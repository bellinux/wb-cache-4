5|$|The {{closely related}} simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) {{has evolved into}} many strains, classified by the natural host species.

These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS,</b> and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.|$|E
50|$|Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania {{and a team}} of {{researchers}} in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. Bonobos appear to avoid simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its effects, though it is not known why.|$|E
50|$|Immunodeficiency {{resembling}} human AIDS {{was reported}} in captive monkeys in the United States beginning in 1983. SIV was isolated in 1985 from some of these animals, captive rhesus macaques suffering from <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> (SAIDS). The discovery of SIV was made shortly after HIV-1 had been isolated {{as the cause of}} AIDS and led to the discovery of HIV-2 strains in West Africa. HIV-2 was more similar to the then-known SIV strains than to HIV-1, suggesting {{for the first time the}} simian origin of HIV. Further studies indicated that HIV-2 is derived from the SIVsmm strain found in sooty mangabeys, whereas HIV-1, the predominant virus found in humans, is derived from SIV strains infecting chimpanzees (SIVcpz).|$|E
50|$|Unlike HIV-1 and HIV-2 {{infections in}} humans, SIV infections {{in their natural}} African simian {{non-human}} hosts appear in many cases to be non-pathogenic due to evolutionary adaptation of the hosts to the virus. Extensive studies in sooty mangabeys have established that SIVsmm infection does not cause any disease in these African primates, despite high levels of circulating virus. However, if the virus infects an Asian or Indian rhesus macaque, these non-African simian primates will also develop <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> (SAIDS), as they, like humans (which although are also an African-origin simian primate species), {{have not had a}} prolonged history with the virus. A recent study of SIVcpz in wild living chimpanzees suggests that infected chimpanzees experience an AIDS-like illness similar to HIV-1 infected humans. The later stages of SIV infection turn into SAIDS, much as HIV infection turns into AIDS.|$|E
40|$|Aspartate 368 {{on human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) gp 120 forms multiple contacts with CD 4; in mutagenesis studies, its replacement by asparagine and corresponding changes in simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac (D 385 N) reduced binding with CD 4. Nevertheless, simian immunodeficiency virus envelopes with D 385 N were prevalent in several studies. Extending these observations, we also found D 385 N to be dominant among env clones from two rhesus macaques that progressed rapidly to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> These envelopes showed a CD 4 -independent phenotype as well as reduced affinity to CD 4. Moreover, an adjacent change, G 383 R, which was frequently coselected with D 385 N, further decreased binding. An optical biosensor study demonstrated that the SIVmac 239 gp 120 bound to CD 4 with kinetics {{similar to those of}} HIV- 1. However, the gp 120 s with D 385 N and G 383 R showed a 40 -fold reduction in affinity, with a drastic increase in dissociation rate, indicating an inherently unstable complex. This finding showed that rapid progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> may be accompanied by the selection of CD 4 -independent gp 120 variants with impaired CD 4 binding ability...|$|E
40|$|Rhesus macaques {{infected}} with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing either a large nef deletion (SIVmac 239 Δ 152 nef) or interleukin- 2 {{in place of}} nef developed high virus loads and progressed to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Viruses recovered from both juvenile and neonatal macaques with disease produced a novel truncated Nef protein, tNef. Viruses recovered from juvenile macaques {{infected with}} serially passaged virus expressing tNef exhibited a pathogenic phenotype. These findings demonstrated strong selective pressure to restore expression of a truncated Nef protein, and this reversion was linked to increased pathogenic potential in live attenuated SIV vaccines...|$|E
40|$|SIV {{infection}} of natural host {{species such as}} sooty mangabeys results in high viral replication without clinical signs of <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Studying such infections is useful for identifying immunologic parameters that lead to AIDS in HIV-infected patients. Here we have demonstrated that acute, SIV-induced CD 4 + T cell depletion in sooty mangabeys does not result in immune dysfunction and progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> and that a population of CD 3 +CD 4 –CD 8 – T cells (double-negative T cells) partially compensates for CD 4 + T cell function in these animals. Passaging plasma from an SIV-infected sooty mangabey with very few CD 4 + T cells to SIV-negative animals resulted in rapid loss of CD 4 + T cells. Nonetheless, all sooty mangabeys generated SIV-specific antibody and T cell responses and maintained normal levels of plasma lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, all CD 4 -low sooty mangabeys elicited a de novo immune response following influenza vaccination. Such preserved immune responses {{as well as the}} low levels of immune activation observed in these animals were associated with the presence of double-negative T cells capable of producing Th 1, Th 2, and Th 17 cytokines. These studies indicate that SIV-infected sooty mangabeys do not appear to rely entirely on CD 4 + T cells to maintain immunity and identify double-negative T cells as a potential subset of cells capable of performing CD 4 + T cell–like helper functions upon SIV-induced CD 4 + T cell depletion in this species...|$|E
40|$|Mucosal {{transmission}} is the predominant mode of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection worldwide, and the mucosal innate interferon response represents {{an important component of}} the earliest host response to the infection. Our goal here was to assess the changes in mRNA expression of innate mucosal genes after oral simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inoculation of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were followed throughout their course of disease progression. The SIV plasma viral load was highest in the macaque that progressed rapidly to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> (99 days) and lowest in the macaque that progressed more slowly (> 700 days). The mRNA levels of six innate/effector genes in the oral mucosa indicated that slower disease progression was associated with increased expression of these genes. This distinction was most evident when comparing the slowest-progressing macaque to the intermediate and rapid progressors. Expression levels of alpha and gamma interferons, the antiviral interferon-stimulated gene product 2 ′- 5 ′ oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and the chemokines CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 in the slow progressor were elevated at each of the three oral mucosal biopsy time points examined (day 2 to 4, 14 to 21, and day 70 postinfection). In contrast, the more rapidly progressing macaques demonstrated elevated levels of these cytokine/chemokine mRNA at lymph nodes, coincident with decreased levels at the mucosal sites, and a decreased ability to elicit an effective anti-SIV antibody response. These data provide evidence that a robust mucosal innate/effector immune response is beneficial following lentiviral exposure; however, it is likely that the anatomical location and timing of the response need to be coordinated to permit an effective immune response able to delay progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cytokines and chemokines are {{critical}} for establishing tissue-specific immune responses and play key roles in modulating disease progression in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected macaques and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected humans. The goal here was to characterize the innate immune response at different tissue sites and to correlate these responses to clinical outcome, initially focusing on rhesus macaques orally inoculated with SIV and monitored until onset of <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Cytokine and chemokine mRNA transcripts were assessed at lymph nodes (LN) and peripheral blood cells utilizing quantitative real-time PCR at different time points postinfection. The mRNA expression of four immune modulators—alpha interferon (IFN-α), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), CXCL 9, and CXCL 10 —was positively associated with disease progression within LN tissue. Elevated cytokine/chemokine expression in LN {{did not result in}} any observed beneficial outcome since the numbers of CXCR 3 + cells were not increased, nor were the SIV RNA levels decreased. In peripheral blood, increased OAS and CXCL 10 expression were elevated in SIV+ monkeys that progress the fastest to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Our results indicate that higher IFN-α, OAS, CXCL 9, and CXCL 10 mRNA expression in LN was associated with rapid disease progression and a LN environment that may favor SIV replication. Furthermore, higher expression of CXCL 10 and OAS in peripheral blood could potentially serve as a diagnostic marker for hosts that are likely to progress to AIDS. Understanding the expression patterns of key innate immune modulators will be useful in assessing the disease state and potential rates of disease progression in HIV+ patients, which could lead to novel therapy and vaccine approaches...|$|E
40|$|A {{spontaneous}} multifocal subcutaneous fibromatosis {{is described}} in 6 pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) with simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome (<b>simian</b> <b>AIDS).</b> The lesions consisted of a proliferation of vascular fibrous tissue that was infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells. One animal also had retroperitoneal fibromatosis, which has also been found in this colony of pig-tailed macaques. Progressive weight loss, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and neutropenia were seen. Peripheral lymph nodes were hyperplastic, and there was splenomegaly. Aggregates of lymphocytes {{were present in the}} bone marrow, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Type D retrovirus particles were found in three nodules by electron microscopy; intracytoplasmic type A and budding particles were identified in fibroblasts. In a setting of acquired immunodeficiency, these subcutaneous tumors in pig-tailed macaques present a striking analogy to Kaposi's sarcoma in human AIDS...|$|E
40|$|We have {{monitored}} {{changes in}} the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (env) gene in two macaques which developed AIDS after inoculation with a molecular clone of SIV. As the animals progressed to AIDS, selection occurred for viruses with variation in two discrete regions (V 1 and V 4) but not for viruses with {{changes in the}} region of SIV env that corresponds to the immunodominant, V 3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus. Within the highly variable domains, the vast majority of nucleotide changes encoded an amino acid change (98 %), suggesting that these envelope variants had evolved as a result of phenotypic selection. Analysis of the biological properties of these variants, which have been selected for in the host, may be useful in defining the mechanisms underlying viral persistence and progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} how viral variants {{may affect}} disease progression in human pediatric AIDS, we studied {{the potential of}} three simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates to induce <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> in newborn rhesus macaques. The three virus isolates were previously shown to range from pathogenic (SIVmac 251 and SIVmac 239) to nonpathogenic (SIVmac 1 A 11) when inoculated intravenously into juvenile and adult rhesus macaques. Six newborn macaques inoculated with pathogenic, uncloned SIVmac 251 developed persistent, high levels of cell-associated and cell-free viremia, had no detectable antiviral antibodies, and had poor weight gain; these animals all exhibited severe clinical disease and pathologic lesions diagnostic for <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> and were euthanatized 10 to 26 weeks after inoculation. Two newborns inoculated with pathogenic, molecularly cloned SIVmac 239 developed persistent high virus load in peripheral blood, but both animals had normal weight gain and developed antiviral antibodies. One of the SIVmac 239 -infected neonates exhibited pathologic lesions diagnostic for SAIDS and was euthanatized at 34 weeks after inoculation; the other SIVmac 239 -infected neonate remained alive and exhibited no significant clinical disease for more than 1 year after inoculation. In contrast, three newborn rhesus macaques inoculated with the nonpathogenic molecular clone, SIVmac 1 A 11, had transient, low-level viremia, seroconverted by 10 weeks after inoculation, had normal weight gain, and remained healthy for over 1 year. These results indicate that (i) newborn rhesus macaques infected with an uncloned, virulent SIVmac isolate have a more rapid, fulminant disease course than do adults inoculated with the same virus, (ii) the most rapid disease progression is associated with lack of a detectable humoral immune response in SIV-infected infant macaques, (iii) a molecularly cloned, attenuated SIV isolate is nonpathogenic in neonatal macaques, and (iv) SIV-infected neonatal macaques exhibit patterns of infection, virus load, and disease progression similar to those observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. This SIV/neonatal rhesus model of pediatric AIDS provides a rapid, sensitive model with which to compare the virulence of SIV isolates and to study the mechanisms underlying the differences in disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus-infected infants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{varicella-zoster virus}} (VZV) Oka vaccine offers {{potential}} as a recombinant vaccine against other pathogens. In this study, recombinant simian varicella viruses (rSVV) expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (env, gp 130) and gag antigens were constructed. Expression of the SIV env and gag transcripts and antigens in rSVV-infected Vero cells was confirmed. The rSVV-SIVenv and rSVV-SIVgag viruses replicated as efficiently as wild-type SVV in cell culture. The immunogenicity of rSVV-SIVenv and rSVV-SIVgag was investigated in immunized vervet monkeys. Humoral immune responses to the SIV gp 130 and gag antigens were detected as early as 4  weeks after the initial immunization with higher antibody titers following a booster immunization. Cellular immune responses against the SIV gp 130 antigen were detected by ELISPOT assay. The rSVV established latent infection in neural ganglia. A subsequent study will evaluate the ability of rSVV vaccines expressing SIV antigens to protect nonhuman primates against <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractRetroperitoneal fibromatosis {{herpesvirus}} (RFHV), the macaque homolog of {{the human}} rhadinovirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), was first identified in retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF) tumor lesions of macaques with <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> We cloned and sequenced the ORF 73 latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of RFHVMn from the pig-tailed macaque. RFHVMn LANA is structurally analogous to KSHV ORF 73 LANA and contains an N-terminal serine–proline-rich region, a large internal glutamic acidic-rich repeat region and a conserved C-terminal domain. RFHVMn LANA reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific for a glutamic acid–proline dipeptide motif and a glutamic acid–glutamine-rich motif in the KSHV LANA repeat region. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that RFHVMn LANA is a nuclear antigen which is highly expressed in RF spindloid tumor cells. These data suggest that RFHV LANA is an ortholog of KSHV LANA and will function similarly to maintain viral latency and {{play a role in}} tumorigenicity in macaques...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are a {{heterogenous}} {{population of}} antigen presenting cells important in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The two major subsets of DC, CD 11 c+ myeloid DC (mDC) and CD 123 + plasmacytoid DC (pDC), are depleted {{in the blood}} of human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 infected individuals. It has been proposed that DC loss may be due to lymph node recruitment, direct viral infection, bone marrow suppression or death, although this has not been directly addressed. Using the highly relevant, rhesus macaque/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV infection, we investigated DC dynamics during acute pathogenic SIV infection and <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> We hypothesized that SIV infection causes a dysregulation of DC trafficking and death not solely dependent upon direct viral infection. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) determine the phenotypic heterogeneity of DC in blood from healthy macaques and develop a rapid assay for frequent longitudinal quantitation of absolute DC numbers; 2) determine whether mDC and pDC are recruited to lymphoid tissues in simian AIDS; 3) determine the dynamics and possible mechanisms of pDC loss and redistribution to lymphoid tissue during acute SIV infection. We found that rhesus macaque DC were more phenotypically homogeneous than their human counterparts and could be accurately quantified in small volumes of blood. In monkeys with <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS,</b> DC were depleted in both blood and secondary lymphoid tissues associated with increased spontaneous apoptosis. However, the remaining DC were phenotypically normal. During acute SIV infection, pDC responded to infection in a biphasic manner, with rapid mobilization into blood followed by depletion in both blood and lymphoid tissue. However, pDC production from bone marrow was normal and BrdU-labeling indicated increased pDC mobilization and recruitment to lymphoid tissues despite net loss of pDC. In lymph nodes, pDC were directly infected with virus, activated, and undergoing increased levels of apoptosis but retained functional TLR 7 signaling. The findings in this study are significant to public health because defining the mechanisms leading to DC loss will offer new opportunities for therapeutic interventions to augment immune responses in HIV-infected individuals...|$|E
40|$|Nine rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were inoculated with a {{combination}} of two passaged strains of SIV mac (R 71 and 17 E), both of which are known to be neurovirulent. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded at regular intervals from these animals both before and after inoculation. Increases in ABR peak and interpeak latency were observed corresponding to progression of SIV disease. Post-inoculation increases in latency were observed for all ®ve peaks of the ABR and for interpeak intervals I ± V and III ± V. The largest increases in latency were associated with end-stage disease. Within 14 weeks of inoculation, all but two animals developed end-stage <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> and were euthanized. Histopathological examination revealed multifocal lesions in the cerebral gray and white matter {{as well as in the}} auditory structures of the brainstem. In most animals, ABR changes were accompanied by evidence of underlying neuropathology. However, cases of severe neuropathology with no ABR abnormalities and vice versa were also noted. Though in a much shorter time frame, SIVmac R 71 / 17 E produced both physiological and histopathological abnormalities similar to those associated with HIV disease in humans. These results further support the SIV mac R 71 / 17 E infected rhesus macaque as an animal model of HIV related neurological disease in humans...|$|E
40|$|Similar to HIV {{infection}} in humans, SIV {{infection in}} macaques induces progressive loss of immune cell components and function, resulting in immune deficiency {{in nearly all}} untreated infected subjects. In SIV-infected macaques, 25 % of animals develop terminal AIDS within 6 months of infection. The factors responsible {{for the development of}} such rapid progression are unknown. We have previously found that defects in CD 8 + T cells detectable from early infection correlate to rapid progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> The transcriptional screening of molecular fingerprints on different steps along the activation/effector process of splenic CD 8 + cells at termination revealed a distinction in rapid compared to regular progressors, which was characterized by a decrease in classic T cell receptor (TCR) components, and an increase in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and apoptotic pathways. A TLR pathway screening in lymphoid and myeloid cells from both the spleen and from the central nervous system of infected macaques revealed that the upregulation of TLR is not in the innate immune compartment, but rather in lymphoid cells that contain adaptive immune cells. Our findings suggest that opposing effects of TCR specific signaling and TLR engagement may drive the CD 8 phenotypic failure that determines a rapid disease course in HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Newborn rhesus macaques were {{infected}} with two chimeric simian-{{human immunodeficiency virus}} (SHIV) strains which contain unique human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) env genes and exhibit distinct phenotypes. Infection with either the CCR 5 -specific SHIVSF 162 P 3 or the CXCR 4 -utilizing SHIVSF 33 A resulted in clinical manifestations consistent with <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Most prominent {{in this study was}} the detection of severe thymic involution in all SHIVSF 33 A-infected infants, which is very similar to HIV- 1 -induced thymic dysfunction in children who exhibit a rapid pattern of disease progression. In contrast, SHIVSF 162 P 3 induced only a minor disruption in thymic morphology. Consistent with the distribution of the coreceptors CXCR 4 and CCR 5 within the thymus, the expression of SHIVSF 162 P 3 was restricted to the thymic medulla, whereas SHIVSF 33 A was preferentially detected in the cortex. This dichotomy of tissue tropism is similar to the differential tropism of HIV- 1 isolates observed in the reconstituted human thymus in SCID-hu mice. Accordingly, our results show that the SHIV-monkey model can be used for the molecular dissection of cell and tissue tropisms controlled by the HIV- 1 env gene and for the analysis of mechanisms of viral immunopathogenesis in AIDS. Furthermore, these findings could help explain the rapid progression of disease observed in some HIV- 1 -infected children...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} is {{a hallmark of}} the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome, but the role of distinct HIV variants in the development of AIDS is unclear. Envelope (env) is the most highly variable gene in HIV as well as in other retroviruses. We have previously demonstrated that variation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) env is primarily localized in two regions (V 1 and V 4) during progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> To determine whether there is a common genotype that evolves as AIDS develops, a total of 160 SIV env genes isolated directly from the tissue DNAs of four macaques infected with cloned virus were compared. Common amino acid sequence changes were identified within V 1, V 4, and, in the late stages of disease, near V 3. At several positions, the same amino acid change was seen frequently in the variant genomes from all four animals. As AIDS developed, the majority of viruses evolved an extended sequence in V 1 that was rich in serine and threonine residues and shared similarity with proteins modified by O-linked glycosylation. Several of the predominant common sequence changes in V 1 and V 4 created new sites for N-linked glycosylation. Thus, common features of the SIV variants that evolve during progression to AIDS are motifs that potentially allow for structural and functional changes in the env protein as a result of carbohydrate addition...|$|E
40|$|The simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) -rhesus macaque model of heterosexual human {{immunodeficiency virus}} transmission consists of atraumatic application of cell-free SIVmac onto the intact vaginal mucosa of mature female rhesus macaques. This procedure results in systemic infection, and eventually infected animals develop the clinical signs and pathologic changes of <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> To achieve 100 % transmission with the virus stocks used to date, multiple intravaginal inoculations are required. The current titration study utilized two stocks of SIVmac and demonstrated that a single intravaginal dose of cell-free SIV can reliably produce infection in rhesus macaques. This study also demonstrated that some animals intravaginally inoculated with cell-free SIVmac develop transient viremia characterized by a limited ability to isolate virus from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and lymph node mononuclear cells and no seroconversion to SIV antigen. SIV could be isolated from the peripheral lymph nodes of transiently viremic animals only during periods of viremia and not at times when SIV was not detected in circulating mononuclear cells. Thus, peripheral lymphoid tissues were not reservoirs of infection in the transiently viremic animals. Taken together, these results suggest either that the SIV infection was cleared in the transiently viremic animals or that SIV infection is limited to a compartment of the genital mucosal immune system that cannot be assessed by monitoring SIV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peripheral lymphoid tissue...|$|E

Despite significant upregulation of homeostatic chemokine CCL 19 /macrophage inflammatory protein 3 β and proinflammatory chemokine CXCL 9 /monokine induced by gamma interferon in secondary lymphoid tissue in SIV infection, {{no differences in}} CFSE+ T-lymphocyte frequencies or cell compartmentalization in lymph nodes were identified between animal groups. By contrast, a higher frequency of CFSE+ T lymphocytes in the small intestine was detected in acute SIV infection. This result correlated with increased numbers of gut CD 4 T lymphocytes expressing chemokine receptors CCR 9, CCR 7, and CXCR 3 {{and high levels of}} their respective chemokine ligands in the small intestine. The changes in trafficking parameters in SIV-infected macaques occurred concomitantly with acute gut CD 4 T-lymphocyte depletion. Here, we present the first in vivo T-lymphocyte trafficking study in SIV infection and a novel approach to delineate T-lymphocyte recruitment into tissues in the nonhuman primate animal model for AIDS. Such studies are likely to provide unique insights into T-lymphocyte sequestration in distinct tissue compartments and possible mechanisms of CD 4 T-lymphocyte depletion and immune dysfunction in <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sooty mangabeys, {{the natural}} host of simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIVsm), generally avoid progressive depletion of CD 4 + T cells and opportunistic infections associated with infection of humans (HIV) and macaques (SIVmac). The {{means by which}} the SIVsm-infected mangabeys maintain CD 4 + T-cell levels despite high rates of viral replication is unknown. One cytokine that has {{a key role in the}} regulation of T-cell levels is interleukin- 7 (IL- 7). Here, the longitudinal assessment of 6 SIVsm-infected mangabeys identified an early increase in plasma IL- 7 levels at weeks 1 to 5 after infection. This IL- 7 increase correlated with an early decline in CD 4 + T-cell levels (decline of 492 - 1171 cells/μL) accompanying acute viremia. Elevated IL- 7 levels were followed by increased T-cell proliferation (Ki 67) and maintenance of lower but stable (more than 500 cells/μL) CD 4 + T-cell levels in each mangabey through 37 weeks of infection. These data contrast with our earlier studies in SIVmac-infected macaques, in which the IL- 7 increase was delayed until 20 to 40 weeks after infection, just before the onset of <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Taken together, these data suggest that timely triggering of IL- 7 is important for stabilizing healthy T-cell levels in mangabeys and that timely administration of exogenous IL- 7 may show benefit during pathogenic SIVmac and HIV infection...|$|E

The evolution of the gp 120 and nef genes, which encode two key proteins required for the establishment andmain-tenance of infection, was assessed in macaques that were intravenously inoculated with the same viral swarm and allowed to naturally progress to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> and potential SIV-associated encephalitis (SIVE). Longitudinal plasma samples and immune markers were monitored until terminal illness. Single-genome sequencing was employed to amplify full-length env through nef transcripts from plasma over time and from brain tissues at necropsy. nef sequences diverged from the founder virus faster than gp 120 diverged. Host-specific sequence populations were detected in nef (92 days) before they were detected in gp 120 (182 days). At necropsy, similar brain nef sequences were found in different macaques, indicating convergent evolution, while gp 120 brain sequences remained largely host specific.

The most highly attenuated SIVmac mutants fail to induce disease but also fail to induce immune responses capable of protecting macaques from challenge with pathogenic virus. We recently described a novel attenuated virus, SIVmac-M 4, containing multiple mutations in the transmembrane protein (TM) intracytoplasmic domain. This domain has been implicated in viral assembly, infectivity, and cytopathogenicity. Whereas parental SIVmac 239 -Nef+ induced persistent viremia and <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> in rhesus macaques, SIVmac-M 4 induced transient viremia in juvenile and neonatal macaques, with no disease for at least 1 year postinfection. In this vaccine study, 8 macaques that were infected as juveniles (n = 4) or neonates (n = 4) with SIVmac-M 4 were challenged with pathogenic SIVmac 251 administered through oral mucosa. At 1 year postchallenge, six of the eight macaques had low to undetectable plasma viremia levels. Assays of cell-mediated immune responses to SIVmac Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef revealed that all animals developed strong CD 8 + T-cell responses to Gag after challenge but not before. Unvaccinated control animals challenged with SIVmac 251 developed persistent viremia, had significantly weaker SIV-specific T-cell responses, and developed AIDS-related symptoms.

In the present study, we analyzed a SIVmac 239 envelope (Env) mutant (239 DL) containing two mutations in the V 3 loop which reduced viral entry via CCR 5 by 10 - to 20 -fold, disrupted utilization of common alternative SIV coreceptors and changed the way Env engaged CCR 5. To evaluate its replicative capacity and pathogenic potential in vivo we infected six rhesus macaques with 239 DL. We found that 239 DL replication was only slightly attenuated early during infection. Thereafter, a D 324 V change, which restored efficient CCR 5 usage and coincided with 239 wt-like levels of viral replication, emerged in two animals. In contrast, the viral geno- and phenotype remained stable in the other four rhesus macaques. Although these animals had about 100 -fold reduced viral RNA loads relative to 239 wt-infected macaques, they showed pronounced CD 4 T-cell depletion in the intestinal lamina propria, and one developed opportunistic infections and died with <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Thus, changes in the V 3 loop that diminished CCR 5 usage and altered Env interactions with CCR 5 reduced the pathogenic potential of SIVmac in rhesus macaques but did not abolish it entirely...|$|E
40|$|Endemic simian {{retrovirus}} (SRV) infection {{can cause}} fatal <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> in Macaca fascicularis, but many individuals survive with few clinical signs. To further clarify {{the parameters of}} SRV pathogenesis, we investigated the persistence of viral DNA forms in relation to active viremia, antibody response, and transmissibility of infection. In M. fascicularis from endemically SRV- 2 -infected colonies, viral DNA was present in both linear and unintegrated long terminal repeat circular forms in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of all viremic and many nonviremic animals. Long-term followup of three individuals with distinct infection patterns demonstrated persistence of linear and circular forms of viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissues, irrespective of viremia or antibody status, but reactivation of latent infections was not observed. The role of viral DNA in transmission and early pathogenesis of SRV- 2 was investigated by inoculation of SRV- 2 DNA-positive blood into groups of naïve M. fascicularis from either a viremic or nonviremic donor and subsequent analysis of the virological and serological status of the recipients. Transmission of SRV and development of anti-SRV antibodies were only observed in recipients of blood from the viremic donor; transfer of SRV provirus and unintegrated circular DNA in blood from the nonviremic donor did not lead to infection of the recipients. These results indicate that a proportion of M. fascicularis are able to effectively control the replication and infectivity of SRV despite long-term persistence of viral DNA forms in infected lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of immune {{responses}} to infection by a pathogenic or a nonpathogenic immunodeficiency virus in macaques may provide insights into pathogenetic events leading to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> This work {{is aimed at}} exploring cytokine expression during infection by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We used semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR to monitor interleukin (IL) - 2 /interferon (IFN) -gamma (Th 1 -like), and IL- 4 /IL- 10 (Th 2 -like) expression in unmanipulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs), during the acute phase of infection of eight cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with a pathogenic primary isolate of SIVmac 251 (full-length nef), and of four other cynomolgus macaques by an attenuated molecular clone of SIVmac 251 (nef-truncated). All the monkeys became infected, as clearly shown by the presence of infected PBMCs and by seroconversion. Nevertheless, PBMC-associated virus loads and p 27 antigenemia in monkeys infected by the attenuated virus clone remained lower than those observed in animals infected with the pathogenic SIVmac 251 isolate. A rise of IL- 10 mRNA expression occurred in both groups of monkeys coincident with the peak of viral replication. In monkeys infected with the pathogenic SIVmac 251, IL- 2, IL- 4, and IFN-gamma mRNAs were either weakly detectable or undetectable. On the contrary, animals infected by the attenuated virus exhibited an overexpression of these cytokine mRNAs during the first weeks after inoculation. The lack of expression of these cytokines in monkeys infected with the pathogenic primary isolate may reflect early immunodeficiency...|$|E

Similar to HIV infection in humans, SIV infection in macaques induces progressive loss of immune cell components and function, resulting in immune de�ciency in nearly all untreated infected sub�ects. In SIV-infectedmacaques, 25 % of animals develop terminal AIDS within 6 months of infection. e factors responsible {{for the development of}} such rapid progression are unknown. We have previously found that defects in CD 8 + T cells detectable from early infection correlate to rapid progression to <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> e transcriptional screening of molecular �ngerprints on di�erent steps along the activation/e�ector process of splenic CD 8 + cells at termination revealed a distinction in rapid compared to regular progressors, which was characterized by a decrease in classic T cell receptor (TCR) components, and an increase in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and apoptotic pathways. A TLR pathway screening in lymphoid and myeloid cells from both the spleen and from the central nervous system of infected macaques revealed that the upregulation of TLR is not in the innate immune compartment, but rather in lymphoid cells that contain adaptive immune cells. �ur �ndings suggest that opposing e�ects of TCR speci�c signaling and TLR engagement may drive the CD 8 phenotypic failur...|$|E
40|$|<b>Simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> (SAIDS) is an {{endemic disease}} of macaques that shares many {{characteristics}} with AIDS in humans. SAIDS is etiologically linked to infection by a type D retrovirus, SAIDS retrovirus (SRV). Immunization with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine {{was shown to}} protect macaques against infection by SRV serotype 1. To identify the antigen(s) responsible for eliciting protective immunity, we have constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus (v-senv 5) that expresses the envelope glycoproteins of SRV serotype 2 (SRV- 2 /W). Pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) immunized with v-senv 5 showed lymphoproliferative responses to purified SRV- 2 /W. They also generated antibodies that neutralized SRV- 2 /W infectivity in vitro and mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SRV- 2 -infected cells. Four v-senv 5 -immunized animals, together with four control animals, were challenged intravenously with 5 x 10 (3) tissue culture infectious doses of SRV- 2 /W. As early as 2 weeks after challenge, three of four control animals became viremic, and two of these three animals also seroconverted. The animal that was viremic but remained antibody negative died of symptoms of SRV infection 6 1 / 2 weeks after challenge. In contrast, all four v-senv 5 -immunized animals remained healthy, virus-free, and seropositive against only the immunizing envelope antigens. These results indicate that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the envelope antigens of SRV- 2 /W protects primates from infection by a retrovirus that causes immunodeficiency diseases...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{infection}} with simian retrovirus (SRV) {{has long been}} recognized in rhesus macaques (RMs) and may result in an AIDS-like disease. Importantly, SRV infections persist as a problem in recently imported macaques. Therefore, {{there is a clear}} need to control SRV spread in macaque colonies. We developed a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -SRV vaccine consisting of replication-competent hybrid VSVs that express SRV gag and env in separate vectors. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the VSV-SRV serotype 2 vaccine prime-boost approach in RMs. The VSV-SRV vector (expressing either SRV gag or env) vaccines were intranasally administered in 4 RMs, followed by a boost 1 month after the first vaccination. Four RMs served as controls and received the VSV vector alone. Two months after the boost, all animals were intravenously challenged with SRV- 2 and monitored for 90 days. After the SRV- 2 challenge, all four controls became infected, and viral loads (VLs) ranged from 106 to 108 SRV RNA copies/ml of plasma. Two animals in the control group developed <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> within 7 to 8 weeks postinfection and were euthanized. Anemia and weight loss were observed in the remaining controls. During acute infection, severe B-cell depletion and no significant changes in T-cell population were observed in the control group. Control RMs with greater preservation of B cells and lower VLs survived longer. SRV- 2 was undetectable in vaccinated animals, which remained healthy, with no clinical or biological signs of infection and preservatio...|$|E

After SIV infection, CTL activity against the Nef 169 – 178 epitope was no longer detectable, as assessed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by autologous SIV. CTL activity against the 211 – 225 epitope was lost after 3 months, and an additional CTL response to the amino acids 112 – 119 Nef epitope emerged. Analysis of the Nef proviral sequence revealed the presence of immune escape variants first in the 211 – 225 epitope and much later in the 112 – 119 epitope. In contrast, epitope 169 – 178 showed only two mutations among all viral sequencing performed. We conclude that in this macaque, bispecific CTL exerted a strong selective pressure and escape virus mutants finally emerged. We identified CTL recognizing a conserved Nef epitope 112 – 119 (SYKLAIDM), essential for viral replication, which could be associated with a prolonged AIDS-free period. These results stress the importance of the induction of broader multispecific CTLs directed against highly conserved and functional T-cell epitopes by vaccination, with the aim of keeping HIV infection in check...|$|E
40|$|Depo-Provera® (medroxyprogesterone acetate), a long-acting {{derivative}} of progesterone, is utilized during many nonhuman primate microbicide studies to facilitate simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection by thinning the vaginal epithelium. To date, the systemic {{effects of this}} steroid hormone in regard to SIV/HIV pathogenesis are not well understood, but an increase in infection rates and lymphoproliferation following progesterone application has been reported. Therefore, a proactive study using 20 Chinese rhesus macaques was designed to investigate {{the effect of a}} single Depo-Provera injection on SIV disease progression. Group 1 (n[*]=[*] 10) was treated with 30 [*]mg Depo-Provera intramuscularly 30 days prior to intravenous challenge with 50 TCID 50 SIVmac 251, while Group 2 (n[*]=[*] 10) remained untreated, but received the same amount of SIV. Blood samples were taken at predetermined intervals to measure RNA viral loads, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 20 + lymphocyte counts and percentages and absolute numbers of naive and memory T lymphocytes. Upon statistical endpoint data analysis, none of the parameters measured were shown to be significantly different between the groups. One animal in the Depo-Provera-treated group and two macaques in the control group were euthanized prior to study end due to the development of clinical signs (in weeks 43 and 51, respectively). All other animals were euthanized between weeks 68 and 71 post-SIV infection. Histopathological evaluations revealed that 5 of 10 animals in each group had developed <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> (SAIDS). In summary, this prospective study demonstrated that a single injection of 30 [*]mg Depo-Provera did not have a significant influence on SIV disease progression...|$|E
40|$|The reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) assay is a simple, relatively inexpensive, widely used assay that can detect all retroviruses (known and novel retroviruses {{as well as}} infectious and defective retroviruses) {{on the basis of}} the divalent cation requirement of their RT enzyme, i. e., Mg 2 + or Mn 2 +. Descriptions of various RT assays have been published; however, they cannot be directly applied to the analysis of biological products or clinical samples without further standardization to determine the lower limit of virus detection (sensitivity), assay variability (reproducibility), or ability to detect different retroviruses (specificity). We describe the detection of type E and type D primate retroviruses, which may be pathogenic for humans, by a new 32 P-based, Mg 2 +-containing RT assay. The results show that the sensitivity of detection is < 3. 2 50 % tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 s) for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and < 1 TCID 50 for simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from a rhesus macaque (SIVmac). Analysis of recombinant HIV- 1 RT enzyme indicated that 10 − 5 U, which is equivalent to 4. 25 × 104 virions, could be detected. Additionally, genetically distinct type D retroviruses such as <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> retrovirus and squirrel monkey retrovirus were also detected in the assay with similar sensitivities. Thus, the improved RT assay can be used to detect genetically divergent Mg 2 +-dependent retroviruses of human and simian origin that can infect human cells and that therefore pose a potential health risk to humans...|$|E

40|$|The {{human and}} simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1 and SIVmac) transmembrane proteins contain unusually long intracytoplasmic domains (ICD-TM). These domains are suggested {{to play a}} role in envelope fusogenicity, interaction with the viral matrix protein during assembly, viral infectivity, binding of intracellular calmodulin, disruption of membranes, and induction of apoptosis. Here we describe a novel mutant virus, SIVmac-M 4, containing multiple mutations in the coding region for the ICD-TM of pathogenic molecular clone SIVmac 239. Parental SIVmac 239 -Nef+ produces high-level persistent viremia and <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS</b> in both juvenile and newborn rhesus macaques. The ICD-TM region of SIVmac-M 4 contains three stop codons, a + 1 frameshift, and mutation of three highly conserved, charged residues in the conserved C-terminal alpha-helix referred to as lentivirus lytic peptide 1 (LLP- 1). Overlapping reading frames for tat, rev, and nef are not affected by these changes. In this study, four juvenile macaques received SIVmac-M 4 by intravenous injection. Plasma viremia, as measured by branched-DNA (bDNA) assay, reached a peak at 2 weeks postinoculation but dropped to below detectable levels by 12 weeks. At over 1. 5 years postinoculation, all four juvenile macaques remain healthy and asymptomatic. In a subsequent experiment, four neonatal rhesus macaques were given SIVmac-M 4 intravenously. These animals exhibited high levels of viremia in the acute phase (2 weeks postinoculation) but are showing a relatively low viral load in the chronic phase of infection, with no clinical signs of disease for 1 year. These findings demonstrated that the intracytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane Env (Env-TM) is a locus for attenuation in rhesus macaques...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} causing AIDS {{and subsequently}} death in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 infection are not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, correlates of accelerated progression to disease based on immunological and virological markers have been identified. The best correlate identified to date is the baseline virus load or the so-called viral set point. By focusing on a virus load measurement from a restricted time range, however, we ignore valuable information contained in the long-term profile of the virus load. Here, we investigate the relationship between virus load and survival {{with the aid of}} a statistical model. The model takes into consideration the virus load at every stage of the disease. In particular, we aim to determine the effect of peaks of virus load on disease progression. We fit our model to unique sequential viral load data of 12 simian immunodeficiency virus mac 251 -infected rhesus macaques which contain frequent measurements throughout the entire course of the infection until the development of <b>simian</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Our model enables us to predict the survival times of the animals more accurately than an equivalent model which considers the viral set point only. Furthermore, we find that peaks of the virus load contribute less to disease progression than phases of low virus load with the same amount of viral turnover. Our analysis implies that the total viral turnover is not the best correlate of survival. As a consequence, the direct cytopathic effects of virus replication may, by themselves, have less of an impact on disease progression than previously thought...|$|E
