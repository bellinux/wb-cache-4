60|$|It was in 1910 {{that the}} parents of young Holsten, who was to be called by a whole {{generation}} of scientific men, 'the greatest of European chemists,' were staying in a villa near Santo Domenico, between Fiesole and Florence. He was then only fifteen, but he was already distinguished as a mathematician and possessed by a savage appetite to understand. He had been particularly attracted by the mystery of phosphorescence and its apparent unrelatedness to every other source of light. He was to tell afterwards in his reminiscences how he watched the fireflies drifting and glowing among the dark trees in the garden of the villa under the warm blue night sky of Italy; how he caught and kept them in cages, dissected them, first studying the general anatomy of insects very elaborately, and how he began to experiment with the effect of various gases and varying temperature upon their light. Then the chance present of a little scientific toy invented by Sir William Crookes, a toy called the <b>spinthariscope,</b> on which radium particles impinge upon sulphide of zinc and make it luminous, induced him to associate the two sets of phenomena. It was a happy association for his inquiries. It was a rare and fortunate thing, too, that any one with the mathematical gift should have been taken by these curiosities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spinthariscopes</b> {{were quickly}} {{replaced}} with more accurate and quantitative devices for measuring radiation in scientific experiments, but enjoyed a modest revival {{in the mid}} 20th century as children's educational toys. In 1947, Kix cereal offered a Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring {{in exchange for a}} box top and 0.15 USD that contained a small one.Spinthariscopes can still be bought today as instructional novelties, but they now use americium or thorium.|$|R

5000|$|The lab {{contained}} a cloud chamber {{that allowed the}} viewer to watch alpha particles traveling at 12,000 mi/s m/s, a <b>spinthariscope</b> that showed the results of radioactive disintegration on a fluorescent screen, and an electroscope that measured the radioactivity of different substances {{that were in the}} set.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, Kix {{offered a}} Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring in {{exchange}} for a box top and 15 cents. The ring contained a <b>spinthariscope,</b> so that when the red base (which served as a [...] "secret message compartment") was taken off, and after a period of time for dark adaptation, you could look through a small plastic lens at scintillations caused by polonium alpha particles striking a zinc sulfide screen.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{premiums}} {{were rather}} anachronistic for a 19th-century hero. In 1947, the program offered the Kix Atomic Bomb Ring, also known to collectors as the Lone Ranger Atom Bomb Ring. This ring was a miniature <b>spinthariscope</b> that {{actually had a}} small amount of polonium-210 in it, which emitted alpha particles to produce scintillations on the zinc sulfide outer part of the ring. With its tailfin piece removed, though, the [...] "bomb" [...] body looked like a silver bullet.|$|E
50|$|A common {{reason that}} radium was added into almost {{everything}} at the time, including water and toys, {{was that people}} saw radium as fun, not harmful. Radium bromide was found to induce phosphorescence at normal temperatures. This led to the US army making and supplying luminous watches to all soldiers. It also allowed for the invention of a <b>spinthariscope,</b> which soon became the item everyone wanted {{in order to show}} that they were {{up to date on the}} new science discoveries at the time.|$|E
50|$|The first device {{which used}} a {{scintillator}} {{was built in}} 1903 by Sir William Crookes and used a ZnS screen. The scintillations produced by the screen were {{visible to the naked}} eye if viewed by a microscope in a darkened room; the device was known as a <b>spinthariscope.</b> The technique led to a number of important discoveries but was obviously tedious. Scintillators gained additional attention in 1944, when Curran and Baker replaced the naked eye measurement with the newly developed PMT. This was the birth of the modern scintillation detector.|$|E
50|$|In the 1890s, the {{business}} {{continued to grow}} and advertised in catalogues their factories for instruments, optical glass and cabinet work located at Fullwood Rents W.C. The warehouse and show room remained at 313 High Holborn. In 1900, W. Watson & Sons purchased the John Browning & Co. In 1903, a section in the journal Knowledge lists an assortment of equipment available from the company: microscopes, astronomical telescopes (educational model for £5 1s), Crookes' <b>spinthariscope</b> (pocket model for £1 1s), and Electro-Therapeutics apparatus that included complete outfits for radiography from £30. The company also offered Finsen-type lamps.|$|E
5000|$|Foley was {{interested}} {{throughout his career}} in radiation and wave phenomena of all sorts. He completed his doctorate just about a year before Marie Skłodowska-Curie, Pierre Curie, and Gustave Bémont announced (November 1898 in Paris) their discovery of radium. Seizing an opportunity to popularize a new scientific phenomenon, as early as 1904 Foley was giving spectacular public demonstrations of radiation from radium. He demonstrated some effects of the radiation by using the <b>spinthariscope,</b> invented by Sir William Crookes in 1903. Foley collaborated with IU Instructor Ryland Ratliff, investigating properties of “one-tenth of a gram of ‘Curie’ radium chloride.” ...|$|E
50|$|The modern {{electronic}} {{scintillation counter}} {{was invented in}} 1944 by Sir Samuel Curran whilst {{he was working on}} the Manhattan Project at the University of California at Berkeley. There was a requirement to measure the radiation from small quantities of uranium and his innovation was to use one of the newly-available highly sensitive photomultiplier tubes made by the Radio Corporation of America to accurately count the flashes of light from a scintillator subjected to radiation.This built upon the work of earlier researchers such as Antoine Henri Becquerel, who discovered radioactivity whilst working on the phosphorescence of uranium salts in 1896. Previously scintillation events had to be laboriously detected by eye using a <b>spinthariscope</b> which was a simple microscope to observe light flashes in the scintillator.|$|E
5000|$|He {{developed}} the Crookes tubes, investigating cathode rays. He published numerous papers on spectroscopy and conducted research {{on a variety}} of minor subjects. In his investigations of the conduction of electricity in low pressure gases, he discovered that as the pressure was lowered, the negative electrode (cathode) appeared to emit rays (the so-called [...] "cathode rays", now known to be a stream of free electrons, and used in cathode ray display devices). As these examples indicate, he was a pioneer in the construction and use of vacuum tubes for the study of physical phenomena. He was, as a consequence, one of the first scientists to investigate what is now called a plasma and identified it as the fourth state of matter in 1879. He also devised one of the first instruments for studying nuclear radioactivity, the <b>spinthariscope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spinthariscope</b> {{was invented}} by William Crookes in 1903. While observing the {{apparently}} uniform fluorescence on a zinc sulfide screen created by the radioactive emissions (mostly alpha radiation) of a sample of radium bromide, he spilled some of the sample, and, owing to its extreme rarity and cost, {{he was eager to}} find and recover it. Upon inspecting the zinc sulfide screen under a microscope, he noticed separate flashes of light created by individual alpha particle collisions with the screen. Crookes took his discovery a step further and invented a device specifically intended to view these scintillations. It consisted of a small screen coated with zinc sulfide affixed {{to the end of a}} tube, with a tiny amount of radium salt suspended a short distance from the screen and a lens on the other end of the tube for viewing the screen. Crookes named his device from Greek σπινθήρ (spinth´ēr) [...] "spark".|$|E
