50|$|On {{the drive}} back, Carter reciprocates {{by trying to}} reunite Edward with his daughter. Believing it as a breach of trust, Edward angrily storms off. Carter returns home to his wife, {{children}} and grandchildren {{where they have a}} nice family dinner telling stories and sharing jokes while a frustrated Edward <b>stays</b> <b>home</b> <b>eating</b> frozen dinners alone. The family reunion is short-lived. While preparing for a romantic interlude, Carter suffers a seizure and is rushed to the hospital, with the cancer having spread to his brain.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived a poor woman who had only one child, {{and he was a}} little boy called Hassebu. When he ceased to be a baby, and his mother thought it was time for him to learn to read, she sent him to school. And, after he had done with school, he was put into a shop to learn how to make clothes, and did not learn; and he was put to do silversmith's work, and did not learn; and {{whatsoever}} he was taught, he did not learn it. His mother never wished him to do anything he did not like, so she said: 'Well, <b>stay</b> at <b>home,</b> my son.' And he <b>stayed</b> at <b>home,</b> <b>eating</b> and sleeping.|$|R
50|$|As {{they reached}} their seventh grade the group progressed {{to the youth}} society, where they stayed {{until the end of}} twelfth grade. By this stage the teacher and nanny {{separated}} from this group, and the adolescents would get a new team of educators. Many kibbutzim would send their children to a regional school away from home. The teenagers would then live in the dormitories and travel to their kibbutz to meet with their parents only about twice a week. The children in these schools would have their own dining halls. Other kibbutzim maintained a local high school and had their children <b>stay</b> at <b>home,</b> <b>eat</b> in the kibbutz dining hall and work with the kibbutz members.|$|R
60|$|Now did the high-minded Peter de Groodt shower down a pannier load of maledictions {{upon his}} burgomaster {{for a set}} of self-willed, obstinate, factious varlets, who would neither be {{convinced}} nor persuaded. Nor did he omit to bestow some left-handed compliments upon the sovereign people, as a heard of poltroons, who had no relish for the glorious hardships and illustrious misadventures of battle, but would rather <b>stay</b> at <b>home,</b> and <b>eat</b> and sleep in ignoble ease, than fight in a ditch for immortality and a broken head.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} her departure from the stage, Graham sank into a deep depression fueled by views from the wings of young dancers performing many of the dances she had choreographed for herself and her former husband. Graham's health declined precipitously as she abused alcohol to numb her pain. In Blood Memory she wrote,It wasn't until years after I had relinquished a ballet that I could bear to watch someone else dance it. I believe in never looking back, never indulging in nostalgia, or reminiscing. Yet how can you avoid it when you look on stage and see a dancer made up to look as you did thirty years ago, dancing a ballet you created with someone you were then deeply in love with, your husband? I think that is a circle of hell Dante omitted.I stopped dancing I had lost my will to live. I <b>stayed</b> <b>home</b> alone, <b>ate</b> very little, and drank too much and brooded. My face was ruined, and people say I looked odd, which I agreed with. Finally my system just gave in. I was in the hospital for a long time, much of it in a coma.|$|R
60|$|I {{think that}} Mrs Dale was wrong. She would have joined that {{party on the}} croquet ground, instead of {{remaining}} among the pea-sticks in her sun-bonnet, had she done as I would have counselled her. Not a word was spoken among the four {{that she did not}} hear. Those pea-sticks were only removed from the lawn by a low wall and a few shrubs. She listened, not as one suspecting, but simply as one loving. The voices of her girls were very dear to her, and the silver ringing tones of Lily's tongue were as sweet to her ears as the music of the gods. She heard all that about Lady Hartletop, and shuddered at Lily's bold sarcasm. And she heard Lily say that mamma would <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and <b>eat</b> the peas, and said to herself sadly that that was now her lot in life.|$|R
60|$|The {{mutual friend}} was saved {{the trouble of}} suppressing Adolphus. Until Elvira had {{finished}} Adolphus never got an opening. He grumbled at their dinners. He! who can dine night after night with his precious Freemasons. Does he think she likes them any better? She, doomed to <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and <b>eat</b> them. What does he take her for? An ostrich? Whose fault is it that they keep an incompetent cook too old to learn and too obstinate to want to? Whose old family servant was she? Not Elvira's. It has been to please Adolphus that she has suffered the woman. And this is her reward. This! She breaks down. Adolphus is astonished and troubled. Personally he never liked the woman. Faithful she may have been, but a cook never. His own idea, had he been consulted, {{would have been a}} small pension. Elvira falls upon his neck. Why did he not say so before? Adolphus presses her to his bosom. If only he had known! They promise the mutual friend never to quarrel again without his assistance.|$|R
25|$|When she {{is found}} in the temple by the priest she is praying silently, but her lips are moving. A priest called Eli {{witnesses}} this odd posture and concludes she is drunk. In her despair she prays to God for a child and if her prayer is granted she will give the son back to God. After Hannah's explanation of her sobriety, Eli blesses her with peace and a guarantee that God of Israel will grant her request. She goes <b>home,</b> <b>eats</b> and drinks with her husband, and is filled with hope. Subsequently, Hannah becomes pregnant; her child is named Samuel. The time comes to offer the yearly sacrifice at the temple but Hannah <b>stays</b> <b>home.</b> She promises to go to the temple when Samuel is weaned and plans to leave him with Eli to be trained as a Nazirite.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. How do {{increasing}} {{levels of}} education affect parentsâ€™ decisions to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> with their children? When children are born parents {{make the decision to}} <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> and raise them or to continue at their jobs in the labor force. Parents need to be informed to make the best choice for their family. The choice to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> with the children or work in the labor market is based on the perceived value a family puts on a parent <b>staying</b> <b>home.</b> Some of the duties of a typical stay-home parent include cooking, cleaning, laundering, childcare, and driving. Using three {{levels of education}} including high school, college, and professional school graduates an income will be established that parents may use {{to determine whether or not}} they should <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Opportunity cost, market equivalents of services, and reservation wage will all be used to determine at what level parents will <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Financially, if a parent makes more than the average salary of someone performing the average household tasks, they should choose to enter the labor force once again. Otherwise it is beneficial to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> and raise the child and forgo the potential market wage...|$|R
40|$|Access to paid {{sick days}} (PSD) differs by {{workplace}} size, race/ethnicity, gender, and {{income in the}} United States. It is not known to what extent decisions to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work when sick with infectious illnesses such as influenza depend on PSD access, and whether access impacts certain demographic groups more than others. We examined demographic and workplace characteristics (including access to PSD) associated with employees' decisions to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work for their own or a child's illness. Linking the 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) consolidated data file to the medical conditions file, we used multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance estimates to identify factors associated with missed work for an employee's own or a child's illness/injury, influenza-like-illness (ILI), and influenza. Controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income, access to PSD {{was associated with a}} higher probability of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> for an employee's own illness/injury, ILI, or influenza, and for a child's illness/injury. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a lower prevalence of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> for the employee's own or a child's illness compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Access to PSD was associated with a significantly greater increase in the probability of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic Whites. Women had a significantly higher probability of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> for their child's illness compared to men, suggesting that women remain the primary caregivers for ill children. Our results indicate that PSD access is important to encourage employees to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work when sick with ILI or influenza. Also, PSD access may be important to enable stay-at-home behavior among Hispanics. We conclude that access to PSD is likely to reduce the spread of disease in workplaces by increasing the rate at which sick employees <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work, and reduce the economic burden of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> on minorities, women, and families...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} the gender roles {{and attitudes toward}} womenâ€Ÿs and menâ€Ÿs social roles of <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers and employed fathers recruited on the Internet. The relationship between gender roles and attitudes toward womenâ€Ÿs and menâ€Ÿs social roles on reasons for becoming a <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> father were also investigated. It was predicted that <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers would endorse more traditionally feminine characteristics for themselves and would have more nontraditional attitudes toward menâ€Ÿs and womenâ€Ÿs social roles than employed fathers. In addition, {{it was predicted that}} fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> for practical reasons (i. e. lost job) would be more traditional in their gender role attitudes than fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> for other reasons (i. e. really wanted to care for the children). Although <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and employed fathers reported having similar feminine and masculine characteristics, <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers reported having less traditional gender role attitudes than employed fathers. Biosocial theory (Eagly & Wood, 1999) suggests that <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers may have less traditional attitudes about gender roles because the gender role they are acting out is a non-traditional role for men. <b>Stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers reported that they really wanted to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> with their children more than any other reason, whereas the least reported reason for choosing to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> was having a child with special needs. Contrary to a prediction based on evolutionary psychology, <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and employed fathers also reported that their children resembled them to the same degree. The results of this study will contribute further information about a group of fathers that have been under-studied and may also provide helpful information to support groups for <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and employed fathers.
