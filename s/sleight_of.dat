5|$|Because of {{its heavy}} use and {{practice}} by magicians, <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand is often confused as {{a branch of}} magic, but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment, as many artists practice <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand without the slightest interest in magic.|$|E
5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection {{and years of}} practice. For these reasons, the term <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand in his stage shows.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand (also {{known as}} prestidigitation or legerdemain) refers to fine motor skills when used by {{performing}} artists in different art forms to entertain or manipulate. It is {{closely associated with}} close-up magic, card magic, card flourishing and stealing.|$|E
5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the Card Table from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), {{emphasized the importance of}} incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sleights</b> <b>of</b> Mind is {{the result}} of Macknik and Martinez-Conde’s yearlong, world-wide {{exploration}} of magic and how its principles apply to human behavior. <b>Sleights</b> <b>of</b> Mind introduces Neuromagic as a new area of scientific endeavor, a discipline aimed to uncover the interaction between brain science and the art of magic. Macknik and Martinez-Conde propose that understanding how the mind perceives magic and illusion will provide a greater understanding of perception and cognition at large.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sleights</b> <b>of</b> Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals about Our Everyday Deceptions is a 2010 popular science book, {{written by}} neuroscientists Stephen Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde, with science writer Sandra Blakeslee. [...] Working {{alongside}} {{some of the}} world’s greatest magicians, Macknik and Martinez-Conde studied how conjuring techniques trick the brain. <b>Sleights</b> <b>of</b> Mind considers the greater implications of magic and misdirection for clinical conditions such as autism, and for everyday life situations, including choice and trust in personal and business relationships.|$|R

When Suzy comes out in a white bride's dress and sings her lines, Doc is unimpressed, and Suzy is humiliated. As both stalk off in opposite directions, the party disintegrates into a brawl.|$|E
5|$|Unlike card tricks done on {{the streets}} or on stage and card cheating, cardistry is solely about impressing without illusions, deceit, {{misdirection}} and other elements commonly used in card tricks and card cheating. Cardistry, or card flourishes, are always intended to be visually impressive and appear extremely difficult to perform. Card flourishing {{is often associated with}} card tricks, but many <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E

5|$|The art of card {{throwing}} generally {{consist of}} throwing standard playing cards with excessively high speed and accuracy, {{powerful enough to}} slice fruits like carrots and even melons. Like flourishing, throwing cards {{are meant to be}} visibly impressive and does not include magic elements. Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand industry with the release of his 1977 book entitled Cards as Weapons, which was met with large sales and critical acclaim. Some magic tricks, both close-up and on stage, are heavily connected to throwing cards.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed {{responses}} from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing.|$|E
