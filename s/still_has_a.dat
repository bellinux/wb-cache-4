5|$|Luring {{is not a}} {{necessary}} condition however, as the predator <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> significant advantage simply by not being identified as such. They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.|$|E
5|$|Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre's steam trains {{run on the}} sidings {{which were}} {{disconnected}} from the network in 1967, the station <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> working railway line passing through it, used for occasional special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre. Regular freight trains are mainly landfill trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former brick pits at Calvert.|$|E

5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each {{team has a}} tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form}} of a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The metal-working and {{printing}} industries which replaced wool as Frome's main industry have declined but not left the town. Singers <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{presence in the}} town, as does Butler and Tanner, although the latter (now named Butler Tanner and Dennis following a take-over) hit major financial difficulties in 2008, and made two-thirds of its workforce redundant.|$|E

5|$|Yeovil <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{town council}} which {{took over the}} {{functions}} of the Charter Trustees in 1982. The council has responsibility for the management of recreational and leisure facilities, open spaces and play areas. In 2005, Yeovil Town Council became the first large council in Somerset to be awarded Quality Town Council status.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> bone to pick.|$|E

It is revealed that Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley) are secretly dating. Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany reaffirm their friendship, and Brittany tells Santana she loves her more than she has ever loved anyone. Rachel meets up with Finn and the two contemplate their Nationals kiss; Finn reminds her that she <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> year until graduation and kisses her.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke {{is an old}} {{market town}} {{expanded}} in the mid 1960s {{as a result of}} an agreement between London County Council and Hampshire County Council. It was developed rapidly after World War II, along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, in order to accommodate part of the London 'overspill' as perceived under the Greater London Plan in 1944. Basingstoke market was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and it remained a small market town until the early 1960s. At the start of World War II the population was little more than 13,000. It <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> regular market, but is now larger than Hampshire County Council's definition of a market town.|$|E

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, it <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related}} to the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Misaki is Asuma's {{assistant}} {{and is the}} first person that Hibiki meets from Kamisaid Magic Academy. When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and the only thing that could cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E
5|$|Some {{dealers and}} antique shops remain, {{but many of}} the shops have come to be {{occupied}} by fashion boutiques, some branches of global designer brands. The street <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> reputation as a fashionable place for shopping, including the flagship stores of Ralph Lauren and Cartier. Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891. The Phillips building at No.101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|The main valleys {{between the}} hills {{are filled with}} {{alluvial}} deposits from the hills or sea. The county has many small rivers, most of which flow into the Bristol Channel. Many of the latter rivers now have clysts (the local name for a sluice) on them to control the sea, but formerly they were tidal for some way inland. The main exception to this is the River Parrett, which <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> tidal bore. However the Chew and the Frome flow into the Avon which forms most of the northern county boundary with Gloucestershire. The Cale flows into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale, while the Exe flows into Devon. The (Dorset) Axe, the Culm and the Otter rise in Somerset but flow into Dorset.|$|E
5|$|The {{part-time}} portion at {{the former}} Horace Harding Boulevard on the east end has a closed and removed booth and one street stair to {{the north side of}} Queens Boulevard at 92nd Street. This entrance abuts two expressway ramps and leads to the former Horace Harding Boulevard, now replaced by the LIE exit ramp. This exit <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> directional mosaic pointing to it, listing the exit as 60th Avenue and 92nd Street {{on the north side of}} Queens Boulevard. The construction of the Long Island Expressway removed this intersection. This is also a staircase that dates to the station's opening.|$|E
