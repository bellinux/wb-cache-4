40|$|Animal welfare during {{transport}} has {{for a long}} time been a problem around the world. Many animals are transported in stressful environments for slaughter. Even during Roman and Antiquity times wild animals were transported from Africa to the amusement parks in Rome. The aim of our work was to compare how well Sweden and Denmark are performing their inspections of transports of cattle and pigs for slaughter. Today, overloaded transports and poor treatment is not uncommon in Europe and every year 22 million animals are transported between countries. To ensure that animals are transported in a manner that leaves no unnecessary suffering, the EU has established a Council Regulation No 1 / 2005, which applies in all EU member countries. Each country will then supplement this with their own laws and regulations. Probably the best thing for the animals had been to use the so-called mobile slaughterhouses, so that the killing can be done on the farm. But so far the standard of the mobile slaughterhouses are inadequate. If this should work it would mean that the meat will be transported frozen and that the animals {{do not have to be}} stressed before slaughter. Sweden and Denmark have two different systems for checking animal transports. In Sweden this is the responsibility of animal welfare inspectors at the county administration, whereas in Denmark the police are the responsible part. The number of inspections differs in the two countries and Denmark makes more inspections per year. A reason why Denmark performs more inspections is because of their geographic location, and many transports are just passing through while in Sweden there are more domestic transports. There is a lot that the two countries can learn from each other. Denmark has a much simpler checklist to follow during an inspection, but in Sweden, for example, they have a better education of animal welfare inspectors, who also judge harder during an inspection. However, it is better that less advanced checks are done than none at all. Sweden today has not as hard sanctions as Denmark; this means that Denmark can provide higher <b>sanctions</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringements.</b> The conclusion is that Sweden has a better education while Denmark has a better statistic result of number of inspections per year...|$|E

50|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the leaked draft chapter on intellectual property covering copyright, trademarks, and patents. In the US, they believed this was likely to further entrench controversial aspects of US copyright law (such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and restrict the ability of Congress to engage in domestic law reform to meet the evolving IP needs of American citizens and the innovative technology sector. Standardization of copyright provisions by other signatories would also require significant changes to other countries' copyright laws. These, according to EFF, include obligations for countries to expand copyright terms, restrict fair use, adopt criminal <b>sanctions</b> <b>for</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> that is done without a commercial motivation (ex. file sharing of copyrighted digital media), place greater liability on internet intermediaries, escalate protections for digital locks and create new threats for journalists and whistleblowers.|$|R

40|$|Resumé The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to {{introduce}} {{the concept of the}} leniency programme and to describe its development and current legal regulation in the European Union and the Czech Republic, to evaluate its rules, its effectiveness and morality. The thesis also explores the relationship between leniency programme and other instruments in antitrust law enforcement. The first chapter defines what a leniency programme is and describes its evolution in the USA and the EU. Leniency programme lies in granting full or partial immunity from sanction to the member of a cartel that reports the existence of this cartel to the antitrust authority. Next it describes the key features of an effective leniency programme. It means severe <b>sanctions</b> <b>for</b> competition <b>infringement,</b> fear of detection and transparency of the programme. Next chapter deals with the development of leniency programme in the EU. It points out the differences between European Commission notification issued in the years 1996, 2002 and 2006 and it describes how the programme works nowadays. It also focuses on the cases in which the Commission used the leniency programme. This chapter entails also the issue of European Competition Network and it Model Leniency Programme.

40|$|Curbing (without banning) {{potentially}} environmentally-damaging {{activities that}} have global, rather than local, effects raises challenges analogous to those faced by a community lacking legislative powers {{that has to}} restrict access to a common pasture {{in order to make}} its use sustainable. A local community achieves autonomy in a matter such as this by consensual cooperation. In the absence of a world coercive authority, global environmental problems (in which a measure of world autonomy is needed) have to be met similarly by consensual co-operation among governments. The conditions under which local consensual cooperation have been observed to be successful may also be relevant to global consensual cooperation. In particular there must be clear rules, and devices for interpreting them; they must be acceptable to all parties; and monitoring of compliance is crucial. Even in such cases of quasi-voluntary compliance, graduated <b>sanctions</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringement,</b> or analogous arrangements, are quite likely to play a vital part. In an international regime for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, it is essential that rules should be devised that will appeal as fair and practically tolerable to opinion in both rich and poor countries and to both high and low per capita emitters. This will rule out a regime of uniform percentage reductions without balancing compensation. It will also rule out a regime based on equal per capita claims to engage in the restricted activity. It is desirable that the rules also act to make the allocation of the reductions in the potentially damaging activity efficient. This will favour rules under which financial signals reflecting marginal costs or benefits play some part in the allocation of any target aggregates. It will probably be essential, given prevalent views of justice and differing valuations of environmental goals between rich and poor nations, that the arrangements involve transfers of resources from richer, higher-per-capita polluting countries to poorer, lower per capita polluting countries. Nevertheless, reducing emissions sufficiently through a system of tradable quotas summing to the targeted total of emissions – which might seem to meet both this requirement and the need for efficient marginal incentives – has, in its simple form in which the quotas issued are proportional to countries’ populations, little chance of being acceptable to rich, high-emitter nations. An attempt is made to explore solutions to these dilemmas, leading on from the arrangements made under the Kyoto protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

40|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding[ [...] . ] {{incidents of}} industrial espionage {{resulted in a}} push for federal protections. In response to this pressure from U. S. industries, Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (2 ̆ 2 EEA 2 ̆ 2). The EEA protects trade secrets {{through the use of}} federal criminal sanctions. 2 ̆ 2 The EEA 2 ̆ 7 s provisions are introduced in Part I. Trade secrets are a form of intellectual property. Therefore, a basic understanding of intellectual property law is important to an analysis of the EEA. Part II of this Article provides an overview of the various forms of intellectual property. To be effective, the EEA must complement existing intellectual property jurisprudence. Yet, on its face the EEA prohibits practices that are otherwise lawful as part of a reverse engineering program. Part II of this Article also describes reverse engineering and examines its acceptance in each area of intellectual property law. Understanding the EEA in terms of the other forms of intellectual property protection and the practice of reverse engineering raises some concerns over the prudence of vigorous EEA enforcement. A strict reading of the EEA may prohibit reverse engineering. Since reverse engineering plays {{a significant role in the}} exploitation of knowledge committed to the public domain through the grant of patents and copyrights, prohibiting reverse engineering may stifle the drive to study and improve upon the existing knowledge base. Part III of this Article examines these concerns. The increasing importance of intellectual property in the world economy has created a trend toward criminalization of infringement. In addition to the acts covered by the EEA, some international agreements require criminal <b>sanctions</b> <b>for</b> <b>infringement</b> of various rights, certain acts of copyright infringement carry criminal penalties, and Congress is currently considering the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act. While these laws are designed to protect intellectual property, the inclusion of criminal sanctions means that they must be analyzed in light of criminal law theories such as notice, vagueness, and leniency. As this trend continues, and prosecutions under these new laws become more frequent, it will be important for criminal practitioners to have a firm grasp of intellectual property concepts and for intellectual property attorneys to understand the importance of criminal law. Finally, it is important for Congress to consider such criminal law issues when enacting new intellectual property legislation. A discussion of these issues with respect to the EEA provides a framework for developing this discussion with respect to other intellectual property laws. To assist in determining the legitimacy of these concerns, Part I also examines the legislative history of the EEA to ascertain congressional intent with respect to the identified problems. Based upon the issues raised in Part III, Part IV proposes a solution to address these concerns while maintaining the effectiveness of the EEA in fulfilling its intended purpose. Specifically, the Article proposes amending the EEA to explicitly allow reverse engineering and to limit its application to espionage activities similar to those Congress had in mind when drafting the Act...|$|R
