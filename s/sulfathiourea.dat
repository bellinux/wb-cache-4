40|$|Forty-four sulfa {{drugs were}} {{screened}} against crude preparations of recombinant Pneumocystis carinii dihydropteroate synthetase. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for p-aminobenzoic acid and 7, 8 -dihydro- 6 -hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphate were 0. 34 +/- 0. 02 and 2. 50 +/- 0. 71 microM, respectively. Several sulfa drugs, including sulfathiazole, sulfachlorpyridazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, and <b>sulfathiourea,</b> inhibited dihydropteroate synthetase approximately {{as well as}} sulfamethoxazole, {{as determined by the}} concentrations which cause 50 % inhibition and/or by Ki. For all sulfones and sulfonamides tested, unsubstituted p-amino groups were necessary for activity, and sulfonamides containing an N 1 -heterocyclic substituent were found to be the most effective inhibitors. Folate biosynthesis in isolated intact P. carinii was approximately equally sensitive to inhibition by sulfamethoxazole, sulfachlorpyridazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfisoxazole, and sulfathiazole. Two of these drugs, sulfamethoxypyridazine and sulfisoxazole, are known to be less toxic than sulfamethoxazole and should be further evaluated for the treatment of P. carinii pneumonia...|$|E
