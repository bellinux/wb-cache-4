50|$|Low voltage and {{low current}} signals (i.e., at the {{secondary}} of a voltage transformers and current transformers) are brought into a low pass filter that removes frequency content above about 1/3 of the sampling frequency (a relay A/D converter needs to sample faster than twice per cycle of the highest frequency that it is to monitor). The AC signal is then sampled by the relay's {{analog to digital converter}} from 4 to 64 (varies by relay) samples per power <b>system</b> <b>cycle.</b> As a minimum, magnitude of the incoming quantity, commonly using Fourier transform concepts (RMS and some form of averaging) would be used in a simple relay function.

5000|$|Many {{traditional}} {{theories of}} international relations, including the other approaches to hegemony, {{believe that the}} baseline nature {{of the international system}} is anarchy. [...] Modelski's long cycle theory, however, states that war and other destabilizing events are a natural product of the long cycle and larger global <b>system</b> <b>cycle.</b> They are part of the living processes of the global polity and social order. Wars are [...] "systemic decisions" [...] that [...] "punctuate the movement of the system at regular intervals." [...] Because [...] "world politics is not a random process of hit or miss, win or lose, depending on the luck of the draw or the brute strength of the contestants," [...] anarchy simply doesn't play a role. After all, long cycles have provided, for the last five centuries, a means for the successive selection and operation of numerous world leaders.|$|E
5000|$|LLWAS compares results {{over its}} {{operating}} area {{to determine whether}} calm, steady winds, wind shifts (in relation to runways), wind gusts, divergent winds, sustained divergent winds (indicative of shear), or strong and sustained divergent winds (indicative of microbursts) are observed. A LLWAS master station polls each remote station every <b>system</b> <b>cycle</b> (nominally every ten seconds) and provides prevailing airport wind averages, runway specific winds, gusts, may set new wind shear alerts or microburst alerts and reset countdown timers of elapsed time since the last alert. By airline rules, pilots must avoid microbursts if warnings are issued by an automated wind shear detection system, and must wait until a safe time interval passes, to assure departure or landing conditions are safe {{for the performance of}} the airframe. Pilots may decide whether to land (or conduct a missed approach) after wind shear alerts are issued. LLWAS wind shear alerts are defined as wind speed gain or loss of between 20 and 30 knots aligned with the active runway direction. [...] "Low level" [...] refers to altitudes of 2000 ft or less above ground level (AGL). Arriving aircraft on descent, generally within three nautical miles of touchdown will fly within this low level, maintaining a glide slope and may lack recovery altitude sufficient to avoid a stall or flight-into-terrain if caught unaware by a microburst. LLWAS microburst alerts are issued for greater than 30 knot loss of airspeed at the runway or within three nautical miles of approach or two nautical miles of departure. Microbursts in excess of 110 knots are known.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a new scheduling and allocation algorithm which optimizes a datapath-controller system for clock cycle time. The cycle {{time of a}} VLSI system depends {{not only on the}} characteristics of the datapath and controller in isolation but also on the interactions between them. A datapath may impose both arrival time constraints on controller inputs and departure time constraints on controller outputs. Late-arriving controller inputs may be generated by complex datapath functions, such as ALU carry-out, while early-departure controller outputs may be required to control slow datapath units. If the controller is not designed taking into account arrival and departure times, it may unnecessarily put control logic on the critical timing path. Our synthesis heuristic, which can be used in conjunction with other scheduling heuristics, identifies critical interactions between datapath and controller and reallocates/reschedules them to reduce <b>system</b> <b>cycle</b> time during high-level synthesis. Experimental results show that a unifiable scheduling and allocation (USA) can substantially improve <b>system</b> <b>cycle</b> time with only small area penalties.
