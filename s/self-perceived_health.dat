5000|$|Several studies {{tried to}} measure {{the quality of life}} and self-perceive {{physical}} health using different scales. Overall, transsexual people have rated their self-perceived quality of life as ‘normal’ or ‘quite good’, however, their overall score was still lower than the control group. Another study showed a similar level of quality of life in transsexual individuals and the control group. Nonetheless, a study with long-term data suggested that albeit quality of life of patients 15 years after sex reassignment surgery is similar to controls, their scores in the domains of physical and personal limitations were significantly lower. On the other hand, research has found that quality of life of transsexual patients could be enhanced by other variables. For instance, trans men obtained a higher <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> score than women because they had a higher level of testosterone than them. Trans women who had undergone face feminization surgery have reported higher satisfaction in different aspects of their quality of life, including their general physical health.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> {{is a good}} {{indicator}} of health status. It is generally accepted that <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> status has important role on one’s health behavior and public health education. Smoking, drinking, and obesity are well known risk factors for one’s health. But its effects on <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> status are not known so well in Korea. This study was planned to evaluate the effect of health behavior such as smoking, drinking, and obesity on <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> status. Methods: We enrolled a total of 6, 040 Koreans, visited to one general hospital health promotion center from June, 2004 through June, 2007. Data was collected by questionnaire, including basic demographic variables, family history of cancers or cerobrovascular accidents, psycho-emotional factors such as stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and health behaviors including smoking, drinking, and exercise. Risk factors for metabolic syndrome were also obtained including waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood sugar, and body mass index (BMI). Results: Older age, higher alcohol consumption, higher BMI, and regular exercise were associated with higher <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> status. Higher education status, higher score of stress, symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia, drug medication, operation history, and abnormal HDL status were associated with lower <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> status.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: <b>Self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> is a simple, non-invasive, and {{inexpensive}} method of data collection, which considers the psychosocial aspects of oral health and {{is related to}} the likelihood of seeking oral health care. Our study aimed to assess the association between self-perceived and clinically determined findings of oral health in a context of socio-economic status (SES) and perceived general health among adult dental patients in a university dental clinic. METHODS: Through a cross-sectional study, we collected the data from 499, 20 - 50 years olds attending dental clinic of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, using valid questionnaire-led interviews about patients’ demographic characteristics; their perceived general health, and oral health. In addition, clinical oral examination was performed to assess decayed missing filled teeth (DMFT) index and prosthesis status of the participants. Spearman correlation, ANOVA and a linear regression model served for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 34. 8 years [SD (Standard deviation) = 9. 91] {{and more than half of}} them were women (51. 9 %). While as high as 73. 0 % of the patients perceived their general health as excellent or good, only 31. 0 % reported the same with their oral <b>health.</b> <b>Self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> was positively associated with <b>self-perceived</b> general <b>health.</b> The younger participants, patients with a higher number of missing and decayed teeth, and those participants wearing more complicated prosthesis in the upper jaw reported worse oral health status (P < 0. 050). CONCLUSION: Oral conditions have significant effects on function and well-being. The present association between clinically determined and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> admitted that it might be beneficial to monitor oral health using such inexpensive and non-invasive method.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> among {{elderly people}} and assess associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study {{was carried out}} with 876 participants forming {{a representative sample of}} elderly people (65 years of age or over) in Campinas, Southeastern Brazil, in 2008 - 2009. Dental examinations were conducted in accordance with criteria standardized by the World Health Organization for epidemiological surveys on oral <b>health.</b> <b>Self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> was evaluated using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Individuals were classified according to sociodemographic characteristics, dental factors and prevalence of biological frailty. Associations were assessed using Poisson regression analysis, taking into consideration sample weights and the complex structure of the cluster sampling. Results: The subjects' mean age was 72. 8 years; 70. 1 % were women. The proportion of the individuals with more than 20 teeth present was 17. 2 %; 38. 2 % were using full dentures in both arches; 8. 5 % needed dental prostheses in at least one arch. On average, the GOHAI was high: 33. 9 (maximum possible: 36. 0). Retaining 20 teeth or more, using full dentures in both arches, not needing such treatment, not presenting any oral mucosa abnormalities and not presenting biological frailty were factors signifi cantly associated with better <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> (p < 0. 05).

40|$|ObjectivesThis population‐based {{analysis}} {{examined the}} prevalence of periodontal diseases along with the <b>self‐perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> and patterns of dental care utilization of breast cancer survivors in the United States. MethodsData from the 1999 ‐ 2004 National Health and Nutrition Surveys were utilized, examining information from 3, 354 women between 50 and 85 years of age. Primary outcomes were gingivitis and periodontitis, <b>self‐perceived</b> oral <b>health,</b> and dental care utilization. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate relationships of breast cancer diagnosis and primary outcomes while controlling for confounding factors. ResultsBreast cancer survivors {{were more likely to}} be older than 55 years, white, nonsmokers, have higher levels of education and income, and a higher prevalence of osteoporosis. Breast cancer survivors were significantly less likely to have dental insurance (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). Utilization of dental services and reason for last dental visit did not significantly differ between groups. A history of a breast cancer diagnosis did not increase the odds of gingivitis [odds ratio (OR) :[*][*] 1. 32; 95 percent confidence interval (CI) : 0. 53 ‐ 3. 63], periodontitis (OR:[*] 1. 82; 95 percent CI:[*][*] 0. 89 ‐ 4. 01), or poor <b>self‐perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> (OR:[*] 0. 89; 95 percent CI: 0. 61 ‐ 1. 33) after adjusting for age, race, education, dental care utilization, and smoking status.

Another purpose was to investigate if there were any differences in these respects, between the two age groups, born in 1932 or 1942. In two counties in Sweden, Orebro and Ostergötland, all persons born in 1942 have been surveyed by mail every fifth year since 1992. In the year 2007 all persons born in 1932 were also surveyed using the same questionnaire. Those born in 1932 consisted of 3735 persons and those born in 1942 6078 persons. From an outline of a general model of inequalities in oral health data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and contingency tables with chi 2 analysis. Multivariable analysis was performed by using multiple regression analysis. Factors related to <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> were age group, social network, ethnicity, education, general health,tobacco habits, oral hygiene routines, dental visit habits and cost for care. The <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> was overall rather high, especially in view of the studied ages, although it was worse for those of age 75.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's core Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scale using data from 5, 520 public high school students. METHODS: The 1997 South Carolina Youth Risk Behavior Survey was the source of data. Chi-square analysis was applied to assess scale construct validity. Adjusted multiple logistic regression with selected tobacco and substance use variables was used to assess known-groups validity of the scale's Healthy Days index (items regarding poor physical and mental health days during the past 30 days). RESULTS: Construct validity was supported for the core HRQOL scale by the associations between <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and physical health, mental health, and activity limitation days. A greater number of poor physical health days, poor mental health days, or activity limitation days was associated with poorer <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> (p< 0. 0001); however, correlation coefficients for the associations between <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and physical health days (r= 0. 24; p< 0. 001), <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and mental health days (r= 0. 26; p< 0. 0001), and <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and activity limitation days (r= 0. 23; p< 0. 0001), although significant, were low in magnitude. Logistic regression analyses conducted with the Healthy Days index revealed significant (p< 0. 05) HRQOL differences between users and non- users of tobacco and other substance use variables. As hypothesized, as the usage of each substance increased, reported poor HRQOL days increased, supporting the known- groups validity of the scale. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the HRQOL scale items are valid and potentially useful for adolescent surveillance. The results, however, are mixed regarding the inclusion of <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> as a measure of HRQOL for adolescents, given the low correlation coefficients for the associations between <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and the other HRQOL scale items. These results suggest that adolescents may be rating two separate dimensions of health when rating their <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and HRQOL. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in different adolescent populations...|$|E
40|$|T he Canadian {{population}} is aging. In 2004, 13 % {{of the population}} was 65 or older; in 1971, the figure wasjust 8 %. 1 Even greater changes in the proportion of seniors will occur in 2011 when the oldest baby boomers, those born in 1946, reach 65. It is projected that by 2051, a quarter of Canadians will be in their senior years. 2 Aging is often accompanied by the onset or exacerbation of disease and disability, and a greater need for assistance with daily activities and personal care. While most seniors remain in the community as their needs increase, some require long-term institutional care. Since 1981, the proportion of people aged 65 or older living in health care institutions has remained fairly stable at around 7 %. 3 However, over the same period, as the elderly population increased, the actual number living in health care institutions rose from about 173, 000 to more than 263, 000. 3 Objectives This article explores factors associated with positive <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> among Canadian seniors who live in health care institutions. Data source Cross-sectional and longitudinal data are from the institutional and household files of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS). Analytical techniques Prevalence rates of positive <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> were estimated using 1996 / 97 cross-sectional data from the NPHS.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the present study, which focused on a census of 19 -yearolds (2006) {{attending}} dental clinics in two Swedish counties, was to describe the frequency distribution of clinically- and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> indicators in terms of DSa (Decayed Surfaces approximal), four global dimensions of oral health and one ‘all-embracing’ oral health measure, according to county of residence and gender. A second purpose was to examine to what extent the clinical indicator of oral health and the global dimensions of <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> contribute to the explainable variance of the global single-item indicator. Finally, the study examined whether or not the association of clinically- and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> indicators with the single global oral health indicator varied as a function of gender and place of residence. The study base was 46. 5 % (n= 3658) of all children attending for dental checks (n= 7866). The questionnaire included thirteen questions, divided into four global dimensions. These were Knowledge, Quality of life, Social and Function. There was also one ‘all-embracing’ oral health question, one question about gender and finally information about clinically-registered disease. The findings of this study were that females reported more serious problems than males in the Social and Quality of life dimensions and there were differences between counties in knowledge about oral diseases. The group with poor self-reported oral health in the ‘all-embracing’ oral health question had significantly more problems with all global dimensions, especially Quality of life and Social dimensions. Statistically-significant two-way interactions occurred between county and Knowledge and between county and Quality of life. This study supports the idea of one or several questions concerning <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> {{to be used as a}} complement to the traditional epidemiological clinical registration of oral diseases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Leprosy is a {{hyperendemic}} chronic {{condition in}} the Rondônia State. Despite the significant impact of oral health {{on the quality}} of life and clinical evolution of leprosy patients, systematic evaluation of oral health status has been neglected. To analyze the dental-clinical profile, <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> and dental health service access of leprosy cases in the municipality of Cacoal in Rondônia State, North Brazil, from 2001 to 2012. A descriptive, cross-sectional study design was performed based on dental evaluation and standardized structured instruments. We investigated clinically assessed and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> status, as well as dental health service access. A total of 303 leprosy cases were included; 41. 6 % rated their oral health as good, and 42. 6 % reported being satisfied with their oral health. Self-reported loss of upper teeth was 45. 5 %. The clinical evaluation revealed that 54. 5 % had active caries. Most (97. 7 %) cases reported having been to the dentist at least once in their life and 23. 1 % used public health services. The poor standard of oral health in this population may increase the risk for leprosy reactions, consequently reducing quality of life. Low access to public health dental services and poor <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> reinforce the need to achieve comprehensive health care in this population...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Health {{is defined}} as a state of {{complete}} physical, social and mental wellbeing, therefore, it should not be considered as simply the absence of disease. In this light, the assessment of <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and life satisfaction plays an important role as it allows addressing the subjective perception of physical health, as well as mental health and social functioning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from 8516 university students enrolled in the "Sportello Salute Giovani" project ("Youth Health Information Desk"). In particular, it addressed <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and life satisfaction, reported somatic and psychological symptoms and ability to cope with daily problems of university students from 18 to 30 years old. RESULTS: Overall, 77. 1 % of students declared to have a good or very good health and the mean score of life satisfaction was 7. 46. In respect to somatic and psychological symptoms, 25. 8 % of students reported to suffer almost daily of at least one among headache, stomach pain, back pain, tiredness, nervousness, dizziness and troubles falling asleep. Results varied on the basis of sex, with women showing lower <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> compared to men and reporting more symptoms. Furthermore, <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> was shown better in younger students and in those belonging to higher socio-economic level. DISCUSSION: The survey showed that concern exists with respect to university students' <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health,</b> which is different from that arising from other evidence. Female students had a significant lower <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and reported somatic and psychological symptoms more commonly than men. On the other hand, results about life satisfaction seem to be aligned with the literature. CONCLUSION: One of the most important implications of the study is the need to address <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and reported symptoms in university students in order to monitor them and initiate interventions aimed at improving well-being and controlling inequalities...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between role stress, professional self-efficacy, and <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> using the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R model). The proposed model hypothesizes that professional self-efficacy mediates the relationship between role ambiguity and role conflict on the one hand, and <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> on the other. To test this hypothesis, data were collected from 272 workers from southern Spain. Mediation analyses were performed using the macro PROCESS for SPSS developed by Hayes (2013). Results showed that role conflict, role ambiguity, and self-efficacy were significant predictors of <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health.</b> In addition, self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between role stress and health...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Health self-perception is {{a strong}} {{indicator}} of {{the health of a}} population. Objective To investigate the association between <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health,</b> and sociodemographic and clinical factors in a sample of elderly outpatients in Rio de Janeiro. Methods A sample of 345 elderly patients was assessed with an anamnesis, Lawton and Brody’s Scale, Katz Index, Geriatric Depression Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, and Study of Osteoporotic Fracture Index. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the predictors of <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health.</b> Results Risk of falls, frailty, functional performance on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, insomnia, and familial support were related to <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health.</b> Insomnia was the variable that strongly influenced <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> (OR = 0. 47, CI 95 %: 0. 28 – 0. 80, p = 0. 01) in our sample. Conclusions The investigation of insomnia in the elderly should be routinely performed in primary care, because of the negative impact it imposes on the health of this population...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} to {{validate}} a mandarin Chinese version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 49) in China {{and to develop a}} shortened version of OHIP appropriate for use in partially dentate patients with implant-supported prostheses. The original 49 items of OHIP were translated into mandarin Chinese using a forward-backward method and administered to 580 subjects selected by stratified random sampling. <b>Self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> status and treatment need were also collected. Reliability and validity of the Chinese version of OHIP (OHIP-C 49) were validated. A shortened version (OHIP-I) was derived from the OHIP-C 49 by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as expert-based approach in partially dentate patients (n= 102) with implant-supported prostheses. For validation of the new modified shortened version, another independent sample of 97 partially dentate patients completed OHIP-I and their <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> status at baseline and at least 3 months after dental implant rehabilitation. Five hundred and thirty-seven effectual questionnaires were reclaimed from the 580 subjects interviewed. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0 · 78 to 0 · 96 and test-retest correlation coefficients ranged from 0 · 84 to 0 · 97 for subscale and summary scores. Construct validity was demonstrated by priori hypothesised associations between the OHIP-C 49 scores and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> (P< 0 · 001). The reliability and validity of OHIP-I were similar to which of the OHIP-C 49, and the responsiveness appeared able to measure the effect of dental implant therapy effectively. The mandarin version of OHIP- 49 showed sufficient psychometric properties for Chinese. The modified shortened version (OHIP-I) may be appropriate for the evaluation of implant therapy outcomes in partially dentate Chinese patients. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} {{access of}} adolescents to dental services and identify its determinants. Material and Methods: This is a cross-sectional, population-based study conducted with {{a representative sample}} of 431 adolescents aged 15 - 19 years in a health district of Vitória, ES. The interviews were guided by a structured questionnaire with socio-demographic questions, service utilization, and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health.</b> SPSS statistical software version 15. 0 was used. Statistical analysis consisted of the use of simple frequency with proportion and chi-square tests. Significance level of 5 % was adopted. Results: Most respondents visit the dentist at least once a year, having as main reason routine visit, are attended in public services and positively evaluate the service provided. Factors associated with greater access to dental services (consultation once a year) were care in private service (p = 0. 000), schooling (p = 0. 019) and positive <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> (p = 0. 047). Conclusion: It was concluded that the prevalence of recent use of dental services among adolescents was high and access was related t...|$|R
40|$|Influence of <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> and {{socioeconomic}} predictors on {{the utilization of}} dental care services by schoolchildren Abstract: The influence of socioeconomic factors and self-rated oral health on children’s dental health assistance was assessed. This study fol-lowed a cross-sectional design, with a multistage random sample of 792 12 -year-old schoolchildren from Santa Maria, a city in southern Brazil. A dental examination provided information on the prevalence of dental caries (DMFT index). Data {{about the use of}} dental service, socioeconom-ic status, and <b>self-perceived</b> oral <b>health</b> were collected by means of struc-tured interviews. These associations were assessed using Poisson regres-sion models (prevalence ratio; 95 % confidence interval). The prevalence of regular use of dental service was 47. 8 %. Children from low socioeco-nomic backgrounds and those who rated their oral health as “poor ” used the service less frequently. The distribution of the kind of oral healthcare assistance used (public/private) varied across socioeconomic groups. The better-off children were less likely to have used the public service. Clini-cal, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors were strong predictors for the utilization of dental care services by schoolchildren...|$|R
40|$|Background. Several {{population-based}} {{studies have}} shown that <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> is a powerful predictor of health outcomes. The extent to which <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> is associated with personality characteristics is, however, largely unknown. We aimed to study the relationship between <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and personality among adults in the community. Method. Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States Survey, a representative sample of adults age 25 - 74. MANOVA was used to determine the relationship between self perception of health and personality using the five-factor model. Results. Personality factors were significantly associated with perception of poor health. Among those without self-reported medical problems (N = 834), openness to experience, extraversion and conscientiousness were associated with perception of good health, while neuroticism was associated with the perception of poor health. In subjects with self-reported medical problems (N = 2772), high scores on agreeableness, openness to experience, extraversion and conscientiousness, and low neuroticism scores were associated with perception of good health. These associations remained significant after adjustments for age, gender, race, marital status and education. Conclusions. <b>Self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> is strongly associated with personality characteristics, both in subjects with and without self-reported medical problems. It is suggested that personality characteristics could contribute to the previously reported associations between <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and symptoms of elderly persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and to explore whether there are special symptoms associated with undiagnosed DM or IGT. The study population consisted of community-living northern Finnish persons aged 70 years or over (n = 379). Poor <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and high number of symptoms were most common among previously diagnosed diabetic persons. Undiagnosed diabetes and especially IGT did not predict poorer <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> or higher number of symptoms compared with non-diabetic status. We conclude that in older subjects neither undiagnosed diabetes nor I G T can be traced by worsened health perceptions or on the basis of symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Adolescents are at {{substantial}} risk of acquiring behaviors which might influence their health status. This study was aimed {{to assess the}} proportion of school going adolescents (both males and females) with poor <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> and its associated factors. Methodology: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} three major cities of Pakistan i. e. Karachi, Lahore and Quetta. From each city, six (6) secondary schools were randomly selected (3 public and 3 private). Pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to students. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine independent factors associated with poor <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health.</b> Results: Approximately 29 % adolescents (119 / 414) reported poor <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health.</b> Individual and parental factors significantly associated with poor <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> were being male (AOR = 1. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 09 - 2. 79), living in extended family (AOR = 2. 65, 95 % CI: 1. 66 – 4. 22), unskilled employment of father (AOR = 2. 17, 95 % CI: 1. 35 – 3. 48), lack of parental-child communication (AOR = 1. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 03 – 2. 91) and unfair treatment by parents (AOR = 1. 80, 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 2. 96). Life style factors such as use of smokeless tobacco (AOR = 2. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 26 – 3. 96) and unhealthy diet (AOR = 3. 60, 95 % CI: 1. 76 – 7. 33) were associated with poor <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health.</b> Conclusion: Better employment opportunities for father, parental counseling and increase awareness for adolescents about healthy diet are recommended to improve adolescent <b>self-perceived</b> <b>health</b> in Pakistan. </p...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the impact of Taiwan's National Health Insurance program (NHI), established in 1995, on improving elderly access to care and health status. Further, we estimate the extent to which NHI reduces gaps in access and health across income groups. Using data from a longitudinal survey, we adopt a difference-in-difference methodology to estimate the causal effect of Taiwan's NHI. Our results show that Taiwan's NHI has significantly increased utilization of both outpatient and inpatient care among the elderly, and such effects were more salient for people in the low- or middle-income groups. Our findings also reveal that although Taiwan's NHI greatly increased the utilization of both outpatient and inpatient services, this increased utilization of health services did not reduce mortality or lead to better <b>self-perceived</b> general <b>health</b> status for Taiwanese elderly. Measures more sensitive than mortality and <b>self-perceived</b> general <b>health</b> may be necessary for discerning the health effects of NHI. Alternatively, the lack of NHI effects on health may reflect other quality and efficiency problems inherent in the system not yet addressed by NHI. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
