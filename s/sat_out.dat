5|$|Seven offered Johns the 10.30pm Thursday timeslot, which Johns had {{the option}} of declining owing to a clause in his contract.

Consequently, Johns declined the offer and <b>sat</b> <b>out</b> 2011 on full pay. It has also been suggested that success of The Matty Johns Show depended on the success of related AFL show The Bounce, which failed in 2010.
