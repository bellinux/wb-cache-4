40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the effect of strain ageing on the tensile and {{fracture}} properties of reinforcing steels and to determine economically feasible methods of reducing <b>strain</b> <b>age</b> <b>embrittlement</b> in reinforcing bar contained in reinforced concrete structures. The effect of titanium and vanadium additions to normal reinforcing steels on strain ageing has been investigated by obtaining the resultant changes in mechanical properties. Both these transition elements have been effective in reducing strain ageing to a negligible level when present in sufficient quantities, while titanium also reduces the asrolled transition temperature and increases the Luder's strain. Examined in detail also is the effect of strain ageing on the mechanical properties of a normal reinforcing steel and a similar titanium-bearing steel after variation of plastic strain, ageing temperature and ageing time. Due to the stabilizing effect of the titanium addition, this steel exhibits superior impact properties over the normal steel when strained and then aged at or below 100 °C. When the ageing temperature is increased above 100 °C, these stabilized characteristics are gradually removed and hence the fracture properties tend to that of the normal steel. A critical study of the existing standards for bends in deformed reinforcing bar shows the necessity for modification of these standards to eliminate the possibility of brittle fracture at bends as a result of <b>strain</b> <b>age</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> Recommendations for these modifications are made from the determination of safe bend diameters obtained using data from field failures at bends...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} and strain aging on C- Mn steel weld metal toughness and fracture characteristics were investigated {{by means of}} fracture mechanics. Multipass shielded metal arc weld metal bearing a total nitrogen content {{in the range of}} 80 to 210 ppm have been tested by using mini wide plates (WP) in tension and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) specimens under four different conditions, viz., 1) As-Welded (AW), 2) Stress Relieved (SR) : 580 C/ 120 min., 3) Artificially Strain Aged (SA) : 10 % cold deformation + 250 C/ 30 min. and 4) Artificially Strain Aged and Stress Relieved (SAS). In order to obtain specimens in SA condition, the welds were artificially strained (10 % compression in plate thickness direction) and aged. The CTOD and sixteen through thickness center cracked wide-plate specimens with transverse weld metal were tested at room temperature to determine the sensitivity of each test type to the nitrogen and <b>strain</b> <b>age</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> The weld metal yield and ultimate tensile strengths increased with increasing nitrogen content for all four conditions. Results of the small scale CTOD tests clearly show that nitrogen and strain aging have a definite embrittling effect on the weld metal toughness and R-curve behaviour. The wide-plate test results, however, did not show a similar sensitivity to the nitrogen content and strain aging as CTOD tests showed and all of the WP plates fractured in fully ductile manner.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to support warm prestressing experiments on unclad and sub-clad flawed beams loaded in pure bending. Two cladding yield strengths were investigated: 0. 6 Sy and 0. 8 Sy, where Sy is the yield strength of the base metal. Cladding and base metal were assumed to be stress free at the stress relief temperature for the 3 D elastic-plastic finite element analysis used to model the experiments. The model results indicated that when cooled from the stress relief temperature, the cladding was put in tension due to its greater coefficient of thermal expansion. When cooled, the cladding exhibited various amounts of tensile yielding. The degree of yielding depended on the amount of cooling and the strength of the cladding relative to that of the base metal. When subjected to tensile bending stress, the sub-clad flaw elastic-plastic stress intensity factor, K{sub I}(J), was at first dominated by crack closing force due to tensile yielding in the cladding. Thus, imposed loads initially caused no increase in K{sub I}(J) near the clad-base interface. However, K{sub I}(J) at the flaw depth was little affected. When the cladding residual stress was overcome, K{sub I}(J) gradually increased until the cladding began to flow. Thereafter, the rate at which K{sub I}(J) increased with load was {{the same as that of}} an unclad beam. A plastic zone corrected K{sub I} approximation for the unclad flaw was found by the superposition of standard Newman and Raju solutions with those due to a cladding crack closure force approximated by the Kaya and Erdogan solution. These elastic estimates of the effect of cladding in reducing the crack driving force were quite in keeping with the 3 D elastic-plastic finite element solution for the sub-clad flaw. The results were also compared with the analysis of clad beam experiments by Keeney and the conclusions by Miyazaki, et al. A number of sub-clad flaw specimens not subjected to warm prestressing were thought to have suffered degraded toughness caused by locally intensified <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> <b>embrittlement</b> (LISAE) due to welding over the preexisting flaw...|$|R

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steel welds in components used in light water reactors {{are susceptible to}} thermal <b>aging</b> <b>embrittlement</b> at reactor operating temperature of around 300 degrees C after a long service life. In this study, low temperature <b>aging</b> <b>embrittlement</b> of types 304 L and 316 L {{stainless steel}} welds with 10 % ferrite was investigated {{on the basis of}} changes in mechanical properties and microstructure after aging up to 20, 000 h at 335, 365 and 400 degrees C. Spinodal decomposition and G-phase precipitation in the ferrite was observed after aging which lead to embrittlement in the material. In contrast to the small effect on tensile properties, the impact toughness was significantly degraded after aging. Charpy impact test of the aged samples showed decrease in upper-shelf and lower-shelf energy and increase in ductile brittle transition temperature. Large increase in the microhardness of ferrite phase was observed with no change in austenite hardness. The embrittlement in 316 L weld was higher compared to 304 L weld for similar aging condition. The kinetics of <b>aging</b> <b>embrittlement</b> was established based on Arrhenius relationship. A constant activation energy was determined for 304 L weld in the temperature range 335 - 400 degrees C, however, 316 L weld showed different activation energy values in each temperature range.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Metal surfaces, and particularly steels, may be modified by processes which include; plastic-deformation, chemical changes and heating. These layers are often characterised by high hardness and a pronounced resistance to chemical etching. This latter characteristic giving rise to the generically descriptive term "White Layer", which is often applied to such features. Processes which may result {{in the formation of}} "White Layer" can be broadly separated into three groups; thermal, chemical and mechanical. In practice, "White Layers" observed on materials removed from service environments have generally experienced a combination of these processes. In this work white-etching layers formed on engineering steels have been characterised, using a variety of electron beam and X-ray analytical techniques, to establish the chemical nature and structural properties of "white layer" material. Specimens drawn from such diverse service applications as; high-pressure tank gun barrels, digger-teeth from gravel extraction plant and adiabatically-sheared armour steel have been compared with samples produced in the laboratory by conventional pin-on-disc wear testing apparatus, specialised machining techniques and laser surface-hardening heat-treatment. The presence of a hard white-etching layer on each of the samples was first established using metallographic examination by light microscopy and microhardness testing to confirm the etch-resistance and high hardness of the white-layer. The chemical composition of the whiteetching layer was then compared with the bulk steel composition using scanning electron microscopy and conventional microprobe analysis (Z > 11), and no significant differences were observed. Light element microprobe analysis and SIMS showed an increase in H, C, N, 0 in the white-etching layers formed within gun barrels, and on abusively turned steel. The levels detected were not considered to be significant in terms of white-layer formation but may well have an influence on <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> and <b>embrittlement</b> phenomena. A technique for the preparation of cross-sectional thin foils was developed which allowed the structure of the white-etching layers to be compared with the underlying matrix by TEM and electron diffraction. The results of this study showed clear similarities between white-etching layers formed by wear and abusive machining and those formed by adiabatic shear. From these results it is concluded that " white layer " is a fine grain martensite which forms on steel as a result of thermo-mechanical transformation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{addresses}} the <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> {{effects on the}} mechanical properties of the partially damaged structural mild steel. Since repairing partly damaged structures may not occur immediately, the <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> effect can significantly influence the structural behaviour.

Systematic additions of titanium (in the range of 5 ppm to 450 ppm) and nitrogen (80 ppm to 260 ppm) were made to obtain various amounts of acicular ferrite and different microstructures which led to varying fracture behaviours and sensitivity to <b>strain</b> <b>ageing.</b> Artificially <b>strain</b> <b>aged</b> welds were obtained by two subsequent processes; 1) local compression (4 %) of the weld region in the plate thickness direction at room temperature and 2) ageig at 250 C for 1 / 2 h. An increasing nitrogen content in the weld metals leads to an increase in strenght and hardness and impairs the fracture toughness properties associated with an incrase of coarser microstructure and due to the dislocation pinning effect of free nitrogen which hinders their movements.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> {{has been investigated}} in polycrystalline and single crystal NiAl alloys at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K. Static <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> studies revealed that after annealing at 1100 K for 7200 s (i. e., 2 h) followed by furnace cooling, high purity, nitrogen-doped and titanium-doped polycrystalline alloys exhibited continuous yielding, while conventional-purity and carbon-doped alloys exhibited distinct yield points and Luders strains. Prestraining by hydrostatic pressurization removed the yield points, but they could be reintroduced by further annealing treatments. Yield points could be reintroduced more rapidly if the specimens were prestrained uniaxially rather than hydrostatically, owing to the arrangement of dislocations into cell structures during uniaxial deformation. The time dependence of the <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> events followed at t(exp 2 / 3) relationship suggesting that the yield points observed in polycrystalline NiAl {{were the result of}} the pinning of mobile dislocations by interstitials, specifically carbon. Between 700 and 800 K, yield stress plateaus, yield stress transients upon a ten-fold increase in strain rate, work hardening peaks, and dips in the strain rate sensitivity (SRS) have been observed in conventional-purity and carbon-doped polycrystals.

At low strain rates small serrations on the stress-strain curves, typical for the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect are observed for the material loaded in the transverse and rolling directions at room temperature.

Furthermore, inhomogeneous deformation is observed on several size scales ranging from localized glide bands to surface deformation effects (orange peel surface) and macroscopic flow localization in shear bands...|$|R
40|$|This work {{explores the}} effects of Cr (0. 26 – 0. 74 wt%) and Mo (0. 09 – 0. 3 wt%) {{additions}} on the kinetics of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> process in low carbon steel. The <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> behaviour of the steels was investigated by using tensile tests and transmission electron microscopy. The results have shown that Mo-alloyed steels undergo the same four stages of ageing as unalloyed low carbon steel, whereas Cr-alloyed steels exhibit only three stages of ageing. At the same time, the addition of Mo accelerates the ageing response, while alloying with Cr reduces the rate of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> by ∼ 3 times in comparison with non-alloyed low carbon steel. It especially delays the offset of Stage III. This is explained by the reduction of carbon content in ferrite due to the enrichment of cementite with Cr leading to the reduction of its equilibrium solubility in ferrite...|$|R
40|$|The {{materials}} parameter i. e. microstructure {{as well as}} {{the processing}} factors i. e. aging time and temperature, the amount of plastic deformation, and residual stresses affecting the kinetic of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing</b> in the S 275 JRC steel were investigated in detail. For this purpose, 5 % pre-strained steel was aged at 160 ºC for different intervals. The ageing behavior was determined for the as-received (AR) and homogenization & normalizing heat treated (H+N heat treated) conditions. The yield stresses before and after aging process and, the hardness values of the aged steels were considered to calculate <b>strain</b> <b>aging</b> progress. It was shown that a noticeable increase in the yield strength, tensile strength and hardness values was observed for aged AR and H+N heat treated specimens. Moreover, the repetitive increase in the yield and ultimate tensile strength was believed to be a result of <b>strain</b> <b>ageing...</b>|$|R
