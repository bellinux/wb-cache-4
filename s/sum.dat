The arithmetic properties of {{the generalized}} Cochrane <b>sums</b> are studied, and the Cochrane–Hardy <b>sums</b> are {{expressed in terms of}} the generalized Cochrane <b>sums.</b> Analogues of Subrahmanyam's identity and Knopp's theorem are given and proved.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} higher-dimensional Dedekind <b>sums</b> with {{a complex}} parameter z, generalizing Zagier's higher-dimensional Dedekind <b>sums.</b> The <b>sums</b> tend to Zagier's higher-dimensional Dedekind <b>sums</b> as z→∞. We {{show that the}} <b>sums</b> {{turn out to be}} generating functions of higher-dimensional Apostol–Zagier <b>sums</b> which are defined to be hybrids of Apostol's <b>sums</b> and Zagier's <b>sums.</b> We prove reciprocity law for the <b>sums.</b> The new reciprocity law includes reciprocity formulas for both Apostol and Zagier's <b>sums</b> as its special case. Furthermore, as its application we obtain relations between special values of Hurwitz zeta function and Bernoulli numbers, as well as new trigonometric identities...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to define p-adic Hardy <b>sums</b> and p-adic q-higher-order Hardy-type <b>sums.</b> By using these <b>sums</b> and p-adic q-higher-order Dedekind <b>sums,</b> we {{construct}} p-adic con-tinuous functions for an odd prime. These functions contain p-adic q-analogue of higher-order Hardy-type <b>sums.</b> By using an in-variant p-adic q-integral on Zp, we give fundamental properties of these <b>sums.</b> We also establish relations between p-adic Hardy <b>sums,</b> Bernoulli functions, trigonometric functions and Lambert series...|$|R

40|$|Dedekind <b>sums</b> are well-studied {{arithmetic}} <b>sums,</b> with values uniformly distributed on {{the unit}} interval. Based on their relation to certain modular forms, Dedekind <b>sums</b> may be defined as functions on the cusp set of SL(2,Z). We present a compatible notion of Dedekind <b>sums,</b> which we name Dedekind symbols, for any non-cocompact lattice Γ<SL(2,R), and prove the corresponding equidistribution mod 1 result. The latter part builds up on a paper of Vardi, who first connected exponential <b>sums</b> of Dedekind <b>sums</b> to Kloosterman <b>sums.</b> Comment: 22 page...|$|R

Harmonic <b>sums</b> and generalized harmonic <b>sums</b> emerge as special cases of so-called d'Alembertian solutions of recurrence relations. We show that harmonic <b>sums</b> form a quasi-shuffle algebra and describe a method how we can find algebraically independent harmonic <b>sums.</b> In addition, we define a differentiation on harmonic <b>sums</b> via an extended version of the Mellin transform. Along with that, new relations between harmonic <b>sums</b> will arise. Furthermore, we present an algorithm which rewrites certain types of nested <b>sums</b> into expressions in terms of harmonic <b>sums.</b> We illustrate by nontrivial examples how these algorithms {{in cooperation with the}} summation package Sigma support the evaluation of Feynman integrals...|$|R
