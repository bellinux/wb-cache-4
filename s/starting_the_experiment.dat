30|$|CO 2 was insufflated {{into the}} lung model at {{approximately}} 200  mL/min (float-type area flowmeter), and continuous gas sampling was performed from the lung model using a capnometer (Life Scope TR, NIHON KOHDEN Co., Tokyo, Japan) (Fig.  1). The gas sampling {{rate of the}} capnometer was set at 200  mL/min. The partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2; mmHg) was monitored by the capnometer, and the stabilized value was recorded. The actual minute volume of insufflated CO 2 (V̇CO 2; mL/min) was calculated by the measurement of PCO 2 using the capnometer when it was mixed with oxygen at 5  L/min (fixed-type flowmeter).

After administration of drugs (orally), animals were caged immediately under sterile condition. Urine samples were collected up to 5  h, during the experiment, food and water was not given to the animals in cages. After collection, urine samples were preserved with sodium azide to avoid microbial contamination. Further, urine Na+ and K+ ions were analyzed by flame photometer (Elico. CL 378, India) [15].
