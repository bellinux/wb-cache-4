25|$|Another 25,000 Teamsters {{walked off}} the job in a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> on April 25, 1905, paralyzing grocery stores, warehouses, railway shippers, {{department}} stores and coal companies. The EA and its members then sued nearly every union involved in the strike. Local and state courts issued numerous injunctions against the unions, ordering them to stop picketing and return to work.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Chicago {{was one of}} {{the most}} unionized cities in the world. Nearly 243,000 Chicagoans belonged to unions, about a quarter of the workforce. One-third of these worked in a single {{industry}} (meatpacking). The Teamsters were vitally important to the Chicago labor movement, for a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout the city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Gold {{continued}} {{to pursue an}} aggressive collective bargaining policy {{until the beginning of}} World War II. Within weeks of taking over as president, he authorized a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> of 13,000 fur workers in New York City to support striking fur workers in Canada. The protests, rallies and spot strikes continued as Gold pushed to organize the remaining fur shops in New York City. Signed contracts were reached with newly organized employers in July 1937.|$|E

25|$|Opposition to Shea's {{re-election}} {{as president}} of the Teamsters appeared in early June 1905. Albert Young announced that Shea had mismanaged the Chicago <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> and that he would run for president at the union's convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in August. Shea was supported by about half the 200 delegates from locals outside Chicago, with the remaining delegates split among two other reform candidates. Although the 325-member convention was dominated by the 125-member Chicago delegation, the Chicagoans appeared split between Young and Shea.|$|E
25|$|On December 15, 1904, 19 {{clothing}} cutters at Montgomery Ward went {{on strike}} to protest the company's use of nonunion subcontractors. Montgomery Ward vice president Robert J. Thorne locked the remaining workers out. Sympathy strikes by tailors' and other unions quickly broke out. By April, 5,000 workers were on the picket line {{in front of the}} 26 local companies represented by the National Tailors' Association (an employer group). The Teamsters engaged in a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> on April 6, 1905, adding another 10,000 members to the picket lines.|$|E
25|$|The Teamsters were vitally {{important}} to the labor movement, for a strike or <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood. It also meant that Teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes {{in order to avoid}} strikes, and control of a Teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues. During Shea's presidency, the entire Teamsters union was notoriously corrupt. Noted labor historian John R. Commons famously concluded that during this time, the Teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization.|$|E
5000|$|On December 15, 1904, 19 {{clothing}} cutters at Montgomery Ward went {{on strike}} to protest the company's use of nonunion subcontractors. The manager of the fabric cutting room for Montgomery Ward & Co. {{at the time of}} the initial incident was C.V. Boller. [...] The Montgomery Ward company locked the remaining workers out. <b>Sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> by several tailors' unions broke out, as did <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> by other unions. By April, 5,000 workers were on the picket line, with all 26 local members of the National Tailors' Association (a coalition of clothing manufacturers and retailers) struck.|$|R
5000|$|Wildcat and <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> {{were made}} illegal, and unionized workers {{had to follow}} an orderly fashion to engage in {{striking}} which meant no striking during periods of collective bargaining.|$|R
50|$|In early March 1980 the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood {{closed down}} the {{business}} district of Aleppo for two weeks. The <b>strikes</b> spurred <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> {{in other cities}} including Hama, Homs, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor, and Hasaka.|$|R
25|$|After {{two weeks}} of legal maneuvers, the trial began on November 30 with a major bombshell: Albert Young had pleaded guilty to {{conspiracy}} and turned state's evidence against Cornelius Shea. The following day, Young alleged that he, Shea and three others had each received a $300 bribe from the tailors' union in order to call the April 6 <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> against Montgomery Ward. Over the next few days, Young and other witnesses also testified that Shea had ordered the beating of non-union drivers and strikebreakers and personally told picketers to throw acid at horses and non-union team drivers.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Debs {{formed the}} American Railway Union (ARU) as an {{industrial}} organization {{in response to}} craft limitations. Railroad engineers and firemen had called a strike, but other employees, particularly conductors who were organized into a different craft, did not join that strike. The conductors piloted scab engineers on the train routes, helping their employers to break the strike. In June 1894, the newly formed, industrially organized ARU voted to join in solidarity with an ongoing strike against the Pullman company. The <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> demonstrated the enormous power of united action, yet resulted in a decisive government response to end the strike and destroy the union.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of poor {{national}} economic conditions in the mid-1870s following the Panic of 1873, the B attempted to reduce its workers' wages. After a second reduction in wages was announced in the same year, workers began the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The strike spread to Cumberland, and when the governor of Maryland on July 20 attempted {{to put down the}} strike by sending the state militia from Baltimore, riots broke out resulting in 11 deaths, the burning of parts of Camden station, and damage to several engines and cars. The next day workers in Pittsburgh staged a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> that was also met with an assault by the state militia; Pittsburgh then erupted into widespread rioting. The strike ended after federal troops and state militias restored order.|$|E
5|$|Multiple Unions {{across the}} city {{declared}} <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> and joined the growing crowd. Between 8,000 and 10,000 rioters flooded Illinois Street, the main business district of the city, lighting fires, destroying property, and attacking people.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{secondary}} boycotts {{are prohibited}} by the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. In the 1910s, <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> were sometimes called {{to extend a}} strike {{beyond the bounds of}} an Australian state to make it eligible for handling by the Federal Arbitration Court.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> were outlawed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Union Act of 1927 in the {{aftermath}} of the general strike. That was repealed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1946, passed by the postwar Labour Government.|$|R
25|$|Several major strikes {{occupied}} the union {{in its first}} three years. In November 1903, Teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other Teamster locals, but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathy-strike issue. A <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> in support of 18,000 striking meat cutters in Chicago in July 1904 led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led Shea to force his members back to work (leading {{to the collapse of}} the meat cutters' strike). In the midst of the strife in 1904, the Teamsters convention in Cincinnati, Ohio re-elected Shea by acclamation on August 8, 1904. Under his leadership, the union had expanded to nearly 50,000 members in 821 locals in 300 cities, making the Teamsters one of the largest unions in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominance}} of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement. The first major <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed by CPR police while picketing at the docks, becoming the movement's first martyr in British Columbia. The rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to Canada's first general strike in 1918, at the Cumberland coal mines on Vancouver Island. Following a lull in the 1920s, the strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province. After two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting, the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances {{to the federal government}} and embarked on the On-to-Ottawa Trek, but their protest was put down by force. The workers were arrested near Mission and interned in work camps {{for the duration of the}} Depression.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1902, Brass Molder's Union Local 83 struck Stromberg-Carlson and Western Electric, {{seeking to}} win the closed shop in {{collective}} bargaining negotiations. The employers locked out the workers and brought in strikebreakers. Union members began attacking the strikebreakers. [...] On May 7, 1903, the union struck the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company. Kellogg Switchboard, too, locked out 90 percent of its workforce and hired strikebreakers. The Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago began a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> on June 24, 1903. [...] The three employers sought injunctions against the <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike,</b> which they won on July 20, 1903. The Brass Molders' strike collapsed soon afterward.|$|E
5000|$|Workers may strike only in {{relation}} to bargaining for a new collective agreement (section 86) or [...] "on grounds of health and safety"(section 84). Workers must wait for the old collective agreement to expire before they go on strike. As collective bargaining can only be undertaken by a union, only union members can go on strike. One person cannot go on strike, only a [...] "number of employees" [...] can do so (section 81). <b>Sympathy</b> <b>strikes,</b> Strikes for political purposes, such as human rights in other countries, and General Strikes are all unlawful.|$|R
50|$|In December 1904, {{a strike}} {{occurred}} at the Putilov plant (a railway and artillery supplier) in St. Petersburg. <b>Sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> {{in other parts of}} the city raised the number of strikers to 150,000 workers in 382 factories. By , the city had no electricity and newspaper distribution was halted. All public areas were declared closed.|$|R
50|$|Unions bitterly {{resented the}} injunction; a few <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> shut down some railroads completely. The strike {{eventually}} died out as many shopmen made {{deals with the}} railroads on the local level. The often unpalatable concessions—coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike—soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for years.|$|R
2500|$|Gould and his {{railroad}} executives {{continued to}} resist meeting any strike demands. [...] On April 3, a Tarrant County deputy named Richard Townsend {{was shot and}} killed in a confrontation between officers and a mob of about 500 in Ft. Worth, Texas. [...] Two other deputies were also wounded. [...] On April 9, in East St. Louis, Illinois, where about eighty switchmen had gone out on a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, violence broke out when a crowd of strikers met with eight deputies guarding a freight train. [...] The guards shot into the threatening crowd, killing six bystanders [...] and narrowly avoiding shooting Mayor Maurice Joyce. [...] The mob answered by setting the rail yards on fire.|$|E
2500|$|The EA {{took its}} first {{active role in}} a labor dispute during the 1902-03 {{telephone}} equipment strike. [...] The Teamsters and team owners had formed a body known as the Chicago Board of Arbitration (CBA) in early 1903. Ostensibly, the CBA was established to mediate disputes between drivers and their employers. But the CBA quickly asserted jurisdiction over all labor disputes in the city. [...] The Teamsters could force employers to the table by striking, where the team owners would win decisions which enabled them to profit {{at the expense of}} other business owners. [...] When the CBA attempted to intervene in the telephone equipment strike, the EA retaliated. [...] The EA threw its entire support behind Kellogg Switchboard, which subsequently refused to bargain with the union. The EA also supplied funds and legal expertise which enabled Kellogg Switchboard to win a court injunction forcing the Teamsters to end their <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike.</b> [...] These actions helped break the strike.|$|E
2500|$|The tide {{suddenly}} {{turned in the}} dockers' favour when carters on the railway company quays refused to transport goods unloaded from the ships by the Dublin blackleg dockers. On 4 July after submitting a general pay claim, Larkin called the thousand remaining carters of Belfast, who were employed by the 60 firms of the Master Carriers Association, out on a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike.</b> Gallaher and the other employers had no means of getting their merchandise out of the port. The Belfast Newsletter commented on the situation with the following words: [...] "It was remarkable to see the stagnation which existed from the Custom House to the Clarendon Dock. With the exception of an isolated van or lorry driven by the obvious amateur, there was scarcely a sign of life or movement". Soon afterwards engineers and boilermakers were striking; workplaces {{all over the city}} stopped production and shut down. The strike escalated into bitter violence when shipyard workers burnt company vans, hurled rocks at the police and attacked blacklegs with [...] "shipyard confetti" [...] which consisted of rivets, nuts and bolts. Blackleg workers had to be billeted aboard a ship in the Belfast Lough for their own safety.|$|E
2500|$|But Shea {{was not an}} {{advocate}} of <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes,</b> not even when they meant one unit of Teamsters would be supporting another unit of Teamsters. In November 1903, Teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> by other Teamster locals in the city but failed. However, three Teamster locals in the city—the truck, ice wagon, and coal wagon drivers, which together represented about half the Teamster membership in Chicago—refused to violate their contracts and walk off the job. The three locals went even further, and disaffiliated from the Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago. Furious, Shea called them [...] "cowards and traitors". [...] His outburst only angered his opponents in the union. In mid-December, Shea was confronted in his office by Teamster leader who shot at him four times and forced him to dance a jig before fleeing.|$|R
50|$|There was {{widespread}} {{opposition to the}} injunction, {{and a number of}} <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> shut down some railroads completely, but the strike eventually died out, as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on the local level. The often-unpalatable concessions, coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike, soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for quite some time.|$|R
25|$|Friction {{with the}} AFL {{continued}} as well. Spencer was elected an AFL {{vice president in}} 1904, which significantly lessened the AFL's suspicions regarding the SBTA. In March 1905, the AFL assisted the SBTA in a conflict with contractors in New York City. But local SBTA and AFL building trades councils continued to fight with one another, and repeated jurisdictional battles and calls for <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> weakened SBTA local alliances.|$|R
2500|$|On July 12, 1904, 18,000 {{members of}} the Amalgamated Meat Cutters working in the meatpacking {{industry}} in Chicago walked off the job to win higher wages. The contract for the packinghouse drivers belonging to the Teamsters union had expired on June 1, 1904, and the ongoing strike by the butcher workmen led the drivers to fear for their own contract talks. On July 25, 1904, the packinghouse drivers asked the international Teamsters union to sanction a strike. On July 26, Shea agreed to let them walk out the next day, declaring that the walkout was not a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> but [...] "It is, therefore, to protect ourselves" [...] and prevent the packers from breaking the union. The meatpackers, however, brought in several thousand African American strikebreakers. With meatpacking plants operating at about 40 percent of capacity, the strike began to falter. On August 8, Shea ordered the ice wagon and market drivers to strike {{in support of the}} butcher workmen. The hope was that, with no refrigeration and delivery slowed, the meat would spoil and the packers would be forced to come to the bargaining table. On the afternoon of August 9, riots occurred throughout the afternoon and evening in Chicago, and a number of strikers and strikebreakers were assaulted or wounded by gunfire.|$|E
2500|$|The EA's biggest anti-union push came in 1905. [...] On December 15, 1904, 19 {{clothing}} cutters at Montgomery Ward went {{on strike}} to protest the company's use of nonunion subcontractors. [...] The Montgomery Ward quickly locked them out. [...] Sympathy strikes by several tailors' unions broke out, as did sympathy strikes by other unions. [...] By April, 5,000 workers were on the picket line. [...] The Teamsters engaged in a <b>sympathy</b> <b>strike</b> on April 6, 1905, adding another 10,000 members to the strike. [...] The EA collected $250,000 (about $6.2 million in 2007 dollars) from its members to hire strikebreakers. [...] The EA also raised $1 million (about $25 million in 2007 dollars) to establish the Employers' Teaming Association-a new company which, {{within a matter of}} weeks, bought out a large number of team owners and imported hundreds of African American strikebreakers from St. Louis to drive the wagons. Mark Morton, president of Morton Salt and an EA member, convinced the railroads to pressure the remaining team owners to lock out their Teamster members as well. The Teamsters upped the ante, and another 25,000 members walked off the job on April 25, 1905, paralyzing grocery stores, warehouses, railway shippers, department stores and coal companies. The EA and its members sued nearly every union as well. [...] Local and state courts issued numerous injunctions against the unions, ordering them to stop picketing and return to work. [...] When a wagon owner refused to do business with Montgomery Ward for fear that the Teamsters would picket him, a court forced the team owner to do business with the retailer. [...] Few courts were impartial in their administration of justice. One judge seated a grand jury whose foreman was A. A. McCormick, the reactionary publisher of the Chicago Evening Post.|$|E

5000|$|Even as {{jurisdictional}} battles increased, local building trades councils {{had formed}} in most major cities by 1897. A [...] "Board of Walking Delegates" [...] {{was formed in}} New York City in 1884, and the Chicago Building Trades Council—the first true local building trades organization—formed in 1890. These local building trades councils not only enforced jurisdictional rules by calling <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes,</b> but also built support for unions when they went on strike.|$|R
2500|$|On September 1, {{a federal}} judge issued the {{sweeping}} [...] "Daugherty Injunction" [...] against striking, assembling, and picketing. Unions bitterly resented the injunction; a few <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes</b> shut down some railroads completely. The strike eventually died out as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on the local level. The often unpalatable concessions—coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike—soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for years.|$|R
50|$|With {{the garment}} workers' strike all but forgotten, the tailors' union {{asked that the}} other unions end their <b>sympathy</b> <b>strikes.</b> The Teamsters, the {{critical}} union in the strike, agreed to do so if the employers would agree to rehire all striking workers. But on April 23, Montgomery Ward declared it would defer to {{the decision of the}} Employers' Association, and the EA announced a day later that no striking workers should be rehired.|$|R
