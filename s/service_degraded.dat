40|$|The {{emergence}} of new network applications is driving network operators to not only fulfill dynamic bandwidth requirements, but offer various grades of <b>service.</b> <b>Degraded</b> provisioning provides an effective solution to flexibly allocate resources in various dimensions to reduce blocking for differentiated demands when network congestion occurs. In this work, we investigate the novel problem of online degraded provisioning in service-differentiated multi-layer networks with optical elasticity. Quality of Service (QoS) is assured by service-holding-time prolongation and immediate access {{as soon as the}} service arrives without set-up delay. We decompose the problem into degraded routing and degraded resource allocation stages, and design polynomial-time algorithms with the enhanced multi-layer architecture to increase the network flexibility in temporal and spectral dimensions. Illustrative results verify that we can achieve significant reduction of network service failures, especially for requests with higher priorities. The results also indicate that degradation in optical layer can increase the network capacity, while the degradation in electric layer provides flexible time-bandwidth exchange.

40|$|A ring-model of vicious cycles in customer-employee-interaction is proposed: Service {{employees}} perceive complaints as {{a threat}} to their self-esteem resulting in defense responses such as an increased need for cognitive closure, a devaluation of the customer and their information and <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> behavior. Confronted with such <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> behavior, customers react defensively as well, by devaluing the employee for example with regard to his/her competence and by reducing repurchase and positive word-of-mouth. Three studies investigated each link in this ring-model. In study 1, participants were confronted with an aggressive or neutral customer complaint. Results show that motivated closed-mindedness (one aspect of the need for cognitive closure) increases after an aggressive complaint leading to a devaluation of the customer and their information, and in turn to a <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> reaction. In study 2, participants were confronted with a <b>degrading</b> or favorable <b>service</b> reaction. Results show that they devaluate the employees’ competence after receiving a <b>degrading</b> <b>service</b> reaction and thus reduce their intention to repurchase.

40|$|Abstract. Buffer {{overflow}} {{has become}} a major source of network security vul-nerability. Traditional schemes for detecting buffer overflow attacks usually terminate the attacked <b>service,</b> <b>degrading</b> the <b>service</b> availability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight buffer overflow protection mechanism that allows continued network service. The proposed mechanism allows a service program to reconfigure itself to identify and protect the vulnerable functions upon buffer overflow attacks. Protecting only the vulnerable functions, instead of the whole program, keeps the runtime overhead small. Moreover, the mechanism adopts the idea of failure-oblivious computing to allow service programs to execute through memory errors caused by the attacks once the vulnerable functions have been identified, eliminating the need of restarting the service program upon further attacks to the vulnerable functions. We have applied the mecha-nism on five Internet servers. The experiment results show that the mechanism has little impact on the runtime performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Wireless access {{networks}} scale by replicating base stations geographically and then allowing mobile clients to seamlessly “hand off ” from one station {{to the next}} as they traverse the network. However, providing the illusion of continuous connectivity requires selecting {{the right moment to}} handoff and the right base station to transfer to. Unfortunately, 802. 11 -based networks only attempt a handoff when a client’s <b>service</b> <b>degrades</b> to a point where connectivity is threatened. Worse, the overhead of scanning for nearby base stations is routinely over 250 ms – during which incoming packets are dropped – far longer than what can be tolerated by highly interactive applications such as voice telephony. In this paper we describe SyncScan, a low-cost technique for continuously tracking nearby base stations by synchronizing short listening periods at the client with periodic transmissions from each base station. We have implemented this SyncScan algorithm using commodity 802. 11 hardware and we demonstrate that it allows better handoff decisions and over an order of magnitude improvement in handoff delay. Finally, our approach only requires trivial implementation changes, is incrementally deployable and is completely backward compatible with existing 802. 11 standards...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Web Service orchestrations are {{compositions}} {{of different}} Web Services {{to form a}} new service. The services called during the orchestration guarantee a given Quality of Service (QoS) to the orchestrator, usually in the form of contracts. These contracts can then be used by the orchestrator to deduce the contract it can offer to its own clients, by performing contract composition. An implicit monotonicity assumption in contract based QoS management is: “the better the component services perform, the better the orchestration’s performance will be”. In some orchestrations, however, monotonicity can be violated, i. e., the performance of the orchestration improves when the performance of a component <b>service</b> <b>degrades.</b> This is highly undesirable since it can render the process of contract composition inconsistent. In this paper we formally define monotonicity for orchestrations modelled by Colored Occurrence Nets (CO-nets) and we characterize the classes of monotonic orchestrations. Contracts can be formulated as hard, possibly nondeterministic, guarantees, or alternatively as probabilistic guarantees. Our work covers both cases. We show that few orchestrations are indeed monotonic, mostly because of complex interactions between control, data, and timing. We also provide user guidelines to get rid of non-monotonicity when designing orchestrations. ...|$|R

40|$|Energy is {{increasingly}} a first-order concern in computer systems. Exploiting energy-accuracy trade-offs {{is an attractive}} choice in applications that can tolerate inaccuracies. Recent work has explored exposing this trade-off in programming models. A key challenge, though, is how to isolate parts of the program that must be precise from those that can be approximated so that a program functions correctly even as quality of <b>service</b> <b>degrades.</b> We propose using type qualifiers to declare data that {{may be subject to}} approximate computation. Using these types, the system automatically maps approximate variables to low-power storage, uses low-power operations, and even applies more energy-efficient algorithms provided by the programmer. In addition, the system can statically guarantee isolation of the precise program component from the approximate component. This allows a programmer to control explicitly how information flows from approximate data to precise data. Importantly, employing static analysis eliminates the need for dynamic checks, further improving energy savings. As a proof of concept, we develop EnerJ, an extension to Java that adds approximate data types. We also propose a hardware architecture that offers explicit approximate storage and computation. We port several applications to EnerJ and show that our extensions are expressive and effective; a small number of annotations lead to significant potential energy savings (10 %– 50 %) at very little accuracy cost...|$|R
