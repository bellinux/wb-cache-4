25|$|In many locations, PV {{has reached}} grid parity, {{which is usually}} defined as PV {{production}} costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). However, in many countries {{there is still a}} need for more access to capital to develop PV projects. To solve this problem securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects.

25|$|Solar {{power in}} Israel and the Israeli solar energy {{industry}} {{has a history}} that dates to {{the founding of the}} country. In the 1950s, Levi Yissar developed a solar water heater to help assuage an energy shortage in the new country. By 1967 around one in twenty households heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. With the 1970s oil crisis, Harry Zvi Tabor, the father of Israel's <b>solar</b> <b>industry,</b> developed the prototype solar water heater that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes.

25|$|Pennsylvania {{is ranked}} 19th {{in the nation}} in the {{production}} of renewable, notably solar, energy. The Lehigh Valley boasts one of the largest solar panel installations in Pennsylvania and is a leading producer of solar and other renewable energy in the region. As an example, Air Products & Chemicals, in Trexlertown, installed and maintains a 15-acre solar farm which generates more than half the required electricity for their corporate headquarters, saving an estimated $250,000 per year in utility costs. The comparatively large <b>solar</b> <b>industry</b> in the Lehigh Valley is due mostly to a combination of federal, state and local incentive programs which make using renewable energy sources more cost effective than in years past.|$|E
25|$|Granholm {{delivered}} her sixth State of the State {{address on}} January 29, 2008. The speech focused mainly on creating jobs in Michigan through bringing alternative energy companies to Michigan. Through passing a renewable portfolio standard, {{which would require}} that 10percent of Michigan's energy would come from renewable sources by 2015 and 25percent by 2025, Granholm expected the alternative energy industry to emerge in Michigan. Since {{the passage of the}} standard, Mariah Power, Global Wind Systems, Cascade Swift Turbine, Great Lakes Turbine, and 38 other companies have announced new projects in Michigan. The solar and wind power industries now provide over 10,000 jobs in Michigan. As a result of Granholm's efforts, Michigan is now fourth in the nation in the number of jobs in the <b>solar</b> <b>industry</b> and first in the nation for clean energy patents.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power in}} the United States {{includes}} utility-scale solar power plants {{as well as local}} distributed generation, mostly from rooftop photovoltaics. As of the end of 2016, the U.S. had 40 gigawatts (GW) of installed photovoltaic capacity, having almost doubled in capacity from the previous year. In the twelve months through August 2017, utility scale solar power generated 49.0 terawatt-hours (TWh), 1.22% of total U.S. electricity. During the same time period total solar generation, including estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation, was 72.1 TWh, 1.80% of total U.S. electricity. In terms of total installed capacity, by year end 2015 the U.S. ranked 4th in the world behind China, Germany, and Japan. In 2016, 39% of all new electricity generation capacity in the country came from solar, more than any other source and ahead of natural gas (29%). By 2015, solar employment had overtaken oil and gas as well as coal employment in the U.S. In 2016, more than 260,000 Americans were employed in the <b>solar</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} currently facing mankind is tackling the challenge of climate change. To mitigate this, there have been several multilateral conferences, where some steps have been taken. The Copenhagen Summit in 2009 was one such conference, where the expectations before the conference were significant. Unfortunately, the conference was later described to be a failure. This paper uses an event-study methodology to analyse the effect of this unexpected event. Portfolios of companies in the coal and <b>solar</b> <b>industries,</b> listed in the United States of America and China, are used. The results show that the conference did not have any discernible effect on the coal and <b>solar</b> <b>industries</b> in either of the analysed markets. A significant effect was found for Chinese Solar, but the economic reasoning behind this change is unsatisfactory. There were many events that together thwarted the ability of the conference to get to an agreement. Any one event during or before the conference is not likely to have been the direct cause of the observed outcome. The inability of this study to unambiguously find evidence of the coal and <b>solar</b> <b>industries</b> being affected by the outcome of the conference can perhaps be explained by climate change being a natural part of everyday life today. The efforts of top-level politicians might not have a direct impact on the day-to-day valuation of industries...|$|R
