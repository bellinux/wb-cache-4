The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production.

40|$|Abstract Introduction About 20 % of {{the cases}} of human <b>severe</b> {{combined}} <b>immunodeficiency</b> {{are the result of}} the child being homozygous for defective genes encoding the enzyme adenosine deaminase. To our knowledge, the mutation pattern in Arab patients with <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> has never been reported previously. Case presentation A 14 -month-old Arab boy had clinical features typical of <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency.</b> His clinical picture and flow cytometric analysis raised the diagnosis of adenosine deaminase deficiency and prompted us to screen the adenosine deaminase gene for mutation(s). We detected a novel mutation in exon 9 of the adenosine deaminase gene (p. Arg 282 >Gln), which we believe is the cause of the <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> phenotype observed in our patient. Conclusion This is the first report of adenosine deaminase mutation in an Arab patient with <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> due to a novel pathogenic mutation in the adenosine deaminase gene. </p...|$|R
40|$|We report two {{patients}} with <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> and short stature/short limb skeletal dysplasia. Case 1 presented at birth with rhizomelic shortening of the extremities and bowing of the femora. She developed clinical signs of <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> at 13 months and died at 21 months. Case 2 had severe prenatal shortening and bowing of the extremities and a small, malformed chest. Symptoms of <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> and <b>severe</b> {{failure to thrive}} developed soon after birth and she died at 5 months. The diagnosis of <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> in our patients was based on their clinical course and necropsy findings, supported in case 1 {{by the results of}} immune function tests. The results of investigation of immune function (immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subpopulations, lymphocyte function) are very variable in this syndrome as in other variants of <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency.</b> Bone histopathology in both patients showed grossly irregular costochondral junctions, but normal transition of proliferating to hypertrophic chondrocytes. These cases belong to early lethal type 1 short limb skeletal dysplasia with <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency.</b> Review of previously published cases with <b>severe</b> combined <b>immunodeficiency</b> and well documented skeletal findings show eight patients with prenatal onset of bowing and shortening of the extremities and metaphyseal abnormalities. These include two sib pairs concordant for the skeletal changes. In these cases, adenosine deaminase levels were not reported. An additional four published cases with associated adenosine deaminase deficiency had only mild metaphyseal abnormalities, but subsequently showed no linear growth.

The lack of RFX binding activity in complementation group C results from mutations in the RFX5 gene encoding the 75-kD subunit of RFX (Steimle et al., 1995). RFX5 is the fifth member of the growing family of DNA-binding proteins sharing a novel and highly characteristic DNA-binding domain called the RFX motif.

The enzyme responsible for this activity is biochemically homologous with the high-molecular-weight tissue isoenzyme of adenosine deaminase found in normal fibroblasts and tissues other than erythrocytes. The residual adenosine deaminase has an altered electrophoretic mobility, increased heat stability as compared to normals, and can be detected in fibroblasts of obligate heterozygotes.
