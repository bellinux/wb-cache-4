He retained the position as superintendent until 1896, after the 1895 consolidation. That the library was considered <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> local institution was demonstrated in 1878 when the United States Sanitary Commission, having completed its task, donated its archives to the library for safe keeping. The archives consisted of all its correspondence, reports, account books, hospital directories, printed reports, histories, maps and charts, claims of some 51,000 soldiers and sailors investigated by it, miscellaneous papers, etc. The library promised {{that they would be}} preserved and accessible to the public.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people have}} pointed out more or less {{significant}} areas where Lewis' Outline is {{not consistent with the}} text of The Chronicles. Paul Ford, author of Companion to Narnia, points out that the text of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe states that Lucy and Edmund are one year apart in age, the years given in the timeline for their births, 1930 and 1932 respectively, would put their ages at <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year. Devin Brown, author of Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan's appearances in Narnia with other characters' recollection of those appearances.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{ultimate}} objectives behind {{the making of}} the film, Morgan said he was not trying to blame just a single company nor the fast fashion industry as [...] "it did not invent a very irresponsible way of manufacturing, it did not invent overmarketing the consumption of things." [...] The director said the film was intended to be a caution on the [...] "incessant consumption of mediocre stuff" [...] and an incentive to view shopping as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hobby, adding that buying is [...] "a moral act and there is a chain reaction of consequences". He commented he was not trying to be [...] "anti-business or anti-market" [...] but was just reaffirming basic human rights and showing the limits of natural resources.|$|E

500|$|The PC {{version of}} Incoming was {{generally}} well-received. British magazine PC Zone {{described it as}} [...] "bloody good," [...] with [...] "some modest simulation elements." [...] The magazine praised {{the setting of the}} game, commenting: [...] "a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay." [...] The review concluded by saying that [...] "it's as fun as it looks. Just for once, all those people who don't read reviews and buy games purely on the strength of pretty pictures on the packaging are gonna find themselves playing a very, very enjoyable game." [...] Edge highlighted the game's efficient gameplay mechanics, stating that designers [...] "managed to produce <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> lightshow, taking care to fine-tune a design that, if not exactly original, at least does its thing with flair and solid understanding of gameplay." ...|$|E
500|$|For this reason, Caramanica {{considers}} Illmatic to be [...] "unusually {{significant to}} the intellectual {{development of the}} [...] genre" [...] yet he also remains critical of the divisiveness spawned by its [...] "zealots."

[...] Commenting on these polarized debates, Jeff Weiss suggests that Illmatic is [...] "best heard by ignoring the dogma, culture wars, Nas clones, and would-be saviors that have accreted since April of 1994. Who cares whether it's the greatest rap album of all-time or not? It's an example of how great rap can be, but not necessarily the way it should be."' ...|$|E
500|$|At the time, teams rarely {{employed}} {{tactics of}} any sort – Chapman would later remark: [...] "No {{attempt was made to}} organise victory. The most that I remember was the occasional chat between, say two men playing on the same wing." [...] As a manager, he sought to change that; after seeing Northampton lose to Norwich City despite dominating, Chapman opined that [...] "a team can attack for too long". He thus set about creating a tactical framework for all his players; he dropped the half backs (midfield) back to give his forwards more space and draw the opposition defenders out of the penalty area, while encouraging his own back line to pass their way out of trouble. Gradually, he created a style of highly-organised, counter-attacking football, which was at odds with the prevailing orthodoxy but nevertheless highly effective; Swindon Town's England international Harold Fleming, after losing 4–1 at home to Northampton, remarked to Chapman: [...] "You have <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> team: you have a machine." ...|$|E

500|$|Setting {{the opera}} in Japan, an exotic locale {{far away from}} Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British {{politics}} and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, [...] "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution." [...] G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: [...] "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt {{if there is a}} single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> satire; he is the truth."

500|$|Davies {{found himself}} again {{at odds with}} his party, {{over the issue of}} Welsh self-government. He had championed this cause for many years, to the {{annoyance}} of Labour's Welsh Regional Council. In May 1954 he offered proposals for a Welsh parliament that were rejected by the Regional Council and by the South Wales Area conference of the NUM. Davies persevered, and on 4 March 1955 introduced in the House of Commons a private member's bill proposing self-government for Wales {{on the basis of the}} aborted 1914 act that would have granted home rule to Ireland. Davies claimed to have received thousands of messages of support for his measure, from all parts of Wales, but in the House he could only muster 14 votes in favour. Undeterred, he told MPs: [...] "There is a movement in Wales, an uprising, as it were, that will not only support the bill but will continue to insist upon it until Wales is represented in the United Kingdom as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mere region." ...|$|E
500|$|Structurally, Devotions {{consists}} of 23 chronologically ordered sections – representing the length, in days, of Donne's illness. Each one contains a 'meditation', {{in which he}} describes a stage of his illness, an 'expostulation' containing his reaction to that stage, and finally a prayer in which he makes peace with the disease. In the five editions published during the 17th century, the book opens with a Latin preface, titled [...] "Stationes, sive Periodi in Morbo, ad quas referuntur Meditationes sequentes". Also 23 sections long, each line of the preface is followed by what purports to be an English translation of the Latin. Joan Webber argues that these lines constitute a poem, in dactylic hexameter; David Novarr disputes this, arguing that Stationes [...] "has none of Donne's customary wit, drama, and imagination". Instead, it represents the Stations of the Cross, or supplicatio stativa. Mary Arshagouni, writing in Modern Philology, argues that the stationes indeed constitute a poem – or, at least, <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mere table of contents. The Latin lines play-off the English translations, and contain nuanced meaning {{not found in the}} English that better represents the sections to which they refer.|$|E

500|$|Flower {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Alice Liang of 1UP.com applauded the game, saying that [...] "the {{freedom of movement}} makes the game feel as relaxing as a gently wafting breeze". She felt that [...] "fun" [...] did not fully describe the game experience, saying {{that it had a}} [...] "well-constructed movie's emotional arc" [...] and that the game's music, visuals, and gameplay all drew the player into a compelling emotional experience. She also felt that it was very replayable, which offset its brevity. Ryan Clements of IGN agreed with Liang's opinion, saying that it provided [...] "more enjoyment, emotion and enlightenment than any game" [...] he had played in years. Though he noted that the game would not appeal to everyone, he described it as [...] "something very unique and very powerful", referring to it as a [...] "must-play". Michael Kontoudis of PALGN called it an [...] "utterly unique, brave and moving game brimming with personality and intent", though he noted that as it was closer to a work of art than a game, many players would not be interested in it. Gerard Campbell of The Press similarly described it as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> game, calling it a [...] "perfect foil" [...] to [...] "ultra-violent shoot-'em-up" [...] games and summarizing it as [...] "one of the most refreshing and relaxing games around".|$|E
500|$|The cover art for [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was previewed on April 20, 2011. On the cover, Beyoncé {{strikes a}} bold pose while {{standing}} in sand.

The Los Angeles Times wrote that the photograph points to a [...] "...post-apocalyptic war zone, donning an elaborate gold headdress and holding a red flag emblazoned with a black 'B'." [...] The photograph was taken on April 14, 2011. Tray Hova of Vibe magazine complimented the cover art of the single, stating that Beyoncé looks [...] "resplendent as hell" [...] on the cover and that [...] "Nobody's complaining about Bey season here." [...] Eleanor Young, in Marie Claire, described the cover art as [...] "hideous". Ray Rogers of Billboard stated that Beyoncé [...] "clearly transmits her trademark message of female empowerment". Becky Bain of Idolator described the cover as [...] "pretty disappointing", and that, with a [...] "ballistic, over-the-top club banger" [...] song like [...] "Run the World (Girls)", she expected <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> body shot of Beyoncé, and criticized the cover for being confusing regarding {{the location of the}} photography.

500|$|Javier Bardem {{was cast}} as the film's {{principal}} villain, Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist who is seeking revenge against those he holds responsible for betraying him. Bardem described Silva as [...] "more than a villain", while Craig stated that Bond has a [...] "very important relationship" [...] to Silva. In casting the role, director Sam Mendes admitted that he lobbied hard for Bardem to accept the part. Mendes saw {{the potential for the}} character to be recognised {{as one of the most}} memorable characters in the series and wanted to create [...] "something [...] may consider to have been absent from the Bond movies for a long time". He felt that Bardem was one of the few actors up to the task of becoming [...] "colourless" [...] and existing within the world of the film as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> function of the plot. In preparing for the role, Bardem had the script translated into his native Spanish to better understand his character, which Mendes cited as being a sign of the actor's commitment to the film. Bardem dyed his hair blond for the role after brainstorming ideas with Mendes to come up with a distinct visual look for the character, which led some commentators to observe a similarity between the character and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Bérénice Marlohe was cast as Séverine, a character who had been saved from the Macau sex trade by Silva and now works as his representative. Marlohe described her character as being [...] "glamorous and enigmatic", and that she drew inspiration from GoldenEye villain Xenia Onatopp (played by Famke Janssen) in playing Séverine.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'Orison' rises above {{its origins in}} the depressing, hackneyed genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone X-Files stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode [...] "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is , and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] " [...] was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It {{was also one of}} the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." [...] Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that [...] "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she did right, but it certainly wasn't a difficult thing to understand." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B" [...] and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a [...] "potentially fascinating figure" [...] who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it [...] "helps transform the episode’s climax into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series Millennium.|$|E
