500|$|Only {{after one}} year with Arrows, Hill came close to signing a deal with Alain Prost's team, before {{deciding}} to instead <b>signup</b> with the Jordan team for the 1998 season. His new teammate was Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of Michael. In {{the first half of}} the season, the Jordan 198 car was off the pace and unreliable until improvements in performance from the Canadian Grand Prix. During that race, Hill moved up to second place as others retired or pitted for fuel. On lap 38, Michael Schumacher, who was delayed by a stop-and-go penalty after forcing Frentzen's Williams off the track, caught Hill on the home straight; Hill moved across the track three times to block Schumacher, who took the place after missing his braking point and running over kerbs at the last chicane. Hill then ran fourth after his only pit stop before retiring due to an electrical failure. After the race, Schumacher accused Hill of dangerous driving. Hill responded by stating that Schumacher [...] "cannot claim anyone drives badly when you look at the things he's been up to in his career. He took Frentzen out completely." [...] At the German Grand Prix, Hill scored his first point of the year and at the Belgian Grand Prix, in very wet conditions, he took the Jordan team's first ever win. At that race, Hill was leading late in the race, with teammate Schumacher closing rapidly, when he suggested that team principal Eddie Jordan order Ralf Schumacher to hold position instead of risking losing a 1–2 finish. Jordan followed the suggestion, ordering Schumacher not to overtake. In all, only eight drivers finished the race. The victory was his first since being dropped by the Williams team, which won no races that season. Hill finished the year with a last lap move on Frentzen at the Japanese Grand Prix, which earned him fourth place in the race and Jordan fourth position in that year's constructors' championship.|$|E

According to Time magazine, this fee keeps the site [...] "remarkably free of trolls, griefers and other anonymous jerks", resulting in a [...] "public-spirited flavor {{of a small town}} or good university". Although the number of registrations has topped 100,000, a design flaw in the counting process means that it counts users who abandoned the <b>signup</b> process mid way; the actual number of posters is smaller, at around 38,700 as of October 2008.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{study the}} effects of word-of-mouth (WOM) {{marketing}} on member growth at an Internet social networking site. Because such sites track the electronic invitations sent out by existing members, outbound WOM may be precisely tallied daily and then linked to the number of new members joining the site (<b>signups).</b> To handle the potential endogeneity among WOM, new <b>signups,</b> and traditional marketing activity, the authors use a Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling approach to quantify the short- and long-term effects of WOM referrals. First, Granger causality tests demonstrate the endogeneity among <b>signups</b> and WOM referrals. Second, word-of-mouth referrals have substantially longer carryover effects than traditional marketing actions. Specifically, the long-run elasticity of <b>signups</b> to WOM is estimated at close to 0. 5 – about 2. 5 times larger than the average advertising elasticities reported in the literature. The authors also report that the estimated WOM effect is about 20 times higher than the elasticity for marketing events, and 30 times larger than that of media appearances. Using the estimated Internet display advertising revenue produced by impressions served to a new member, the monetary value of a WOM referral is calculated, yielding an upper bound estimate for the financial incentives th...|$|R
