50|$|The Snake River is 91.0 mi {{long and}} with its tributaries drains a 1324 sq mi area. It flows for its entire length on the old lake bed of glacial Lake Agassiz, mostly in western Marshall County but also through {{a small portion of}} northwestern Polk County. After {{initially}} flowing southwestwardly from its headwaters, the <b>Snake</b> <b>turns</b> westward and collects a short tributary, the South Branch Snake River, and passes the towns of Warren and Alvarado. Downstream of Alvarado, the <b>Snake</b> <b>turns</b> north-northwestward, paralleling the Red River in the Red River Valley. Much of the river's course through the valley has been straightened and channelized. It collects the Middle River upstream of its confluence with the Red in Fork Township.|$|R
5000|$|A man-eating giant, [...] "!esengego" [...] (and his family) {{was killed}} by a benevolent <b>snake.</b> The <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> out to be the remedy applied by Ishoko to {{liberate}} people. Ishoko changed the corpses of the giant family into leopards. He prohibited them to attack people, except for the case they would be provoked or wounded by an arrow.|$|R
50|$|In anger, Evil <b>Snake</b> <b>turns</b> Bubbles' {{grandmother}} into {{a bubble}} {{in a fierce}} fight. Angry, Bubbles searches for the real dragon to revive his grandmother, and avenge her death by finding the five dragon scales left by the Dragon in order to beat Evil Snake. Along the way, he meets new friends, including the imposing Aku, the sassy Mei Mei, and the timid Erl, while Evil Snake and his henchmen relentlessly pursue Bubbles.|$|R
60|$|The great, wide-gaping jaws of the <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> and hovered above him. The elastic maw, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} a rabbit or a horned buck with equal facility, yawned for him; but Histah, in turning his attention upon the ape-man, brought his head {{within reach of}} Tarzan's blade. Instantly a brown hand leaped forth and seized the mottled neck, and another drove the heavy hunting knife to the hilt into the little brain.|$|R
5000|$|Kilve Pill, {{where the}} stream from Holford {{runs into the}} sea, was once a tiny port, used for {{importing}} culm, an inferior type of coal which {{was used in the}} limeburning process. It was also the site for [...] "glatting" [...] which was the hunting of conger eels by dogs. On the shore a Saint Keyne serpent can be seen, which a local legend says is a <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> to stone, but is in reality an ammonite.|$|R
25|$|The seventh Horcrux was Nagini, {{the snake}} Voldemort {{had with him}} constantly. This Horcrux was created by Voldemort when he was hiding in the forests of Albania; the murder victim whom he used for its {{creation}} was Bertha Jorkins. He found Nagini, and becoming smitten by the <b>snake,</b> <b>turned</b> it into a Horcrux, being connected with it. In the last chapter of Deathly Hallows, Nagini was killed by Neville Longbottom using the sword of Godric Gryffindor. The destruction of the last remaining Horcrux made Voldemort mortal.|$|R
50|$|The {{aesthetic}} and religious {{significance of the}} various colors remains a source of controversy and speculation. The bright green varieties may have been identified with the young Maize God. The Olmec were fascinated with the unique blue jade of Guatemala and it {{played an important role}} in their rituals involving water sources. The Olmec used blue jade because it represented water, an Olmec iconography representing the Underworld. Blue also represented the blue color that <b>snakes</b> <b>turn</b> before shedding their skin; therefore, blue represents aquatic and serpentine rejuvenation.|$|R

40|$|Why, in Ovid's account, is Orpheus' severed head {{attacked}} by a snake as it lies on the beach, {{and why is that}} <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> to stone? I argue that this incident, instead of deriving from a lost episode in the Thracian bard's mythic cycle, is invented by Ovid as a rearrangement of elements from the Medusa myth told earlier in the poem. Both heads retain supernatural powers after death, and in Ovid each one provides a coda to a longer story by causing a petrifaction while deposited on a sandy beach...|$|R
6000|$|... § 17. One {{of these}} landscapes is thus {{described}} by Macaulay: [...] "We have an exact square, enclosed by the rivers Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates, {{each with a}} convenient bridge in the centre; rectangular beds of flowers; a long canal neatly bricked and railed in; the tree of knowledge, clipped {{like one of the}} limes behind the Tuileries, standing in the centre of the grand alley; the <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> round it, the man on the right hand, the woman on the left, and the beasts drawn up in an exact circle round them." ...|$|R
50|$|Only Dirawong was {{powerful}} {{enough to deal with}} Rainbow Snake. Dirawong chased Rainbow Snake from inland eastward towards the coast and as they went they formed parts of the Richmond River. At Maniworkan (or the town of Woodburn, New South Wales, Australia) they left the Richmond River and kept on going east. Halfway down the Evans River, Dirawong caught Rainbow <b>Snake,</b> the <b>Snake</b> <b>turned</b> around and bit Goanna on the head, Dirawong then withdrew from the battle in order to eat some herbs to recover (heal) from the snakebite, when he felt better from the snakebite he resumed his chase.|$|R
50|$|The River Clarin rises {{north of}} Attymon and <b>snakes</b> westwards, <b>turning</b> southwards through Athenry. Athenry Castle was built at a fording {{point on the}} river. It flows southwestwards and passes under the N18 at Clarinbridge and enters Dunbulcaun Bay.|$|R
50|$|The snake's chameleon-like {{behaviour}} {{was discovered}} accidentally in 2005 when a specimen {{was put in}} a dark bucket. The <b>snake's</b> skin <b>turned</b> pale white 20 minutes later. Scientists determined the snake {{to be a new}} species belonging to the genus Enhydris.|$|R
50|$|When Rainbow Snake spotted Dirawong {{heading towards}} him, Rainbow <b>Snake</b> quickly <b>turned,</b> {{and this time}} Rainbow Snake kept going {{until he reached the}} Burraga (Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean), and made himself into an Island so Dirawong wouldn't {{recognise}} Rainbow Snake.|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear me, dear me, such terrible {{times as}} there were on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest! They grew worse and worse, and when at last Old Mother Nature came to see how all the little people were getting along, she heard so many {{complaints}} that she hardly knew where to begin to straighten matters out. She had all the little people come before her in turn and tell their troubles. When it came Mr. <b>Snake's</b> <b>turn,</b> he had no complaint to make. He {{seemed to be the}} only one who had no troubles. She asked him a great many questions, and for each one he had a ready reply. Of course a great many of these replies were lies, and every time he told one of these, he winked without knowing it. You see, it had become a habit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beach at}} Kilve was {{described}} by William Wordsworth, the Romantic poet, as [...] "Kilve's delightful shore". Kilve Pill, where the stream from Holford runs into the sea, was once a tiny port, used for importing culm, an inferior type of coal which {{was used in the}} limeburning process. It was also the site for [...] "glatting" [...] which was the hunting of conger eels by dogs. On the shore a Saint Keyne serpent can be seen, which a local legend says is a <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> to stone, but is in reality an ammonite. It is just possible to make out the remains of a stone jetty and the ruins of a lime kiln nearby. Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{expedition}} arrived in Nemea, the young son of King Lycourgos {{was killed by}} a <b>snake.</b> In <b>turn,</b> Adrastus’s men killed the serpent, buried the boy and held the first Nemean Games in his honor (alternate stories cite Heracles' triumph over the Nemean Lion as the cause of the first games). Tydeus won the boxing event at these games.|$|R
40|$|Polarized protons were {{injected}} {{and accelerated}} in the clockwise ring of RHIC to commission {{the first full}} helical Siberian snake ever used in an accelerator. With the <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> on, the stable spin direction is in the horizontal plane. Vertically polarized protons were injected with the snake off. The snake was adiabatically ramped to give a spin rotation of 180 {degree} around a horizontal rotation axis about 13 {degree} from the longitudinal. When the beam was accelerated from injection G{sub {gamma}} = 46. 5 to G{sub {gamma}} = 48 the spin flipped sign as expected and polarization was preserved. At G{sub {gamma}} = 48 without the snake, no polarization was observed since several spin resonances were crossed. Eventually polarized beam was accelerated to G{sub {gamma}} = 55. 7 (29. 1 GeV). In the next proton running period we plan to run with two full helical snakes in each ring and collide both transversely and longitudinally polarized protons at an energy around 100 GeV per beam...|$|R

50|$|Lewiston {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of the Snake and Clearwater rivers. Immediately west of Lewiston is the smaller twin city of Clarkston, Washington. The north-flowing Snake River departs Hells Canyon and forms the state boundary with Washington, while west-flowing Clearwater River defines the northern border of the city. At their confluence at the city's northwest corner, the lower <b>Snake</b> River <b>turns</b> west into Washington, and after passing four dams, empties into the Columbia River at Burbank.|$|R
5000|$|The 'God' of the Amato Empire. He {{is the one}} {{who created}} Chigusa, Rakan, the Prince and Kinrei. Hoshiminokoto used the shining sand to {{communicate}} with people. He created the current world as an experiment and planned to destroy it to build anew. He created the prince to announce [...] "prophecies" [...] about upcoming disasters. Chigusa was created as a trigger for the giant <b>snakes</b> to <b>turn</b> into streams and awaken other objects that would destroy the world.|$|R
5000|$|After awakening, he escapes the {{hospital}} following {{an attack by}} Cipher's XOF strike force and is extracted by Ocelot. Given the code name Venom Snake, the double takes command of the Diamond Dogs mercenary unit along with the new Mother Base constructed near Seychelles. Snake then engages {{in a series of}} missions in Afghanistan and Central Africa as he seeks revenge for his lost comrades and pursues the Cipher organization. Along the way he recruits several individuals into his army, including companions such as the sniper Quiet and the canine D-Dog. Snake ultimately comes face to face with Skull Face, the man who plotted the original Mother Base's destruction. Throughout the course of the story clues to Venom Snake's true identity are gradually revealed, starting with the presence of his roommate Ishmael in the Cypriot hospital. When Snake asks Ishmael's identity, the bandaged patient simply replies [...] "you're talking to yourself." [...] Later on, a DNA test is conducted on the child mercenary leader Eli, a suspected product of the Les Enfants Terribles cloning project (and ultimately revealed to be a young Liquid <b>Snake),</b> <b>turns</b> out negative when Eli's DNA is compared with Snake's.|$|R
50|$|The {{belief that}} <b>snakes</b> will {{eventually}} <b>turn</b> into dragons if unseen {{by human beings}} also exists in Hungary and Romania. Among the Kastrati, {{it was believed that}} a snake would lose its capacity to turn into a Kulshedra if it were seen by a wren.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for the {{modelling}} of irregularly sampled surfaces is presented. The surfaces under consideration allow discontinuities {{of the first}} and higher derivatives. The method discussed is a general-ization of the so called snakes approximation method. The variational problem, {{which is part of the}} <b>snakes</b> modelling, <b>turns</b> out to be the weighted sum of a membrane and a thin-plate-spline kernel. The varia-tional problem is solved by the direct method using scaled and shifted Gaussians as base functions. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated for a set of laser-scanning data...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Snake" [...] {{was written}} in 1963 by Oscar Brown Jr and {{released}} by Al Wilson in 1968. It was used by Donald Trump at rallies during his bid for presidency. The Brown family asked him not to use their father's song, {{which is about a}} woman who takes in an ailing <b>snake</b> that <b>turns</b> on her. Maggie Brown and Africa Brown stated that when Donald Trump read [...] "The Snake" [...] {{he was referring to the}} snakes as refugees and the caring woman as America. They disapproved of the analogy.|$|R
5000|$|Taking {{the name}} [...] "Brother Voodoo", Jericho {{challenges}} the priest, {{who goes by}} the same name as his god Damballah, and his cult. With the help of his brother Daniel Drumm's spirit possessing one of the cult members, Jericho removes Damballah's artifact of power (wangal), causing Damballah's <b>snakes</b> to <b>turn</b> on him and evidently destroying Damballah's cult. Brother Voodoo becomes Haiti's houngan supreme and champion, and establishes a sprawling mansion as a base of operations. He places the wangal in a safe, its combination known only to Brother Voodoo and his manservant Bambu.|$|R

60|$|The tree {{to which}} the Scot {{directed}} attention overhung the stream, and down one of its branches a snake was seen twining itself with caution. It evidently meant to rob one of the nests, for the little owner, with some of its companions, was shrieking and fluttering round the would-be robber. This kind of bird has been gifted with special wisdom to guard its home from snakes. It forms the entrance to its pendent nest at the bottom instead of the top, and hangs the nest itself at the extreme point of the finest twigs, so that the snake is compelled to wriggle downwards perpendicularly, and at last has to extend part of its body past the nest, {{in order to be}} able to turn its head upwards into the hole. Great, unquestionably, is a snake's capacity to hold on by its tail, but this holding on as it were to next-to-nothing is usually too much for it. While the explorers were watching, the <b>snake</b> <b>turned</b> its head upwards for the final dive into the nest, but its coils slipped, and it fell into the water amid triumphant shrieks from the little birds. Nothing daunted, however, the snake swam ashore and made another attempt--with the same result. Again it made the trial; a third time it failed, and then, in evident disgust, went off to attack some easier prey.|$|R
