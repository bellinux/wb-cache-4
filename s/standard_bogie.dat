2500|$|Carriage 21 and {{carriage}} 22 {{have been}} designed to appear as similar as possible to the original 19th Century bogie vehicles, but constructed to 21st Century safety standards with a steel chassis based on the Talyllyn Railway's <b>standard</b> <b>bogie</b> carriage design and a steel skeleton with timber cladding for the body. Carriage 21 (completed in May 2003) has a plain roof, and carriage 22 (completed in July 2015) has a clerestory roof, similar to those carried by two original carriages in the 1920s. Since September 2015 the railway has been able to run an authentic-looking [...] "1920s" [...] train with the [...] "Tattoo" [...] locomotive and two bogie carriages 21 and 22.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 1920s onwards {{passenger}} trains ran faster, and less running time meant that on-board sorting of mail {{was no longer}} practical. As a result, the onboard mail sorting carriages were removed and converted to other uses, with mail instead being carried in <b>standard</b> <b>bogie</b> boxvans or louvre vans.|$|E
5000|$|When introduced, most of {{the class}} were fitted with a <b>standard</b> <b>bogie</b> tender, similar as those {{attached}} to the 50 class, although some saw service with large capacity [...] "Wampu" [...] tenders. In the later period of their lives, the majority were fitted with larger turret type tenders. In later years some were used as heavy shunting locomotives and from 1963 {{on some of these}} had automatic couplers fitted to the front.|$|E

50|$|Prussian state {{railways}} {{coaches were}} equipped with <b>standard</b> <b>bogies</b> with two and later three spring systems. Most coaches were 18.55 m long. Initially Westinghouse brakes were used, but after 1900 they were fitted with standard Knorr brakes. The hand brake was {{housed in a}} separate brakeman's cabin {{at one end of}} the coach. These were removed in 1930.|$|R

50|$|In 1936 the {{locomotive}} 670.030 was rebuilt with a Franco-Crosti boiler. Articulated ducts carried the combustion gases {{from the main}} boiler to the preheater (placed on a <b>standard</b> <b>bogie</b> tender), and these passed to a chimney {{at the end of}} the tender. Exhaust steam from the cylinders similarly went through articulated ducts to the blastpipe at the rear of the tender, while articulated pipes connected the preheater and main boiler to take water and steam from one to the other. The whole locomotive-tender complex was given a streamlined casing. The locomotive was reclassified FS 672.001 and was subjected to trial runs, which showed a 22 per cent fuel saving compared to other Class 671 locomotives.|$|E

50|$|Another tram, 118, {{which was}} a {{single-deck}} bogie saloon car built by Hobart Municipal Tramways in 1941, was recovered from a farm in Sorell, where it had lain abandoned since being withdrawn from service in 1960. As of 2008, Tony Colman was continuing its restoration including refitting replica original upholstery and operation metal frame windows. Bendigo Tramways will refit 3’6” (106.68 cm) gauge M&MTB No. 9 trucks. This tram had originally been number 11, but was renumber 118 in 1947, when all <b>standard</b> <b>bogie</b> cars were numbered in the one hundred range. This car had already been the third number 11, as two previous cars (1893-1914, and 1914-52) had born the same car number. Similarly, tram number 133 was also recovered from a farm, this time in Bridgewater where it had also laid abandoned since 1960. Unfortunately, its condition may prevent future restoration. It is currently stored at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery’s Moonah workshops. Tram number 120 was recovered from private ownership in Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory in June 2005, {{where it had been}} for twenty years. Prior to that it {{is believed to have been}} used as a fishing shed in Interlaken in Tasmania’s Central Highlands. It was originally built in 1936, and withdrawn in 1959.|$|E
50|$|Two sets of <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies</b> {{were also}} supplied, for cross border work (bogie exchange).|$|R
50|$|The {{basis of}} the first coaches even {{included}} those with Prussian <b>standard</b> <b>bogies,</b> although these were converted from friction bearings to roller bearings. The next 300 coaches were given the originally American Schwanenhals bogies, an amazing parallel with the 1964 eight-wheeled Reko-Wagen coaches of the Reichsbahn in East Germany. All the remaining yg class coaches were then equipped with Minden-Deutz MD 36 bogies.All the coaches were cleared to run at up to 120 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The DF4D, {{the most}} recent DF4 revision, has been {{produced}} since 1996 with the 16V240ZJD engine. The passenger versions increased top speed to 145 km/h or 170 km/h. The freight version comes in a different color scheme than the previous DF4Ds, namely green(7000 Series) and later light blue(4000 Series) and yellow. The green version sat on radial bogies but later converted to <b>standard</b> <b>bogies.</b> Their top speed to 100 km/h (62 mph).|$|R
50|$|In 1974 the RA1914, RA1917 and RA1918 were {{fitted with}} <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies</b> and renumbered KA211-KA213. RA1918 has been {{preserved}} by Rail Heritage WA.|$|R
50|$|In February 2006, one {{locomotive}} {{was fitted}} with <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies</b> {{for use by}} QR National in New South Wales and Victoria, but the NSW Environment Protection Authority refused permission {{for it to be}} used in that state due to excessive noise emissions. In August 2009 it was converted back to narrow gauge for use in Western Australia. In 2013 three were reclassfied as the 3200 class for use in NSW, following the installation of <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies</b> and a modified exhaust system that reduced low frequency noise emissions.|$|R
50|$|The tenders {{initially}} rode on drawing x-6002 <b>standard</b> <b>bogies</b> {{fitted with}} grease-lubricated bearings. Later, drawing x-10161 bogies, still fitted with grease-lubricated bearings were substituted on some locomotives {{as they came}} in for overhaul. A later variant was the drawing x-11183 'Timken' roller-bearing bogie fitted to the WAB class conversions of 1947-57 and as used under the G class locomotive tenders from 1937. Enthusiasts {{were able to identify}} these different types of bogies by their design characteristics - for example, the x-6002 bogies had a prominent journal box and were made of steel bar sections.|$|R

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that railway dynamics {{is far from being}} trivial, mostly because of the wheel/rail contact phenomenon.

50|$|The Lohr Railway System or Modalohr System (Système Modalohr) uses special railway wagons {{of a type}} {{known as}} {{piggyback}} wagons, to carry standard road semi-trailers on the European rail network. They are currently used on the AFF route from France to Italy and Luxembourg to the French border with Spain and vice versa; there are plans to expand this service. They have also been approved for the Channel Tunnel. This articulated railway wagon consists of two low-floor decks, resting on a single Y25 jacobs bogie {{in the middle and}} on two Y33 bogies on the extreme ends. Using <b>standard</b> <b>bogies</b> resulted in lower maintenance costs compared with the similar rolling highway concept.The deck between the bogies (trucks) pivots (swings) 30°, allowing the trailers to be loaded from the sides. The cars are built by Lohr Industrie.|$|R
5000|$|The trains {{were transported}} across the {{continent}} on <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies</b> and converted to Western Australia's [...] gauge standard locally. The first set, set 01, arrived in September 1990 and immediately {{became the subject of}} industrial action at Westrail's Midland Railway Workshops over a pay dispute and the impending one-man train operation which the new trains would ensure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A special wagon, {{presented}} in the paper, {{can be used for}} intermodal transport of various types of vehicles. It enables transport of vehicles of 36 tons mass and height of 4 m on the GB 1 clearance height. An innovative wagon is equipped with a frame-support with marginal parts mounted on <b>standard</b> biaxial <b>bogies</b> and the central part lowered with a rotatable loading platform. The rotating part of wagon acts as a kind of platform, allowing truck to move through it during load/unload. During railway operation, this rotating platform is to become an integrated part of the wagon; the tailboards of the rotating part will be connected to the over-bogie part with the special locks. A unique concept of the wagon structure forced a design approach which was rather unusual for the rail industry. Since the design team aimed at very challenging demands of GB 1 envelope and usage of <b>standard</b> <b>bogies,</b> the layout of the wagon had to be thoroughly examined in terms of its overall stiffness. Every major design change had to be simulated in order to accurately predict its influence on the whole wagon structure. FE analysis was used for numerical tests of such a wagon structure in different configurations. The calculations were carried out on the basis of PN-EN standards. Selected results of numerical tests of the prototype version of a such wagon for intermodal transports were {{presented in}} the paper. Key words: prototype railway wagon for intermodal transport, FE methodology of numerical tests, analysis of the wagon strength and dynamics simulations according to PN-EU standards. 1...|$|R
30|$|A {{technique}} utilising accelerometer measurements {{taken on}} <b>standard</b> operating <b>bogies</b> {{was accepted as}} a quick track condition inspection of a subway [10] with a particular focus on short-pitch rail corrugation. A diagnostic tool, based on the wavelet transform, was able to detect and to quantify the wheel-flat defect of a test train [11] at various speeds and can accurately measure the train speed. Only one accelerometer was required to provide results in real time.|$|R
50|$|The Langbein System uses claw pairs {{to form a}} yoke {{around the}} axles of the <b>{{standard}}</b> gauge <b>bogies.</b> With the bogies {{pulled out of the}} pit the standard gauge wheels can sink to the Rollbock to find support. This method enables the Rollbock wagons to traverse curves as sharp as 15 m radius and, when fully loaded, they could be moved over narrow gauge tracks at a safe speed of 13 mph.|$|R
25|$|The {{first to}} arrive was NSU52 on 10 May 1954 at Port Adelaide, it was used for crew training. It was {{followed}} by NSU51 on 20 May 1954. Still temporarily mounted on <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies,</b> on 12 June 1954 NSU51 was unveiled at Port Augusta {{with a pair of}} plates bearing the name of the then Federal Minister for Fuel, Shipping & Transport George McLeay. The locomotive then worked a trip to Bookaloo (68 kilometres) and return for dignitaries and guests.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Siemens {{bought one}} of the {{prototype}} units (Unit 498) and refitted the southern-end car (7498) with Syntegra-bogies to create a demonstration vehicle. Car 6498 is fitted with <b>standard</b> B-Class <b>bogies</b> and serves as reference in order to compare the [...] "Syntegra" [...] design to the current bogie design. The Unit has been tested at the Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg-Wildenrath in North Rhine-Westphalia, and entered revenue service in 2008. When in service, this unit forms the middle unit in a three-unit train.|$|R
50|$|The boiler of the Class 690 was {{replaced}} by the one fitted on the Class 746 locomotives; the trailing axle {{was replaced}} by a Bissel truck, to sustain the weight of the new, larger firebox, and a Nielebock-Knorr pre-heater was added. The 33 locomotives were rebuilt, part by the FS workshops, and part by the Ernesto Breda company.Initially they would have received the same tender designed for the Class 695, but in the end an enlarged version of the <b>standard</b> FS <b>bogie</b> tender was fitted.|$|R
50|$|The Class 480 {{was fitted}} with an Italian bogie, the central driving wheels had their flanges reduced, {{and the last}} driving axle was given some lateral play to allow the {{locomotive}} to deal with sharp curves; {{because of the need}} of a boiler with good steaming capacity, a huge firebox (4.3 m2, considered the maximum compatible with hand-firing) was fitted. Coherent with the standard FS practices, the locomotives were superheated and had two simple-expansion cylinders; they also had left-hand drive and multiple Del Papa valves. A <b>standard</b> FS <b>bogie</b> tender was fitted.|$|R
5000|$|After the Silverton Tramway was {{replaced}} by a new standard gauge line, 27 was sold to the South Australian Railways in February 1970 as 874 and after being rebuilt with a nose low cab, continues in service with Genesee & Wyoming Australia as 907. [...] The other two were fitted with <b>standard</b> gauge <b>bogies,</b> 28 at Silverton's workshop and 29 at Islington Railway Workshops and were relegated to trip working between the various mines in Broken Hill being repainted in Silverton's yellow and blue livery in May 1984.|$|R
50|$|Dual {{reduction}} are <b>standard</b> on Mack <b>bogies,</b> with straight-trough dual-reduction drive carriers as standard, requiring {{no transfer}} gearing and provide excellent driveline angles. This design, exclusive to Mack, permits shorter wheelbases, extended “U” joint life, lower bearing side loads and reduced vibration. The custom engineered frames are {{the envy of}} the industry.|$|R
