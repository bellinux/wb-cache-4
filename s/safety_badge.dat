During the merge of the airline system of Japan in 2002, uniforms were changed, so the <b>safety</b> <b>badge</b> was dropped. However, on every anniversary of the accident, all employees of the Moscow branch of Japan Airlines would visit the memorial of the victims, and mourn the dead.|$|E

50|$|Rotary Scout Reservation is a 1300 acre camp of the Twin Rivers Council, {{located in}} Poestenkill, New York. The {{original}} {{part of the}} camp was donated by the Troy Rotary Club in 1922. Summer camp program areas include the Trail to First Class Program, where young Scouts can work on requirements needed to earn Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class ranks. Following {{the introduction of the}} Kayaking and Traffic <b>Safety</b> merit <b>badges</b> for the 2012 summer camp season, RSR offers 43 merit badges in 10 program areas. In addition to the merit badge options, RSR offers an open schedule which allows Scouts to plan their day with a variety of outdoor experiences. The camp also offers several additional program areas designed to appeal to older Scouts, which include COPE, Mountain Biking, and Chillicothe.|$|R

40|$|Government {{agencies}} are investing {{a considerable amount}} of resources into improving security systems as result of recent terrorist events that dangerously exposed flaws and weaknesses in today’s <b>safety</b> mechanisms. <b>Badge</b> or password-based authentication procedures are too easy to hack. Biometrics represents a valid alternative but they suffer of drawbacks as well. Iris scanning, for example, is very reliable but too intrusive; fingerprints are socially accepted, but not applicable to non-consentient people. On the other hand, face recognition represents a good compromise between what’s socially acceptable and what’s reliable, even when operating under controlled conditions. In last decade, many algorithms based on linear/nonlinear methods, neural networks, wavelets, etc. have been proposed. Nevertheless, Face Recognition Vendor Test 2002 shown that most of these approaches encountered problems in outdoor conditions. This lowered their reliability compared to state of the art biometrics. This paper provides an ‘‘ex cursus’’ of recent face recognition research trends in 2 D imagery and 3 D model based algorithms. To simplify comparisons across different approaches, tables containing different collection of parameters (such as input size, recognition rate, number of addressed problems) are provided. This paper concludes by proposing possible future directions...|$|R
