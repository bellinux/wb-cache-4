5000|$|As a {{measurement}} technique, <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> was {{used during the}} Manhattan Project in early experiments to determine the minimum critical masses of 235U and of 239Pu. It is still used today to calibrate the controls for nuclear reactors during startup, as many effects (discussed in the following sections) can change the required control settings to achieve criticality in a reactor. As a power-generating technique, <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> allows generation of nuclear power for fission where a critical assembly is undesirable for safety or other reasons. A subcritical assembly together with a neutron source {{can serve as a}} steady source of heat to generate power from fission.|$|E
5000|$|Even in a {{subcritical}} assembly {{such as a}} shut-down reactor core, any stray neutron {{that happens to be}} present in the core (for example from spontaneous fission of the fuel, from radioactive decay of fission products, or from a neutron source) will trigger an exponentially decaying chain reaction. Although the chain reaction is not self-sustaining, it acts as a multiplier that increases the equilibrium number of neutrons in the core. This <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> effect can be used in two ways: as a probe of how close a core is to criticality, and as a way to generate fission power without the risks associated with a critical mass.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{shortage}} of plutonium-238, {{a new kind of}} RTG assisted by subcritical reactions has been proposed. In this kind of RTG, the alpha decay from the radioisotope is also used in alpha-neutron reactions with a suitable element such as beryllium. This way a long-lived neutron source is produced. Because the system is working with a criticality close to but less than 1, i.e. Keff < 1, a <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> is achieved which increases the neutron background and produces energy from fission reactions. Although the number of fissions produced in the RTG is very small (making their gamma radiation negligible), because each fission reaction releases almost 30 times more energy than each alpha decay (200 MeV compared to 6 MeV), up to a 10% energy gain is attainable, which translates into a reduction of the 238Pu needed per mission. The idea was proposed to NASA in 2012 for the yearly NASA NSPIRE competition, which translated to Idaho National Laboratory at the Center for Space Nuclear Research (CSNR) in 2013 for studies of feasibility.. However the essentials are unmodified.|$|E

The interpretation of the measurement using a Monte Carlo method is based on a perturbation model for the relationship between the spectral ratio and the <b>subcritical</b> neutron <b>multiplication</b> factor. The <b>subcritical</b> source-driven noise measurement has advantages over other subcritical measurement methods in that reference measurements at delayed critical are not required for interpreting the measurements. Therefore, benchmark or in-situ subcritical measurements can be performed outside a critical experiment facility. Furthermore, a certain ratio of frequency spectra {{has been shown to be}} independent of detection efficiency thereby making the measurement more robust and unaffected by drifts or changes in instrumentation during the measurement. Criteria have been defined for application of this measurement method for benchmarks and in-situ subcritical measurements. An extension of the source-driven subcritical noise measurement has also been discussed that eliminates the few technical challenges for in-situ applications...|$|R

50|$|Most nuclear {{reactors}} are hence operated in a prompt subcritical, delayed critical condition: the prompt neutrons alone {{are not sufficient}} to sustain a chain reaction, but the delayed neutrons make up the small difference required to keep the reaction going. This has effects on how reactors are controlled: when {{a small amount of}} control rod is slid into or out of the reactor core, the power level changes at first very rapidly due to prompt <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> and then more gradually, following the exponential growth or decay curve of the delayed critical reaction. Furthermore, increases in reactor power can be performed at any desired rate simply by pulling out a sufficient length of control rod. However, without addition of a neutron poison or active neutron-absorber, decreases in fission rate are limited in speed, because even if the reactor is taken deeply subcritical to stop prompt fission neutron production, delayed neutrons are produced after ordinary beta decay of fission products already in place, and this decay-production of neutrons cannot be changed.|$|E
40|$|Basic {{experiments}} on the accelerator-driven system (ADS) at the Kyoto University Critical Assembly {{are carried out}} by combining a solid-moderated and -reflected core with the fixed-field alternating gradient accelerator. The reaction rates are measured by the foil activation method to obtain the <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> parameters. The numerical calculations are conducted {{with the use of}} MCNPX and JENDL/HE- 2007 to evaluate the reaction rates of activation foils set in the core region and at the location of the target. Here, a comparison between the measured and calculated eigenvalues reveals a relative difference of around 10 % in C/E values. A special mention is made {{of the fact that the}} reaction rate analyses in the subcritical systems demonstrate apparently the actual effect of moving the tungsten target into the core on neutron multiplication. A series of further ADS experiments with 100 [*]MeV protons needs to be carried out to evaluate the accuracy of <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> parameters...|$|E
40|$|The 252 Cf source-driven noise {{analysis}} (CSDNA) method is an experimental technique, developed by J. T. Mihalczo {{and his collaborators}} at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which makes use of {{noise analysis}} to determine the multiplication factor, k, in subcritical multiplying media. In this work, a stochastic diffusion description was used to interpret the CSDNA experiment in an infinite, homogeneous medium in order {{to shed light on}} the practicality of this experimental procedure in determining the multiplication factor. By defining such a benchmark problem, an exact solution is obtained for the <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> factor in which the locations of the 252 Cf source and neutron detectors are explicitly taken into account. The expression relating reactivity to the measured data was found to depend implicitly on k itself. Through a numerical analysis of this expression, certain limiting conditions were identified in which the expression for the reactivity became essentially independent of k, hence demonstrating some possibility for the viability of this technique. However, under more realistic experimental conditions, i. e. for finite systems in which diffusion theory is not applicable, the measurement of the <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> factor from the measured data, without extensive transport calculations, becomes doubtful...|$|E
40|$|Methods for the {{determination}} of the <b>subcritical</b> neutron <b>multiplication</b> of nuclear materials are of interest in the field of nuclear nonproliferation and safeguards. A time-correlated pulse-height (TCPH) analysis technique could be used to estimate the sub-critical multiplication of nuclear material. To evaluate the effectiveness of this technique and to benchmark the simulation capabilities of MCNPX-PoliMi/MPPost, a series of measurements were performed at the Joint Research Centre facility in Ispra, Italy. This campaign measured two low-multiplication samples: 1 -kg mixed oxide (MOX) powder sample and plutonium-gallium (PuGa) disks. The measured results demonstrated that the sensitivity of the TCPH technique could not clearly distinguish samples with very-low levels of multiplication. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R

In order to operate a <b>subcritical</b> core with <b>multiplication</b> factor of k=0.95, a particle accelerator able to provide a maximum current of 4 mA beam of 600 MeV protons is needed.

40|$|The {sup 252 }Cf-source-driven {{frequency}} analysis method {{can be used}} for measuring the <b>subcritical</b> neutron <b>multiplication</b> factor of arrays of LWR fuel and as little as a single PWR fuel assembly.

In addition, the data can be used to validate calculational methods for criticality safety. These measurements provide parameters that have a higher sensitivity to changes in fissile mass than neutron multiplication factor and thus serve as a better test of calculational methods. The analysis have also shown that measurement of the cross power spectral density (CPSD) between detectors on one side of a single fuel assembly and an internal or external {sup 252 }Cf source driving the fission chain multiplication process {{can be used for}} nondestructive assay of fissile mass {{along the length of the}} assembly.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the accuracy {{and performance of}} the RAPID (Real-time Analysis for Particle transport and In-situ Detection) code system for the simulation of a used nuclear fuel (UNF) cask. RAPID is capable of determining eigenvalue, <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication,</b> and pin-wise, axially-dependent fission density throughout a UNF cask. We study the source convergence based on {{the analysis of the}} different parameters used in an eigenvalue calculation in the MCNP Monte Carlo code. For this study, we consider a single assembly surrounded by absorbing plates with reflective boundary conditions. Based on the best combination of eigenvalue parameters, a reference MCNP solution for the single assembly is obtained. RAPID results are in excellent agreement with the reference MCNP solutions, while requiring significantly less computation time (i. e., minutes vs. days). A similar set of eigenvalue parameters is used to obtain a reference MCNP solution for the whole UNF cask. Because of time limitation, the MCNP results near the cask boundaries have significant uncertainties. Except for these, the RAPID results are in excellent agreement with the MCNP predictions, and its computation time is significantly lower, 35 second on 1 core versus 9. 5 days on 16 cores...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to delayed critical experiment {{was performed in}} 1981 at Pacific Northwest Laboratory with a cylindrical tank of plutonium-uranium nitrate solution. During this experiment, various methods to determine the critical height were used, including (1) extrapolation of the usual plot of inverse count rate vs. height, which estimates the delayed critical height (DCH); (2) the inverse count rate vs. height divided by count rate, which corrects somewhat for the change in inherent source size as the height changes; (3) ratio of spectral densities vs. height, which extrapolates to DCH; (4) extrapolations of prompt neutron decay constant vs. height, which extrapolates to the prompt critical height (PCH); and (5) inverse kinetics rod drop (IKRD) methods, which measure {Delta}k/k{Beta} very accurately for a particular solution height. The problem {{with some of the}} extrapolation methods is that the measured data are not linear with height, but, for lack of anything better, linear extrapolations are made. In addition to the measurements to determine the delayed critical height subcriticality measurements by the {sup 252 }Cf source driven frequency analysis method were performed for a variety of subcriticality heights. This paper describes how all these methods were applied to obtain the critical height of a cylindrical tank of plutonium nitrate solution and how the <b>subcritical</b> neutron <b>multiplication</b> factor was obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{verification}} of the subcriticality {{is of utmost}} importance for the safe transportation and storage of nuclear reactor fuels. Transportation containers and storage facilities are designed such that nuclear fuels remain in a subcritical state. Such designs often involve excess conservatism {{because of the lack}} of relevant experimental data to verify the accuracy of Monte Carlo codes used in nuclear criticality safety analyses. A joint experimental research program between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions, Inc., and the University of Missouri was initiated to obtain measured quantities that could be directly related to the subcriticality of simple arrays of Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) fuel elements. A series of measurement were performed to assess the reactivity of materials such as BORAL, stainless steel, aluminum, and lead that are typically used in the construction of shipping casks. These materials were positioned between the fuel elements. In addition, a limited number of measurements were performed with configurations of fresh and spent (irradiated) fuel elements to ascertain the reactivity of the spent fuel elements. In these experiments, fresh fuel elements were replaced by spent fuel elements such that the subcritical reactivity change could be measured. The results of these measurements were used by Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions to determine the subcriticality of MURR fuel elements isolated by absorbing materials. The measurements were interpreted using the MCNP-DSP Monte Carlo code to obtain the <b>subcritical</b> neutron <b>multiplication</b> factor k(sub eff), and the bias in K(sub eff) that are used in criticality safety analyses...|$|R
40|$|There {{considered}} a system {{consisting of a}} fast neutron batch pulsed IBR type reactor and a subcritical unit (neutronically thermal). The reactor is fitted with a reactivity modulator, which provides short-term “transfer” of the system from a deep subcritical to a prompt supercritical state and back. The system is in a deep subcritical state in the intervals between pulses. Such a system is capable to operate in an equilibrium (static) mode only when a critical condition is fulfilled for the kinetic parameters describing its operation. The neutron kinetics is described {{as part of a}} two-point approximation. It is assumed that the change in the reactor reactivity at the pulse generation time takes place periodically according to a parabolic law and the reactor is deeply subcritical in the intervals between pulses. Numerical simulation of the critical condition is extremely time-consuming, and analytical representation is almost impossible due to the need for solving ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients. There proposed a methodology for approximate estimating of parameters of a coupled “batch pulsed reactor–subcritical unit” system operating in an equilibrium mode. Analytical relations have been obtained in a quadrature form to calculate the “critical” condition of such a system in the approximation of “frequently recurring” pulses, when the decay of the delayed neutron precursors in the interval between pulses can be ignored. Calculations of the “critical condition” are illustrated by an example of a laser system consisting of an IBR-type batch pulsed reactor and a <b>subcritical</b> neutron <b>multiplication</b> unit, in which fission energy is converted into laser emission energy. Critical parameters of the system were estimated using analytical relations, as well as direct numerical calculations based on the STIK program that models the neutron kinetics in the considered system in a two-point approximation. It has been shown that the results of direct calculations and the estimates based on analytical relations matched good...|$|R
40|$|Subcritical {{experiments}} using californium source-driven {{noise analysis}} (CSDNA) and Feynman variance-to-mean methods were performed with an alpha-phase plutonium sphere reflected by nickel shells, up {{to a maximum}} thickness of 7. 62 cm. Both methods provide means of determining the <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> of a system containing nuclear material. A benchmark analysis of the experiments was performed {{for inclusion in the}} 2010 edition of the International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments. Benchmark models have been developed that represent these subcritical experiments. An analysis of the computed eigenvalues and the uncertainty in the experiment and methods was performed. The eigenvalues computed using the CSDNA method were very close to those calculated using MCNP 5; however, computed eigenvalues are used in the analysis of the CSDNA method. Independent calculations using KENO-VI provided similar eigenvalues to those determined using the CSDNA method and MCNP 5. A slight trend with increasing nickel-reflector thickness was seen when comparing MCNP 5 and KENO-VI results. For the 1. 27 -cm-thick configuration the MCNP eigenvalue was approximately 300 pcm greater. The calculated KENO eigenvalue was about 300 pcm greater for the 7. 62 -cm-thick configuration. The calculated results were approximately the same for a 5 -cm-thick shell. The eigenvalues determined using the Feynman method are up to approximately 2. 5 % lower than those determined using either the CSDNA method or the Monte Carlo codes. The uncertainty in the results from either method was not large enough to account for the bias between the two experimental methods. An ongoing investigation is being performed to assess what potential uncertainties and/or biases exist that have yet to be properly accounted for. The dominant uncertainty in the CSDNA analysis was the uncertainty in selecting a neutron cross-section library for performing the analysis of the data. The uncertainty in the Feynman method was equally shared between the uncertainties in fitting the data to the Feynman equations and the neutron multiplicity of 239 Pu. Material and geometry uncertainties in the benchmark experiment were generally much smaller than uncertainties in the analysis methods...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for performing and applying {{nuclear criticality safety}} calculations, for PWR spent nuclear fuel (SNF) packages with actinide-only burnup credit, is described. The changes in the U- 234, U- 235, U- 236, U- 238, Pu- 238, Pu- 239, Pu- 240, Pu- 241, Pu- 242, and Am- 241 concentration with burnup are used in burnup credit criticality analyses. No credit for fission product neutron absorbers is taken. The methodology consists of five major steps. (1) Validate a computer code system to calculate isotopic concentrations of SNF created during burnup in the reactor core and subsequent decay. A set of chemical assay benchmarks is presented for this purpose {{as well as a}} method for assessing the calculational bias and uncertainty, and conservative correction factors for each isotope. (2) Validate a computer code system to predict the <b>subcritical</b> <b>multiplication</b> factor, k{sub eff}, of a spent nuclear fuel package. Fifty-seven UO{sub 2 }, UO{sub 2 }/Gd{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, and UO{sub 2 }/PuO{sub 2 } critical experiments have been selected to cover anticipated conditions of SNF. The method uses an upper safety limit on k{sub eff} (which can be a function of the trending parameters) such that the biased k{sub eff}, when increased for the uncertainty is less than 0. 95. (3) Establish bounding conditions for the isotopic concentration and criticality calculations. Three bounding axial profiles have been established to assure the ''end effect'' is accounted for conservatively. (4) Use the validated codes and bounding conditions to generate package loading criteria (burnup credit loading curves). Burnup credit loading curves show the minimum burnup required for a given initial enrichment. The utility burnup record is compared to this requirement after the utility accounts for the uncertainty in its record. Separate curves may be generated for each assembly design, various minimum cooling times and burnable absorber histories. (5) Verify that SNF assemblies meet the package loading criteria and confirm proper assembly selection prior to loading. A measurement of the average assembly burnup is required and that measurement must be within 10 % of the utility burnup record for the assembly to be accepted. The measurement device must be accurate to within 10 %. Each step is described in detail for use with any computer code system and is then demonstrated with the SCALE 4. 2 computer code package using 27 BURNUPLIB cross sections...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed at the Los Alamos critical assembly facility in the early 1950 s to determine the critical mass of highly enriched uranium spheres surrounded by thin reflectors of various materials. The objective of these experiments was to obtain a precision graph of the critical mass of highly enriched uranium metal {{as a function of}} reflector thickness and to generate transport cross sections for the reflector material. Thirteen configurations are described and evaluated under ICSBEP identifier, HEU-MET-FAST- 085; two with 1. 98 -inch-thick and 4. 158 -inch-thick copper reflectors, two with 2 - and 4 -inch-thick cast iron reflectors, one with a 1. 945 -inch-thick nickel reflector, two with 1. 88 - and 2. 02 -inch-thick nickel-copper-zinc alloy reflectors, one with a 1. 81 -inch-thick thorium reflector, two with 2 -inch-thick and 4 -inch-thick tungsten alloy reflectors, two with 2 -inch-thick and 4. 075 -inch-thick zinc reflectors, and one with a 2 -inch-thick tungsten alloy reflector surrounded by a 2 -inch-thick cast iron reflector. All configurations were slightly <b>subcritical</b> with measured <b>multiplications</b> ranging from 20 to 162. Analyses were performed in which uncertainty associated with six different parameters was evaluated; namely, extrapolation to uranium critical mass, uranium density, 235 U enrichment, reflector density, reflector thickness, and reflector impurities were considered. Uncertainty in cast-iron alloying elements was also considered when appropriate. In addition to the idealizations made by the experimenters, two simplifications were also made to the benchmark models that resulted in a small bias and additional uncertainty. First of all, since impurities in core and reflector materials are only estimated, they are not included in the benchmark models. Secondly, the room, support structure, and other possible surrounding equipment {{were not included in the}} model. Bias values that result from these two simplifications were determined and associated uncertainty in the bias values were included in the overall uncertainty in benchmark keff values. Bias values range from 0. 0021 ?k low to 0. 0016 ?k high. Overall uncertainties range from ? 0. 0023 to ? 0. 0064. Major contributors to the overall uncertainty include uncertainty in the extrapolation to the uranium critical mass and the uranium density. Results are summarized in the following figure. The 3 configurations described and evaluated in HEU-MET-FAST- 085 are judged to be acceptable for use as criticality safety benchmark experiments and should be valuable integral benchmarks for nuclear data testing of the various reflector materials. Details of the benchmark models, uncertainty analyses, and final results are given in this paper...|$|R
