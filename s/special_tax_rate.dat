Dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes, unlike {{in the rest of}} the EU. The CFO denied that they chose the Netherlands as their European headquarters to avoid tax, explaining that the company's Dutch coffee roasting plant was the reason for the decision. Until 2009, the royalty rate was 6% of UK sales, but after being challenged by UK tax authorities it was reduced to 4.7%. The CFO told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products, but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided. The coffee they serve in the UK is purchased from the Swiss subsidiary, which charges a 20% markup on the wholesale price and pays 12% corporation tax on profits. Coffee is not transported to Switzerland but the 30 people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality. Regarding Starbucks' frequent reports of loss in the UK, the CFO told the committee that Starbucks are [...] "not at all pleased" [...] about their financial performance in the UK. MPs replied that it [...] "just doesn't ring true" [...] that the business made a loss, pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the US and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, {{there were}} more than 100 PTPs and Congress {{estimated}} that the trend was costing Washington $245 million a year in lost revenue. A law was enacted that treated PTPs as corporations unless they derived 90 percent of their income from so-called [...] "passive sources," [...] which included interest, dividends, capital gains, real estate rents, income and capital gains from real estate (e.g., developers and homebuilders), income and gain from natural resources activities, and commodities. All existing PTPs whose income did not qualify (roughly a third of them) were given 10 years before they would be taxed as corporations. Just like in Australia, many of these eventually changed structures, went off the market, etc., but the decade-long transition meant fewer sharp losses for investors.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the impact and {{the appropriateness of}} tax incentives for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in the European Union. First, we provide a survey of implemented tax incentives specifically targeted at SMEs in the 28 EU Member States. Building hereon, we measure the impact of these regimes on the effective tax burdens of targeted companies. We find that SME tax incentives are a commonly used measure among European policy makers. The vast majority of regimes, however, only marginally reduce the tax liability of SMEs. If major reliefs are available, they mostly stem from <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> whereas <b>tax</b> credits and <b>special</b> allowance play a minor role. In the second main part of the analysis, we examine the arguments potentially justifying the usage of SME tax incentives. As a main result, small firms per se do not create more jobs and innovations nor do they face insurmountable financing constraints. The existence of market failures commonly associated with SMEs – and possibly warranting the use of SME tax incentives – can therefore not be confirmed. Instead, disproportionate tax compliance costs for small entities constitute the most compelling argument for a <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> treatment. These compliance costs can most appropriately be addressed by administrative reliefs. <b>Special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>tax</b> credits and allowances, in contrast, are not only inefficient but also ineffective in this regard. Instead of improving the neutrality of the overall tax system, the latter are likely to add further distortions and unnecessary complexity. Altogether, the focus of policy - makers should thus shift from providing discriminatory incentives to the design of a generally neutral and simple tax system, which would benefit small as well as large enterprises...|$|R

The paper also looks at Robert Frank's arguments for a progressive consumption tax based on the findings of the happiness research.

Demographic projections are combined with incidence and mortality rates of four major cigarette related diseases, price elasticity of cigarette demand and unit costs of nonprice measures to reduce demand in order to estimate the net present discounted values of policy alternatives. Among policy alternatives that yield the same amount of cigarette consumption, cessation programs yield lower costs to households and the society at large than taxation, while taxation is preferred by the public sector. Net benefit to the public sector as a function of the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is a single-peaked Laffer curve.

My remarks will focus mainly on the effects of extending lower rates for capital gains and dividends. I will also comment briefly on the savers credit and the education deduction. Lower Rates for Capital Gains and Dividends Prior to 2003, dividends of individuals were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains were subject to a maximum <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of 20 percent for taxpayers in the 25 percent <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> bracket and above and of 10 percent for taxpayers in the 15 percent <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> bracket and below. Between 2003 and the end of 2007, dividends and capital gains will both be subject to a maximum rate of 15 percent for taxpayers in the 25 percent rate bracket and above and 5 percent for taxpayers in lower brackets. (The lower rate on dividends was effective January 1, 2003; the lower rate on capital gains for sales of assets after May 6, 2003). In 2008, the rates drop to zero for taxpayers in the 15 percent income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> bracket and below. The lower rates for dividends and capital gains expire at the end of tax year 2008.
