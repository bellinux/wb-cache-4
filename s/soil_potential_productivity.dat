40|$|Forest {{fires are}} a common {{disturbance}} in many forest systems {{in the world and}} in particular in the Mediterranean region. Their origins can be either natural or anthropogenic. The effects in regard to the time trends, vegetation, and soil will be reflected in the species distribution, forest composition, and <b>soil</b> <b>potential</b> <b>productivity.</b> In general, {{it can be said that}} the larger the fire and the shorter the time between two consecutive occurrences, the higher the probability to originate shifts in vegetation and soil degradation. In the Mediterranean region, the number of fire ignitions does not reflect the burnt area due to the occurrence of very large fires. The latter occur in a very small proportion of the number of ignitions, but result in very large burnt areas. Also there seems to be an increasing trend toward larger fires in the Mediterranean region due mainly to climatic and land use changes. This case study highlights the importance of vegetation regrowth a short time after the fire to maintain both forest systems and soil conservation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{research}} efforts {{have shown that}} soil erosion decreases soil productivity. Erosion-caused crop production decreases of 15 - 40 % are commonly reported with some values over 50 %. Furrow erosion on irrigated land in Idaho decreases topsoil depth on the upslope approximately 33 % of the field area and may increase topsoil depth on the downslope 50 - 55 %. Crop yields arc generally decreased where topsoil depths are decreased, but yields are not generally increased where topsoil depths are increased beyond a critical depth. Crops vary in their sensitivity to decreases in topsoil depth, but all crops studied exhibited lower yields on the eroded areas. <b>Soil</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>potential</b> of one area representing several million ha of furrow irrigated land was reduced at least 25 % by furrow erosion over 80 irrigation seasons. Technology is not available to restore <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>potential</b> to the level that would exist had there been no erosion except for returning topsoil to eroded areas. Research and technology applications arc needed to reduce or eliminate topsoil loss and redistribution by irrigation erosion...|$|R
40|$|A {{classification}} of forest vegetation is presented for the Mt. Baker-snoqualmie Forest. It {{is based on}} the potential National vegetation and uses the plant association as the basic unit. The classification is based on 2464 sample plots distributed across the Forest from 1979 to 1990. Of these 1963 were in late successional stands over 150 years old. An additional 633 plots were taken in non-forest communities or undescribed plant associations. The hierarchical classification includes 4 forest series, 19 plant association groups, and 60 plant associations. Diagnostic keys are presented to aid in the identification of vegetation series and plant associations. Descriptions are presented for each series and association. Plant association descriptions include information about plant species occurrences, distribution, environment and <b>soils,</b> <b>potential</b> timber <b>productivity,</b> management considerations, and comparisons with similar plant associations.

40|$|The clay {{mineralogy}} of paddy soils {{collected from}} 28 sites in Thailand and Malaysia that represent 19 soil series was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. Most soils contain kaolinite, 2 : 1 mixed-layer minerals and mica. Chlorite and chloritesmectite or vermiculite intergrades are rather rare species. The mixed-layer minerals consist of random stratification of smectite/vermiculite/mica or smectite/mica that {{differ in their}} major mineral species. All the 2 : 1 layer silicates are dioctahedral and most smectite is a high-charge type. The contents of the minerals in the clay show regional and physiographic variations.

40|$|The soil {{resource}} {{is one of}} the most influential factors in determining the manner in which agricultural land is used. However, external factors such as culture, economics, and market demand also contribute to land use decisions and in some cases may disproportionately influence utilization of the {{soil resource}}. History has shown that the result of allowing land use decisions to be disproportionately influenced by external factors may result in the misuse and consequent over-utilization of the soil resource. Alternatively, the underutilization of the soil resource may inhibit the ability of the land owners to fully realize the economic return available from their land. This dissertation compares land use patterns on two politically and culturally disparate, yet geographically adjacent land areas. Land use is evaluated on the Standing Rock reservation in North and South Dakota, and compared with the land use patterns in the area immediately surrounding the reservation, for the purpose of identifying whether land use decisions are influenced by location with respect to the reservation. In addition, the <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> of the <b>soil</b> resource within both study sites is evaluated and correlated with land use to determine whether the two sites utilize productive soils in the same way. Finally, the various land ownership categories on the reservation are correlated with land use and also with <b>potential</b> <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> to identify any differences in land use and <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> within the reservation. The results of this research indicate that land use patterns as well as <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> are significantly different on the reservation in comparison to the land surrounding the reservation. In addition, land use and <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> within the reservation vary, depending upon whether the land is under Indian or non-Indian ownership. ...|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean climatic {{conditions}} for stone fruit production are good but soil fertility is low, mainly due to low (< 2. 0 %) {{soil organic matter}} (OM). Consequently, conventional growers apply high fertiliser rates (typically ~ 350 Kg N ha- 1 yr- 1). Our main objectives were to compare the effects of 2 modes of nitrogen nutrition, suitable for organically certified orchard vs a conventional control on tree development, yield, and some soil chemical, physical and biological properties. The orchard is located on a Grumosol soil, in the Jezreel Valley, Israel and is treated organically in terms of plant protection and weed control. The orchard was planted to peach, plums and nectarines in 1998, all grafted onto rootstock CV. 677. The tested treatments were: A. conventional control, receiving an average of 350 Kg N ha- 1 yr- 1; B. fertilization using cattle manure compost (40 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1) + feather meal (1 tonne ha- 1 yr- 1); and C. {{a combination of the}} same amount of compost + 500 Kg feather meal ha- 1 yr- 1 + leguminous cover crop (Alfalfa, Medicago sativa cv. Gilboa). The cover crop was mowed 7 – 8 times per year. There were five replicates per treatment, of nine trees per replicate and the experiment was arranged in a randomised block design. The experiment lasted 6 years. OM content of the native soil (5 – 30 cm) was 1. 8 – 2. 0 %. By 2003 the OM content of the conventional control treatment remained stable; that of treatment B increased by 36 % while that of treatment C increased by 91 %. This change was refl ected in a clear and statistically significant change in soil’s bulk density values which were 0. 80, 0. 73 and 0. 71 gr cm 3 for treatments A, B and C, respectively. At the beginning of the experiment levels of soil nitrate, phosphate and potassium ions were somewhat lower in treatments B and C than those in A but they became consistently higher after 2 – 3 years. The levels of these ions in the 30 – 60 cm soil layer followed the same trend at a 1 – 2 years lag. Nitrification capacity of the soils of treatments B and C were twice as high as those of treatment A. Consequently, beginning 2002 application rates of organic amendments were reduced. Yet, no decline in nutrients levels in the organic treatments could be detected over the period 2002 – 2004, presumably due to continued mineralisation of the OM pool. In 2004 various soil microbial characteristics (microbial counts, fl uorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, functional richness and diversity) were determined. In all these parameters the organic treatments showed higher levels than treatment A. From the autumn of 2002 on, stem circumference are similar for all treatments and for all species. No statistical differences could be found among the treatments in any of the tested species for the 3 year cumulative yields. It can be concluded that once a significant buildup of organic matter in the soil is occurring, organic matter application can be reduced considerably, as a signifi cant <b>soil’s</b> <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> has been built...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} and survival or disappearance of civilizations {{has been based}} on the performance of soils to provide food, fibre, and further essential goods for humans. Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21 st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high soil productivity in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the soil productivity function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>potential</b> on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of <b>potential</b> <b>soil</b> and land <b>productivity.</b> Their soil data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also, that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method "Le profil cultural" and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the soil's productivity function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking <b>soil</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>potentials</b> on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the soil productivity function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds...|$|R

Estimating the agricultural <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> and assessing its response to cultivated land changes could provide a scientific basis for strategic decision-making concerning grain production and thus guarantee food security. In the present study, the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model was applied to estimate the agricultural <b>potential</b> <b>productivity.</b> Data from the second national land survey were first applied to characterize the changes of cultivated land (by comparing the cultivated land in 2009 with that in 2012) and their influence on <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> in Mainland China.

Supplement cropland was mainly from ecological reclamation (77. 78 %) and was mainly distributed in Northeast China and Northwest China with poor climatic and natural conditions. Occupation cropland was mainly used for construction (52. 88 %) and ecological restoration (44. 78 %) purposes, and was mainly distributed in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, and the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River with better climatic and natural conditions. 2) The climate conditions were quite different in supplement and occupation cropland areas.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> {{of forests}} is an {{important}} parameter {{in the evaluation of}} vegetation as a carbon sink. At the same time, <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> can be considered as an indicator of growth conditions and also as a measure of available fuel loads, which, in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, are a main factor of regional fire incidence. The present work deals with the relationship between an estimation of forest <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> and the fire incidence registered in peninsular Spain. Fire incidence was characterized by means of several fire regime variables. In order to contrast the patterns obtained, a similar analysis of the relationship between fire regime and human population density was also carried out. The results show that higher fire incidence was registered in more productive areas. <b>Potential</b> <b>productivity</b> was correlated to variables related to the number of fires and to the area burned, whereas the population density was also correlated to the number of fire variables and to the area burned, but with lower correlation coefficients. Although it is difficult to establish cause-and-effect relationships between complex phenomena that depend on a large number of factors, finding statistically significant relationships between fire incidence and the estimation of <b>potential</b> forest <b>productivity</b> used over a long time period is considered very relevant.

40|$|<b>Soil</b> water <b>potential</b> is a <b>soil</b> {{property}} affecting a large {{variety of}} bio-physical processes, such as seed germination, plant growth and plant nutrition. Gradients in <b>soil</b> water <b>potential</b> are the driving forces of water movement, affecting water infiltration, redistribution, percolation, evaporation and plants’ transpiration. The total <b>soil</b> water <b>potential</b> {{is given by}} the sum of gravity, matric, osmotic and hydrostatic potential. The quantification of the <b>soil</b> water <b>potential</b> is necessary {{for a variety of}} applications both in agricultural and horticultural systems such as optimization of irrigation volumes and fertilization. In recent decades, a large number of experimental methods have been developed to measure the <b>soil</b> water <b>potential,</b> and a large body of knowledge is now available on theory and applications. In this review, the main techniques used to measure the <b>soil</b> water <b>potential</b> are discussed. Subsequently, some examples are provided where the measurement of <b>soil</b> water <b>potential</b> is utilized for a sustainable use of water resources in agriculture. soil water potential; water use; irrigation; agriculture...|$|R

Aside from the educational level employers use the field of study as signal for <b>potential</b> <b>productivity.</b> They rank graduates from different fields of study into a labour queue according to potential training costs and match it to a second queue of vacant jobs sorted by skill requirements (Thurow 1975). If students are able to complete the most challenging fields, they indicate lower training costs in the future and have a higher probability of fulfilling the requirements of a demanding job.|$|R

Transpiration rate decreased with reduction in soil water potential; transpiration rate dropped at <b>soil</b> water <b>potentials</b> lower than pF 3. 0. This fact suggests that the reduction in <b>soil</b> water <b>potential</b> restricts water uptake in roots and causes a decrease in leaf water potential, which results in lower transpiration rate through stomatal response to the leaf water potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{for agriculture}} is a mathematical tool {{that allows us}} to weigh the effects of factors, environmental or management on crop productivity. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency of mathematical models, in the estimation of the productivity of maize over the need for nitrogen fertilization. Estimates of nitrogen fertilization were performed to obtain the <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> and depleted grain yield and silage corn genotypes. The Model 1 was based on estimates obtained in the literature and Model 2 on estimates generated by the proposed alternative model, calibrated with data observed in the experiment. To evaluate the performance of the models we used statistical indicators, such as Pearson correlation coefficient, Willmott agreement index, the performance index of Camargo, percentage deviation and medium square error. Recommendations of nitrogen generated by the models for the <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> and depleted much grain as silage were higher compared with the recommendations of the culture ways. The AG 30 A 91 genotype had a higher leaf area index, reflecting higher estimates of <b>potential</b> <b>productivity</b> and depleted grain and silage. The model 2 can be used to estimate the yield of grain and silage and the need for simulation of nitrogen for grain production, however, requires adjustments to estimate nitrogen needs for the production of silage. Both models are efficient in simulating the crop cycle...|$|R
