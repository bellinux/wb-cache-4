He <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> helmet to the turf once he reached the sideline, then hobbled down a tunnel. After the game, Chiefs head coach Herman Edwards announced that Croyle would miss the remainder of the 2008 season.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{made his}} mixed martial arts debut on January 1, 1998 at Joe Gaytia's JKD Challenge. He <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> {{opponent}} {{to the ground}} in just fifteen seconds, winning via KO. The slam became his signature move. He won his next fight via submission due to strikes. Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21, on October 17, 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC Midleweight Champion Dave Menne via unanimous decision. In the third fight of that night he lost to then-undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission (guillotine choke) at 0:17 of the first round. The result was announced as a KO.

With Slick as a distraction, the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match. After crushing Koko in {{between himself and the}} turnbuckle with a jumping Avalanche, Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match. Instead, he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Koko stomach-first, but missed. The Bird Man then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin. Boss Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned, and he <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> opponent into the mat, allowing him to pin Koko for the win.|$|E
500|$|Although {{not highly}} {{thought of as}} a batsman, Poyntz was known for being able to hit the ball hard. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he is described as lacking [...] "technique and consistency" [...] by David Foot, but obituaries suggest that his shortage of talent was offset by application of effort. Wisden declared him [...] "an excellent fielder", but Foot is more reserved, describing him as a [...] "passable slip fielder". Sammy Woods was Poyntz's godfather, while Poyntz in turn acted as a godfather to John Daniell's son Nigel. David Foot portrays an element of caricature about Poyntz, describing him as, [...] "a tall man who <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> hair back with a distinctive parting in the middle." [...] He also related a story from a Somerset teammate in which Poyntz claimed that he could trace him family {{all the way back to}} William the Conqueror, and had a massive coat of arms in his Bristol flat.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{then called}} for Stevenson {{to give a}} full {{accounting}} of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. [...] "Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> pencil down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.|$|E

500|$|Faced {{with intense}} {{competition}} from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking, and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog, {{although he did not}} {{go so far as to}} give up the cocktails or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: [...] "Who let a Russian in here?" [...] During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news he <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relation officer feared he might have broken it.|$|E

2500|$|An {{exhibition}} of Doherty's paintings titled, [...] "Art of the Albion", {{took place at}} the Galerie Chappe in Paris from 25 April to 25 May 2008. The exhibit caused controversy due to artworks made with Doherty's own blood. According to newspapers, anti-drug campaigners were enraged and accused Doherty of glamourising illegal substance abuse. Art experts were similarly unimpressed. David West, the owner of London's Decima gallery, for example, <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> work: [...] "It's not got any artistic merit. He's using his blood to make them interesting, {{but when you look at}} them they're what any four-year-old can do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, 80-year-old Zholtovsky {{became the}} subject of a witch-hunt once again. With no {{apparent}} reason, small-time critics <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> works and his role in education.

In February 1949, a [...] "professional round table" [...] branded his Bolshaya Kaluzhskaya House as formalist, condemned Zholtovsky’s educational efforts, and virtually excommunicated him from practice for a year. Suddenly, fortune turned around, and in March, 1950 Zholtovsky was awarded Stalin Prize, second class – for the same building that was ostracized a year before. By 1952, critics praised it as the way to build.|$|E

[...] He grabbed the drop hammer and threw it across the Missouri River, {{at which point the}} earth where the hammer fell buckled. [...] The hammer fall created Nebraska's Missouri River breaks. [...] Barada was still angry and <b>slammed</b> <b>his</b> fist down on a pile. [...] It was driven so far into the soil that it pierced a water table. [...] Legend says that all of Nebraska would have flooded from this bung hole if Antoine Barada hadn't plugged it by sitting over it.
