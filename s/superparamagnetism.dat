50|$|There {{are various}} {{other types of}} magnetism, such as spin glass, <b>superparamagnetism,</b> superdiamagnetism, and metamagnetism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superparamagnetism</b> {{occurs in}} {{nanoparticles}} which are single-domain, i.e. {{composed of a}} single magnetic domain. This is possible when their diameter is below 3-50 nm, depending on the materials. In this condition, it is considered that the magnetization of the nanoparticles is a single giant magnetic moment, sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle. Those {{in the field of}} <b>superparamagnetism</b> call this “macro-spin approximation”.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superparamagnetism</b> {{occurs in}} {{ferromagnetic}} and ferrimagnetic nanoparticles which are single-domain, i.e. {{composed of a}} single magnetic domain. This is possible when their diameter is below 3-50 nm, depending on the materials. In this condition, it is considered that the magnetization of the nanoparticles is a single giant magnetic moment, sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle. This is what people {{working in the field}} of <b>superparamagnetism</b> call the “macro-spin approximation”.|$|E
50|$|The {{extreme of}} this is <b>superparamagnetism</b> which only occurs in small {{ferromagnetic}} particles and is where fluctuations are very influential causing magnetic moments to change direction randomly and thus create disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superparamagnetism</b> sets a {{limit on}} the storage density of hard disk drives due to the minimum size of {{particles}} that can be used. This limit {{is known as the}} superparamagnetic limit.|$|E
50|$|Normally, any {{ferromagnetic}} or {{ferrimagnetic material}} undergoes {{a transition to}} a paramagnetic state above its Curie temperature. <b>Superparamagnetism</b> is different from this standard transition since it occurs below the Curie temperature of the material.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of magnetic nanoparticles largely depend on the synthesis method and chemical structure. In most cases, the particles range from 1 to 100 nm in size and may display <b>superparamagnetism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{small size}} of nanomagnets {{prevents}} the formation of magnetic domains (see single domain (magnetic)). The magnetization dynamics of sufficiently small nanomagnets at low temperatures, typically single-molecule magnets, presents quantum phenomena, such as macroscopic spin tunnelling. At larger temperatures, the magnetization undergoes random thermal fluctuations (<b>superparamagnetism)</b> which present a limit {{for the use of}} nanomagnets for permanent information storage.|$|E
5000|$|Adding thermal {{fluctuations}}: Thermal fluctuations make jumps between stable states possible, {{reducing the}} hysteresis in the system. Pfeiffer added {{the effect of}} thermal fluctuations to the Stoner-Wohlfarth model. This makes the hysteresis dependent {{on the size of}} the magnetic particle. As the particle size (and the time between jumps) decreases, it eventually crosses over into <b>superparamagnetism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other size-dependent {{property}} changes include {{quantum confinement}} in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles and <b>superparamagnetism</b> in magnetic materials. What would appear ironic {{is that the}} changes in physical properties are not always desirable. Ferromagnetic materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their magnetisation direction using room temperature thermal energy, thus making them unsuitable for memory storage.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949 French {{physicist}} Louis Néel (1904-2000) {{discovered that}} when they are finely divided, ferromagnetic nanoparticles lose their hysteresis below a certain size; this phenomenon is known as <b>superparamagnetism.</b> The magnetization of these materials {{is subject to the}} applied field, which is highly non-linear.This curve is well described by the Langevin function, but for weak fields it can be simply written as: ...|$|E
5000|$|Suppose {{that the}} {{magnetization}} {{of a single}} superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured over a time [...] If this time {{is much greater than}} the relaxation time , the nanoparticle magnetization will flip several times during the measurement. In zero field, the measured magnetization will average to zero. If , the magnetization will not flip during the measurement, so the measured magnetization will be equal to the initial magnetization. In the former case, the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will be blocked in its initial state. The state of the nanoparticle (superparamagnetic or blocked) depends on the measurement time. A transition between <b>superparamagnetism</b> and the blocked state occurs when [...] In several experiments, the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied, so the transition between <b>superparamagnetism</b> and blocked state {{is a function of the}} temperature. The temperature for which [...] is called the blocking temperature: ...|$|E
5000|$|Let us {{imagine that}} the {{magnetization}} of a single superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured and let us define [...] as the measurement time. If , the nanoparticle magnetization will flip {{several times during the}} measurement, then the measured magnetization will average to zero. If , the magnetization will not flip during the measurement, so the measured magnetization will be what the instantaneous magnetization was {{at the beginning of the}} measurement. In the former case, the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will appear to be “blocked” in its initial state. The state of the nanoparticle (superparamagnetic or blocked) depends on the measurement time. A transition between <b>superparamagnetism</b> and blocked state occurs when [...] In several experiments, the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied, so the transition between <b>superparamagnetism</b> and blocked state is seen as a function of the temperature. The temperature for which [...] is called the blocking temperature: ...|$|E
50|$|Nanoparticles are {{of great}} {{scientific}} interest {{as they are}} effectively a bridge between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures. A bulk material should have constant physical properties regardless of its size, but at the nano-scale this is often not the case. Size-dependent properties are observed such as quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles and <b>superparamagnetism</b> in magnetic materials.|$|E
5000|$|Although pure single-domain {{particles}} (mathematically) exist for some special geometries only, for most ferromagnets {{a state of}} quasi-uniformity of magnetization is achieved when {{the diameter of the}} particle is in between about [...] nanometers and [...] nanometers (Chris Binns, Introduction to Nanoscience and Technology, page 31, Wiley). The size range is bounded below by the transition to <b>superparamagnetism</b> and above by the formation of multiple magnetic domains.|$|E
50|$|In <b>superparamagnetism</b> (a form of magnetism), the Néel effect appears when a superparamagnetic {{material}} in a conducting coil {{is subject to}} varying frequencies of magnetic fields. The non-linearity of the superparamagnetic material acts as a frequency mixer, with voltage measured at the coil terminals. It consists of several frequency components, at the initial frequency and at the frequencies of certain linear combinations. The frequency shift of the field to be measured allows for detection of a direct current field with a standard coil.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic beads {{are made}} of nanometric-sized iron oxide {{particles}} encapsulated or glued together with polymers. These magnetic beads range from 35 nm up to 4.5μm. The component magnetic nanoparticles range from 5 to 50 nm and exhibit a unique quality referred to as <b>superparamagnetism</b> {{in the presence of}} an externally applied magnetic field. First discovered by Frenchman Louis Néel, Nobel Physics Prize winner in 1970, this superparamagnetic quality has already been used for medical application in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and in biological separations, but not yet for labeling in commercial diagnostic applications.Magnetic labels exhibit several features very well adapted for such applications: ...|$|E
50|$|Iron-platinum {{nanoparticles}} (FePt NPs) are 3D superlattices {{composed of}} an approximately equal atomic ratio of Fe and Pt. Under standard conditions, FePt NPs {{exist in the}} face centered cubic phase but can change to a chemically ordered face centered tetragonal phase {{as a result of}} thermal annealing. Currently there are many synthetic methods such as water-in-oil microemulsion, one-step thermal synthesis with metal precursors, and exchanged-coupled assembly for making FePt NPs. An important property of FePt NPs is their superparamagnetic character below 10 nanometers. The <b>superparamagnetism</b> of FePt NPs has made them attractive candidates to be used as MRI/CT scanning agents and a high-density recording material.|$|E
5000|$|In {{existing}} {{hard disk}} drives, data {{is stored in}} a thin magnetic film. This film is deposited so that it consists of isolated (weakly exchange coupled) grains of material of around 8 nm diameter. One bit of data consists of around 20-30 grains that are magnetized {{in the same direction}} (either [...] "up" [...] or [...] "down", with respect to the plane of the disk). One method of increasing storage density has been to reduce the average grain volume. However, the energy barrier for thermal switching is proportional to the grain volume. With existing materials, further reductions in the grain volume would result in data loss occurring spontaneously due to <b>superparamagnetism.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Superpara{{magnetism}}</b> {{is a form}} of magnetism {{which appears}} in small ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles. In sufficiently small nanoparticles, magnetization can randomly flip direction under the influence of temperature. The typical time between two flips is called the Néel relaxation time. In the absence of an external magnetic field, when the time used to measure the magnetization of the nanoparticles is much longer than the Néel relaxation time, their magnetization appears to be in average zero; they are said to be in the superparamagnetic state. In this state, an external magnetic field is able to magnetize the nanoparticles, similarly to a paramagnet. However, their magnetic susceptibility is much larger than that of paramagnets.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{exchange}} interaction keeps spins aligned, {{it does not}} align them in a particular direction. Without magnetic anisotropy, the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to thermal fluctuations and the magnet is superparamagnetic. There are several kinds of magnetic anisotropy, {{the most common of}} which is magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystallographic lattice. Another common source of anisotropy, inverse magnetostriction, is induced by internal strains. Single-domain magnets also can have a shape anisotropy due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape. As the temperature of a magnet increases, the anisotropy tends to decrease, and there is often a blocking temperature at which a transition to <b>superparamagnetism</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|Owing {{to their}} large {{magnetic}} moment (µ2 = 63µB2) Gd3+ ions {{are the most}} popular MRI contrast agents. They are toxic in aqueous solutions, but can be neutralized by chelation or by encapsulating them into carbon nanotubes or fullerenes, resulting in gadonanotubes and gadofullerenes. The as-prepared nanotubes have their ends capped by carbon that hinders their filling. They are cut open by a chemical or/and ultrasonic treatment, and their side walls are chemically modified (functionalized) to impart solubility in water and biological compatibility. Then the nanotubes are sonicated in an aqueous solution of GdCl3 to form gadonanotubes, where the Gd3+ forms clusters of 2-5 nm diameter which contain up to 10 ions. The small size of the clusters is responsible for the <b>superparamagnetism</b> and superior MRI contrast properties of gadonanotubes. The non-encapsulated Gd is removed by repeated washing with water.|$|E
50|$|In {{hyperthermia}} application, the nanoparticles form a ferrofluid in the blood. They {{move and}} rotate randomly in the fluid, exhibiting Brownian motion. When {{a magnetic field}} is applied to them, magnetic nanoparticles rotate and align with the magnetic field. The magnetization of nanoparticles can spontaneously change their orientation {{under the influence of}} thermal energy, a phenomenon called <b>superparamagnetism.</b> The magnetization of the nanoparticle is also reversed when an applied magnetic field is large enough to suppress the energy barrier between the two equilibrium positions, a phenomenon which is known as the Stoner-Wohlfarth model of magnetization reversal. In the most general case, the reversal of the magnetization is due to a combination of the three mechanisms described above. For instance, for a single domain nanoparticle that is inside a fluid at room temperature and a sweeping magnetic field is suddenly applied in a direction opposite to the one of the nanoparticle magnetization. At the same time, i) the nanoparticle will rotate in the fluid, ii) the barrier between the two equilibrium positions of the magnetization will decrease, iii) when the energy barrier becomes of the order of the thermal energy, the magnetization will switch (if the nanoparticle is not already aligned with the magnetic field due to its physical rotation).|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} <b>superparamagnetism</b> and {{controllable}} shape, size, and surface, iron-platinum nanoparticles have {{great potential for}} advancing medicine in many fields, including imagining, pathogen detection, and targeted cancer therapy. The NPs can be conjugated with antibodies for tissue-specific delivery, providing a systematic way to customize for either technology. FePt NPs are compatible for CT scans because of their strong ability to absorb x-rays. FePt NPs also provide a non-toxic, more persistent alternative to iodinated molecules that are harmful to the kidney and survive in the body for only a short time.The superparamagnetic properties of the nanoparticles and the systematic method for conjugating ligands to the FePt surface makes them viable vehicles for detection of pathogens such as gram-positive bacteria. Antibodies for the bacteria conjugated to the FePt NP bind to the bacteria and magnetic dipoles are used to detect the FePt NP-bacteria conjugate. By attaching peptides {{to the surface of}} the face centered cubic FePt NPs, cytotoxic iron can be delivered to specific locations and taken up with high selectivity. A phospholipid coating of the FCC-FePt prevents Fe release. Once in the cell, the low pH of lysosome’s intracellular environments breaks down the phospholipid bilayer. Fe catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into ROSs results in membrane lipid oxidation, damage to DNA and proteins, and tumor death.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{broadest}} sense this definition can include porous media, colloids, gels and copolymers, but is more usually taken to mean the solid combination of a bulk matrix and nano-dimensional phase(s) differing in properties due to dissimilarities in structure and chemistry. The mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, electrochemical, catalytic properties of the nanocomposite will differ markedly {{from that of the}} component materials. Size limits for these effects have been proposed, <5 nm for catalytic activity, <20 nm for making a hard magnetic material soft, <50 nm for refractive index changes, and <100 nm for achieving <b>superparamagnetism,</b> mechanical strengthening or restricting matrix dislocation movement. Nanocomposites are found in nature, for example {{in the structure of the}} abalone shell and bone. The use of nanoparticle-rich materials long predates the understanding of the physical and chemical nature of these materials. Jose-Yacaman et al. investigated the origin of the depth of colour and the resistance to acids and bio-corrosion of Maya blue paint, attributing it to a nanoparticle mechanism. From the mid-1950s nanoscale organo-clays have been used to control flow of polymer solutions (e.g. as paint viscosifiers) or the constitution of gels (e.g. as a thickening substance in cosmetics, keeping the preparations in homogeneous form). By the 1970s polymer/clay composites were the topic of textbooks, although the term [...] "nanocomposites" [...] was not in common use.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a technique to}} optically characterize <b>superparamagnetism.</b> Faraday rotation measurements are performed on a superparamagnetic nanocomposite using small alternating current magnetic fields. The <b>superparamagnetism</b> of the iron oxide nanoparticles causes signals at the uneven harmonics of the magnetic field frequency. These signals provide information on the magnetic moment of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Dia- and paramagnetism do not cause signals at higher harmonics, resulting in a high sensitivity to <b>superparamagnetism,</b> even in samples with large dia- or paramagnetic contributions. This technique provides a rapid, economical method to characterize <b>superparamagnetism</b> in composite samples not easily accessible by other techniques. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} nature of {{magnetic}} ordering in Mn-doped ZnO thin films that exhibited ferromagnetism at 300 K and <b>superparamagnetism</b> at 5 K.

By obtaining a qualitative agreement between these two models, we attribute the ferromagnetism to the s-d exchange-induced spin splitting that was indicated by large positive magnetoresistance (∼ 40 %).

30|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} show remarkable new phenomena {{such as high}} field irreversibility, high saturation field, <b>superparamagnetism,</b> extra anisotropy contributions, or shifted loops after field cooling. These phenomena {{arise from}} narrow and finite-size effects and surface effects that dominate the magnetic behavior of individual nanoparticles [44]. Frenkel and Dorfman [45] {{were the first to}} predict that a particle of ferromagnetic material, below a critical particle size (< 15 nm for the common materials), would consist of a single magnetic domain, i.e., a particle that {{is in a state of}} uniform magnetization at any field. The magnetization behavior of these particles above a certain temperature, i.e., the blocking temperature, is identical to that of atomic paramagnets (<b>superparamagnetism)</b> except that large susceptibilities and, thus, an extremely large moment are involved [46].|$|E

The superparamagnetic blocking temperature of 3 nm cobalt particles has been increased to above room temperature. The choice of Cr 2 O 3 is vital as its TN is higher compared to other antiferromagnetic materials {{used for this purpose}} such as CoO.
