40|$|Background: CTCs are {{promising}} biomarkers in mCRPC, and telomerase activity (TA) is a recognized cancer marker. In this phase III trial we analyzed CTCs using 2 methods: CellSearch for fixed cell enumeration, and a novel Parylene-C <b>slot</b> <b>filter</b> for live CTC capture and TA measurement. Methods: Blood samples (7. 5 ml) were drawn at baseline (d 1) and pre-cycle 2 (d 21) of Rx and shipped overnight for central processing. For CellSearch enumeration, Cox regression {{was used to}} evaluate the association between OS, baseline CTC counts, and CTC dynamics (d 1 to d 21). For TA, filter-trapped cells were lysed and assayed for TA using qPCR-based telomeric repeat amplification. Cox regression evaluated the association between OS and TA overall and within subgroups characterized by good vs. poor (= 5) prognosis baseline CTC counts. For all measurements, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis and characteristics and regression trees (CART) were used to explore further prognostic cutpoints. Results: Samples were obtained from 263 men. Median d 1 CTC count was 5, and {{there was a significant difference}} in OS for d 1 CTC = 5, hazard ratio (HR) 2. 92 (p = 5), a >= 2 -fold decrease in CTC was associated with longer OS, HR 0. 45 (p= 0. 012); adjusting for risk factors. For TA, men with baseline CTC >= 5 (41 % of cohort) who had high CTC TA had HR 1. 14 (p = 5, TA from cells live-captured on a new <b>slot</b> <b>filter</b> constitutes the first CTC-derived biomarker prognostic of OS in a prospective clinical trial...|$|E

A 13 <b>slot</b> <b>filter</b> wheel {{will be used to}} provide spectral information in order for the JANUS experiment to study the geology and physical properties of Ganymede, Europa and Io, and to investigate processes and structures in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The sensor selected for JANUS is the back-thinned CIS 115, a 3 MPixel CMOS Image Sensor from e 2 v technologies. The CIS 115 has a 4 -Transistor pixel design with a pinned photodiode to improve signal to noise performance by reducing dark current and allowing for reset level subtraction. The JUICE mission will consist of an 8 year cruise phase followed by a 3 year science phase in the Jovian system. Models of the radiation environment throughout the JUICE mission predict that the End of Life (EOL) non-ionising damage will be equivalent to 10 ^ 10 protons cm^- 2 (10 MeV) and the EOL ionising dose will be 100 krad(Si), once the shielding from the spacecraft and instrument design is taken into account. An extensive radiation campaign is therefore being carried out to qualify and characterise the CIS 115 for JANUS, as well as other space and terrestrial applications. Radiation testing to take the CIS 115 to twice the ionising dose and displacement damage levels was completed in 2015 and the change in sensor performance has been characterised. Good sensor performance has been observed following irradiation and a summary of the key results from the campaign using gamma irradiation (ionising dose) will be presented here, including its soft X-ray detection capabilities, flat-band voltage shift and readout noise. In 2016, further radiation campaigns on flight-representative CIS 115 s will be undertaken and their results will be disseminated in future publications...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{characterize}} the rejection of oil emulsion by two tubular surface filters, namely 13 μm slots and 4 μm circular pores. A 17 mm helix was incorporated inside the filters to increase the wall shear stress.

Since the 1960 s, public well fields have been installed in this aquifer for water table control and for providing supplementary i rigation water. The early well designs utilized unprotected mild steel components, creens with saw-cut <b>slots</b> and <b>filter</b> packs of 'pea gravel'.

However, long-term performance monitoring has disclosed slow but serious well deterioration, the causes of which are still not understood. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this deterioration is at least partly due to some chemical mechanism, probably affecting the formation/gravel filter interface.

By switching the PIN diodes, the proposed design can operate in either wideband or narrowband modes. When the antenna operates in the narrowband state, two varactor diodes are used to continuously tune the narrowband frequency from 2. 55 to 3. 2 [*]GHz, while the wideband state is obtained over the 1. 35 – 6. 2 [*]GHz band.

The equilibrium flux and deposit thickness correlated with shear stress, regardless of: <b>filter</b> type (metal <b>slotted</b> surface <b>filter</b> or homogeneous sintered filter); and mode of oscillation. Shear stress values up to 240 Pa were used and the particle compact believed to be at, or near, the deposited solids showed non-Newtonian flow behaviour described by the Herschel-Bulkley equation.

The existence of a yield stress in the compact appeared to limit the internal fouling of the matrix (homogeneous) type of filter, which had a membrane thickness of 8 mm, but did not demonstrate significant internal fouling over time, nor between filtrations.

The features of the lens are: a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, a distance window with infrared index, the ability to limit the focus range, a focus-preset mechanism, {{and the ability to}} set the AF speed. The maximum aperture of 5.6 gives this lens the ability to create depth of field effects. The optical construction of the lens contains 13 lens elements, including two large fluorite lens elements. The lens uses an inner focusing system, powered by a ring type USM motor. Manual focusing is rendered by wire: the lens does not have a direct mechanical connection to the focusing ring, instead detecting rotation of the focusing ring and using the lens motor to drive the lens elements. The manual focus speed is adjustable: 1 = 1/2 standard (for precision), 2 = standard and 3 = 2x standard (for fast-moving subjects). The front of the lens does not rotate nor extend when focusing. It does not have a typical rotating tripod mount like other telephoto lenses. However, the lens mount can be rotated and locked, allowing the lens to be used in horizontal and vertical shot formats. It is compatible with the Canon Extender EF teleconverters. The lens uses a small <b>slot</b> to insert <b>filters</b> near the base of the lens, similar to other super-tele lenses, rather than the conventional attachment {{at the end of the}} barrel.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of contemporary SHF systems {{calls for a}} broad nomenclature of frequency-selective devices, band-pass filters in particular. One of the possible directions of filter design is the usage of electromagnetic-bandgap (EBG) structures, which can be implemented {{in the form of}} certain slots in a microstrip line’s ground plane. It was previously proposed to use these structures as parts of output matching networks of high-efficiency SHF amplifiers built according to harmonic-manipulation approach. The use of the mentioned structures would be more effective if they themselves could perform as matching network. By utilizing the results of theoretical and experimental research of harmonic filters built on microstrip line’s ground plane slots, let’s consider design of networks that are capable of performing other relevant function in addition to that of band-reject filters. The goal of the current work is to investigate the possibility of application of the microstrip line’s ground plane <b>slot</b> resonators (band-reject <b>filters)</b> to the design of band-pass filters. This research can also contribute to the design of such output matching networks of SHF amplifiers that must simultaneously perform the tasks of harmonics filtering and impedance matching on the fundamental frequency of amplifier’s operation. In order to achieve this task a band-pass filter was proposed and studied theoretically and experimentally. The filter includes two sections of band-reject filters, each section consisting of two slot resonator located in microstrip line’s ground plane, while the line section with slots at the same time works as a part of three-section band-pass <b>filter.</b> Each <b>slot</b> resonator can be represented as a parallel resonant circuit connected serially into the transmission line. Parameters of the parallel resonant circuit are calculated from the known resonant frequency of the slot resonator and wave impedance of the slot line. The characteristics of the filter were calculated with the aid of ABCD matrices. The matrices represented every slot, line sections between the slots and variation of the line’s characteristic impedance (the width of microstrip line). The results of calculation were compared with results of electromagnetic simulation and experimental study of the filter test sample. The considered filter was found to have characteristics similar to that of a filter built on half-wave resonators, but the signal suppression in the upper pass-band was much higher compared with situation when only a step-like variation of characteristic impedance was used in the filter. Herewith the overall length of the <b>filter</b> with <b>slot</b> resonators was not higher than that of the prototype. Using a test sample of the three-section filter manufactured on Rogers 3010 material with thickness 0. 635 mm and nominal relative permittivity e = 10. 2 the signal suppression in 2. 0 – 3. 6 GHz band was measured to be within the range of 0. 1 to 3 dB, while in 4. 6 – 6 GHz band the signal suppression was found to be more than 20 dB.
