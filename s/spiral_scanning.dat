25|$|As chance {{would have}} it, in July 1940 Hodgkin had been {{introduced}} to A.W. Whitaker of Nash and Thompson, best known for their work on powered gun turrets. They {{began to talk about}} the scanning problem, and Hodgkin described their current solution of moving the dipole {{at the center of the}} parabola up and down while moving the parabola itself right and left. Hodgkin was not convinced this was a good solution and was proven correct when Whitaker built their first version of such a system in November. They found that the two motions combined to cause enormous vibrations in the entire system. Lovell and Hodgkin considered the problem and came up with the idea of causing the parabolic reflector to rotate around the axis extending from the nose of the aircraft, tracing out circles. By smoothly increasing the angle of the reflector compared to the forward axis while the circular motion continued, the net effect was a <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning</b> pattern. Whitaker was able to rapidly build such a system, scanning out a cone-shaped area 45degrees on either side of the nose.|$|E

The second regime accomplishes a <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning,</b> i. e., a circular scanning with variable strength, to overcome the problem of small duration of RF period.

40|$|Abstract: For {{applications}} in bolus-chasing CT angiography and electron-beam micro-CT, the backprojection-filtration (BPF) formula developed by Zou and Pan was recently generalized by Ye et al. to reconstruct images from cone-beam data collected along a rather flexible scanning locus, including a nonstandard spiral. A major {{implication of the}} generalized BPF formula {{is that it can}} be applied for n-PI-window-based reconstruction in the nonstandard <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning</b> case. In this paper, we design an n-PI-window-based BPF algorithm, and report the numerical simulation results with the 3 D Shepp-Logan phantom and Defrise Disk phantom. The proposed BPF algorithm consists of three steps: cone-beam data differentiation, weighted backprojection, and inverse Hilbert filtration. Our simulated results demonstrate the feasibility and merits of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear viscoelastic methodology for modelling probe–surface interactions and so explores the signal fidelity in stylus based surface metrology. A novel model is introduced {{to simulate the}} nonlinear contact behaviour between the stylus tip and the measured surface. After briefly describing existing models of contact between solid bodies, a modified nonlinear viscoelastic contact model is introduced into the dynamic modelling of the stylus instrument. Based on this model, two scanning modes, i. e., raster scanning and <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning,</b> have been examined for high-speed measurement of a circular sinusoidal XY grid. The tip flight and residual vibrations associated with start-up transients are shown to have potentially serious effects on the signal fidelity during fast surface scanning. The effects of the scanning speed and direction have been investigated to show the influences of the scanning methodologies on the measurement. It is demonstrated that the <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning</b> methodology has inherent advantages for fast scanning with acceptable measurement accuracy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare image quality, {{radiation}} dose, {{and their}} relationship with heart rate of computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiographic scan protocols by using a 128 -section dual-source CT scanner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approved the study; all patients gave informed consent. Two hundred seventy-two patients (175 men, 97 women; mean ages, 58 and 59 years, respectively) referred for CT coronary angiography were categorized according to heart rate: less than 65 beats per minute (group A) and 65 beats per minute or greater (group B). Patients were randomized to undergo prospective high-pitch <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning</b> and narrow-window prospective sequential scanning in group A (n = 160) or wide-window prospective sequential scanning and retrospective <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning</b> in group B (n = 112). Image quality was graded (1 = nondiagnostic; 2 = artifacts present, diagnostic; 3 = no artifacts) and compared (Mann-Whitney and Student t tests). RESULTS: In group A, mean image quality grade was significantly lower with high-pitch spiral versus sequential scanning (2. 67 ± 0. 38 [standard deviation] vs 2. 86 ± 0. 21; P <. 001). In a subpopulation (heart rate, < 55 beats per minute), mean image quality grade was similar (2. 81 ± 0. 30 vs 2. 94 ± 0. 08; P =. 35). In group B, image quality grade was comparable between sequential and retrospective <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning</b> (2. 81 ± 0. 28 vs 2. 80 ± 0. 38; P =. 54). Mean estimated radiation dose was significantly lower (high-pitch spiral vs sequential scanning) in group A (for 100 kV, 0. 81 mSv ± 0. 30 vs 2. 74 mSv ± 1. 14 [P <. 001]; for 120 kV, 1. 65 mSv ± 0. 69 vs 4. 21 mSv ± 1. 20 [P <. 001]) and in group B (sequential vs retrospective <b>spiral</b> <b>scanning)</b> (for 100 kV, 4. 07 mSv ± 1. 07 vs 5. 54 mSv ± 1. 76 [P =. 02]; for 120 kV, 7. 50 mSv ± 1. 79 vs 9. 83 mSv ± 3. 49 [P =. 1]).

For long objects, however, it is highly desirable to scan only the portion of the object that is of interest, for the sake of reduction in scan time as well as radiation protection of the patient in medical imaging.

Within the thesis, I also compare the aspects of radiation burden, time and financial requirements and last but not least the overall burden on the patient {{over the course of the}} examination. The comparison was performed by calculating a typical effective dose in a sample of fifty patients examined by intravenous excretion urography and fifty patients examined by <b>spiral</b> CT <b>scan.</b> The results are shown in graph format. These results did not confirm the hypothesis that the radiation burden is lower in <b>spiral</b> CT <b>scanning.</b> The doses determined in my thesis are up to three times higher in the CT scan. In financial terms, both imaging techniques have been evaluated as almost comparable and the price of the examination should not influence selection of the method. <b>Spiral</b> CT <b>scanning</b> is much more beneficial when comparing the time needed for performance of the two techniques. The results pertaining to the radiation burden for patients during <b>spiral</b> CT <b>scanning</b> suggest how important the radiology assistant?s ability is in influencing the size of the effective dose by the proper selection and inspection of the exposure parameters when selecting the examination protocol. This statement is further strengthened when comparing the results of this work with those of foreign studies, where the radiation burden on patients examined by <b>spiral</b> CT <b>scanning</b> was one to four times lower than my results of effective doses.
