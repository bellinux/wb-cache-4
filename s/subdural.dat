5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, <b>subdural</b> hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In <b>subdural</b> hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, <b>subdural</b> hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his 2011 arrest, al-Tamimi {{had been}} arrested by Israeli {{authorities}} eleven times, at one point spending {{more than three years}} in administrative detention without trial. In 1993, he lost consciousness for eight days after being shaken during an interrogation, and required surgery for removal of a <b>subdural</b> haematoma. His home has also been designated for demolition by Israel's Civil Administration.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a <b>subdural</b> hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. <b>Subdural</b> hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, <b>subdural</b> hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E
25|$|Electrodes {{can either}} be placed {{directly}} on brain areas of interest or can {{be placed in the}} <b>subdural</b> space of the brain. <b>Subdural</b> electrodes can shift slightly and can be affected by cerebrospinal fluid in the <b>subdural</b> space, which could interfere with the current used to stimulate the brain from the electrodes and possibly cause shunting and dissipate the current, making the stimulation's effect less accurate. However, an advantage of <b>subdural</b> electrode grids is that they can be left in the brain for multiple days, and allow functional testing during stimulation outside the operating room.|$|E
25|$|Acute bleeds often develop {{after high}} speed {{acceleration}} or deceleration injuries and are increasingly severe with larger hematomas. They are most severe if associated with cerebral contusions. Though {{much faster than}} chronic <b>subdural</b> bleeds, acute <b>subdural</b> bleeding is usually venous and therefore slower than the typically arterial bleeding of an epidural hemorrhage. Acute <b>subdural</b> bleeds have a high mortality rate, higher even than epidural hematomas and diffuse brain injuries, because the force (acceleration/deceleration) required to cause them causes other severe injuries as well. The mortality rate associated with acute <b>subdural</b> hematoma is around 60 to 80%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subdural</b> hematomas {{are divided}} into acute, subacute, and chronic, {{depending}} on the speed of their onset. Acute <b>subdural</b> hematomas that are due to trauma are the most lethal of all head injuries and have a high mortality rate {{if they are not}} rapidly treated with surgical decompression.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} shunt drains into the <b>subdural</b> compartment.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of a <b>subdural</b> hematoma {{depends on}} its size and rate of growth. Some small <b>subdural</b> hematomas can be managed by careful {{monitoring}} until the body heals itself. Other small <b>subdural</b> hematomas can be managed by inserting a temporary small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma; this procedure can {{be done at the}} bedside. Large or symptomatic hematomas require a craniotomy, the surgical opening of the skull. A surgeon then opens the dura, removes the blood clot with suction or irrigation, and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. Postoperative complications include increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizure. The injured vessels must be repaired.|$|E
25|$|Other {{risk factors}} for <b>subdural</b> bleeds include taking blood {{thinners}} (anticoagulants), long-term alcohol abuse, dementia, {{and the presence of}} a cerebrospinal fluid leak.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} a chronic <b>subdural</b> hematoma, but without a history of seizures, the {{evidence}} is unclear if using anticonvulsants is harmful or beneficial.|$|E
25|$|In some <b>subdural</b> bleeds, the {{arachnoid}} {{layer of}} the meninges is torn, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood both expand in the intracranial space, increasing pressure.|$|E
25|$|Fujiyama {{inadvertently}} attracted {{attention in}} 2000 after an article {{was published in}} the journal Neurology. The article discussed the possible relationship between riding roller coasters and the occurrence of <b>subdural</b> hematomas. The primary case study cited by the authors was a woman who had reported severe headaches after riding several roller coasters at Fuji-Q Highland (including Fujiyama). Upon investigation, it was discovered that this woman did in fact have a <b>subdural</b> hematoma. Subsequent research, however, has maintained that this risk remains low and is not unique to this particular coaster.|$|E
25|$|A typical adult human EEG {{signal is}} about 10 µV to 100 µV in {{amplitude}} when measured from the scalp {{and is about}} 10–20 mV when measured from <b>subdural</b> electrodes.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} that a person receive medical assessment, including a complete neurological examination, after any head trauma. A CT scan or MRI scan will usually detect significant <b>subdural</b> hematomas.|$|E
25|$|Collected {{blood from}} the <b>subdural</b> bleed may draw in water due to osmosis, causing it to expand, which may {{compress}} brain tissue and cause new bleeds by tearing other blood vessels. The collected blood may even develop its own membrane.|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin may be {{substituted}} for nafcillin if significant concern exists for infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Appropriate therapy should {{take into account the}} primary source of infection as well as possible associated complications such as brain abscess, meningitis, or <b>subdural</b> empyema.|$|E
25|$|The {{injuries}} {{he received}} caused a <b>subdural</b> hematoma, resulting in his death the following morning. Nance died {{alone in his}} apartment. His body was discovered on the bathroom floor by Bulgarini. An autopsy revealed that the actor's blood alcohol level was 0.24% {{at the time of}} his death.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the size}} and deterioration, age of the patient, and {{anaesthetic}} risk posed, <b>subdural</b> hematomas occasionally require craniotomy for evacuation; most frequently, simple burr holes for drainage; often conservative treatment; and rarely, palliative treatment in patients of extreme age or with no chance of recovery.|$|E
25|$|A 1994 {{article in}} Neurology {{suggests}} Mozart {{died of a}} <b>subdural</b> hematoma. A skull believed to be Mozart's was saved by the successor of the gravedigger who had supervised Mozart's burial, and later passed on to anatomist Josef Hyrtl, the municipality of Salzburg, and the Mozarteum museum (Salzburg). Forensic reconstruction of soft tissues related to the skull reveals substantial concordance with Mozart's portraits. Examination of the skull suggested a premature closure of the metopic suture, which has been suggested {{on the basis of}} his physiognomy. A left temporal fracture and concomitant erosions raise the question of a chronic <b>subdural</b> hematoma, which would be consistent with several falls in 1789 and 1790 and could have caused the weakness, headaches, and fainting Mozart experienced in 1790 and 1791. Additionally, aggressive bloodletting used to treat suspected rheumatic fever could have decompensated such a lesion, leading to his death.|$|E
25|$|Signals can {{be either}} <b>subdural</b> or epidural, but are not taken from within the brain {{parenchyma}} itself. It has not been studied extensively until recently due to the limited access of subjects. Currently, the only manner to acquire the signal for study is {{through the use of}} patients requiring invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptogenic focus.|$|E
25|$|Risks {{for late}} PTS include hydrocephalus, reduced {{blood flow to}} the {{temporal}} lobes of the brain, brain contusions, <b>subdural</b> hematomas, a torn dura mater, and focal neurological deficits. PTA that lasts for longer than 24hours after the injury is a risk factor for both early and late PTS. Up to 86% of people who have one late post-traumatic seizure have another within two years.|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{are intended to}} reduce acceleration to (and within) the head due to impact, as a stiff liner made of expanded polystyrene is crushed against the head. However, both the CPSC and the EN 1078 standards only look at linear accelerations and ignore rotational accelerations. The rotational accelerations that arise in bicycle accidents can {{be large enough to}} cause concussions, diffuse axonal injury and <b>subdural</b> haematoma. A few new helmets are designed to reduce rotational accelerations in accidents.|$|E
25|$|Imatinib was {{initially}} {{thought to have}} a potential role {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 <b>subdural</b> hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end.|$|E
25|$|Hypertonic Saline with σ=1 {{has been}} of {{interest}} since early 1980s. Hypertonic Saline which contains sodium chloride works in regulating ICP, intravascular volume and cardiac output without causing significant diuresis, but there are theoretical side effects ranging from neurological complications to <b>subdural</b> hematoma. Hypertonic saline solution has been choice of neuro critical care {{for the past few}} years. Hypertonic Saline solution used varies and could be 3%, 7.5%, 10%, or 24.3% saline solution. When Hypertonic Solution is administered, the dosage is 2 g/kg.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 2010, Chrétien {{complained of}} {{experiencing}} difficulty walking, and {{was admitted to}} a hospital. A brain scan was conducted the next day, and it revealed that a 3 centimeter wide <b>subdural</b> hematoma was pushing 1.5 centimeters into his brain. Emergency surgery was then performed that afternoon, and the blood was successfully drained. He was released from hospital on August 9, 2010. Doctors, who were impressed {{with the speed of}} his recovery, ordered him to rest for two to four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 1% of Emergency Department visits for {{children}} are for headache. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. The {{most common type}} of headache seen in pediatric Emergency Rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5%). Other headaches diagnosed in the Emergency Department include post-traumatic headache (20%), headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (a device put into the brain to remove excess CSF and reduce pressure in the brain) (11.5%) and migraine (8.5%). The most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds (<b>subdural</b> hematoma, epidural hematoma), brain abscesses, meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. Only 4–6.9% of kids with a headache have a serious cause.|$|E
25|$|Basquette's first {{marriage}} was to Sam Warner, film producer {{and co-founder of}} Warner Bros. studio. The two were married on July 4, 1925, despite Warner's family's disapproval because Basquette was not Jewish. They had a daughter, Lita (named after Charlie Chaplin's wife Lita Grey) in October 1926. After suffering severe headaches and a sinus infection aggravated by several abscessed teeth, Warner was admitted to California Lutheran Hospital in September 1927. Doctors discovered that he had developed a mastoid infection that was spreading to his brain. After four surgeries to remove the infection, Warner slipped into a coma. He died of pneumonia caused by sinusitis and epidural and <b>subdural</b> abscesses on October 5, 1927.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} uses of MEG are {{in detecting}} and localizing pathological activity {{in patients with}} epilepsy, and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas. Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, visual cortex, and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on ECoG are considered {{the gold standard for}} localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling <b>subdural</b> grid electrodes. Both are invasive.|$|E
25|$|Bhumibol {{was again}} {{admitted}} to Siriraj Hospital in September 2009, apparently suffering from flu and pneumonia. In 2011, {{it was revealed}} as part of WikiLeaks's leak of United States diplomatic cables that he had suffered from Parkinson's disease and depression. He was diagnosed with diverticulitis in hospital in November 2011, and was treated for the condition in January 2012. Bhumibol suffered minute <b>subdural</b> bleeding in the left frontal area of his brain {{for which he was}} treated in July 2012. Bhumibol left the hospital in July 2013, and travelled to Klai Kangwon Palace at Hua Hin on 2 August 2013, but returned intermittently in the following years, most recently on 1 June 2015. Bhumibol was too ill to appear for the public celebration of his birthday on 5 December 2015, but made a televised appearance on 14 December, his first in several months. The King temporarily left hospital to visit Chitralada Royal Villa on 11 January 2016 but returned later that day.|$|E
25|$|If {{a patient}} with {{epilepsy}} is being considered for resective surgery, it is often necessary to localize the focus (source) of the epileptic brain activity with a resolution greater than what is provided by scalp EEG. This is because the cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp smear the electrical potentials recorded by scalp EEG. In these cases, neurosurgeons typically implant strips and grids of electrodes (or penetrating depth electrodes) under the dura mater, through either a craniotomy or a burr hole. The recording of these signals {{is referred to as}} electrocorticography (ECoG), <b>subdural</b> EEG (sdEEG) or intracranial EEG (icEEG)--all terms for the same thing. The signal recorded from ECoG is on a different scale of activity than the brain activity recorded from scalp EEG. Low voltage, high frequency components that cannot be seen easily (or at all) in scalp EEG can be seen clearly in ECoG. Further, smaller electrodes (which cover a smaller parcel of brain surface) allow even lower voltage, faster components of brain activity to be seen. Some clinical sites record from penetrating microelectrodes.|$|E
500|$|On April26, Johnson and {{two other}} passersbyalso Nation of Islam memberssaw the {{officers}} beating an African-American man with nightsticks. When they attempted to intervene, shouting, [...] "You're not in Alabama...this is New York!" [...] {{one of the officers}} turned on Johnson, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and <b>subdural</b> hemorrhaging. All four African-American men were arrested.|$|E
500|$|Roshan {{received}} a fourth consecutive Filmfare nomination for {{his performance in}} the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, a remake of the 2010 Hollywood release Knight and Day {{and one of the}} most expensive Bollywood films. Playing the role of an eccentric secret agent who plots to track down a terrorist, Roshan became the first actor to perform a flyboarding stunt in film. While filming in Thailand, Roshan suffered a head injury from a stunt accident and underwent brain surgery to relieve a chronic <b>subdural</b> hematoma. The critic Mohar Basu noted that Roshan was [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and [...] "breez through his part brilliantly". The film was a commercial success, earning [...] in global ticket sales.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the head trauma also {{influences}} the risk of PTE. [...] People who suffer depressed skull fractures, penetrating head trauma, early PTS, and intracerebral and <b>subdural</b> haematomas due to the TBI are especially likely to suffer PTE, which occurs in more than 30% of people with {{any one of these}} findings. About 50% of patients with penetrating head trauma develop PTE, and missile injuries and loss of brain volume are associated with an especially high likelihood of developing the condition. [...] Injuries that occur in military settings carry higher-than-usual risk for PTE, probably because they more commonly involve penetrating brain injury and brain damage over a more widespread area. [...] Intracranial hematomas, in which blood accumulates inside the skull, {{are one of the most}} important risk factors for PTE. [...] <b>Subdural</b> hematoma confers a higher risk of PTE than does epidural hematoma, possibly because it causes more damage to brain tissue. Repeated intracranial surgery confers a high risk for late PTE, possibly because people who need more surgery are more likely to have factors associated with worse brain trauma such as large hematomas or cerebral swelling. [...] In addition, the chances of developing PTE differ by the location of the brain lesion: brain contusion that occurs on in one or the other of the frontal lobes has been found to carry a 20% PTE risk, while a contusion in one of the parietal lobes carries a 19% risk and one in a temporal lobe carries a 16% chance. [...] When contusions occur in both hemispheres, the risk is 26% for the frontal lobes, 66% for the parietal, and 31% for the temporal.|$|E
