50|$|The river's estuary {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an 8000 ha (19,768 acre) Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species. These include swan geese, bean geese, whooper swans, Oriental storks, black-faced spoonbills, Chinese egrets, great bustards, white-naped cranes, hooded cranes, red-crowned cranes, Far Eastern curlews and <b>spotted</b> <b>greenshanks.</b> The site includes the 800 ha (1,977 acre) Mundok Nature Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{include a}} variety of waders through the winter and {{migration}} seasons including significant numbers of black-tailed godwit, <b>spotted</b> redshank, <b>greenshank</b> and ruff. Winter also brings many ducks including pintail, shoveller, teal and wigeon, as well as small numbers of Bewick's swan and whooper swan. Birds of prey can be seen over the marsh, from the reserve or from nearby Denhall Lane; these include short-eared owl, hen harrier, marsh harrier, merlin, kestrel and peregrine falcon.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} months {{juvenile}} marsh harriers {{can be found in}} the reedbeds, along with <b>greenshanks,</b> <b>spotted</b> redshanks and ruffs which {{can be found in the}} muddy margins. Cuckoos are also a popular bird seen in {{the summer months}}.|$|R

40|$|The Yellow Sea {{region is}} of high global {{importance}} for waterbird populations, but recent systematic bird count data enabling {{identification of the}} most important sites are relatively sparse for some areas. Surveys of waterbirds at three sites on the coast of southern Jiangsu Province, China, in 2014 and 2015 produced peak counts of international importance for 24 species, including seven globally threatened and six Near Threatened species. The area is of particular global importance for the 2 ̆ 7 Critically Endangered 2 ̆ 7 Spoon-billed Sandpiper Calidris pygmaea (peak count across all three study sites: 62 in spring [2015] and 225 in autumn [2014] and 2 ̆ 7 Endangered 2 ̆ 7 <b>Spotted</b> <b>Greenshank</b> Tringa guttifer (peak count across all three study sites: 210 in spring [2014] and 1, 110 in autumn [2015]). The southern Jiangsu coast is therefore currently the most important migratory stopover area in the world, in both spring and autumn, for both species. Several serious and acute threats to waterbirds were recorded at these study sites. Paramount is the threat of large-scale land claim which would completely destroy intertidal mudflats of critical importance to waterbirds. Degradation of intertidal mudflat habitats through the spread of invasive Spartina, and mortality of waterbirds by entrapment in nets or deliberate poisoning are also real and present serious threats here. Collisions with, and displacement by, wind turbines and other structures, and industrial chemical pollution may represent additional potential threats. We recommend the rapid establishment of effective protected areas for waterbirds in the study area, maintaining large areas of open intertidal mudflat, and the urgent removal of all serious threats currently faced by waterbirds here...|$|E
50|$|The water area {{encourages}} {{wading birds}} such as <b>spotted</b> redshank, <b>greenshank,</b> green sandpiper and curlew. Snipe are recorded as over-wintering. Breeding birds include little grebe, moorhen, mallard, teal and tufted duck. The heathland area encourages whinchat, skylark, tree pipit, cuckoo, nightjar, kestrel and sparrowhawk. The reserve {{is one of}} three known sites in the Forest of Dean where stonechat breed. Swift, swallow and house martin are regular feeders as the site is rich in insect life.|$|R
50|$|The mudflats {{attract more}} than 20% of the British {{wintering}} {{population of the}} uncommon pied avocet. They additionally support black-tailed godwit, common redshank, dunlin, whimbrel, <b>greenshank,</b> <b>spotted</b> redshank and green sandpiper during the wintering period, with the first birds arriving in October and leaving again throughout March.|$|R
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, <b>spotted</b> redshank, common <b>greenshank,</b> avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|R
40|$|The Nigdu-Sarovar {{is located}} in Nilokheri block in Karnal {{district}} in Haryana (29 ° 50 ′N 76 ° 55 ′E). The duration of observations span over seven years (September, 2005 to March, 2012). The recording of wetland winter visitor birds during 2005 - 08 in winter season included atleast 58 species of birds belonging to 10 orders and 18 families. It is important to mention that 29 species of wetland birds were winter migratory, 17 residents, 9 local migratory and three species of wetland birds like Lesser-whistling Duck Dendrocygna javanica, Pheasant-tailed Jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus and Blue-cheeked Bee-eater Merops persicus were summer migratory. The special features of 2005 - 06 winter was the huge populations of birds like Northern Shoveller Anas clypeata, Northern Pintail Anas acuta, Common Teal Anas crecca, Spot-billed Duck Anas poecilorhynchus, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Bar-headed Goose Anser indicus, Greylag Goose Anser anser, Gadwall Anas strepera, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos and Common Redshank Tringa totanus etc. In successive years, the scenario {{was more or less}} a substantial one depicting stability with respect to diversity of birds, number of birds upto the year of 2008. The popular birds included Painted Stork Mycteria leucocephala, Openbill Stork Anastomus oscitans, White-necked Stork Ciconia episcopus, Black-necked Stork Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus, Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia, <b>Spotted</b> <b>Greenshank</b> Tringa guttifer and Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrines. The sharp decline in winter migratory birds at “Nigdu-Sarovar” started in the year of 2008 when the pond was leased out for FISH-FARMING as per the policies of Govt. of Haryana. Fish Farming based deepening of the pond by excavation of bottom resulting in total decimation of rooted, floating, submerged and ejecting plants along with its subsidiary fauna, Zooplanktons, phytoplankton etc. The age old structural regime of the pond was obliterated to turn it in a scientifically managed fish pond. The year of 2009 - 10, 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12 (March, 2012) showed the total absence of migratory birds like Mallards, several Geese, Dabbling Ducks, Pochards and Teals etc. As of today (2012), the sarovar is a clean sheet of water with bird repelling devices installed in places...|$|E
50|$|The bay {{has been}} {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and in 1994 it became a Local Nature Reserve because of its importance for wildlife. Many birds visit in winter and during migration including large numbers of wildfowl and waders such as wigeon which peak at over 3000 birds. Notable species include brent goose, jack snipe, <b>spotted</b> redshank and <b>greenshank.</b> terns roost {{at the mouth of}} the bay.|$|R

50|$|The Tamar-Tavy Estuary is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{covering}} the tidal estuaries of the River Tamar and the River Tavy. Part of the Tamar estuary also forms the Tamar Estuary Nature Reserve, {{owned by the}} Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The site was designated in 1991 for its biodiversity and varying habitats that support {{a large number of}} wader and wildfowl species, as well as the special interest of its marine biology. The site supports a nationally important wintering population of avocet and supports species such as black-tailed godwit, whimbrel, <b>greenshank,</b> <b>spotted</b> redshank, green sandpiper and golden plover.|$|R
50|$|Carrick Roads and the Fal Estuary are favoured by ornithologists for birdwatching, {{especially}} the waders and waterbirds that visit in autumn and winter. The little egret and kingfisher {{can be seen}} all year while various passage waders pass through in spring, late summer and autumn. These include the whimbrel, the <b>spotted</b> redshank, the <b>greenshank,</b> the common sandpiper, the curlew sandpiper and the little stint. In the winter, the great northern diver and the black-throated diver can be seen, {{as well as the}} black-necked grebe, the red-necked grebe and the Slavonian grebe, the goldeneye and red-breasted merganser, and sometimes the long-tailed duck and the scoter.|$|R
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common <b>greenshank,</b> <b>spotted</b> redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|R
50|$|Songor Lagoon’s {{complement}} of rare and diverse species {{makes it a}} popular tourist attraction. Birders are probably the lagoon’s most avid ecotourists, attracted {{to the thousands of}} birds that migrate to the site in the European winter. The area’s two bird watching platforms, one in Pute and one in Lolanya, host the birders while they observe and photograph varieties such as sandwich, black, royal, roseate, and little terns, black-winged stilts, ringed plovers, curlew sandpipers, <b>spotted</b> redshanks, and <b>greenshanks.</b> The lagoon’s second most popular ecotourist attraction is its guided sea turtle walk program. The walks are managed by the Ghana Wildlife Division, with the best months to see turtles being August through March. The walks are conducted at night, between 23:00 and 2:00, when sea turtles are likely to be seen nesting on the beach. However, as all sea turtle species are threatened, the Wildlife Division officers often remind tourists that a turtle sighting is a rare event and cannot be guaranteed to occur during the walk.Other visitors prefer to tour the site by boat, readily booking trips privately or through the Manet Paradise Hotel. These excursions often afford birders a more diverse viewing at Crocodile Island, where little egrets, western reef herons, and cormorants are known to breed; the island is also acclaimed for its basket-weaving industry. Another attraction that can only be reached by boat is Sugar Cane Island, which offers tours of its rum distillery. Additionally, boats can be commissioned through the Manet paradise hotel for deep-sea fishing trips, which generally last all day.|$|R
