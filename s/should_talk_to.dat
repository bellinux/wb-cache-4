25|$|Research {{has shown}} a fairly limited side effect profile for honokiol and {{it appears to be}} fairly well tolerated. However, its {{antithrombotic}} effects could cause hemorrhage especially in patients with conditions that would put them at a higher risk like hemophilia or Von Willebrand disease. Additionally, patients already taking anticoagulants <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> their doctor before taking honokiol supplements. Honokiol is also neurotoxic at high concentrations. In a 2002 study, researchers induced cell death in fetal rat cortical neurons by directly applying 100μM in vitro.|$|E
25|$|In April 1980, King Khalid {{cancelled}} {{the state}} visit to Britain as a protest over the broadcasting of Death of a Princess, that narrated {{the execution of}} Misha'al bin Fahd, the granddaughter of Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz. King Khalid had been invited by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1979, following the Queen's visit to Saudi Arabia in February 1979, during which King Khalid gave her a diamond necklace. The visit that had been cancelled in 1980 was realized on 9 June 1981 for four days. Upon meeting then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia in April 1981, King Khalid is reputed to have {{said he would be}} happy to discuss falcons with her, but for all matters of administration she <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Crown Prince Fahd.|$|E
25|$|Around the time, Sun Quan's heir apparent, Sun Deng, who was {{stationed}} in Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), was actively networking with many people. He wrote to Bu Zhi, seeking his advice on whom he <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> first because he knew little about the officials in Eastern Wu. In his reply to Sun Deng, Bu Zhi named 11 notable officials serving in Jing Province – Zhuge Jin, Lu Xun, Zhu Ran, Cheng Pu, Pan Jun, Pei Xuan (裴玄), Xiahou Cheng (夏侯承), Wei Jing (衞旌), Li Su (李肅), Zhou Tiao (周條) and Shi Gan (石幹) – and appraised them individually. He also advised Sun Deng to refrain from micromanaging, and instead learn from great rulers such as Duke Huan of Qi and Emperor Gao of Han, who delegated the task of governing their empires to their premiers (e.g. Guan Zhong, Xiao He). He also urged Sun Deng to attract as many talents as possible to join him.|$|E

500|$|Davies {{continued}} to submit scripts to the WGYT during his studies at Oxford, including Box, {{a play about}} the influence of television that Evans noted contained Davies' penchants for misdirecting the audience and mixing comedy and drama; In Her Element, which centred on the animation of still objects; and Hothouse, an Alan Bennett-inspired piece about internal politics in an advertising office. In 1984, he made his final performance for the WGYT and signed up for a course in Theatre Studies at Cardiff University after graduating from Oxford. He worked sporadically for the Sherman Theatre's publicity department and claimed unemployment benefit in the interim. In 1985, Davies began his professional television career after a friend suggested that he <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a television producer who was seeking a temporary graphic artist for the children's show Why Don't You? ...|$|E

When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, [...] "I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys." [...] He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim {{in a statement to}} the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, [...] "Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good."

2500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into two parts, {{entitled}} [...] "One" [...] and [...] "Two", both of which are narrated by Tony Webster when he is retired and living alone. The first part begins in the 1960s with four intellectually arrogant school friends, of whom two feature in the remainder of the story: Tony, the narrator, and Adrian, the most precociously intelligent of the four. [...] Towards the end of their school days another boy at the school hangs himself, apparently after getting a girl pregnant. [...] The four friends discuss the philosophical difficulty of knowing exactly what happened. [...] Adrian goes to Cambridge University and Tony to Bristol University. Tony acquires a girlfriend, Veronica, at whose family home he spends an awkward weekend. On waking one morning he finds that he and Veronica's mother, Sarah, are alone in the house, and she apologises for her family's behaviour towards him. Tony and Veronica's relationship fails in some acrimony, as he breaks up with her after she has sex with him. In his final year at university Tony receives a letter from Adrian informing him that he is going out with Veronica. Tony replies to the letter, telling Adrian that in his opinion Veronica was damaged in some way and that he <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her mother about it. Some months later he is told that Adrian has committed suicide, leaving a note addressed to the coroner saying that the free person has a philosophical duty to examine the nature of their life, and may then choose to renounce it. Tony admires the reasoning. He briefly recounts the following uneventful forty years of his life until his sixties. At this point Tony's narration of {{the second part of the}} novel – which is twice as long as the first – begins, with the arrival of a lawyer's letter informing him that Veronica's mother has bequeathed him £500 and two documents. These lead him to re-establish contact with Veronica and after a number of meetings with her, to re-evaluate the story he has narrated in the first part. On consulting the lawyers, Tony learns that Veronica has Adrian's diary. This leads him to send Veronica repeated e-mails requesting the diary. Veronica eventually sends Tony a single page of the diary, containing Adrian's musings on life as a series of cumulative wagers. Following this, Veronica meets Tony on the Millennium Bridge in London and gives him the letter he sent to Adrian in his youth. On re-reading it, Tony realises how malicious and unpleasant it was, and how he has erased this from his memory. Nevertheless, he persists in attempting to retrieve the diary from Veronica, which leads to her asking him to meet at a location in North London, where she drives him to see a group of mentally retarded men being taken for a walk by their careworker, one of whom she points out to him. Tony does not understand the significance of this and Veronica leaves him with no explanation. Over the course of several weeks, Tony revisits the location until he is able to relocate the man Veronica showed him in a pub. Tony greets the man saying he is a friend of Veronica's which leads to an upset response from the man. Tony realises from the man's features that this is Adrian's son, and he e-mails Veronica an apology, saying he didn't realise that she and Adrian had a son together. Veronica only responds with the reply [...] "You don't get it, but then you never did." [...] On revisiting the pub where he saw the man, Tony gets into conversation with the careworker, which reveals that the man is actually the son of Adrian and Veronica's mother, Sarah, making him Veronica's half-brother. Tony realises that his letter to Adrian, telling him to talk to Sarah, was the cause of the affair they had together, that Sarah's son was born with mental issues because of her advanced age and that Adrian killed himself because he could not face the responsibility.|$|E
