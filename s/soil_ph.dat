5|$|Changes in {{the water}} regime due to the {{construction}} of the Ithai barrage across the Manipur River have caused changes in the vegetation composition of the phumdis. A study was instituted, from October 2005 to July 2006, to record the vegetation composition and productivity of phumdis in areas of ranging thickness, water depth and <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> accumulating data in both summer and winter. The study recorded 83 plant species of 21 families (Poaceae and Cyperaceae formed the dominant families); 81 species were recorded in summer and 48 in winter.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a single flower head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E

5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites {{have been shown to}} bioaccumulate arsenic, largely in the form of arsenobetaine.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low <b>soil</b> <b>pH.</b> Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E

5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research {{has led to an}} understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, <b>soil,</b> <b>pH,</b> ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|Production of both {{bulbs and}} cut flowers {{takes place in}} open fields in beds or ridges, often in the same field, {{allowing}} adaptation to changing market conditions. Narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates. Compared to the United Kingdom, the harsher winters in the Netherlands require covering the fields with straw for protection. Areas with higher rainfall and temperatures {{are more susceptible to}} diseases that attack the crops. production is based on a 1 (UK) or 2 (Netherlands) year cycle. Optimal <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> is 6.0–7.5. Prior to planting disinfection by hot water takes place, such as immersion at 44.4°C for three hours.|$|E

50|$|In {{its natural}} habitat Pinus greggiii {{grows in the}} cool highlands, at altitudes between 1300 - 2600 m; in the {{northern}} part of its distribution at 2300 - 2700m. Annual precipitation is 600 - 800 mm in much of its range, except on the east escarpment of the mountain ranges along the Hidalgo-Veracruz borderline, where it is 1000 - 1600 mm. In the north it is more often found on slightly alkaline <b>soils</b> (<b>pH</b> 7 - 8); in the south on acid <b>soils</b> (<b>pH</b> 4 - 5).|$|R
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E

Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E

25|$|Monotropoids {{occur in}} {{coniferous}} or mixed coniferous forests, often {{in areas with}} a heavy, closed overstory with low light availability. They occur in boggy areas, in deep humusy soils, and even relatively dry slopes. The <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> in locations in which they occur is acidic to varying degrees.|$|E
25|$|Many other biotic and {{abiotic factors}} can mediate {{competition}} among EcM fungi, such as temperature, <b>soil</b> <b>pH,</b> soil moisture, host specificity, and competitor number. The results of many studies concerning these factors indicate that these interactions are largely environmentally context-dependent. These aspects can {{often lead to}} “checkerboard” distribution patterns, where certain species occupy locations that are mutually exclusive of the other species.|$|E
25|$|The main micronutrients are molybdenum, zinc, and copper. These {{elements}} are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate <b>soil</b> <b>pH</b> and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a chelate complex, e.g., the EDTA derivative. The micronutrient needs {{depend on the}} plant.
