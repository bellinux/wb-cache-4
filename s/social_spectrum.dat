5|$|After a power struggle, Bolesław III Wrymouth (r. 1102–1138) {{became the}} duke of Poland by {{defeating}} his half-brother Zbigniew in 1106–1107. Zbigniew {{had to leave the}} country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, who attacked Bolesław's Poland in 1109. Bolesław was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the <b>social</b> <b>spectrum</b> (see Battle of Głogów). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Bolesław's other major achievement was the conquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father Władysław I Herman and completed by Bolesław around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western Pomerania up to Rügen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Bolesław's fief, to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.|$|E

While Roma slavery also existed in Wallachia, the presence of Tatar slaves there has not been documented, and is only theorized.

25|$|While the Code of Hammurabi {{was trying}} to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those {{categorized}} in {{the lower end of}} the <b>social</b> <b>spectrum</b> and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves. Punishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status. For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required. Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.|$|E

25|$|Typically {{there was}} not much social mobility. It was possible, however, over several generations for a family to slowly move up the social ladder. For example, A wealthy {{merchant}} or artisan could sometimes attract a wife from an impoverished but aristocratic family. This would bring the merchant/artisan social standing and bring his wife and her family needed finances. The wealthier the family, the greater the odds that they would marry their children off to wealthy families from neighboring towns. This would increase the family influence beyond that of the local village or town. On {{the lower end of the}} <b>social</b> <b>spectrum,</b> occasionally a free farmer with a sufficient dowry for his daughter could attract an artisan to marry her. This kind of strategic marriage could sometimes be used to accomplish social mobility in as little as 2-3 generations. Sometimes the opposite occurred and families would move down the social ladder due to disgrace or financial calamity. In general though, families married within and stayed within their social class for hundreds of years.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{inspiration}} for the characters of Hector and Adeline remain unclear, but several critics have been eager to speculate. Three officers named Hulot were recognized for their valor in the Napoleonic Wars, and some suggest that Balzac borrowed the name of Comte Hector d'Aure. None of these men, however, were known {{for the sort of}} philandering or thievery exhibited by Baron Hulot in the novel. Instead, Balzac may have used himself as the model; his many affairs with women across the <b>social</b> <b>spectrum</b> lead some to suggest that the author [...] "found much of Hulot in himself". Balzac's friend Victor Hugo, meanwhile, was famously discovered in bed with his mistress in July 1845. The similarity of his name to Hector Hulot (and that of his wife's maiden name, Adèle Foucher, to Adeline Fischer) has been posited as a possible indication of the characters' origins.|$|E
500|$|Belgian {{rule in the}} Congo {{was based}} around the [...] "colonial trinity" [...] (trinité coloniale) of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian {{commercial}} interests meant that capital sometimes flowed back into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, {{the interests of the}} government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies with strikebreaking and countering other efforts by the indigenous population to better their lot. The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set [...] "native policy" [...] (politique indigène)—in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of racial segregation. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the <b>social</b> <b>spectrum,</b> but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks.|$|E

500|$|Balzac's {{trademark}} realism {{begins on}} the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the Légion d'honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel's geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette's residence is on {{the opposite end of the}} <b>social</b> <b>spectrum,</b> in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: [...] "Les ténèbres, le silence, l'air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent à faire de ces maisons des espèces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants." [...] ("Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.") Descriptions of her meager quarters are– as usual in Balzac's work– an acute reflection of her personality. The same is true of the Marneffe home at the outset: it contains [...] "les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe" [...] ("the illusory appearance of sham luxury"), from the shabby chairs in the drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.|$|E
500|$|Having made no {{progress}} in Rome, Momolo and Marianna Mortara returned to Bologna in early December 1858, and soon afterwards moved to Turin, in Piedmont. The case—an anti-Catholic [...] "publicist's dream", to quote Kertzer—had by {{now become a}} massive controversy in both Europe and the United States, with voices across the <b>social</b> <b>spectrum</b> clamouring for the Pope to return Edgardo to his parents. Mortara became a cause célèbre not only for Jews but for Protestant Christians as well, particularly in the United States, where anti-Catholic sentiment abounded—The New York Times published more than 20 articles on the case in December 1858 alone. In Britain, The Spectator presented the Mortara case {{as evidence that the}} Papal States had [...] "the worst government in the world—the most insolvent and the most arrogant, the cruelest and the meanest". The Catholic press both in Italy and abroad steadfastly defended the Pope's actions. The pro-Church articles often took on an overtly anti-Semitic character, charging for example that if coverage in Britain, France or Germany was critical this was hardly a surprise [...] "since currently the newspapers of Europe are in good part {{in the hands of the}} Jews". Scazzocchio suggested that the press storm attacking the Church was actually counter-productive for the Mortara family's cause, as it angered the Pope and thereby steeled his resolve not to compromise.|$|E

Aim: In this paper, we aimed to assess the prevalence of IAD in an Italian sample of high-school students. We also explored the relationship between Social Phobia and IAD diagnosis; lastly, we investigated the association between IAD and substance misuse. Methods: The research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. As-sessments administered in this study consisted of three parts: 1) collecting information about general and personal data of the subjects; 2) the Internet Addiction questionnaire proposed by Ko, composed by 9 different areas; 3) the <b>Social</b> Anxiety <b>Spectrum</b> Self-Report (SHY-SR) Lifetime Questionnaire. Results: 19 of 402 subjects (i. e. 4. 7 % of the sample) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IAD, showing a slight predominance of males. 10. 9 % of subjects met diagnostic criteria for a <b>Social</b> Phobia <b>Spectrum</b> disorder. Six IAD subjects (31. 8 %) were also diagnosed with a <b>social</b> phobia <b>spectrum</b> condition. Within the group of students diagnosed with IAD, 4 (21. 05 %) subjects reported current or past use of drugs. Conclusion: Our results suggest that there is a sizable population of youth already showing or at risk of developing some kind of problematic relationship with the web. Social Anxiety Disorder seems to be both a risk factor and a frequent co-morbid disorder of Internet misuse.

[...] "The Indian" [...] was a dark-skinned Cochin Jew and a moshavnik (though Gerafi himself was an Ethiopian Jew), and the film highlights the patronizing attitude that Laufer has to his charge.

Method: A MEDLINE search (1966 - 2003) for relevant articles on the <b>social</b> anxiety disorder <b>spectrum</b> was undertaken using the terms shyness, behavioral inhibition, social phobia, social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality, dimension, and spectrum to aim at objective coverage, but references for this article were chosen more subjectively to illustrate data and themes in description, pathogenesis, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy of the <b>social</b> anxiety disorder <b>spectrum.</b> Results: Several different approaches to delineating a <b>social</b> anxiety disorder <b>spectrum</b> of conditions have been described. These include (1) a <b>spectrum</b> of <b>social</b> fear and avoidance, (2) a spectrum of body-focused concerns, (3) a spectrum of anxiety disorders and affective dysfunction, and (4) a <b>spectrum</b> of <b>social</b> deficits.
