We detect sigma-convergence in aggregate labor productivity and in the service sectors but not in the other sectors. This result can be explained by a transfer of resources from the agricultural sector to the more productive sectors that has been more marked in the poor regions. Empirical results also indicate that the common indicator of sigma-convergence lead to a bias when <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> are not included in the analysis. We then estimate beta-convergence models including the relevant <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> for each sector.

40|$|If {{covariate}} and <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> are modeled at {{the same}} time in order to cover spatial autocorrelation and unobserved heterogeneity, it will lead to wrong or attenuated effects in the presence of “concurvity”. This is caused because spatial autocorrelation cannot separate clearly between <b>spatial</b> and covariate <b>effect.</b> Flexible modeling of the <b>spatial</b> <b>effect</b> includes that it consists of enough degrees of freedom for absorbing the covariate effect partially. This falsification of the estimated covariate effects can be prevented or weakened by modifying the <b>spatial</b> <b>effect.</b> The basic idea is the modification of the <b>spatial</b> <b>effect</b> in a way which can only reproduce the variability it cannot be explained by covariate information in principle. Technically, it can be done by making basis functions, used for <b>spatial</b> <b>effect</b> orthogonal to the basis functions, to the covariate effect. This idea is implemented as a new operator of the mboost package. Simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of the new %ll%-operator and its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, they identified certain situations where the %ll%-operator perform well. Finally, the %ll%-operator is used for an ecological application to investigate the impacts of climate change of the tree population in Bavaria. That is the cause because there is hardly any other industry except for the forestry which is so dependent on the natural environment. Successful management of the forests is inextricably linked to the adaptation to natural climatic conditions. The model indicates a strong decline of the Spruce (Picea abies) in Bavaria...|$|R

The standard approach to analyse the wage curve takes no {{account of the}} spatial relationship among regions. Ignoring this relationship may seriously bias the results. To investigate this, the East German wage curve is estimated including <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> using panel data classified into 114 administrative districts over the period 1993 - 1999. It extends the analysis of Baltagi, Blien and Wolf (2000) in which <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> were not taken into account. To control for the possible endogeneity of the unemployment rate, one of the explanatory variables, instrumental variable methods should be used. To control for spatial dependence, this paper adopts the use of matrix exponentials for spatially transforming the error terms. This transformation has the advantage that the Jacobian term equals zero. Two important empirical results appear. If <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> are not taken into account, the unemployment elasticity in Eastern Germany is larger than in Western countries. If <b>spatial</b> <b>effects</b> are added, the unemployment elasticity significantly reduces. ...|$|R

It is frequently explored using a spatial cueing paradigm and is characterized by slower responses to cued than to uncued locations. The current study investigates the impact of IOR on overt visual orienting involving saccadic eye movements. Using a spatial cueing paradigm, our experiments have demonstrated that at a cue-target onset asynchrony (CTOA) of 400 ms saccades to the vicinity of cued locations are not only delayed (temporal cost) but also biased away (<b>spatial</b> <b>effect).</b> Both of these effects are basically no longer present at a CTOA of 1200 ms. At a shorter 200 ms CTOA, the <b>spatial</b> <b>effect</b> becomes stronger while the temporal cost {{is replaced by a}} temporal benefit.
