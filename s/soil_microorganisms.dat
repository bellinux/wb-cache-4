5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic <b>soil</b> <b>microorganisms)</b> {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic <b>soil</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of <b>soil</b> <b>microorganisms</b> and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|The ectomycorrhizae formed {{between the}} fungus and host plant can be {{influenced}} by <b>soil</b> <b>microorganisms</b> present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, soil bacteria from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus {{does not require a}} specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S.luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S.luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were conducted {{for two years}} {{with the aim of}} studying the effects of deep tillage and straw returning on <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> and enzyme activity in clay and loam soil. Three treatments, (1) conventional tillage (CT), shallow tillage and straw returning; (2) deep tillage (DT), deep tillage and straw returning; and (3) deep tillage with no straw returning (DNT), were carried out in clay and loam soil. The results showed that deep tillage and straw returning increased the abundance of <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> and most enzyme activities. Deep tillage was more effective for increasing enzyme activities in clay, while straw returning was more effective in loam. <b>Soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> abundance and most enzyme activities decreased with the increase of soil depth. Deep tillage mainly affected soil enzyme activities in loam at the soil depth of 20 – 30 [*]cm and in clay at the depth of 0 – 40 [*]cm.

The average well color development (AWCD) and Shannon’s richness index (H) of the <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> community in the L. kaempferi forest decreased {{with the increase in}} forest age and were significantly lower than those in the surrounding native P. armandii forest. The carbon source utilization pattern of <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> community in a 23 -year-old L. kaempferi forest differed significantly from a 17 -year-old L. kaempferi forest and the P. armandii forest. The introduced species also resulted in the changes of soil physicochemical properties. The organic material content, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the soil of L. kaempferi forest were significantly lower than those in the soil of P. armandii forest.|$|R

5|$|In <b>soil,</b> <b>microorganisms</b> that {{reside in}} the {{rhizosphere}} (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. <b>Soil</b> <b>microorganisms</b> are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

However, the potential toxicity of a heavy metal in the soil depends on its speciation and availability. We studied the effects of heavy metal speciation and availability on <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> activities along a Cu/Zn contamination gradient. Microbial biomass and enzyme activity of soil contaminated with both Cu and Zn were investigated. The results showed that microbial biomass was negatively affected by the elevated metal levels. The microbial biomass-C (C-mic) /organic C (C-org) ratio was closely correlated to heavy metal stress. There were negative correlations between soil microbial biomass, phosphatase activity and NH 4 NO 3 extractable heavy metals. The <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> activity could be predicted using empirical models with the availability of Cu and Zn. We observed that 72 % {{of the variation in}} phosphatase activity could be explained by the NH 4 NO 3 -extractable and total heavy metal concentration. By considering different monitoring approaches and different viewpoints, this set of methods applied in this study seemed sensitive to site differences and contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of heavy metals on the size and activity of <b>microorganisms</b> in <b>soils.</b> The data presented demonstrate the relationship between heavy metals availability and heavy metal toxicity to <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> along a contamination gradient...|$|R

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by <b>soil</b> <b>microorganisms)</b> can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called dead zones.|$|E

30|$|The {{introduction}} of L. kaempferi forest significantly changed the carbon source utilization {{pattern of the}} <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> community in Dalaoling National Forest Park. The use efficiency of some carbon sources in the <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> community in the L. kaempferi forest differed {{from those in the}} P. armandii forest and decreased with the increases in stand age.

Therefore, we concluded that the introduction and cultivation of L. kaempferi in the Dalaoling National Forest Park resulted in a decline in soil quality and soil fertility. The significant relationship between soil pH and AWCD suggested that L. kaempferi influenced soil activity by changing the soil pH. However, the detailed mechanism of {{introduction of}} L. kaempferi on soil microbial diversity and function is worthwhile for further research, such as how the litter affects specifically the composition of microbial community and soil physicochemical properties and the response of composition and structure of microbial community to the litter of exotic species.|$|R

30|$|Soil {{ecological}} {{process is}} an important part in the material cycle and energy flow of terrestrial ecosystem and is closely related with vegetation development and succession (Wardle et al. 2004; Noah and Robert 2006). Most artificial plantations alter soil ecological process and cause soil fertility decline and soil degradation, which is more prominent in exotic species forest because of their significant effect on soil microbial community diversity and physicochemical properties (Lorenzo et al. 2010; Patrick 2006). The long-term cultivation of L. kaempferi forest decreased the activity and functional diversity of <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> community in Dalaoling National Forest Park. As a result, the soil physicochemical properties resulted in a decline in soil quality. The plant diversity and seedling regeneration in L. kaempferi forest was further impacted (Xiao and Zeng 2005). Modifying the negative effects of introduced forest species on soil ecological process is crucial to the sustainable forest management. Appropriate disturbance could reduce the effects of exotic plants on the local <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> community (Xu et al. 2008; Carvalho et al. 2010). Zhang (2001) reported that thinning plantation stands increased soil microbe quantities, strengthened soil enzyme activities, decreased bulk density, and enhanced soil total porosity degree and available nutrients. Our primary field investigation showed that thinning the L. kaempferi forest stands increased the diversity of <b>soil</b> <b>microorganism</b> communities and improved soil texture (Song et al. 2013). The mechanism that thinning improves soil fertility is that the increased understory biodiversity after thinning enhances the increase of quantity and diversity of soil microbe and, therefore, strengthens bioactivity of soil and accelerates nutrient cycling of soil (Zhang 2001). The appropriate thinning approach and frequency and the response of L. kaempferi forest to thinning are going to be tested in our future research to provide more information for the sustainable management of the forest.|$|R
