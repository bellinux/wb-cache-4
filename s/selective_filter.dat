50|$|Filter theory then postulates that a <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> {{is needed}} {{to cope with the}} {{overwhelming}} amount of information entering the channels, such that certain messages must be inhibited or filtered out from the messages that were filtered for further processing.

5000|$|Due to {{this limited}} capacity, a <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> {{is needed for}} {{information}} processing. Broadbent stated that all stimuli are processed initially for basic, physical properties. These basic characteristics can include pitch, color, loudness, and direction. [...] Unlike the physical properties, Broadbent believed semantic features, due to their complexity, would impose a limited capacity on the temporary storehouse of incoming stimuli. Therefore, based on physical characteristics, the <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> allows for certain stimuli {{to pass through the}} filter for further processing, while unattended stimuli will be filtered out and lost. Further, goal-directed behaviour requires attention to be controlled; hence a high degree of selectivity is put forth in the information-processing stream. When developing his model, Broadbent emphasized the splitting of incoming stimuli to attended or unattended channels. Channel selection is guided through attention. If one is attempting to attend to a stimulus based on their current goals, they will employ voluntary attention; whereas if a sensory event catches one's attention, reflexive attention will be employed. Information selected to pass through the filter is then available for short-term memory and manipulation of the selected information, prior to storage in long-term memory.|$|E

Velocity <b>selective</b> <b>filtering</b> yields better selectivity when using symmetrical tripoles, but may yield larger signal RMS when using the wider asymmetrical tripoles, potentially allowing for shorter cuffs.

5000|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the glycerol facilitator of E. coli (TC# 1.A.8.1.1) was solved at 2.2 Å resolution (...) [...] Glycerol molecules create a single file within the channel and pass through a narrow selectivity filter. The two conserved D-P-A motifs in the loops between TMSs 2 and 3 and TMSs 5 and 6 form the interface between the two duplicated halves of each subunit. Thus each half of the protein forms 3.5 TMSs surrounding the channel. The structure explains why GlpF is selectively permeable to straight chain carbohydrates, and why water and ions are largely excluded. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the bacterial glycerol facilitator, GlpF can transport O2, CO2, NH3, glycerol, urea, and water to varying degrees. For small solutes passing through AQP1, there is an anti-correlation between permeability and solute hydrophobicity. AQP1 is thus a <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> for small polar solutes, whereas GlpF is highly permeable to small solutes and less permeable to larger solutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{filtration}} process extracts physical properties for all stimuli in parallel manner. The second stage was claimed to be of limited capacity, {{and so this is}} where the <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> was believed to reside in order to protect from a sensory processing overload. Based upon the physical properties extracted at the initial stage, the filter would allow only those stimuli possessing certain criterion features (e.g., pitch, loudness, location) to pass through. According to Broadbent, any information not being attended to would be filtered out, and should be processed only insofar as the physical qualities necessitated by the filter. Since selection was sensitive to physical properties alone, this was thought to be the reason why people possessed so little knowledge regarding the contents of an unattended message. All higher level processing, such as the extraction of meaning, happens post-filter. Thus, information on the unattended channel should not be comprehended. As a consequence, events such as hearing one's own name when not paying attention should be an impossibility since this information should be filtered out before you can process its meaning.|$|E

The scientific community does not accept major scientific claims with ease, and in this case, there were challenges associated with research on S. pneumoniae, which made it especially difficult to attract other investigators to pursue this research.

40|$|Abstract—During {{the last}} decade, <b>selective</b> {{photonic}} crystal <b>filters</b> have received much research {{interest in the}} fields of nanotechnology and optical interconnection network. The main focus of this paper consists of an analysis and a synthesis of one-dimensional photonic crystal <b>selective</b> <b>filters.</b> The optimization is performed by employing the simulated annealing algorithm. The filters synthesis is obtained by acting on the Bragg grating layer widths. Simulated annealing is applied to solve the PhC- 1 D filters synthesis problem {{in order to reduce the}} quadratic error and to obtain a desired transmission according to a Gaussian function defined in advance by the user. Starting from the Maxwell’s equations for dielectric nonmagnetic structure, we show the derivation of the Helmholtz equation and find its solution for 1 D layered structure. In addition, the boundary conditions and equation transformation to set of linear equations which are solved using Cramer’s method are described thoroughly. This mathematical technique is then applied for computation of the transmission spectra of 1 D perfectly periodic structure and structures with different defects. These results can be easily applied for design of <b>selective</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

In this paper we analyze and discuss {{the effect of a}} directionally <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> on the absorption of light and the generation of charge carriers in a germanium solar cell. A directionally <b>selective</b> <b>filter</b> transmits photons of perpendicular incidence and reflects photons under oblique incidence in a given spectral range. To investigate its effect on light trapping, we perform reflection and quantum efficiency measurements. The reflection measurements show that a wavelength dependent absorption enhancement is induced by the application of the directionally <b>selective</b> <b>filter.</b> We calculate a maximum absorption enhancement of 45 % at lambda approximate to 1900 nm. We show that the absorption enhancement is caused by light trapping of non-absorbed and scattered light and is not due to a suppression of radiative processes. A trapping of photons generated by radiative recombination could not be detected. Measurements of the quantum efficiency confirm the results of the reflection measurements. The generation of charge carriers is increased by up to 33 % at lambda approximate to 1900 nm.
