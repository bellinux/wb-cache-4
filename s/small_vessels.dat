5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was used}} as a water supply for agriculture, most of the channel {{remained}} in water, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its restoration, and two stretches are navigable to <b>small</b> <b>vessels.</b> Full restoration will require a new route where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has effectively severed the original route.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Cerebral {{white matter}} lesions and {{asymptomatic}} brain infarcts {{are common in}} elderly people. These brain lesions are thought to result from cerebral <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease, and their presence and severity increase with age {{and the presence of}} arterial hypertension. There is widespread belief that cerebral <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease plays a role in the aetiology of dementia. <b>Small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease is commonly regarded as the primary pathology in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, one of the subtypes of vascular dementia. Furthermore, vascular factors, including cerebral <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease, are increasingly recognized {{to be involved in the}} aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease. 8 However, there is hardly any evidence from prospective population-based studies to support these notions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inflammation {{involving}} the postcapillary venular wall {{is defined as}} <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitis. <b>Small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitis has various clinical manifestations. Etiologically, it can be primary or secondary. Literature regarding secondary vasculitis in elderly is scanty. Aim and Objectives: In this case series, we aimed to assess the clinical features and etiologies of biopsy-proven secondary <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitis in the elderly. Methodology: Twelve elderly patients with biopsy-proven <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitis were included in this study. All patients were thoroughly evaluated to assess the etiology and presence of major organ involvement. Results: Secondary <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitis involved both the sexes equally. Constitutional symptoms including fever and weight loss were noticed {{by most of the}} (70 %) patients. Neurological deficits were present in 83 % of the study population. The most common finding in an electromyographic examination was an asymmetric sensory motor distal predominant polyradiculopathy. Fifty percent of the patients did fulfill the criteria for a definite autoimmune disease. More than 30 % of the vasculitis was secondary to malignancies. Conclusions: Neurological manifestations are the most common systemic involvement in elderly patients with secondary vasculitis. Meticulous search for underlying malignancies is mandatory in elderly patients with secondary <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitis...|$|R
5|$|At 05:00 on 13 April Stopford {{gave the}} order for the inshore {{squadron}} to withdraw back to Gambier's fleet. Cochrane was again furious, and even suggested taking Imperieuse and Indefatigable on a desperate attack on the still-grounded Océan. Captain John Tremayne Rodd on the latter refused. Frustrated, Cochrane remained in the anchorage, joined by Pallas and the smaller vessels as the larger ships returned to more open waters. At 08:00 he ordered a renewed attack on the remaining grounded ships {{at the mouth of}} the Charente, and by 11:00 the <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> were in position and opened fire on the French flagship. Although Aetnas gun split, forcing her withdrawal, the barrage otherwise continued throughout the day, although to little effect. It was not until 16:00 when the battered Océan and Régulus, most of their stores thrown overboard, were able to safely retreat towards the mouth of the Charente.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting Argentine and Chilean {{claims to}} Patagonia, the southernmost region in South America, had been causing {{tension between the}} two {{countries}} since the 1840s. Both countries were incapable of enforcing these claims with a seaborne force, though: in 1860, the Chileans had only five <b>small</b> <b>vessels,</b> while the Argentine Navy had no seagoing ships. These attitudes quickly changed when the circumstances warranted; when Chile joined Peru against Spain in the Chincha Islands War, the Spaniards blockaded and bombarded Valparaíso, leading the Chilean government to strengthen the navy. The Argentine government, under President Domingo Sarmiento, decided to build a navy in the 1870s to counter Brazilian naval acquisitions. Two large monitors, Los Andes and El Plata, were ordered from Laird Brothers, a British company, along with two gunboats. They were delivered in 1874 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March, before Rowley {{could return}} to his blockade, Hamelin ordered a {{squadron}} to sea. This force consisted of the large frigate Bellone, the captured Minerva now renamed Minerve and the captured brig Victor. The force was led by Guy-Victor Duperré on Bellone, with Pierre Bouvet in Minerve as his second in command. Avoiding the remaining frigates of the British blockade, Duperré's ships escaped unnoticed and began cruising in the Bay of Bengal, capturing a few <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> but making no serious impression on British trade in the region. By the 1 June, Duperré {{had moved to the}} Western Indian Ocean, sailing off Madagascar in the hope of sighting British ships from Cape Town. Due to the extended period at sea, his ships were in a poor state of repair and much of the following month was spent conducting repairs at isolated beaches.|$|E

5|$|The keel for Coatit {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 8 April 1897 and her completed hull was launched on 15 November 1899. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 1 October 1900. She proved to be too slow and short-legged to be useful as a fleet scout, which limited her active duty career. She served in the main fleet in 19031904, during which time the fleet was kept {{in a state of}} readiness for seven months. For the remaining five months, the ships had reduced crews. In 1904, the ship was transferred to the Red Sea and stationed in Italy's colony in Eritrea along with three other <b>small</b> <b>vessels.</b> Coatit was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on Sicily during the 1908 fleet maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Three of the <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> {{managed to}} return to England: MLs 160, 307 and 443. They had reached the {{rendezvous}} and waited until 10:00 for the destroyers to appear. Having already been attacked once, they moved further out into the Atlantic to try and avoid the German Air Force, but a Junkers 88 appeared overhead at 07:30 and approached them at low level for a closer look. The ships opened fire and hit the Junkers in the cockpit. The plane went into the sea. The next aircraft to appear was a Blohm & Voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships, but left after being damaged by machine-gun fire. The surviving MLs eventually reached England unaided the following day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E

Dukovac claimed a victory over another LaGG-3 during a patrol three days later, {{but it was not}} seen by his wingman, as they had become separated during the fight. On 1 May, Dukovac sank a small vessel. The following day, he and three other Croat pilots were escorting a group of He 111s when two LaGG-3s tried to intercept the formation. Dukovac and another pilot both claimed to have downed one Soviet fighter each, but their destruction was not witnessed. On 3 May, a morning mission saw Dukovac claim one of four LaGG-3s encountered near Krimskaja.|$|E
5|$|Rowley's {{force had}} also been active: Nereide under Captain Robert Corbet {{captured}} a number of <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> off Port Napoleon in the late spring, including the brig Aigle, which he sent to the Cape of Good Hope with a prize crew that mutinied, killed their officer and took the ship to Île Bonaparte. The brig HMS Otter, under Captain Nesbit Willoughby, raided an anchorage at Rivière Noire District on 14 August, capturing a coastal vessel (which he later had to abandon) under heavy fire. Willoughby also recaptured Aigle shortly afterwards. Rowley himself had chased the Bellone in Raisonnable as the French ship emerged from Port Napoleon on 17 August, but {{had been unable to}} catch her. Most significant of all was the seizure of the island of Rodriguez by a British Army force from India under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating. This small island was close enough to Isle de France to provide an effective base for the British blockade squadron and a staging area for a future invasion of the French islands.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine navy, {{like the}} Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire itself, was a {{continuation}} of the Roman Empire and its institutions. After the Battle of Actium in 31BC, {{in the absence of any}} external threat in the Mediterranean, the Roman navy performed mostly policing and escort duties. Massive sea battles, like those fought in the Punic Wars, no longer occurred, and the Roman fleets were composed of relatively <b>small</b> <b>vessels,</b> best suited to their new tasks. By the early 4th century, the permanent Roman fleets had dwindled, so that when the fleets of the rival emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius clashed in 324AD, they were composed to a great extent of newly built or commandeered ships from the port cities of the Eastern Mediterranean. The civil wars of the 4th and early 5th centuries, however, did spur a revival of naval activity, with fleets mostly employed to transport armies. Considerable naval forces continued to be employed in the Western Mediterranean throughout the first quarter of the fifth century, especially from North Africa, but Rome's mastery of the Mediterranean was challenged when Africa was overrun by the Vandals over a period of fifteen years.|$|E

30|$|Markers of <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important {{for the evaluation of}} patients with dementia, and have been suggested to have a contributory as well as a causative role in the neurodegenerative disease process. The “standards for research into <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease” were established in 2013 summarizing the scales and criteria and proposing a terminology {{to be used in the}} realm of <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease imaging. Important <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease markers are: 1. Cerebral microbleeds, seen as punctate foci of hypointensity on susceptibility sensitive sequences. The location of cerebral microbleeds is also of importance to mention in reports as deep bleeds represent underlying hypertensive arteriopathy, and lobar cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 2. Cortical superficial siderosis implies gyriform linear hypointensities that have been suggested to be a sensitive markers of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 3.

40|$|Brain imaging is {{essential}} for the diagnosis and characterization of cerebral <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease. Several magnetic resonance imaging markers have therefore emerged, providing new information on the diagnosis, progression, and mechanisms of <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease.

This review focuses on the main <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease-related markers on magnetic resonance imaging including: white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, dilated perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain volume. The aim is to summarize, for each marker, what is currently known about: (1) its reproducibility in studies with a scan-rescan procedure either in single or multicenter settings; (2) the acquisition-related sources of variability; and, (3) the techniques used to minimize this variability. Based on the results, we discuss technical and other challenges that need to be overcome in order for these markers to be reliably used as outcome measures in future clinical trials. We also highlight the key points that need to be considered when designing multicenter magnetic resonance imaging studies of <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> disease...|$|R
