5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by <b>strafing</b> aircraft. These trials showed that such <b>strafing</b> could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|September 13 {{represented}} {{the first day}} that Air Group 18 encountered significant resistance in the Pacific skies. From Harris's Strike 2 Able through to the fourth and final strike of the day, Strike 2 Dog, 41 Japanese planes were shot down by Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's Task Group 38.2 and a similar number were destroyed on the ground by bombing and <b>strafing</b> runs.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by <b>strafing</b> while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
50|$|The circle {{jump start}} is the action {{performed}} by the player {{at the start of}} <b>strafe</b> jumping, giving a sudden burst of speed, as opposed to gaining speed with regular <b>strafe</b> jumping. This technique is found to have worked best in Quake engine based games.|$|R
5000|$|While {{releasing}} the forward key, the player jumps, and pressing either the move left or the move right key (ergo the <b>strafe</b> in the term, strafe-jumping). The <b>strafe</b> and jump keys should be pressed {{at the same}} time, and the jump key immediately released.|$|R
50|$|The player now {{continues}} into <b>strafe</b> jumping.|$|R
5|$|At around 07:00, {{the deer}} on the {{expansive}} lawns of the French colonial-era palace were frightened off as Quốc and Cử—flying American-built A-1 Skyraiders (A1H/AD-6 variant) single-seater ground attack planes—flew low over their target {{to inspect the}} ruling family's residence. On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and <b>strafing</b> the presidential compound with machine-gun fire. The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make <b>strafing</b> runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful <b>strafing</b> attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E

50|$|On 7 December, Bopaya and Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon escorted another raid {{into the}} Poonch sector, and <b>strafed</b> enemy {{positions}} after the Vampires had delivered their weapons. On the 8th, Raina and Ghuman escorted another raid into Kargil, and <b>strafed</b> enemy bunkers after the bombs were delivered.|$|R

5|$|During late November and December 1944, No. 78 Squadron {{participated in}} attacks against Japanese {{positions}} in New Britain alongside No. 76 and No. 77 Squadrons, which were also equipped with Kittyhawks. These operations were undertaken {{to support the}} landings conducted by American forces at Arawe on 15 December and Cape Gloucester on the 26th of the month. In addition to bombing and <b>strafing</b> Japanese positions, No. 78 Squadron also escorted RAAF and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|During the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the Royal Air Force {{deployed}} Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei {{to provide}} support for British ground forces; Hunters launched both dummy and real <b>strafing</b> runs on ground targets to intimidate and pin down rebels. In one event, several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels. Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle. In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation, Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya.|$|E
5|$|Echoes also {{features}} a multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to engage in combat using a split screen. It has six arenas and two modes: Deathmatch, in which players attempt to kill their opponents {{as many times as}} possible within a set amount of time; and Bounty, which focuses on collecting coins that injured characters drop. Multiplayer in Echoes features the same control scheme as the single-player mode, including the lock-on system for circle <b>strafing</b> while targeting.|$|E

5|$|Following his 23rd {{victory on}} 1 April, Voss fired upon pilot and plane {{on the ground}} after the crash. On 6 April 1917, he staked two victory claims 15 minutes apart, having brought down a {{two-seater}} and a Sopwith Pup near one another {{on either side of}} the front lines. The two-seater pilot braved both Voss's <b>strafing</b> and incoming German artillery to retrieve aerial photography plates for their military intelligence value. The Sopwith Pup, though later seen with Jasta 2 in German markings after its capture, was an unconfirmed victory despite landing behind German lines.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, after {{returning}} to command of X Corps, Horrocks sustained serious injuries during an air raid at Bizerte, while watching an amphibious rehearsal by the 46th Infantry Division for Operation Avalanche, the Salerno landings. Bullets from a <b>strafing</b> German fighter struck his upper chest and carried on through his body, piercing his lungs, stomach, and intestines. He underwent five operations and spent fourteenmonths recovering. He was replaced as commander of X Corps by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard McCreery.|$|E
5|$|No 141 Squadron's Beaufighter Mk.IF's {{moved to}} Cornwall in February 1943 {{to carry out}} night patrols over Brittany and France and {{daylight}} patrols over the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Approaches to protect RAF Coastal Command aircraft. On 20 March 1943 he claimed a locomotive destroyed and soon afterwards was promoted to acting wing commander. In April Braham attacked a German E-Boat, firing 500 rounds of 20mm cannon at the target causing a large fire. On other operations Braham damaged three E-Boats while also <b>strafing</b> and damaging a U-Boat.|$|E

5|$|No. 351 Squadron flew {{its first}} mission on 13 October 1944; it {{involved}} six aircraft attacking an Axis supply convoy {{near the village}} of Aržano. On 20 October, aircraft from the squadron, supported by Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, conducted rocket and <b>strafing</b> attacks on enemy columns near Metković that were withdrawing {{in the face of the}} advancing Partisan 26th Dalmatian Division. The mission was a success, but one aircraft was lost to ground fire.|$|E
5|$|On April 6 at 3:15p.m., a third {{attempt was}} made to pick Hambleton and now Clark up. Four Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (Sandys 01, 02, 05, and 06) {{prepared}} the area around the survivors with extensive bombing and <b>strafing.</b> They were assisted by two HH53C helicopters (Jolly Green 67 and Jolly Green 60) from the 37th Air Rescue Squadron. During the day American fighters flew 52 sorties and four B-52 bombers bombed the area around Cam Lo.|$|E
5|$|Rebasing at Khartoum, No. 237 Squadron {{undertook}} regular reconnaissance, dive-bombing and <b>strafing</b> sorties during October and November 1940. Meanwhile, the Southern Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery {{arrived in}} Kenya in October and, following {{a period of}} training, received 2-pounder guns and joined the front at Garissa {{around the turn of}} the new year. No.237 Squadron was partially re-equipped during January 1941, receiving some Westland Lysander Mk IIs, but most of the squadron continued operating Hardys.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Strafe</b> (stylized as <b>STRAFE)</b> is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Pixel Titans {{and published by}} Devolver Digital. The game is an homage to 1990s first-person shooter video games, such as Doom and Quake, advertised as to have [...] "bleeding edge graphics and gameplay", citing the year 1996.

Later, several squadron aircraft led by their commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Renfro, bombed and <b>strafed</b> Jaluit, sinking two ships and damaging two others.|$|R
5|$|Tadayoshi Koga, a 19-year-old flight {{petty officer}} first class, was {{launched}} from the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō {{as part of}} the June 4 raid. Koga was part of a three-plane section; his wingmen were Chief Petty Officer Makoto Endo and Petty Officer Tsuguo Shikada. Koga and his comrades attacked Dutch Harbor, shooting down an American PBY-5A Catalina flying boat piloted by Bud Mitchell and <b>strafing</b> its survivors in the water. In the process, Koga's plane (serial number 4593) was damaged by small arms fire.|$|E
5|$|The Batmobile has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including <b>strafing</b> in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E
5|$|The British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service used {{black for}} night bombers, while {{a wide variety}} of {{experimental}} camouflages were tried out for specific roles such as trench <b>strafing,</b> with multiple colors. Alternatives were tested in late 1917 at Orfordness Experimental Station, resulting in NIVO (Night Invisible Varnish Orfordness) being introduced in early 1918, used for all external surfaces on night bombers until superseded by World War II colors.|$|E
