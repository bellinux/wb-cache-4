25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

[...] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died {{suddenly}} of [...] "brain congestion" [...] at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was once my study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E

[...] The Pennsylvania Inquirer reprinted it with the heading [...] "A Beautiful Poem". Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, [...] "Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a fit o' horror, here in England. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'." [...] Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite [...] "The Raven" [...] and to lecture– in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, [...] "to hear [...] repeat the Raven... is an event in one's life." [...] It was recalled by someone who experienced it, [...] "He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing {{in the center of the}} apartment he would recite... in the most melodious of voices... So marvelous was his power as a reader that the auditors would be afraid to draw breath lest the enchanted spell be broken." ...|$|E
