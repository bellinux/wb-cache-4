25|$|Yale Law Professor, and {{opponent}} of mass incarceration James Forman Jr. has countered that 1) African Americans, {{as represented by}} such cities as the District of Columbia, have generally supported tough on crime policies. 2) There {{appears to be a}} connection between drugs and violent crimes, the discussion of which, he <b>says,</b> <b>New</b> Jim Crow theorists have avoided. 3) New theorists have overlooked class as a factor in incarceration. Blacks with advanced degrees have fewer convictions. Blacks without advanced education have more.|$|E

500|$|Warhol sent Blum thirty-two [...] canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each {{representing}} a particular {{variety of the}} Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time. The thirty-two canvases are very similar: each is a realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can silkscreened onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: Clam Chowder has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (Manhattan Style), {{which means that the}} soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; Beef has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says (With Vegetables and Barley); Scotch Broth has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (A Hearty Soup); and Minestrone had black parenthetical lettering saying (Italian-Style Vegetable Soup). There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: Beef Broth (Bouillon) and Consommé (Beef). The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice has the word Soup depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, Cheddar Cheese has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner <b>says</b> <b>New!,</b> and a middle center golden banner says Great As A Sauce Too!.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have also}} said it is {{detrimental}} to the presumption of innocence. [...] "It's {{a way for the}} police to try their case in the press and to get the intimation of guilt by virtue of an arrest," [...] <b>says</b> <b>New</b> York Civil Liberties Union director Donna Lieberman. [...] "The question is, does it poison the right to a fair trial? And that depends on each case." [...] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice observed that [...] "nder such circumstances, even Mother Teresa would look extremely suspicious, especially if her hands were cuffed behind her back." [...] Acknowledging a common response to such criticisms, that no arrested defendant is spared the perp walk, law professor Patricia Williams says [...] "the perp walk is a social equalizer all right, but not in a good way" [...] since the United States leads the world in incarceration rates. [...] " [...] is hardly the greatest icon of equal rights".|$|E
2500|$|While Yanni {{has said}} that new age is [...] "a spiritual {{definition}} more than a musical definition," [...] his music has been said to be [...] "adopted by" [...] the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called contemporary instrumental and {{has been described as}} [...] "an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock." [...] However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as [...] "Greek" [...] and [...] "new age," [...] emphasizing that [...] "when someone <b>says</b> <b>new</b> age music, I think of something that you put on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested." [...] Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: [...] "New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic." ...|$|E
