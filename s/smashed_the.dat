5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was <b>smashed.</b> <b>The</b> majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E

The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E

5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and <b>smashed</b> <b>the</b> windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In 1661, after Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne, Robert Creighton, the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop {{for two years before}} his death in 1672. His brass lectern, given in thanksgiving, {{can be seen in the}} cathedral. He donated the nave's great west window at a cost of £140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to Ralph Bathurst, who had been chaplain to the king, president of Trinity College, Oxford and fellow of the Royal Society. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral {{was restored}}, but in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, <b>smashed</b> <b>the</b> organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.|$|E

5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners in a case that was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place {{in the lobby of the}} hotel when thieves wearing ski masks <b>smashed</b> <b>the</b> jewellery cabinets with a sledgehammer and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly <b>smashed</b> <b>the</b> inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then <b>smashed</b> <b>the</b> window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E

5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and <b>smashed</b> <b>the</b> {{window of a}} police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
