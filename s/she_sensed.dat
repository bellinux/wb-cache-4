25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe {{last great}} artist. When {{you think this}} woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Manga creator Katsura Hoshino {{said that}} she did not know how Allen originated, since she likes her main {{characters}} to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said that the general idea for his design was an [...] "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair and other things like that", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order (the group Allen joins in the series) <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> a [...] "lack of coordination". Hoshino felt that a more-mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best with the Black Order uniform, she wondered if it should be more masculine. Because he is an Exorcist, she wanted him to have a [...] "very scary-looking image" [...] and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a [...] "gloomy" [...] impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century, and his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a [...] "gentlemanly image".|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{reproduced}} {{parts of}} Campbell of Islay's manuscripts when writing Survivals in belief among the Celts (1911). Among {{them is a}} story listed as [...] "boobrie as tarbh uisge". The tale starts by detailing how a man named Eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death {{at the side of}} Loch nan Dobhran, on the west coast of Argyll. Some months later, Phemie, Eachann's girlfriend, is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch, which make her think of Murdoch, her former paramour. While she sat dreaming of Eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near the loch, <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> the flicker of a shadow behind her, except this time it was Murdoch. He promptly overpowered her by enveloping her in a blanket and tying her hands. At that point, a water bull came to Phemie's rescue by knocking Murdoch to the ground. The bull then knelt down allowing Phemie to get on its back, before transporting her {{at the speed of light}} back to the home of her mother. The bull disappeared never to be seen again but a [...] "voice was heard in the air calling out loudly". The verse heard was in Gaelic, and translates as: ...|$|E
50|$|Ruth Bowen (Jodie Whittaker). Grieving for her eight-year-old {{daughter}} Alice who drowned {{six months}} previously, <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> <b>she</b> has been misled on {{the cause of}} Alice's death.|$|R
6000|$|Now did <b>she</b> <b>sense</b> this fleeting, unuttered {{flash of}} mine? I know not, save that her {{laughter}} left her, and long conventional training asserted itself as she said: ...|$|R
50|$|A crystal snake {{that serves}} Sogo and Felia. Called Moura for short, she can {{transform}} into a mecha when <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> danger. <b>She</b> is there mainly to keep Felia's powers in check.|$|R
2500|$|Dahmer {{has been}} {{described}} as being an [...] "energetic and happy child" [...] until he became notably subdued after undergoing a double hernia surgery, which was performed shortly before his fourth birthday. He recalled his early years of family life as being of [...] "extreme tension" [...] which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, he was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described Dahmer as a reserved child whom <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> felt neglected. This teacher did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses. Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.|$|E
60|$|He breathed heavily. She {{could see}} how pale he had grown in the shadowy moonlight. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> a {{difference}} in him--a cool, reckless defiance.|$|E
60|$|Kathleen was a {{precocious}} child, {{with all}} the potentialities of youth. She could not divine Lenore's motive, but <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> a new and fascinating mode of conduct for herself. She seemed puzzled a little at Lenore's earnestness.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>senses</b> that <b>she</b> is delving {{below the}} surface of the complex {{arguments}} of the situationists; she “sees,” for example, the financial interest, the prejudice, or the distorting zealotry that motivates the situationist.|$|R
50|$|Guy shows Harriet {{the sites}} of Bucharest {{especially}} the cafes and the Cismigiu Park. She meets Sophie, a half Jewish student of Guy's who <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> is a rival for Guys affections as she seeks {{the security of a}} passport.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Daphne is courted by Ronald Merrick, {{the local police}} chief. <b>She</b> <b>senses</b> {{something}} sinister about Merrick, and is put off when he lectures her about the propriety of relationships of any kind between whites and Indians.|$|R
60|$|Helen {{watched the}} cowboy glide {{across the room}} and {{carefully}} close the door, then return to her with intent eyes. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> events in his look, and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her brother.|$|E
60|$|Cleve {{seemed to}} expand, to grow taller, to thrill under her nervous hands. And then {{he kissed her}} differently. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> a shyness, a happiness, a {{something}} hitherto foreign to his attitude. It was spiritual, and somehow she received an uplift of hope.|$|E
6000|$|She wondered, for the thousandth time, what a windlute was; yet much of beauty, much of beyondness, <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> of this dimly remembered {{beautiful}} {{mother of}} hers. She communed a while, then unrolled a second manuscript. [...] "To C. B.," [...] it read. To Carlton Brown, she knew, to her father, a love-poem from her mother. Saxon pondered the opening lines: ...|$|E
50|$|Willow and Giles {{continue}} to duel. As {{she begins to}} overpower him, Willow also directs a magical attack at Xander, Dawn, and the others, forcing Buffy to leave to protect them. Willow then defeats Giles and drains his magical strength; the power breaks down her emotional shields. Overwhelmed by her pain and all the pain <b>she</b> <b>senses,</b> <b>she</b> announces she will end it by ending the world.|$|R
5000|$|In the NBC {{science fiction}} series Heroes, the deaf {{character}} Emma (played by Deanne Bray) suddenly begins to see sounds as waves of color. Holding the cello in her hands, <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> vibrations as sounds which converts to a synesthetic experience of colors.|$|R
50|$|Agot Isidro as Reyna Bukang Liwayway - Pedro's mother, who {{together}} with his father Juan, rules the kingdom of Floreshka. Like Lolo Pedro, <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> {{the presence of an}} evil spirit roaming earth, and will check up on her son every once in a while.|$|R
60|$|It {{was obvious}} to Helen that Roy and Dale had {{exchanged}} stories. Roy celebrated this reunion by sitting at table {{the first time since}} he had been shot; and despite Helen's misfortune and the suspended waiting balance in the air the occasion was joyous. Old Mrs. Cass was in the height of her glory. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> a romance here, and, true to her sex, she radiated to it.|$|E
60|$|She is a witch, and {{her voice}} is {{not the least of}} her witchery, he thought, as her voice, so richly a woman's voice, so {{essentially}} her voice in contradistinction to all women's voices in the world, sang and throbbed in his ear. And he knew, beyond shade of doubt, that she felt some touch of this madness that afflicted him; that <b>she</b> <b>sensed,</b> as he sensed, that the man and the woman were met.|$|E
60|$|She contrasted {{him with}} the others. They frankly amused her, and {{sometimes}} Kit was dull. Yet <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> in his soberness something fine that did not mark the rest. They joked and did not bother; Kit bothered much. Betty liked his tight-mouthed, thoughtful look. His habit was to weigh things, {{but when he was}} satisfied he went stubbornly ahead. Betty wondered whether he was satisfied about Olivia. Then, with something of an effort, she resumed her calculations.|$|E
5000|$|As Sarah begins {{spending}} more time at Shutters, <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> crimes that have been committed by the prison's long-dead inmates. Though as Sarah begins to look further into the mystery, two of her enemies fall victims of violence, and their town becomes thirsty for revenge.|$|R
5000|$|Stella and the Swinging Five: Stella Starr, a young guitar player, {{joins the}} newly formed girls' pop group, The Swinging Five and hopes to earn enough money to save her grandfather's rundown cafe. However, <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> {{something}} odd about the group's organiser, Madame Svengler, {{who is also a}} miser.|$|R
5000|$|... 13-year-old Minerva Clark {{lives in}} Portland, Oregon {{and is being}} raised by her three brothers. She is a typical {{insecure}} teenager, but when she is struck by lightning, her personality changes - she becomes outgoing and confident overnight. And when <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> a mystery <b>she</b> cannot resist investigating.|$|R
60|$|His tone, his gloom {{made her}} shiver. It would take all her {{intelligence}} and wit and reason to understand him, and vastly {{more than that}} to change him. She thought earnestly. This was to be an ordeal profoundly more difficult than the confession of her love. It was indeed a crisis dwarfing the other she had met. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> in him a remarkably strange attitude toward this war, {{compared with that of}} her brother or other boys she knew who had gone.|$|E
60|$|How {{beautiful}} {{the response}} of this rude cowboy--to realize his absolute unconsciousness of self, to see the haggard shade burn out of his face, the old, cool, devil-may-care spirit return to his eyes, and to feel something wonderful about him then! It was more than will or daring or sacrifice. A blood-tie might have existed between him and Madeline. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> again that indefinable brother-like quality, so fine, so almost invisible, {{which seemed to be}} an inalienable trait in these wild cowboys.|$|E
60|$|Sally got up abruptly. Slowly, gradually, inch by inch, {{the great}} suffocating cloud {{which had been}} {{crushing}} her had lifted. She felt alive again. Her black hour had gone, and {{she was back in}} the world of living things once more. She was afire with a fierce, tearing pain that tormented her almost beyond endurance, but dimly <b>she</b> <b>sensed</b> {{the fact that she had}} passed through something that was worse than pain, and, with Ginger's stolid presence to aid her, had passed triumphantly.|$|E
5000|$|Miyu and Chisato's bookworm classmate. Shy and intelligent, <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> {{from the}} {{beginning}} that there is something odd about Miyu and takes steps to investigate. Unfortunately, her discoveries lead to her death as she and Yukari come in contact with Miyu shortly after dealing with a shinma. Hisae is killed by Chisato.|$|R
50|$|Mino soon befriends two Austrian {{officers}} Vavra and Delkin. Vavra is an intellectual, {{who often}} {{goes to the}} same villa as Mino to read the many books in the villas library. Mino has grown and begins to look at Naide with different the eyes. <b>She</b> <b>senses</b> it and soon they share his first kiss.|$|R
50|$|Back at the restaurant, Vicki is safe {{again and}} Stefan asks Caroline and Bonnie about Elena. Bonnie writes down Elena's number {{to give it}} to him but the moment she touches him <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> that {{something}} bad happened to him. She asks him about it but she realizes she was being rude so she apologizes and leaves.|$|R
60|$|She {{loved to}} visit her brother William's farm, and to ride past the old McClintock house in which my father had courted her. Her {{expression}} at such times was sweetly sorrowful. The past appeared so happy, so secure, her present so precarious, so full of pain. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> the mystery, the tragedy of human life, {{but was unable to}} express her conceptions,--and I was of no value as a comforter. I could only jest with a bitter sense of helplessness.|$|E
60|$|They took {{seats at}} the table which the cook, Jake, was loading with {{steaming}} victuals. Supper {{appeared to be a}} rather sumptuous one this evening, in honor of the expected guest, who had not come. Columbine helped the old man to his favorite dishes, stealing furtive glances at his lined and shadowed face. <b>She</b> <b>sensed</b> a subtle change in him since the afternoon, but could not see any sign of it in his look or demeanor. His appetite was as hearty as ever.|$|E
60|$|Back in {{the middle}} of the hall, Ernestine was gayly {{grouping}} the victims, and privily, from the faces of Lottie, Paula, and Graham, trying to learn more of the something untoward that <b>she</b> <b>sensed.</b> Why had Lottie looked so immediately and searchingly at Graham and Paula? --she asked herself. And something was wrong with Paula now. She was worried, disturbed, and not in the way to be expected from the announcement of Jeremy Braxton's death. From Graham, Ernestine could glean nothing. He was quite his ordinary self, his facetiousness the cause of much laughter to Miss Maxwell and Mrs. Watson.|$|E
50|$|Father Connolly arrives to {{administer}} the last rites. Granny feels she does not need the priest. She made her peace with God long ago. As <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> her time running out, she thinks {{of all the things}} she wants to tell her children, who have assembled to say their goodbyes. She thinks of Hapsy and wonders if she will see her again.|$|R
50|$|Parsty is a polybop, {{and a day}} {{older than}} Plasmo. She wears a tiara upon her head which allows her to create a {{protective}} forcefield around her. She has a little pet called Niknik. Parsty is quite protective of Plasmo and she will assert herself against bullying characters, such as Coredor, if <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> {{they are trying to}} exploit Plasmo's niceness and friendliness.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} episode of Season Three, Tracy Vetter is called {{to the site of}} a plane crash, where <b>she</b> <b>senses</b> one of the victims is still alive. Everyone tells her she's crazy, but we see this victim's eyes open and watch him scurry off. He is Javier Vachon, and he and Tracy meet again during {{subsequent}} episodes and develop a close relationship.|$|R
