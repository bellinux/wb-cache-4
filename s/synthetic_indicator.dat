40|$|Dynamic {{changes in}} {{intracellular}} calcium concentration {{in response to}} various stimuli regulates many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis 1. During apoptosis, calcium accumulation in mitochondria promotes the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria into the cytosol 2. It is therefore of interest to directly measure mitochondrial calcium in living cells in situ during apoptosis. High-resolution fluorescent imaging of cells loaded with dual-excitation ratiometric and non-ratiometric <b>synthetic</b> calcium <b>indicator</b> dyes has been {{proven to be a}} reliable and versatile tool to study various aspects of intracellular calcium signaling. Measuring cytosolic calcium fluxes using these techniques is relatively straightforward. However, measuring intramitochondrial calcium levels in intact cells using <b>synthetic</b> calcium <b>indicators</b> such as rhod- 2 and rhod-FF is more challenging. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>indicators</b> targeted to mitochondria have blunted responses to repetitive increases in mitochondrial calcium, and disrupt mitochondrial morphology 3.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{data-driven}} policymaking has gained more and more importance due to the larger availability of data (and, more recently, Big Data) for designing proper and timely economic and social policies. This larger availability of data has let decision makers have a deeper insight of complex socio-economic phenomena (e. g. unemployment, deprivation, crime, social care, healthcare) but, at the same time, it has drastically {{increased the number of}} indicators {{that can be used to}} monitor these phenomena. Decision makers are now often in the condition of taking decisions with large batteries of indicators whose interpretation is not always easy or concordant. In order to simplify the decisional process, a large body of literature suggests to use <b>synthetic</b> <b>indicators</b> to produce single measures of vast, latent phenomena underlying groups of indicators. Unfortunately, although simple, this solution has a number of drawbacks (e. g. compensation between components of <b>synthetic</b> <b>indicators</b> could be undesirable; subjective weighting of the components could lead to arbitrary results; mixing information about different phenomena could make interpretation harder and decisionmaking opaque). Moreover, with operational decisions, it is necessary to distinguish between those situations when decisions can be embedded in automated processes, and those that require human intervention. Under certain conditions, the use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>indicators</b> may bring to a misleading interpretation of the real world and to wrong policy decisions. In order to overcome all these limitations and drawbacks of <b>synthetic</b> <b>indicators,</b> the use of multi-indicator systems is becoming more and more important to describe and characterize many phenomena in every field of science, as they keep the valuable information, inherent to each indicator, distinct (see, for a review: Brüggemann and Patil 2011) ...|$|R

In particular, as competition in mobile communications technology innovation among countries become more intense, there are growing needs for enhanced judgment, evaluation, and prediction of technological capabilities in order to improve a national competitiveness. Over the past decade, the mobile communications can be considered as the fastest growing industry. The worldwide mobile subscribers were 5. 28 billion in 2010 and are expected to 7. 3 billion in 2016.

30|$|One of the {{priorities}} of health systems is ensuring the quality of primary care (Nietert et al. 2007). To achieve this objective, multiple indicators {{have been developed to}} assess the quality of clinical practice (McColl et al. 1998). Nonetheless, utilization of numerous partial indicators makes it difficult to achieve a global interpretation and to compare individuals as well as groups or centres. In many situations, the use of fewer but more comprehensive indicators is preferable. Along this line, some composite, or <b>synthetic,</b> <b>indicators</b> have been defined that condense the measurement of several subindicators into one value, thereby facilitating interpretation and better representing the process of healthcare delivery (Saturno 2004). The possibility of summarizing quality of care in one measurement has made these <b>synthetic</b> <b>indicators</b> very attractive for comparisons between different centres and professionals. Among other characteristics, good health indicators should be valid, evidence-based, comparable, modifiable, directed toward health problems of importance due to their severity or frequency in primary care patients, feasible to obtain without overburdening the healthcare professional and finally, they must deliver health benefits to the population with minimal secondary effects (Brown and Lilford 2006; NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement).
