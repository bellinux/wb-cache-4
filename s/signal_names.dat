50|$|Symbolic <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> {{are used}} because signal numbers can vary across platforms, but XSI-conformant systems allow {{the use of}} the numeric {{constant}} 1 to be used to indicate a SIGHUP, which the vast majority of systems in fact use.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, if {{the process}} {{attempted}} to access a memory address outside of its virtual address space, the kernel would notify {{the process of}} this violation via a SIGSEGV signal.

50|$|At the {{operating}} system level, this fault is caught and a signal is {{passed on to the}} offending process, activating the process's handler for that signal. Different operating systems have different <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> to indicate that a segmentation fault has occurred. On Unix-like operating systems, a signal called SIGSEGV (abbreviated from segmentation violation) is sent to the offending process. On Microsoft Windows, the offending process receives a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION exception.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the design}} of the Altair, the {{hardware}} required to make a usable machine was not available in time for the January 1975 launch date. The designer, Ed Roberts, also had the problem of the backplane taking up too much room. Attempting to avoid these problems, he placed the existing components in a case with additional [...] "slots", so that the missing components could be plugged in later when they became available. The backplane was split into four separate cards, with the CPU on a fifth. He then looked for an inexpensive source of connectors, and he came across a supply of military surplus 100-pin edge connectors. The 100-pin bus was created by an anonymous draftsman, who selected the connector from a parts catalog and arbitrarily assigned <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> to groups of connector pins.|$|E
50|$|The COMTRADE {{file format}} has been {{standardised}} by the Power System Relaying Committee (PSRC) of the IEEE Power & Energy Society as C37.111. The {{most widely used}} version of the COMTRADE standard is C37.111-1999. This version specified a file format that consisted of multiple file types designated by the assigned file extensions of *.CFG, *.INF, *.HDR, and *.DAT. The *.DAT file contains the digitized sample data in an ASCII text format. The *.CFG file contains configuration data on {{what is in the}} *.DAT file including information such as <b>signal</b> <b>names,</b> start time of the samples, number of samples, min/max values, and more. Only the *.CFG and *.DAT files were mandatory. Although the values of the digitized samples in the *.DAT file are viewable without the *.CFG file, the value of the data is greatly diminished as {{it would be very difficult}} to fully reconstruct the meaning of the data without the *.CFG file.|$|E

Figure 1 : SERDES views (top and bottom) and PCB dimensions The interface to a host board consists of 16 -bit transmitter and 16 -bit receiver paths and several control and status signals for the TLK and SFP transceivers. The main reference clock for the TLK transceiver (INCLK) is provided from the host board. For reliable transmission the jitter requirements (see datasheets) must be observed. The Samtec MOLC- 120 - 31 -S-Q 80 -pin connector is used on SERDES card and the Samtec FOLC- 120 - 01 -S-Q socket should be used on a host board. The list of signals is shown in Table 2.

Using the template This is {{a template}} that architects and organizations can use for documenting an architecture viewpoint in accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 : 2011 [6]. In particular, the requirements on viewpoints are found in Clause 7 of that Standard.

Each slot is identified by a heading name followed by {{a brief description of}} its intended content and guidance for developing that content. The template uses a few conventions, as follows. ⋆ “Musts ” are items which must be present to satisfy the Standard. Musts are marked like this. ✷ “Shoulds ” are items recommended to be present, but not required by the Standard. Shoulds are marked like this.
