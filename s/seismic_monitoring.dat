Over the next decade, this system was improved, and a network of <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> stations was established to detect underground tests.

25|$|But geophysicists who {{analysed}} {{the seismic}} signals {{concluded that the}} initial sound recorded was triggered by an explosion and not a collision with another vessel. The seismic waveforms of the second event, known {{to be from the}} explosion of several torpedo warheads, also generated a high-frequency bubble signature characteristic of an underwater explosion of approximately 3–7 tons of TNT. When they compared the second event with the first, they concluded that the first event was also the explosion of a torpedo. Britain's Blacknest <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> station, which studies seismic signals generated by underground nuclear explosions and earthquakes, identified two distinct explosions. They determined that the two shockwaves were a perfect match and consistent with a torpedo explosion.|$|E

25|$|Mount Merapi is {{the site}} of a very active volcano {{monitoring}} program. <b>Seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between Merbabu and Merapi), and Plawangan monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into Kaliurang {{as a response to the}} threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.|$|E
500|$|Typically, {{up to five}} {{earthquakes}} {{are recorded}} monthly near the summit. Swarms of five to ten shallow earthquakes over {{two or three days}} take place from time to time, predominantly in the region of [...] below the summit. These earthquakes are thought to be caused by the circulation of hot fluids beneath Mount Rainier. Presumably, hot springs and steam vents within Mount Rainier National Park are generated by such fluids. Seismic swarms (not initiated with a mainshock) are common features at volcanoes, and are rarely associated with eruptive activity. Rainier has had several such swarms; there were days-long swarms in 2002, 2004, and 2007, two of which (2002 and 2004) included M 3.2 earthquakes. A 2009 swarm produced the largest number of events of any swarm at Rainier since <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> began over two decades earlier. Yet another swarm was observed in 2011.|$|E
500|$|While {{earthquakes}} are {{uncommon in}} South Africa in general, the earthquake {{occurred in a}} mining belt where earthquakes are relatively common.

The earthquake occurred on 9March2005 at DRDGOLD's Hartebeesfontein mine in Stilfontein, killing two miners underground and resulting in the closure of the mine. An investigation by the mining regulator following the incident found that it was caused by mining and further seismic events would occur while mining continued. The report on the investigation recommended improvements in <b>seismic</b> <b>monitoring</b> among other things, and some of the recommendations had been implemented before the 2014 earthquake. The USGS recorded a 4.9 moment magnitude earthquake on 15June2014 in the same area, which earth science consultant Dr Chris Hartnady believes may have been a foreshock.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of civil infrastructures under transient dynamic events {{is of particular}} interests for structural engineers, because these event-induced responses usually provide useful insights into the real dynamic behavior of civil infrastructures under extreme conditions. Monitoring these dynamic event induced vibrations {{are among the most}} frequently conducted measurements and experiments in the structural engineering field, and a cheaper, simpler and more flexible monitoring system is always under pursuit of civil engineers. One particular such request comes from the <b>seismic</b> response <b>monitoring</b> applications. <b>Seismic</b> response <b>monitoring</b> for general civil infrastructure is critical in high-risk earthquake areas like Japan. It contributes to earthquake safety by providing quantitative measurement that enables improved understanding and predictive modeling of the earthquake {{response of}} these engineered systems. However, due to the limitations of the current <b>monitoring</b> systems, such <b>seismic</b> response records of general civil infrastructure are usually not available. Therefore, this research describes a novel development of an autonomous dynamic event monitoring system using Wireless Smart Sensor Network(WSSN), which is further extended to support the purpose of long-term <b>seismic</b> response <b>monitoring.</b> This developed WSSN monitoring system is portable and low-cost, it has a potential to provide long-term <b>seismic</b> response <b>monitoring</b> {{for a wide range of}} civil infrastructure. This system can run on existing power sources readily available in common civil infrastructure and thus is able to perform long-term continuous sensing as demanded by the <b>seismic</b> response <b>monitoring</b> applications. A quick and stable event detection method is developed to trigger the recording of the complete seismic response and also eliminate possible false alerts caused by unexpected disturbance. Long-term network-wide time synchronization is guaranteed by a customized long-term Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol(FTSP) so that the all sensor nodes in the network can provide consistent time records of their captured seismic response. An efficient multi-hop service module is also incorporated into the system to disseminate commands and accommodate the need of collecting data in a reliable and prompt manner after major earthquakes, the integrated multi-hop data collection protocol provides a theoretically optimum data collection efficiency. Various experiments have been done to validate the developed programs. Suggestions are also given towards the final realization of successful long-term implementation of the developed monitoring system. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士（工学）; 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{has caused}} collapse {{of more than}} 6.5 million buildings and damaged some 23 million more. [...] Four factors determine the damage to a particular building, according to geologist Liu Jie (...) , Director of Earthquake Prediction Department of (China's) Center for <b>Seismic</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Station Network under the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), who arrived in quake zone the same day of the main quake. [...] Besides the quake's magnitude and intensity in the area, {{the location of the}} building played an important role. In some towns that Liu surveyed, all buildings sitting on the earthquake fault line collapsed, while buildings tens of meters away did not. Building structure was also a factor. Buildings with larger spans tend to collapse more easily. The fourth factor was the quality of the building. If a building's designed fortification intensity is above the quake's intensity at the location, the collapse of a building can be definitively attributed to its engineering quality, Liu explained. On the other hand, if the quake's intensity exceeds the designated code, {{it would be hard to}} determine whether the earthquake engineering quality is the deciding factor of its collapse.|$|E
