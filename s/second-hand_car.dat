His father Himanshu Pandya ran a small car finance {{business}} in Surat which he shut down and, shifted to Vadodara when Hardik was five, {{in order to facilitate}} his sons with better cricket training facilities. He enrolled his two sons (Hardik and Krunal) into Kiran More's cricket academy in Vadodara. Financially weak, the Pandya family lived in a rented apartment in Gorwa, with the brothers using a <b>second-hand</b> <b>car</b> to travel to the cricket ground.

40|$|Certain {{features}} of imported <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> (e. g., age, degree of wear and tear, technical design) can increase their likelihood for traffic crashes. Three official datasets which cover an eight year period (2008 – 2015) {{are used to}} test the connection between importation of <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> and different types of traffic crashes. The traffic crashes database was provided by the Traffic Department of the General Inspectorate of Romanian Police (GIRPTD). The car registration database was provided by Driving-License and Vehicles-Registration Direction (DLVRD). Right-hand driving (RHD) cars database was provided by the Romanian Automotive Registry (RAR). A spatio-temporal visualization of data was performed using Geographic Information System (GIS) while for the statistical analysis we use regression models and Pearson-Correlation-coefficient. The analysis suggests that {{a significant part of the}} variation in the volume of traffic accidents can be explained by the volume of imported <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> at the county level. Moreover, an even stronger direct relation exists between the number of imported <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> and Severe Traffic Accidents but also in the case of RHD imported <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars.</b> The overall impact of imported <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> on the traffic safety in Romania is significant but small in comparison to other types of car registration. Study results belong to the category of empirical evidence production which can improve the quality of existing traffic regulations focused both on organizing and ensuring traffic safety, and on the policy of sustainable transport infrastructure development...|$|R
25|$|Result: Platinum {{got out to}} {{an early}} start, getting some {{relatively}} good discounts on their first few items, but things were marred by infighting among the sub-team of David, Amy and Lucy. The team also struggled to find {{some of the more}} expensive items on the list, and were late back to the Coliseum. None of the Odyssey members started buying anything until three hours in, with the sub-team of Patrick, Maria and Navdeep spending a further three hours doing research. Their research did pay off however, as they got some significant discounts on the items that they did buy. Ultimately the teams both bought only five of the ten items each. However, Platinum were cost dearly by being late and not buying a <b>second-hand</b> <b>car,</b> the most expensive item on the list and correspondingly the one with the biggest fine. Platinum's total spend was £2,204, and Odyssey's total spend was £2,033.|$|E

40|$|Today {{more and}} more people buy {{second-hand}} products on internet. As the typical durable goods, <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> are very popular among consumers. In recent years, the sale of <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars</b> increases quickly in China. In addition, there is still potential in the second-hand market. On the other hand, consumers are the subject in the second-hand market. So what consumers take into consideration is important when buying <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars.</b> We have chosen some social factors that influence consumers’ decision when they purchase <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars.</b> Furthermore, we have analyzed the importance of these social factors and the relationship between factors. The {{purpose of this study is}} to give vehicle dealers a guide how consumers with different characteristics will pay attention to different factors of the cars but also to guide consumers to make a rational decision when they buy <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars.</b> We have chosen the EKB model as our basic theory. A quantitative research approach and cross sectional research design were used in this study. The link of our questionnaire was published in Baidu Tieba after being designed by SOJUMP and we collected 151 responses. Then, respondent demographics, cross tabulations analysis, one-way ANOVA analysis, Cronbach’s alpha, and sorting analysis were analyzed. The results show that information about the real condition of the car is the most important factor influencing customers when purchasing <b>second-hand</b> <b>cars,</b> price is the second most influencing factor, vehicle model and brand are the third and the fourth respectively, after-sales service ranks the least as most influencing factor...|$|R
