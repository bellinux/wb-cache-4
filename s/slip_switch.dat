50|$|An outside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{is similar}} to the double or single slip {{switches}} described above, except that the switch blades are outside of the diamond instead of inside. An advantage over an inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is that trains can pass the slips with higher speeds. A disadvantage over an inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is that they are longer and need more space.|$|E
5000|$|An outside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{can be so}} {{long that}} its slips do not overlap at all, as in the example pictured. In such a case a single, outside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{is the same as}} two regular {{switches}} and a regular crossing. An outside, double <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is about the same as a scissors crossover (see below), but with the disadvantages: ...|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{disadvantages}} over both the double inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> and the scissors crossover, double outside slip switches are only used in rare, specific cases.|$|E
50|$|This {{elevated}} station, {{opened on}} September 16, 1888 {{on the lower}} level, has three tracks and two island platforms. The center track, normally used by J and Z trains for peak-direction express service on weekdays and late night M trains to Metropolitan Avenue, is unused due to construction on the Myrtle Avenue Line until April 2018. East of this station, all trains continue on the Jamaica Line to East New York and, in the J/Z case, to Queens. The connection to the Myrtle Avenue Line {{is one of the}} few remaining level junctions in the subway as well as one of the few places on revenue tracks with <b>slip</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of using either an over-running or under-running third rail by means of retractable shoes operated by pneumatic cylinders. The shoes were retracted to the vertical position outside of third rail territory: if extended, electrically live shoes would have projected towards the low-level station platforms that were the norm until the 1970s. A few early examples were fitted with a small DC pantograph for use within New York City's Grand Central Terminal, where long gaps exist in the third rail because of the complex trackage that includes numerous single and double <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> and double track ladders. These pantographs were soon removed. The complex trackage remains, but the overhead power rails are long gone.|$|R
50|$|Myrtle Avenue (announced on trains as Myrtle Avenue-Broadway) is a New York City Subway express {{station on}} the BMT Jamaica Line. Located at the {{intersection}} of Myrtle Avenue and Broadway in Brooklyn, it is served by the J train at all times, the M train at all times except late nights, and the Z during rush hours in peak direction. The station has two platform levels, but all regular passenger service is on the lower platform level of the station. The station has an abandoned upper platform level which previously served the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line to Downtown Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge. Just east of the station, the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line diverges from the BMT Jamaica Line via <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> in an at-grade junction.|$|R
50|$|A double <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> (double slip) is a narrow-angled {{diagonal}} flat {{crossing of}} two lines combined with four pairs of points {{in such a}} way as to allow vehicles to change from one straight track to the other, as well as going straight across. A train approaching the arrangement may leave by either of the two tracks on the opposite side of the crossing. To reach the third possible exit, the train must change tracks on the slip and then reverse.|$|E
50|$|A single <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or switch tracks to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot switch tracks. This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{describing}} the speech plannings employed by the fourth semester students of English Department, Dian Nuswantoro University in making conversation with their friends. The data was collected by recording the students’ conversation. The conversation lasted for about 30 minutes. The data, then, was transcribed into the written form. In analyzing the data, the writer used the framework proposed by Faerch and Kasper (1983 : 214). The result showed that the speech plannings the students usually attempted in making conversation are: temporal variables such as pause (filled), drawls; hesitation phenomena such as filled pause, repetition, and correction; and other phenomena like <b>slip,</b> <b>switch,</b> uptake signal, and interjection. From the kinds of speech plannings mentioned above {{it can be said}} that pauses (filled) were the most attempted by the students so they could gain time for execution. In general, the speech plannings attempted by the students indicate that the students’ speaking readiness is low. In other words, they often find problems in their conversation. ...|$|E
50|$|In a brushed DC motor {{the field}} is static but the {{armature}} current must be commutated, so as to continually rotate. This is done by supplying the armature windings on the rotor through a commutator, a combination of rotating <b>slip</b> ring and <b>switches.</b> AC induction motors also use field coils on the stator, the current on the rotor being supplied by induction in a squirrel cage.|$|R
40|$|The Maximum a Posteriori Ambiguity Search (MAPAS) {{method for}} GPS {{ambiguity}} resolution first introduced in [8], is generalized to accommodate: (1) satellite switches caused by satellites rising or falling {{below the horizon}} or obstructing terrain, and (2) cycle slips due to temporary loss of lock on satellite signals. It is shown that MAPAS and generalized MAPAS are equivalent to Bayesian estimation. The generalized MAPAS method is successfully applied to real GPS satellite data with cycle <b>slips</b> and satellite <b>switches</b> due to satellite obstruction...|$|R
40|$|Phase slips are topological {{fluctuation}} {{events that}} carry the superconducting order-parameter field between distinct current carrying states. Owing to these phase slips low-dimensional superconductors acquire electrical resistance. In quasi-one-dimensional nanowires {{it is well}} known that at higher temperatures phase slips occur via the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the order-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that phase slips should proceed via quantum tunneling events, which are known as quantum phase slips (QPS). However, experimental observation of QPS is a subject of strong debate and no consensus has been reached so far about the conditions under which QPS occurs. In this study, strong evidence for individual quantum tunneling events undergone by the superconducting order-parameter field in homogeneous nanowires is reported. This is ac-complished via measurements of the distribution of switching currents–the high-bias currents at which superconductivity gives way to resistive behavior–whose width exhibits a rather counter-intuitive, monotonic increase with decreasing temperature. A stochastic model of phase slip kinetics which relates the basic phase <b>slip</b> rates to <b>switching</b> rates is outlined...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} project, brake {{performance}} of heavy vehicles is improved {{by the development}} of new wheel-based functions for a longitudinal slip control braking system using novel Fast Acting Braking Valves (FABVs). To achieve this goal, Volvo Trucks' vehicle dynamics model has been extended to incorporate the FABV system. After validating the updated model with experimental data, a slip-slope based recursive least squares friction estimation algorithm has been implemented. Using information about the tire-road friction coecient, the sliding mode slip controller has been made adaptive to dierent road surfaces by implementing a frictiondependent reference <b>slip</b> signal and <b>switching</b> gain for the sliding mode controller. This switching gain is further optimized by means of a novel on-line optimization algorithm. Simulations show that the on-line friction estimation converges close to the reference friction level within one second for hard braking. Furthermore, using this information for the optimized controller has resulted in reduction of braking distance on most road surfaces of up to 20 percent, as well as in most cases a reduction in air usage...|$|R
40|$|Copper–graphite {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} possess {{the properties of}} copper, i. e. excellent thermal and electrical conductivities, and properties of graphite, i. e. solid lubricating and small thermal expansion coefficient. They are widely used as brushes, and bearing materials because of the above properties. Copper-graphite with low percentages of graphite is also used for <b>slip</b> rings, <b>switches,</b> relays, connectors, plugs and low voltage DC machines with very high current densities. In the present investigation, {{attempts have been made}} for the fabrication of Cu-graphite MMC by conventional and spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques. The MMCs were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different mechanical properties like density, bulk hardness and wear study were also conducted. XRD spectra show the presence of Cu, graphite and Cu 2 O peaks which shows that no interaction between Cu and graphite takes place during fabrication. The presence of a weak peak of Cu 2 O proves that slight oxidation of Cu takes place during sintering. It has been found that addition of graphite into copper does not result in much improvement in hardness due to the soft nature of graphite. However, 90 % and 97 % of theoretical density have been obtained for conventional sintered and SPS samples respectively. Maximum Vickers hardness value of around 100 has been achieved for Cu- 1 vol. % graphite MMC when it is fabricated by SPS. However, a hardness value of 65 has been obtained for the same composite when it is fabricated by conventional sintering at 900 °C for 1 hour. The micrographs of Cu-graphite reflect the clean interface and good compatibility between matrix and reinforcement. From wear study, it is concluded that the wear resistance of the composite increases with increase in graphite content due to the lubricating properties of graphite. It has also been found that wear depth decreases with increase in graphite content. SPS sintered samples show higher wear resistance than conventional sintered samples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{sensor data}} fusion using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to implement high performance vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) based vision tracking system for mobile robots. Information from various sensors {{is required to}} be integrated using an efficient sensor fusion algorithm to achieve a continuous and robust vision tracking system. We use data from low cost accelerometer, gyroscope, and encoders to calculate robot motion information. The Unscented Kalman Filter is used as an efficient sensor fusion algorithm. The UKF is an advanced filtering technique which outperforms widely used Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in many applications. The system is able {{to compensate for the}} <b>slip</b> errors by <b>switching</b> between two different UKF models built for slip and no-slip cases. Since the accelerometer error accumulates with time because of the double integration, the system uses accelerometer data only for the slip case UKF model. Using sensor fusion by UKF, the position and orientation of the robot is estimated and is used to rotate the camera mounted on top of the robot towards a fixed target. This concept is derived from the vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR) of the human eye. The experimental results show that the system is able to track the fixed target in various robot motion scenarios including the scenario when an intentional slip is generated during robot navigatio...|$|R

We outline a stochastic model of phase slip kinetics which relates the basic phase <b>slip</b> rates to <b>switching</b> rates. Comparison with this model indicates that the phase predominantly slips via thermal activation at high temperatures but at sufficiently low temperatures switching is caused by individual topological tunnelling events of the order-parameter field, i. e., QPS. Importantly, measurements on several wires show that quantum fluctuations tend to dominate over thermal fluctuations at larger temperatures in wires having larger critical currents. This fact provides strong supports the view that the anomalously high switching rates observed at low temperatures are indeed due to QPS, and not consequences of extraneous noise or hidden inhomogeneity of the wire.
