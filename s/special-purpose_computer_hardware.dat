40|$|In this paper, we {{overview}} the GRAPE (GRAvity piPE) {{project to}} develop and use <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computers</b> for astrophysical many-body simulations. First, we discuss the trends in semiconductor technology and computer architecture, and discuss merits and demerits of <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computers.</b> The main advantage of the special-purpose systems is the possibility to utilize a much higher fraction of available silicon to actually do calculations. Most of the silicon on generalpurpose microprocessors are now used for control logics and cache, in other words, to assure the generality. As an example, we describe our GRAPE project. In astrophysical many-body simulations, practically all computer time is spent to evaluate particle-particle interactions. This is because the gravitational interaction between astrophysical bodies is a long-range interaction and we cannot apply a cutoff. The basic idea behind the GRAPE project is let the <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computer</b> perform only {{the evaluation of the}} p [...] ...|$|R

Although general-purpose supercomputers are becoming more available, there are significant applications for which it is appropriate to construct special-purpose dedicated computing engines. The Supercomputer Toolkit is intended to make the construction and programming of such <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computers</b> routine and inexpensive, in some cases even automatic. The Toolkit is a family of hardware modules (processors, memory, interconnect, and input-output devices) and a collection of software modules (compilers, simulators, scientific libraries, and high-level front ends) from which high-performance <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computers</b> can be easily configured and programmed.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, <b>special-purpose</b> <b>{{computers}}</b> have surpassed generalpurpose {{computers in}} {{the speed with which}} large-scale stellar dynamics simulations can be performed. Speeds up to a Teraflops are now available, for simulations in a variety of fields, such as planetary formation, star cluster dynamics, galactic nuclei, galaxy interactions, galaxy formation, large scale structure, and gravitational lensing. Future speed increases for <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computers</b> will be even more dramatic: a Petaflops version, tentatively named the GRAPE- 6, could be built within a few years, whereas general-purpose computers are expected to reach this speed somewhere in the 2010 - 2015 time frame. Boards with a handful of chips from such a machine could be made available to individual astronomers. Such a board, attached to a fast workstation, will then deliver Teraflops speeds on a desktop, around the year 2000. 1...|$|R

40|$|We have {{achieved}} a sustained calculation speed of 281 Tflops for the optimization of the 3 -D structures of proteins from the X-ray experimental data by the Genetic Algorithm – Direct Space (GA-DS) method. In this calculation we used MDGRAPE- 3, <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computer</b> for molecular simulations, with the peak performance of 752 Tflops. In the GA-DS method, a set of selected parameters which define the crystal structures of proteins is optimized by the Genetic Algorithm. As a criterion to estimate the model parameters, we used the reliability factor R 1 which indicates the statistical difference between the calculated and the measured diffraction data. To evaluate this factor {{it is necessary to}} reconstruct the diffraction patterns of the model structures every time the model is updated. Therefore, in this method the nonequispaced Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) used to calculate the diffraction patterns dominates most of the computation time. To accelerate DFT calculations, we used the <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computer,</b> MDGRAPE- 3. A molecule, Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthetase was investigated. The final reliability factors were much smaller than the typical values obtained in other methods such as the Molecular Replacement (MR) method. Our results successfully demonstrate that high-performance computing with GA-DS method on <b>special-purpose</b> <b>computers</b> is effective for the structure determination of biological molecules and the method has a potential to be widely used in near future...|$|R
