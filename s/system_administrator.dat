40|$|<b>System</b> <b>administrators</b> {{are unique}} {{computer}} users. As power users in complex and high-risk work environments, intuition {{tells us that}} they may have requirements of the tools they use that differ from those of regular computer users. This paper presents and empirically validates a model of user satisfaction within the context of system administration that accounts for the needs of <b>system</b> <b>administrators.</b> The data were collected through a survey of 125 <b>system</b> <b>administrators</b> and analyzed using structural data modeling techniques. The empirical results of this preliminary investigation demonstrate that user satisfaction models are appropriate in the context of system administration and support the idea that <b>system</b> <b>administrators</b> have unique <b>system</b> and information needs from the tools they use...|$|R
25|$|It {{is the job}} of the <b>system</b> <b>administrator</b> {{force to}} deal with {{low-level}} conflict, and there must be both resources and a smooth transition plan from Leviathan to <b>System</b> <b>Administrator</b> responsibility, of which a classic successful example were the Operation Rankin plans that covered several ways in which Nazi power might end which is more a mission for police, which certainly can include a militarized force like the Constabulary in the post-WWII occupation of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Swarming is not {{a panacea}} for {{conflict}} at all levels. If {{there is a significant}} military force preventing the <b>system</b> <b>administrator</b> from working on developing connections, {{the other part of the}} paradigm comes into play: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established core group such as NATO, ASEAN, or the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{virtualization}} {{refers to}} the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM mainframe operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for x86-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a <b>system</b> <b>administrator</b> could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. Intel Corporation and AMD have also built proprietary virtualization enhancements to the x86 instruction set into each of their CPU product lines, {{in order to facilitate}} virtual computing.|$|E

The traffic monitoring enables notifications to <b>system</b> <b>administrators</b> and other business stakeholders which increases business awareness and enables trend discovery.|$|R

25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the <b>system</b> <b>administrator</b> to the attacker's activities. Another {{problem is that the}} NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
500|$|The main {{protagonist of}} [...]hack is Kite, a new player of The World whose friend Orca becomes {{comatose}} under mysterious circumstances. Kite {{is joined by}} nearly twenty other players in his quest {{to solve the mystery}} of the coma victims. The players who have the greatest impact on the success of Kite's mission are BlackRose, a fellow newbie to The World whose brother is also in a coma; Balmung, a legendary player who seeks to eliminate sources of corruption in the game he loves; and Wiseman, an information broker who becomes a key strategist for Kite's team. Helba, a professional hacker, and Lios, a reluctant <b>system</b> <b>administrator,</b> also aid in Kite's efforts to rescue the coma victims.|$|E
500|$|In [...]hack//Mutation, Kite and BlackRose {{encounter}} <b>system</b> <b>administrator</b> Lios, who declares Kite's bracelet to be {{an illegal}} hack. He tries to delete Kite's character data, but fails due to Kite's data being encrypted by the Book of Twilight. Helba intervenes, and convinces Lios to observe Kite for the time being. Lios directs them to an area where they find Innis, a monster with powers similar to Skeith's. Upon defeating Innis, Kite receives an e-mail from Aura, who reveals that she is an AI. They travel to an area to meet her; but Cubia attacks them, and they repel the monster with difficulty. Short on leads, they contact Wiseman, who is intrigued by Kite's bracelet. He suggests that Skeith and Innis {{are based on the}} [...] "Cursed Wave", an antagonistic force featured in the poem Epitaph of Twilight, upon which The World is based. Wiseman helps grant them access to Net Slum, a place known as a paradise for hackers and wandering AIs. Upon arrival, another Cursed Wave monster called Magus attacks them. They defeat it and return to the Root Town, where they discover that the computer virus has spread to The World main servers and into the real world.|$|E

2500|$|The term rootkit or root kit {{originally}} {{referred to}} a maliciously modified set of administrative tools for a Unix-like operating system that granted [...] "root" [...] access. If an intruder could replace the standard administrative tools on a system with a rootkit, the intruder could obtain root access over the system whilst simultaneously concealing these activities from the legitimate <b>system</b> <b>administrator.</b> These first-generation rootkits were trivial to detect by using tools such as Tripwire {{that had not been}} compromised to access the same information. Lane Davis and Steven Dake wrote the earliest known rootkit in 1990 for Sun Microsystems' SunOS UNIX operating system. In the lecture he gave upon receiving the Turing award in 1983, Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, one of the creators of Unix, theorized about subverting the C compiler in a Unix distribution and discussed the exploit. The modified compiler would detect attempts to compile the Unix login command and generate altered code that would accept not only the user's correct password, but an additional [...] "backdoor" [...] password known to the attacker. Additionally, the compiler would detect attempts to compile {{a new version of the}} compiler, and would insert the same exploits into the new compiler. A review of the source code for the login command or the updated compiler would not reveal any malicious code. This exploit was equivalent to a rootkit.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead {{technologist}} for the NSA's information-sharing office. At {{the time}} of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea, the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. While intelligence officials have described his position there as a <b>system</b> <b>administrator,</b> Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world. On March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his [...] "breaking point" [...] of [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress"—Snowden quit his job at Dell. Although he has stated that his career high annual salary was $200,000, Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen, where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity. According to a Reuters story by Mark Hosenball, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have misled 20–25 co-workers into giving him their logins and passwords under false pretenses. NBC News subsequently reported that the NSA sent a memo to Congress suggesting that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal public key infrastructure certificate to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system. This report was disputed, with Snowden himself saying in January 2014, [...] "With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers." [...] Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.|$|E
