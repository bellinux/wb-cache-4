5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> with Crookes and another observer {{on either side}} of him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
25|$|Hairdressing takes {{almost two}} hours, she said, and while {{my hair is}} busy, my mind stays idle. I am afraid that my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser. Hence my {{headache}} afterwards. The Empress <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> which {{was moved to the}} middle of the room and covered with a white cloth. She was shrouded in a white, laced peignoir, her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} seasons of Agent had a {{distinctive}} way of presenting {{the elimination of}} contestants. At {{the end of each}} episode, the host and the participants <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> to have a dinner together. Each of contestants was given an envelope which contained a feather. One by one, participants opened the envelopes, revealing the color of the feather. If it was green, contestant moved on to the next episode. Red feather meant elimination of the player. In the final episode of each season, one of the envelopes contained a black feather, which revealed the identity of the mole.|$|E

25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract {{in the weeks before}} the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} praised as {{genuinely}} funny, {{with a range}} of different kinds of humour. Praise was also directed at Morales, with both Louisa Mellor (Den of Geek) and Owen commenting on his ability to give the impression of movement, even while the episode revolved mostly around four men <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> Critics commended the performances; Dessau called the cast [...] "uniformly excellent", and Owen said that the script was [...] "brilliantly performed". Ellen E Jones, writing for the London Evening Standard, praised both Glenister and Watkins; Hogan did likewise, but argued that Watkins [...] "stealthily stole the show". Owen suggested that, in the episode, [...] "Watkins again proved why he's one of the most underrated comic actors around right now". Mellor identified Watkins and White as offering the strongest performance. Hogan praised White for offering [...] "estimable support", while Billen identified White as the performer who [...] "stole the half-hour".|$|E
500|$|On 7 November 2013, {{a person}} who was at the murder scene {{uploaded}} a 1:04 minute video on YouTube showing the scene before Francisco Rafael was killed. The video starts with the former vocalist of Banda El Recodo singing [...] "El Señor de las Canas", a song by Vicente Fernández, alongside a mariachi group. As the film progresses, the camera turns to the sides and shows former footballer Jared Borgetti sitting at a table with Rocío del Carmen Lizárraga, wife of Francisco Rafael. Towards the last seconds of the video, a bald-looking man passes through the back of the tables {{in front of the camera}} and apparently gives a hand signal to the assassin before walking away. Then, a man dressed as a clown (the presumed assassin) passes through the crowd and heads towards Francisco Rafael. Seconds later, one shot was heard; most of the invitees were not aware of what had happened, and the music continued. Shortly afterwards, four more shots were heard from the rear. Following the second round of shots, the music stopped and the invitees started screaming. The video only captured a few seconds after the last four shots before concluding. The Baja California Sur authorities believe that the bald-looking man that appeared on the video shortly before the clown and apparently gave him a hand signal is involved in the murder plot. Eyewitnesses who <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with the suspect stated that they did not know who he was but that they saw him greet Francisco Rafael during the party. The suspect reportedly made three phone calls during the party and sent several text messages. Investigators believe that the man was possibly communicating with the assassin; the authorities are investigating the text messages and phone calls made that day in the area through the Telcel database. With the surface of the video, the authorities were able to also gather more information about the assassin and the murder. They were able to identify other invitees, including former Cruz Azul footballer Héctor López. The video allowed the authorities to identify the physical characteristics of the assassin, including his skin color, approximate height, and the color of his clothing. The authorities are investigating whether any purchases made in custom or fabric stores in the area might lead them to the murderers.|$|E
