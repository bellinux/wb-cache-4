500|$|One of {{the judges}} for the gross out contest in the episode's is Madeleine Albright, who was the current US Secretary of State at the time. During the riot that follows the contest, a {{travelling}} exhibition of Van Gogh's paintings is burned to flames. In the episode's subplot, Homer hires a photographer to take erotic pictures of him. The design of the photographer was based on American portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz. The song that plays during the photographing scenes is [...] "I'm Too Sexy" [...] by English pop trio Right <b>Said</b> <b>Fred.</b> During {{the rules and regulations}} announcement, Comic Book Guy declares that sexual intercourse will only be permitted once every seven years in Springfield. This is a reference to pon farr, a term used in the Star Trek franchise to describe the psychophysical effect of the estrous cycle that affects the fictional race Vulcans every seven years. His taunting of [...] "I am smart, much smarter than you, Hib-bert!" [...] is also to the tune of the Star Trek fanfare.

5000|$|... "Hermanos" [...] was {{the first}} episode to delve into Gus Fring's backstory, {{although}} much remains unexplained about the character's past in Chile, which Gus seems anxious to keep concealed. Series creator Vince Gilligan has <b>said</b> <b>Fring</b> was likely involved {{in the government of}} former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, but the writing staff had deliberately not determined the entire back story. Gilligan said he believed this would make Gus a more interesting and mysterious character, while simultaneously allowing the writers greater flexibility in writing for him in future episodes.|$|R

40|$|The Literary Novelty of the New Testament’, was {{the topic}} for this year’s Slattery Lecture, {{delivered}} by Father Justin Taylor SM, at The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus. A teacher, researcher and {{professor in the}} fields of New Testament and Christian origins, Fr Taylor, presented a convincing argument that the New Testament was the first literary work in the ancient world that made ordinary people its central characters. “The literary treatment of ordinary people in the Gospels was without precedent in Greek or Roman literature and constituted a literary revolution,” <b>said</b> <b>Fr</b> Taylor. “The Gospels treat the everyday world and ordinary people {{in a way that is}} realistic and serious, even tragic. ” <b>Fr</b> Taylor <b>said</b> the importance of reading about everyday people in the New Testament reflected on Christian belief and impacted on later European culture. “This new aesthetic, different from the classical tradition, reflects a new social reality and ultimately belief in the incarnation of God in a person of low degree,” he said. Notre Dame Dean of Philosophy and Theology, Professor Matthew Ogilvie, <b>said</b> <b>Fr</b> Taylor’s lecture highlighted some interesting points about the influence of the New Testament. “Father Taylor made it clear that the New Testament was so novel in its treatment of ordinary people, it would seem that the development of modern democracy and the notion that ‘all people are created equal’ would have been impossible without it,” he said. Philosophy and Theology graduate, Karl Brown, agreed with Professor Ogilvie, saying Fr Taylor presented an insightful and convincing lecture on the influence of the New Testament on the modern world. “Father Taylor presented his argument with a clear genius that made his points seem almost obvious after he had explained them,” he <b>said.</b> <b>Fr</b> Taylor was ordained a Catholic priest in 1966, obtaining his PhD from the University of Cambridge in England in 1972. He is also Co-Director of a research seminar in New Testament at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2006, he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Cambridge.
