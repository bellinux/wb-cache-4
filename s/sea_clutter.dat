40|$|Cruise {{missiles}} {{over land}} and <b>sea</b> <b>cluttered</b> background are serious threats to search and track systems. In general, these threats are stealth {{in both the}} infrared and radio frequency bands. That is, their thermal infrared signature and their radar cross section can be quite small. This paper discusses adaptive sequential detection methods which exploit `track-before-detect' technology for detecting low-SNR targets in Infrared Search and Track (IRST) systems. Despite {{the fact that we}} focus on an IRST against cruise missiles over land and <b>sea</b> <b>cluttered</b> backgrounds, the results are applicable to other sensors and other kinds of targets. The developed algorithms allow us to detect a priori unknown number of targets that appear and disappear at unknown points in time. In contrast to the traditional Wald's method the problem of detection of a target with unknown moment of appearance is formulated and solved as a quickest detection problem (change-point detection problem).

40|$|Ship {{detection}} {{is always}} a vital section of the marine application of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), especially after the launch of ENVISAT in 2002. ASAR’s Alternating Polarization (AP) mode can simultaneously provide two well geo-registered images in different polarization pairs, namely VV/HH, HH/HV, and VV/VH. This dual polarization function can probably help to enhance the ship detection efficiency by SAR images. In this paper, we aimed {{to find a solution}} to the fusion schemes of AP data. Because of the property and formats differences between AP Single-Look Complex (APS) and Precision (APP), processors of APS and APP for ship detection were investigated individually.

40|$|Abstract—A new four-parameter {{modified}} {{refractivity profile}} (M-profile) {{model for the}} evaporation duct is introduced in this paper. In the estimation of radio refractivity structure from <b>sea</b> <b>clutters,</b> a parametric M-profile model is normally employed. The conventional M-profile model for evaporation ducts is the one-parameter log linear model, which has some potential disadvantages in describing the observed M-profiles which would result in rough results of evaporation duct estimation. Based on this model, three new parameters are introduced and a four-parameter M-profile model is proposed here. This model {{has the ability to}} (a) more accurately match real-world M-profiles, (b) well replicate the observed clutter field, and (c) show clutter power or path loss sensitivity to each model parameter. All these abilities are necessary for robust refractivity estimations. The performance of this model is tested and validated through the estimation for two truly measured M-profiles. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric phase {{perturbation}} {{with large}} amplitude causes broadening <b>sea</b> <b>clutter’s</b> Bragg peaks to overlap each other; {{the performance of}} traditional decontamination methods about filtering Bragg peak is poor, which greatly limits the detection performance of HF skywave radars. In view of the ionospheric phase perturbation with large amplitude, this paper proposes a cascaded approach based on improved S-method to correct the ionospheric phase contamination. This approach consists of two correction steps. At the first step, a time-frequency distribution method based on improved S-method is adopted and an optimal detection method is designed to obtain a coarse ionospheric modulation estimation from the time-frequency distribution. At the second correction step, based on the phase gradient algorithm (PGA) is exploited to eliminate the residual contamination. Finally, use the measured data to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} method. Simulation results show the time-frequency resolution of this method is high and is not affected by the interference of the cross term; ionospheric phase perturbation with large amplitude can be corrected in low signal-to-noise (SNR); such a cascade correction method has a good effect...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in applications of space remote sensing systems for maritime surveillance which includes among others traffic surveillance, maritime security, illegal fisheries survey, oil discharge and sea pollution monitoring. Within the framework of several French and European projects, an algorithm for automatic ship detection from SPOT- 5 HRG data was developed to complement existing fishery control measures, in particular the Vessel Monitoring System. The algorithm focused on feature-based analysis of satellite imagery. Genetic algorithms and Neural Networks were used to deal with the feature-borne information. Based on the described approach, a first prototype was designed to classify small targets such as shrimp boats and tested on panchromatic SPOT- 5, 5 -m resolution product taking into account the environmental and fishing context. The ability to detect shrimp boats with satisfactory detection rates is an indicator of the robustness of the algorithm.

This image can be used to identify the quantity and sort of ice that has to be dealt with. In standard radar, <b>sea</b> <b>clutter</b> affects the ability to see in the near vicinity of the vessel.

50|$|When {{a target}} {{is to be}} engaged, the ship's {{computer}} slews {{one of the two}} Sea Wolf trackers onto the target (there was a single tracker on a Sea Wolf Leander).

Low-level targets had to be engaged using the 910's secondary TV mode to manually track the target. Subsequently, the lighter Type 911 supplanted the Type 910, adding a second radar (a K-band set based on the Blindfire tracker of the Rapier missile, to control engagements at low level) and was fitted in the 7th Type 22 Frigate onwards. Unlike Type 910, Type 911 does not have any TV function; the TV camera is retained only to allow the Missile Director to visually confirm targets, and to provide a record of engagements.|$|E

An empirical method of wave spectrum scaling is normally employed. Marine navigation radar based wave sensors are excellent tools for wave direction measurements. A marine navigation radar may also be a tool for surface current measurements. Point measurements of the current vector as well as current maps up to a distance of a few km can be provided (Gangeskar, 2002).

Currently the systems developed by the research community are capable of remotely navigating a mine intervention underwater vehicle in the vicinity of the mine by using remote sonar aided navigation from a master vehicle.
