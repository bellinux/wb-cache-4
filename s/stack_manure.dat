Ammonia emission rates (ER) of two commercial manure-belt (MB) layer houses with in Iowa were monitored for a full year. Ammonia ER showed considerable diurnal variation, {{but not as much}} in seasonal variation. Data from the 12 -month monitoring revealed an annual average NH 3 ER of 0. 054 g d- 1 hen- 1 (varying from 0. 002 to 0. 195 g d- 1 hen- 1) from the MB houses when the manure was removed daily. Results of the study contribute to the U. S. national inventory on NH 3 emissions from animal feeding operations;While manure removal via manure belt system is effective in improving indoor air quality and reducing house-level emissions, manure transferred into storage facility also emits NH 3 and needs to be quantified. The effects of moisture content of the manure, ambient temperature, surface to volume ratio (SVR) of <b>manure</b> <b>stack,</b> air exchange rate, and duration of the manure storage on NH 3 emission were quantified. Rising ambient temperature enhances NH 3 emission of the <b>manure</b> <b>stack</b> at the rate of 6 % per degree Celsius rise for the temperature range of 21 to 32 °C. The NH 3 emission rate (ER) from <b>manure</b> <b>stack</b> at 50 % moisture content (MC) is 59 % of the NH 3 ER from <b>manure</b> <b>stack</b> at 77 % MC. A regression model was developed to describe the NH 3 emissions from <b>manure</b> <b>stack</b> with five SVRs and storage time. Reducing emissions from manure storage is of practical significance to the improved environmental stewardship. Four topically applied chemical additives (zeolite, alum, Ferix- 3 and PLT) were tested to evaluate the efficiency on NH 3 emission reduction from stored laying hen manure. The results provide the base line NH 3 emission data from poultry manure storage and potential solutions to mitigate NH 3 emission;In addition, indirect CO 2 balance method and direct ventilation rate measurement method using a Fan Assessment Numeration System were compared in a commercial manure-belt laying hen house. The results showed that careful application of the indirect method could greatly improve the affordability and versatility of endeavors toward quantifying air emissions from confined animal housing...|$|R
40|$|An {{incubation}} {{experiment on}} straw decomposition {{was carried out}} with soils from a long-term field trial at Therwil, Switzerland. Two conventional agricultural systems, one with (CONFYM) and one without manure, an organic system managed according to bio-dynamic farming practice (BIODYN) and an unfertilized control were compared. CONFYM received <b>stacked</b> <b>manure</b> and an additional mineral fertilizer. BIODYN received composted farmyard manure and no mineral fertilizers. Both systems received {{the same amount of}} manure based on 1. 4 livestock units haˇ 1. The aim of the investigation was to explain the large differences in soil microbial biomass and activity between the systems, especially between the manured soils. Di€erences in microbial C-utilization effciency were suggested to be the main reason. We followed the decomposition of 14 C-labeled plant material over a period of 177 days under controled incubation conditions. Prior to incubation, microbial biomass was 75 % higher and qCO 2 up to 43 % lower in the BIODYN soil than in the conventional soils. At the end of the incubation period, 58 % of the applied plant material was mineralized to CO 2 in the BIODYN soil compared to 50 % in the other soils. This difference became signifcant 2 weeks after application of plant material and is suggested to be due to decomposition of more recalcitrant compounds. After addition of plant material, the increase of microbial biomass in the unmanured systems was higher than in the manured systems, but with a higher loss rate thereafter. The amount of 14 C incorporated into Cmic as related to 14 CO 2 evolved was markedly higher in the BIODYN soil. The results support the hypothesis that agricultural measures applied to the BIODYN system invoke a higher efciency of the soil microbial community with respect to substrate use for growth...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} {{for the first time}} that home field advantage (HFA) of litter decomposition also exists in agricultural production systems, in addition to earlier reports from natural ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence that adaptation of the soil decomposer community to differences in the chemical composition of solid cattle manure (SCM) explains the HFA. Two dairy farms were selected which differed in type of home-produced SCM (high-quality stacked or low-quality composted SCM) and soil type (sand or peat). Manure was exchanged between these two farms. Also, manure was incubated in fields of two neighbouring non-SCM farms. Using litterbags with three different mesh-sizes (125 μm, 1. 5 mm, and 4 mm), we investigated the contribution of microbiota, mesofauna and macrofauna, to SCM dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) disappearance after 60, 120 and 240 days of litterbag placement. Home field advantage was estimated after accounting for effects related to structural differences in manure quality (quality index) and grassland soil biota communities (ability index). We found HFA in meso- (14 – 34 %) and macro-mesh (19 – 31 %) size litterbags. In micro-mesh litterbags, the HFA for dry matter and nitrogen disappearance was significant only after 120 days (18 and 26 %, respectively). With time, trends of initial increase and then decrease in HFA of both aforementioned parameters were observed, but these were not significant. The quality index indicated that the composted manure had a lower dry matter and nitrogen disappearance rate compared to the <b>stacked</b> <b>manure,</b> irrespective of the location of incubation. The difference between the two manure types for N disappearance had vanished at day 240. Also, the chemical composition of the manure that remained in the litterbags changed over time. After 120 days, the C:N ratio of SCM at home was significantly higher compared to the translocated SCM (...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{problems}} that have currently beset the commercial egg layer industry have arisen because of methods of handling the manure output from large flocks. Alternative techniques for handling of animal manure within animal production facilities will need to be developed to satisfy current and future zoning and environmental criteria placed on these types of operations. This paper discusses tests conducted in a commercial, naturally ventilated, high-rise layer house that involved an in- house deep litter manure management system. Layers at commercial densities deposited their <b>manure</b> onto <b>stacked</b> litter materials located directly beneath the cages. Regular turning of the litter facilitated composting within the layer house, resulting in a reduction of manure volume and weight. In the full-scale house, the deep litter system produced a 39 % reduction in manure weight and a 37 % reduction in manure volume over that of deep <b>stacked</b> raw <b>manure.</b> The compost at the end of these tests had a dry basis nutrient density of approximately 2 % N, 8. 5 % P 2 O 5, and 5. 5 % K 2 O. The compost had a decreased moisture content, improved handling properties, and less odor than raw manure...|$|R

We determined indicators for soil quality changes in the DOK long-term comparison trial that was initiated in 1978. This replicated field trial comprises organic and integrated (conventional) farming systems that are typical for Swiss agriculture. Livestock based bio-organic (BIOORG), bio-dynamic (BIODYN) and integrated farming systems (CONFYM) were compared at reduced and normal fertilization intensity (0. 7 and 1. 4 livestock units, LU) in a 7 year crop rotation. A stockless integrated system is fertilized with mineral fertilizers exclusively (CONMIN) and one control treatment remained unfertilized (NOFERT). The CONFYM system is amended with <b>stacked</b> <b>manure,</b> supplemental mineral fertilizers, as well as chemical pesticides. Manure of the BIOORG system is slightly rotted and in BIODYN it is composted aerobically with some herbal additives. In the third crop rotation period at normal fertiliser intensity soil organic carbon (Corg, w/w) in the plough layer (0 – 20 cm) of the BIODYN system remained constant and decreased by 7 % in CONFYM and 9 % in BIOORG {{as compared to the}} starting values. With no manure application Corg-loss was severest in NOFERT (22 %), followed by CONMIN together with the systems at reduced fertiliser intensity (14 – 16 %). Soil pH tended to increase in the organic systems, whereas the integrated systems had the lowest pH values. At {{the end of the third}} crop rotation period in 1998 biological soil quality indicators were determined. Compared to soil microbial biomass in the BIODYN systems the CONFYM soils showed 25 % lower values and the systems without manure application were lower by 34 %. Relative to the BIODYN soils at the same fertilization intensity dehydrogenase activity was 39 – 42 % lower in CONFYM soils and even 62 % lower in soils of CONMIN. Soil basal respiration did not differ between farming systems at the same intensity, but when related to microbial biomass (qCO 2) it was 20 % higher in CONFYM soils and 52 % higher in CONMIN as compared to BIODYN, suggesting a higher maintenance requirement of microbial biomass in soils of the integrated systems. The manure based farming systems of the DOK trial are likely to favour an active and fertile soil. Both, Corg and biological soil quality indicators were clearly depending on the quantity and quality of the applied manure types, but soil microbial biomass and activities were much more affected than Corg...|$|R

40|$|Manure-belt (MB) and {{high-rise}} (HR) laying-hen {{houses are}} the two predominant housing types in the U. S. Compared with HR houses, MB houses have better indoor air quality and lower aerial emissions {{as a result of}} frequent (every 1 to 4 d) manure removal from the hen houses into separate manure storage. However, emissions from on-farm manure storage are integral parts of the whole-farm emissions and need to be quantified. This series of lab-scale studies assesses emission rates (ER) of ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases (CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 O) from stored laying-hen manure as affected by the following physical and environmental factors: air exchange rate (10 or 20 air changes per hour, or ACH), <b>manure</b> <b>stacking</b> configuration expressed as surface area to stack volume ratio (SVR at 2. 5, 5, 10, or 20 m- 1), air temperature (constant at 25 °C or diurnal cyclic from 21 °C to 32 °C), manure moisture content (MC, 50 % or 77 %), and periodic addition of new manure to the existing stack. Results of the studies showed the following: (1) air exchange rate of 10 or 20 ACH had no apparent effects on the gaseous emissions; (2) SVR significantly affected emissions, with larger SVR leading to higher NH 3 and CO 2 ERs but lower CH 4 ER on per kg manure basis; (3) emissions were positively related to air temperature; and (4) laying-hen manure with 77 % MC had higher emissions than that with 50 % MC. At the storage condition of 25 °C air temperature, 20 ACH, every 2 d addition of 120 kg (5 cm thick layer) manure at 75 % MC (equivalent to 2 d manure production of 682 laying hens) to the flat base area of 2. 8 m 2, the daily gaseous ERs per hen were 0. 06 to 0. 22 g NH 3, 1. 6 to 4. 8 g CO 2, and 7. 4 to 32 mg CH 4 (0. 18 to 0. 8 g CO 2 e). N 2 O concentrations from the stored manure were below the detection limit (0. 03 ppm) of the measurement instrument; hence, N 2 O emission was omitted from the presentation...|$|R

Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} different housing styles can have significant impacts on the magnitude of NH 3 emissions from laying-hen facilities in that the high rise (HR) systems (typical of US egg production) emit 61 to 71 % more ammonia than the manure-belt (MB) systems (gaining more popularity in the US). The impact of manure accumulation time on the belts in MB systems on NH 3 emissions needs to be quantified. Hence, a research study was conducted in a laboratory setting that resembled a commercial MB system for laying hens. The results of the study are presented in this thesis. Chapter 2 describes the effect of different SD regimens (155 to 619 cm 2 bird- 1 or 24 to 96 in 2 bird- 1) and manure accumulation time (MAT, 1 to 6 d) of pullets (hens < 18 weeks of age) and laying hens on NH 3 emissions. Results showed that daily NH 3 emission rate (ER) for pullets and laying hens increased exponentially with bird age and MAT, while SD effect on NH 3 ER was more pronounced for MAT ≥ 3 d (P< 0. 0001). In general, higher SD led to higher ER. Specifically, for the laying hens, NH 3 emissions from the 3 rd to 6 th d MAT ranged from 41 to 251 mg/hen-d for the high density (HD) and from 29 to 160 mg/hen-d for the low density (LD). This outcome supports the current egg industry practice of removing manure at 1 - to 3 -d MAT for the MB house systems. Chapter 3 assesses the dynamics of feeding, defecation and NH 3 emissions of pullets and laying hens under different SDs (as used in the trials described in Chapter 2), MAT (1 to 6 d) during light and dark periods of the day. Results indicate that SD did not adversely affect feed disappearance or fresh manure production (P = 0. 17 – 0. 81) at any of the tested ages. For each gram of feed use, the fresh manure produced varied from 0. 58 to 1. 15 g bird- 1 (P < 0. 0001) varying according to bird age. The light and dark partitioning of feed disappearance was 92 % to 8 %, respectively, while the partitioning for fresh manure production was 80 % to 20 %. Results also revealed that 37 % of the total daily NH 3 emission occurred during the dark period vs. 63 % during the light hours...|$|R
