25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Australian {{archaeologist}} Karl Kromer excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau. This mound contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which he identified with an artisans' settlement. Mudbrick buildings {{just south of}} Khufu's Valley Temple contained mud <b>sealings</b> of Khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the city is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE, found in June 1970, while digging to make a kiln for a brick factory in the south western corner of the city. The tablets written in ancient Elamite name a city called Tiraziš. Phonetically, this is interpreted as /tiračis/ or /ćiračis/. This name became Old Persian /širājiš/; through regular sound change comes the modern Persian name Shirāz. The name Shiraz also appears on clay <b>sealings</b> found at a 2nd-century CE Sassanid ruin, east of the city. By some of the native writers, the name Shiraz has derived from a son of Tahmuras, the third Shāh (King) of {{the world according to}} Ferdowsi's Shāhnāma.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{cylinder}} seals, stamp seals and cylinder seal impressions on the clay tablets {{have been found}} at Jemdet Nasr. Stylistically, these seals are {{a continuation of the}} preceding Uruk period. The cylinder seals display humans as well as animals in a very crude style. Over 80 of the clay tablets bore a sealing, showing humans, animals, buildings, containers and more abstract designs. Interestingly, none of the <b>sealings</b> on the tablets was made by the seals that were found at the site, indicating that sealing either occurred outside Jemdet Nasr or that seals could also be made of perishable materials. One sealing, found on thirteen tablets, lists the names of a number of cities surrounding Jemdet Nasr, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur and Uruk.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the temple}} and priesthood {{restrictions}} before 1978, black members of African descent could {{not receive the}} priesthood or participate in temple ordinances besides baptisms for the dead. For {{a time in the}} 1960s and 1970s, they were not allowed to perform baptisms for the dead either. For young men and men in the LDS church, holding the priesthood is required to hold leadership roles, perform baptisms, to bless the sacrament, to bless babies and to bless the sick. Since black men could not hold the priesthood, they were excluded from holding leadership roles and performing these rituals. Temple ordinances are necessary for members to receive the endowment and marriage <b>sealings</b> necessary for exaltation, and black members could not enjoy these privileges. Church leaders taught that these restrictions were commanded by God. In 1978, the First Presidency and the Twelve, led by Spencer W. Kimball, declared they had received a revelation instructing them to reverse the racial restriction policy. After this revelation, black men could receive the priesthood and black people could receive temple ordinances.|$|E
25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy <b>sealings,</b> like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the racial}} {{restrictions}} that lasted from Brigham Young's presidency until 1978, persons with any black African ancestry could not receive church priesthood or any temple ordinances including the endowment and eternal marriage or {{participate in any}} proxy ordinances for the dead. An important exception to this temple ban was that (except for a complete temple ban period from the mid-1960s until the early 70s under McKay) black members had been allowed a limited use recommend to act as proxies in baptisms for the dead. The priesthood restriction was particularly limiting, because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood and most male members {{over the age of}} 12 have received the priesthood. Holders of the priesthood officiate at church meetings, perform blessings of healing, and manage church affairs. Excluding black people from the priesthood meant that men could not hold any significant church leadership roles or participate in many important events such as performing a baptism, blessing the sick, or giving a baby blessing. Between 1844 and 1977, most black people were not permitted to participate in ordinances performed in the LDS Church temples, such as the endowment ritual, celestial marriages, and family <b>sealings.</b> These ordinances are considered essential to enter the highest degree of heaven, so this meant that they could not enjoy the full privileges enjoyed by other Latter-day Saints during the restriction.|$|E

Some of these polyandrous marriages were done {{with the consent of}} the first husbands, and some plural marriages may have been considered [...] "eternity-only" [...] sealings; [...] (Hales discusses the historical records and context of 5-11 such <b>sealings,</b> which indicate they were eternity-only unions.); [...] (Quinn acknowledged in 2012 that a recently discovered historical record regarding Ruth Sayers indicates that the union applied [...] "only to the eternities after mortal life," [...] disproving his previously-held [...] "decades-long" [...] assumption that excluded eternity-only <b>sealings.).</b> Ten of Smith's plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty; others were over fifty.

Nonetheless, Menkauhor's name is well attested in the names and titles of priests and officials of the Fifth Dynasty {{as well as in the}} names of the agricultural estates associated with his funerary cult. Surviving artefacts contemporaneous with Menkauhor's reign include two stone vessels inscribed with his name from the mortuary temple of Neferefre– possibly gifts from Menkauhor for the funerary cult of Neferefre– as well as a few <b>sealings</b> from the same temple and from an area known as [...] "Djedkare's Family Cemetery" [...] in Abusir. Cylinder seal impressions showing Menkauhor's Horus name or the name of his pyramid have also been unearthed in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, and in the necropolises of Giza and Gebelein.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{substantial}} doctrinal {{dispute between the}} LDS Church and its offshoots as to whether celestial marriage is plural or monogamous. <b>Sealings</b> for [...] "time and eternity" [...] (i.e., celestial marriages) were being performed for monogamous couples long before 1890. Throughout all time periods of the LDS Church's history, {{the great majority of}} temple <b>sealings</b> were between one man and one wife.|$|E

2500|$|Apart from <b>sealings</b> to parents, {{the church}} does not perform saving {{ordinances}} for those younger than age eight or {{for those who have}} died before the age of eight (when children reach the [...] "age of accountability"), because young children are deemed [...] "alive in Christ" [...] and not responsible for sin.

These individuals are saved by the grace and mercy of Christ without baptism and will inherit the celestial kingdom of God.|$|E
2500|$|The LDS Church {{has been}} {{characterized}} by its members as a family-centered religion. The church teaches that every being that lived upon the earth initially had a spirit body and that all were born to Heavenly Parents in a pre-mortal existence. The church teaches that on earth, families may be [...] "sealed"—meaning that they are eternally bound as husband–wife, parents–child—and that these bonds will continue after death. <b>Sealings</b> can also include deceased ancestors, providing much of the church's rationale for its extensive family history activities. Members tend more often to be married, and have families with more children, than members of other Christian traditions.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{was only}} half {{complete}} at the Death of Joseph Smith in 1844. [...] After a succession crisis, Brigham Young was sustained as the church's leader {{by the majority of}} Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo. [...] As mob violence increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint ordinance, such as baptisms for the dead in the basement font. During the winter of 1845-46, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era endowment, <b>sealings</b> in marriage, and adoptions. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months.|$|E
2500|$|Exaltation is [...] "the {{kind of life}} God lives". In other words, exalted beings {{will live}} in great glory, be perfect, and possess all {{knowledge}} and wisdom. Exalted beings will live forever with God the Father and Jesus Christ, will become gods and goddesses, will live with their righteous earthly family members, and will receive the fulness of joy enjoyed by God and Christ. One of the key qualifications for exaltation is being united in a celestial marriage to an opposite-sex partner. Such a union can be created during mortality, {{or it can be}} created after death by proxy marriages; all such <b>sealings,</b> for the living or for the dead, are performed in temples.|$|E
2500|$|Saving {{ordinances}} {{are those}} that are required for salvation or exaltation, and include baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost (confirmation of membership in the church of Jesus Christ); the [...] "sacrament" [...] of the Lord's supper, taken each Sunday, to keep in remembrance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to renew the covenants made at baptism; ordination to an office of the priesthood (for males); the initiatory or washings and anointings; the endowment; celestial marriage; and family <b>sealings.</b> Each saving ordinance is associated with one or more covenants that the person receiving the ordinance makes with God, and one or more blessing that God promises to the recipient.|$|E
2500|$|Djoser {{is linked}} to Khasekhemwy, the last king of the Second dynasty of Egypt, through his wife Queen Nimaethap (Nimaat-hap) via seals found in Khasekhemwy's tomb and at Beit Khallaf. The seal at Abydos names Nimaat-hap as the [...] "mother of the king's children, Nimaat-hap". On mastaba K1 at Beit Khallaf the same person is {{mentioned}} as the [...] "mother of the dual king". Dating of other seals at the Beit Khallaf site place them to the reign of Djoser. This evidence suggests that Khasekhemwy is either the direct father of Djoser or that Nimaat-hap had him through a previous husband. German Egyptologist Gunter Dreyer found Djoser's <b>sealings</b> at Khasekhemwy's tomb further suggesting that Djoser was the direct successor of Khasekhemwy and that he finished {{the construction of the}} tomb.|$|E
2500|$|The Jemdet Nasr period {{settlement}} (3100–2900 BC) {{extended over}} {{an area of}} [...] of Mound B. Some [...] was occupied by the single, large mudbrick building that was excavated by Langdon, and where the clay tablets were found. In and around this building, kilns for firing pottery and baking bread were found, and other crafts like weaving. Many of these crafts, and also agricultural production, feature prominently in the proto-cuneiform tablets – indicating {{that much of the}} economy was centrally controlled and administered. In the texts from Jemdet Nasr, the term [...] "SANGA AB" [...] appears, which may denote a high official. The building was probably destroyed by fire. There is no evidence for far-reaching trade-contacts; no precious stones or other exotic materials were found. However, the homogeneity of the pottery that is typical for the Jemdet Nasr period suggests that there must have been intensive regional contacts. This idea is strengthened by the finding of <b>sealings</b> on the tablets of Jemdet Nasr that list a number of cities in southern Mesopotamia, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur, Uruk and Tell Uqair.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1450 BCE, the {{beginning}} of LM II, the Mycenaean Greeks must have moved into the palace of Knossos. They were well-established by 1400, if the Linear B tablets can be dated to then. The resulting LM II culture is not a break with the Minoan past. Minoan traditions continue under a new administration. However, the vase forms and designs {{became more and more}} Mycenaean in character with a large variety of decoration. Style names have multiplied and depend to some degree on the author. The names below are {{only a few of the}} most common. Some authors just use the name [...] "Mycenaean Koine"; that is, the Late Minoan pottery of Crete was to some degree just a variety of widespread Mycenaean forms. The designs are found also on seals and <b>sealings,</b> in frescoes and on other artifacts. Often Late Minoan pottery is not easily placed in subperiods. In addition are imports from the neighboring coasts of the Mediterranean. Ceramic is not the only material used: breccia, calcite, chlorite, schist, dolomite and other colored and patterned stone were carved into pottery forms. Bronze ware appears imitating the ceramic ware.|$|E
2500|$|Before 3000 BC the {{political}} {{life of the}} city was headed by a priest-king (ensi) assisted by a council of elders and based on these temples, but it is unknown how the cities had secular rulers rise in prominence from the earliest times. The development and system of administration {{led to the development of}} archaic tablets around 3500 BC-3200 BC and ideographic writing (c. 3100 BC) was developed into logographic writing around 2500 BC (and a mixed form by about 2350 BC). As Sumerologist Christopher Woods points out in Earliest Mesopotamian Writing: [...] "A precise date for the earliest cuneiform texts has proved elusive, as virtually all the tablets were discovered in secondary archaeological contexts, specifically, in rubbish heaps that defy accurate stratigraphic analysis. The sun-hardened clay tablets, having obviously outlived their usefulness, were used along with other waste, such as potsherds, clay <b>sealings,</b> and broken mudbricks, as fill in leveling the foundations of new construction — consequently, it is impossible to establish when the tablets were written and used."

2500|$|This latter ordinance, {{known as}} a sealing ceremony, {{reflects}} a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be [...] "sealed" [...] to one another so that their marital bond continues into the eternities. Children may also be sealed to their biological or adoptive parents to form permanent familial bonds, thus allowing all immediate and extended family relations to endure past death. Children born to biological parents who have been sealed to each other are considered [...] "born in the covenant" [...] and need not be sealed to their parents. See [...] The most significant LDS ordinances may be performed via proxy in behalf {{of those who have}} died, such as baptism for the dead. The church teaches that all {{will have the opportunity to}} hear and accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings that come to those who faithfully adhere to it, in this life or the next. Ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, <b>sealings,</b> and endowments are performed in temples that are built and dedicated specifically for these purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Blacks enjoyed full {{fellowship}} in {{the church}} — holding priesthood office included — up until 1849 when Brigham Young, the prophet of the church at the time, issued a church-wide ban on blacks being {{able to have the}} priesthood. Young would then make the earliest known statement declaring a black priesthood ban, stating, [...] "The Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited them the priesthood." [...] This decision may have been brought about by the actions of William McCary, an African American convert to the church who believed he was a prophet and claimed on various occasions to be Jesus and Adam, father of the human race. McCary was also known to perform <b>sealings</b> in his own house and was later excommunicated in 1847. Despite this banning of priesthood rights, many blacks were still able to hold church office and lead congregations. Joseph T. Ball, for example, was the leader of a Boston congregation, and supposedly the first black to do so. Abel himself also enjoyed opportunities for involvement {{in the church}} after this declaration. He completed three missions for the church: one in the 1830s, one in the 1840s, and the last in his local area in 1843. In addition, as the church moved out West, Mormons were exposed to a larger population of blacks and anti-black political attitudes continued to increase. Other influential black members include Black Pete, a member who came to Ohio and later became notorious for claiming to be a revelator. He was later disfellowshipped by Joseph Smith because of his false teachings. One Q. Walker Lewis from Lowell, Massachusetts also found himself a item of scrutiny during this period. Lewis was ordained an elder by William Smith, Joseph Smith Jr.'s younger brother. By 1847, his authority was challenged despite his being well-respected in the church community.|$|E
2500|$|The early {{occupation}} of the Euphrates basin was limited to its upper reaches; that is, the area that is popularly known as the Fertile Crescent. Acheulean stone artifacts {{have been found in}} the Sajur basin and in the El Kowm oasis in the central Syrian steppe; the latter together with remains of Homo erectus that were dated to 450,000 years old. In the Taurus Mountains and {{the upper part of the}} Syrian Euphrates valley, early permanent villages such as Abu Hureyra – at first occupied by hunter-gatherers but later by some of the earliest farmers, Jerf el-Ahmar, Mureybet and Nevalı Çori became established from the eleventh millennium BCE onward. In the absence of irrigation, these early farming communities were limited to areas where rainfed agriculture was possible, that is, the upper parts of the Syrian Euphrates as well as Turkey. Late Neolithic villages, characterized by the introduction of pottery in the early 7th millennium BCE, are known throughout this area. Occupation of lower Mesopotamia started in the 6th millennium and is generally associated with the introduction of irrigation, as rainfall in this area is insufficient for dry agriculture. Evidence for irrigation has been found at several sites dating to this period, including Tell es-Sawwan. During the 5th millennium BCE, or late Ubaid period, northeastern Syria was dotted by small villages, although some of them grew to a size of over [...] In Iraq, sites like Eridu and Ur were already occupied during the Ubaid period. Clay boat models found at Tell Mashnaqa along the Khabur indicate that riverine transport was already practiced during this period. The Uruk period, roughly coinciding with the 4th millennium BCE, saw the emergence of truly urban settlements across Mesopotamia. Cities like Tell Brak and Uruk grew to over [...] in size and displayed monumental architecture. The spread of southern Mesopotamian pottery, architecture and <b>sealings</b> far into Turkey and Iran has generally been interpreted as the material reflection of a widespread trade system aimed at providing the Mesopotamian cities with raw materials. Habuba Kabira on the Syrian Euphrates is a prominent example of a settlement that is interpreted as an Uruk colony.|$|E
