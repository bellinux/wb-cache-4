A two-dimensional automatic measurement system, which consisted of a conveying unit, a system control unit, an ultrasonic sensor, and a deposition collecting dish, was designed and developed. The system could precisely move an ultrasonic sensor above a pesticide deposition collecting dish to measure the nozzle flow distribution. A <b>sensor</b> <b>sleeve</b> with a PVC tube was designed for the ultrasonic sensor to limit its beam angle in order to measure the liquid level in the small troughs. System performance tests were conducted to verify the designed functions and measurement accuracy. A commercial spray nozzle was also used to measure its flow distribution. The test results showed that the relative error on volume measurement was less than 7. 27 % when the liquid volume was 2 mL in trough, while the error was less than 4. 52 % when the liquid volume was 4 mL or more. The developed system was also used to evaluate the flow distribution of a commercial nozzle. It was able to provide the shape and the spraying width of the flow distribution accurately...|$|E
40|$|An {{orthopedic}} plaster or fiberglass cast {{is often}} applied after a bone fracture {{to hold the}} broken bone in place and allow the fracture to heal and the bone to set. If this cast becomes loose, due {{to a reduction in}} swelling for example, the bone may not heal properly and a misalignment of the bone may occur. If this problem goes unnoticed, surgery may need to be performed to re-break and reset the bone. This is particularly a problem with patients who are unable to accurately express what they are feeling, e. g. children, and who {{may not be able to}} identify that their cast is loose. The SmartCast system has been designed to avoid this complication and to identify early if a cast is not fitting well. SmartCast consists of a sleeve with novel textile sensors capable of measuring the pressure the cast is applying to an appendage as well as electronics to sample and log the sensor data. Several types of textile piezoresistive sensor sleeves have been designed and tested to determine which type would best be able to measure the cast pressure. A full prototype system, including firmware, <b>sensor</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and printed circuit board, has been designed, implemented and tested. The SmartCast system will allow doctors and orthopedic professionals to obtain a better understanding of how well a cast fits over time and to avoid the painful procedure of resetting a bone...|$|E
40|$|With these results, {{it appears}} that UL {{function}} can be improved, even in the chronic post-stroke phase, with a tool such as HARI that encourages active reaching through biofeedback. Additionally, we have developed quantitative measures of outcome relating to control and jerkiness of muscle that {{can be useful in}} conjunction with therapies for anti-spasticity. HARI (Hand Arm Rehab Interface) •HARI consists of a modified chair, which supports the arm against gravity, while measuring muscle activity and reaching and grasping motions, and a computer display for visual biofeedback. Muscle activity is registered with a Myokinetic Interface (MKI), consisting of a pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>sleeve</b> that is donnable by the user. HARI provides targets for the user, while producing metrics of motor control for both the elbow and hand, devised to quantify disability of joint motions and hand grasping. Methodology • Subjects performed elbow flexion and extension exercises two days per week for eight weeks. 3 sets of 5 elbow flexion/extensions. were performed in each hour-long session, • Elbow range of motion (ROM) tasks were not timed; subjects performed the repetitions at a self-selected pace, with rest periods in between for recovery. The RD was used to quantify the range and quality of their movements, with a lower score indicating better control. Results Preliminary results from 4 male and 2 female subjects (age 60 - 79, 4 - 80 months post-stroke) averaged over the first three and last three days, showed improvement in RD and functional performance as assessed by an adapted Chedoke-McMaster (CM) Arm rating scale.

40|$|Transient lower esophageal {{sphincter}} relaxations (TLESRs) are {{the most}} important mechanism by which gastroesophageal reflux occurs, and <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> manometry is the gold standard for detection of TLESRs. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate manometry with closely spaced sideholes (high-resolution manometry) for the detection of TLESRs as an alternative. In 12 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, a 90 -min postprandial manometry was performed by using a catheter incorporating both a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> and closely spaced sideholes in the esophagogastric junction. TLESRs recorded with both techniques were scored. Reflux during TLESRs was detected by using manometry (common cavity), intraluminal impedance, and pH monitoring. A total of 145 TLESRs were detected by using both techniques, 117 with high-resolution manometry and 108 with <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> manometry [not significant (NS) ]. Manometric signs of reflux during TLESRs detected with high-resolution and <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> manometry were found in 62. 4 and 56. 5 %, NS, respectively, versus 38. 5 and 35. 2 %, NS on pH-metry and 70. 1 and 60. 2 %, NS on impedance monitoring.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Unavoidable {{catheter}} movement during sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry {{can produce}} considerable {{variations in the}} basal pressure, due to movement of the recording sidehole. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> is a perfused channel which records the highest pressure point along its length. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop and evaluate a prototype <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> for SO manometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bench-testing was used to assess the dynamic performance of the sleeve and sidehole assemblies. Recordings were initially made with a standard triple-lumen catheter and then with a purpose-built manometric assembly which had a 15 mm long <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor.</b> RESULTS: A perfusion rate of 0. 04 ml/min gave the best balance between baseline pressure offset and rise rate. Recordings were attempted in nine patients and successfully achieved in four. The sleeve and sidehole recordings of the maximal basal pressure did not differ significantly (mean +/- SEM, 86. 1 +/- 26. 5 mmHg vs. 90. 1 +/- 21. 0 mmHg, P = 0. 57, r = 0. 998). CONCLUSIONS: Unnecessarily high perfusion rates are being used for SO manometry.

40|$|In {{response}} of ever increasing demand of the intelligent robots in our society, the natural ways of Human Robot Interaction (HRI) {{have been investigated}} in terms of speech recognition, machine perception and physical interfaces. As the speech and vision methods that require power processing and intensive calibration are difficult to implement. Hence, the physical interfaces are still in use. These interfaces improve the cooperative behavior between man and machine. The aim of this thesis is to design and investigate the use of emerging motion capture techniques for the future robots. In this thesis the human arm motion has been utilized to control the human like manipulator of the WorkPartner robot in real-time dynamic task environment. This technique offers great benefits in advance teleoperation and robotic control through motion learning and conversion. Initially various motion capture techniques are reviewed and then based on reliability, accuracy, robustness and real-time performance the Internal & Magnetic MoCAP technique has been selected. The selected approach is validated by the assembly of low cost c 3 D orientation sensor (tri axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer). After evaluation of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer for angle measurement a sensor fusion based the real-time extended Kalman filter technique is proposed to achieve an average angle accuracy of 0. 5 degree in each axis of 3 D orientation measurement. The performance of the filter is validated by the experiments and their results are discussed. An idea of wearable <b>sensor</b> <b>sleeve</b> comprising four 3 D orientation sensors is presented {{in connection with the}} motion translation control scheme that allows the user to control the human like robotic arm directly using his arm motion with no delay.

Subjects underwent an air infusion protocol after standard assessment and data tracings and isocontour plots were analysed to assess opening characteristics of the EGJ during dLESRs and tLESRs. Our results revealed that during dLESR the opening pattern was top to bottom, occurred in 0 – 2. 7 s and in 29 of 35 (83 %) cases {{the leading edge of the}} bolus was liquid.

40|$|The {{relation}} between pyloric motor activity, opening, and closure was examined in eight healthy men. Manometry was performed with an assembly combining 13 side holes and a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> positioned astride the pylorus. Simultaneous with manometry, pyloric opening and closure and antroduodenal contractions were observed fluoroscopically with the antrum filled with barium. During intraduodenal normal saline infusion, coordinated antral pressure waves swept over the pylorus and ejected barium into the duodenum. No localised pyloric motor pattern was observed under these conditions. In contrast, the intraduodenal triglyceride infusion {{was associated with}} the absence of antral pressure waves and virtual absence of antral wall movement. At the pylorus, there was a zone of luminal occlusion less than 1 cm long that persisted for the period of observation. This zone of luminal occlusion corresponded precisely with manometric recordings of a narrow zone of pyloric phasic and tonic activity. During the duodenal triglyceride infusion, the pylorus was closed for 98. 5 % of the measurement period when basal pyloric pressure was 4 mm Hg or more, and during this motor pattern, barium did not traverse the pylorus. Localised pyloric contractions cause sustained pyloric closure, whether these contractions are phasic or tonic. These contractions occur independently of antral or duodenal contractions and may interrupt gastric emptying...|$|R

Background/Aims: Investigation of {{the motor}} events {{underlying}} gastroesophageal reflux has largely been confined to resting, recumbent subjects. The motor events associated with reflux during physical activity remain unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the patterns of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function underlying reflux in healthy subjects and the effect of exercise and physical activity on reflux mechanisms. Methods: LES pressure was recorded with a perfused <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> in 10 healthy subjects; intraluminal transducers recorded pressure in the stomach, esophagus, and pharynx, and pH was recorded 5 cm above the LES. Signals were stored in a portable datalogger. Recordings were made for 24 hours, including moderate physical activity, periods of rest and sleep, standardized meals, and standardized exercise. Results: Most reflux episodes (81 of 123; 66 %) occurred in the 3 hours after food intake: only 2 episodes occurred during exercise. LES pressure was ≤ 3 cm H₂O in 79 % of reflux episodes. Transient LES relaxation was the mechanism of reflux in 82 % of episodes, irrespective of activity or body position, whereas swallow-related LES relaxations accounted for 13 % and persistently absent LES pressure accounted for 1 %. Straining occurred in only 20 % of episodes. Conclusions: In ambulant healthy subjects, accurate continuous recording of LES function is possible, reflux usually occurs during transient LES relaxations, and straining is not a major factor in the induction of reflux.

40|$|Background: There is {{an inverse}} {{relationship}} between gestational age, birth weight {{and the time of}} first neonatal bowel movement. The authors hypothesized that delayed passage of meconium might result from a delayed maturation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) in premature infants. Objective: To evaluate whether the RAIR is absent in very preterm infants 28 - 32 weeks postmenstrual age with delayed meconium production. Study design: Anorectal manometry was performed in 10 preterm infants (seven male) with delayed meconium production (no meconium in the first 48 hours). Median postmenstrual age was 30 weeks (28 - 31 weeks). Birth weight ranged from 780 to 1930 g (median, 1395 g). A micromanometric assembly (outer diameter, 2. 0 mm) was used which incorporated a 1. 5 -cm-long <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> for measurement of resting anal sphincter pressure and relaxation. Four side-holes recorded anal and rectal pressures. Rectal distension was performed with direct air insufflation to elicit the RAIR. Results: The time from birth to passage of meconium ranged from 48 to 105 hours (median, 82 hours). The mean anal sphincter pressure, rectal pressure, and anal sphincter oscillation frequency were 22. 0 +/- 5. 0 mm Hg, 6. 9 +/- 2. 0 mm Hg, and 9. 8 +/- 1. 9 /min, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} anal sphincter {{function in}} very premature infants < or = 30 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) and {{to evaluate the}} time of maturation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) by using a sleeve catheter. STUDY DESIGN: Anorectal manometry was performed in 16 healthy neonates (nine girls) with a mean PMA of 29 weeks (range, 27 - 30 weeks) and a birth weight of 640 to 1590 g (median, 1220 g) with a micromanometric assembly (outer diameter, 2. 0 mm). The assembly incorporated a 1. 5 -cm-long <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> for measurement of resting anal sphincter pressures and relaxation, and four side holes recorded anal and rectal pressures. Rectal distention was performed with direct air insufflation to elicit the RAIR. RESULTS: The mean anal sphincter pressure, rectal pressure, and anal sphincter oscillation frequency were 24. 5 +/- 11. 4 mm Hg, 6. 5 +/- 4. 8 mm Hg, and 11. 1 +/- 2. 3 /min, respectively. A normal RAIR could be elicited in 13 (81 %) infants studied. In two infants, the RAIR could not be elicited because of a low anal sphincter pressure of only 5 mm Hg. In the other child, no RAIR was seen despite the repeated insufflation of at least 5 mL of air. CONCLUSION: The majority (81 %) of premature infants older than 26 weeks' PMA have normal anorectal pressures and a normal RAIR. Fleur de Lorijn, T. I Omari, J. H Kok, J. A. J. M Taminiau and M.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comBackground/Purpose Perfused multilumen sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry is accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis of SO dysfunction. However, this technique is associated with a relatively high incidence of post-procedure acute pancreatitis. In addition, triple-lumen manometry recordings may be difficult to interpret, as movement may produce artifacts. We have refined the development of a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> for human SO manometry. This assembly aims to overcome the above limitations. In this study the accuracy of sleeve SO manometry (SOM) has been evaluated and compared with standard triple-lumen perfused SOM. Methods Patients undergoing SO manometric studies consented to having both standard triple-lumen and sleeve SOM. A total of 32 paired studies were performed in 29 patients. Diagnosis was made only from standard triple-lumen SOM and the patient treated accordingly. For each study, SO basal pressure, contraction, amplitude, and frequency were recorded. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the recordings of SO basal pressure, contraction, amplitude, and frequency between the two techniques. A strong correlation was demonstrated between SO basal pressure determined with the two catheters. The accuracy of sleeve SOM is comparable to standard triple-lumen SOM, with less movement artifact. One patient developed mild post-manometric pancreatitis. Conclusions The sleeve catheter records SO pressures with comparable values to standard triple-lumen SOM. The sleeve assembly potentially can replace the use of the perfused triple-lumen catheter for the objective diagnosis of SO dysfunction. Masahiko Kawamoto, Joseph Geenen, Taher Omari, Ann C.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Enterally {{administered}} glucose modifies gut sensation, diminishes hunger, and slows gastric emptying by suppressing antral motility {{and stimulating}} pyloric pressures. We aimed {{to clarify the}} mechanism of small intestinal glucose sensing. METHODS: We studied eight healthy males twice, in random order. An antroduodenal manometry catheter was positioned with a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> across the pylorus. Benzocaine, or vehicle alone, was given into the proximal duodenum as a bolus, followed by continuous infusion for 105 min (T=- 15 to 90 min). Glucose was also infused into the proximal duodenum at 3 kcal/min for 90 min (T= 0 - 90 min). Sensations of hunger, bloating, and nausea were assessed with visual analog questionnaires, blood was sampled at intervals, and energy intake at a buffet meal (T= 90 - 120 min) was measured. RESULTS: Perceptions of bloating and nausea were markedly less with benzocaine when compared with vehicle (P< 0. 05 for each), with no difference in hunger, or energy intake. In contrast, the suppression of antral waves and stimulation of phasic and tonic pyloric pressures, duodenal waves, and propagated duodenal wave sequences by intraduodenal glucose infusion did not differ between the 2 days. No difference in blood glucose, plasma insulin, or plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 between benzocaine and control was observed, whereas glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and cholecystokinin concentrations were slightly higher with benzocaine (P< 0. 05 for both). CONCLUSION: Mucosal anesthesia ameliorates unpleasant sensations induced by enteral glucose, but does not inhibit the release of gut peptides that feed back on appetite and gastroduodenal motility.

40|$|Information on the {{mechanism}} of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux disease is limited largely to studies in resting recumbent subjects. Evidence exists that both posture and physical activity may influence reflux. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate reflux mechanisms in ambulant patients with reflux oesophagitis. Concurrent ambulatory oesophageal manometry and pH monitoring were performed in 11 ambulant patients with erosive oesophagitis. Lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure was monitored with a perfused <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor.</b> Recordings were made for 90 min before and 180 min after a meal. At set times patients sat in a chair or walked. LOS pressure was < or = 2 mmHg at the time of reflux for 98 % of reflux episodes. Transient LOS relaxation was the most common pattern overall and the predominant pattern in seven patients, whilst persistently absent basal LOS pressure was the most common pattern in four patients. The pattern of LOS pressure was not altered by the presence of hiatus hernia or by walking. Straining occurred at the onset of 31 % of acid reflux episodes but often followed the development of an oesophageal common cavity. The occurrence of straining was not influenced by walking. In ambulant patients with reflux oesophagitis: (1) LOS pressure is almost always absent at the time of reflux, usually because of transient LOS relaxation, (2) persistently absent basal LOS pressure is an important mechanism of reflux in a few patients, (3) straining may help to induce acid reflux in a variable proportion of occasions and may in some instances be a response to gas reflux, and (4) walking does not influence the occurrence of reflux or its mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease show {{an increase}} in esophagogastric junction (EGJ) distensibility and in frequency of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESR) induced by gastric distension. The objective was to study the effect of localized EGJ distension on triggering of TLESR in healthy volunteers. An esophageal manometric catheter incorporating an 8 -cm internal balloon adjacent to a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> was developed to enable continuous recording of EGJ pressure during distension of the EGJ. Inflation of the balloon doubled the cross-section of the trans-sphincteric portion of the catheter from 5 mm OD (round) to 5 × 11 mm (oval). Ten healthy subjects were included. After catheter placement and a 30 -min adaptation period, the EGJ was randomly distended or not, followed by a 45 -min baseline recording. Subjects consumed a refluxogenic meal, and recordings were made for 3 h postprandially. A repeat study was performed on another day with EGJ distension status reversed. Additionally, in one subject MRI was performed to establish the exact position of the balloon in the inflated state. The number of TLESR increased during periods of EGJ distension with the effect being greater after a meal [baseline: 2. 0 (0. 0 - 4. 0) vs. 4. 0 (1. 0 - 11. 0), P= 0. 04; postprandial: 15. 5 (10. 0 - 33. 0) vs. 22. 0 (17. 0 - 58. 0), P= 0. 007 for undistended and distended, respectively].

The authors hypothesized that delayed passage of meconium might result from a delayed maturation of the recto-anal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) in premature infants. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the RAIR is absent in very preterm infants 28 - 32 weeks postmenstrual age with delayed meconium production. STUDY DESIGN: Anorectal manometry was performed in 10 preterm infants (seven male) with delayed meconium production (no meconium in the first 48 hours). Median postmenstrual age was 30 weeks (28 - 31 weeks). Birth weight ranged from 780 to 1930 g (median, 1395 g). A micromanometric assembly (outer diameter, 2. 0 mm) was used which incorporated a 1. 5 -cm-long <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> for measurement of resting anal sphincter pressure and relaxation. Four side-holes recorded anal and rectal pressures. Rectal distension was performed with direct air insufflation to elicit the RAIR. RESULTS: The time from birth to passage of meconium ranged from 48 to 105 hours (median, 82 hours). The mean anal sphincter pressure, rectal pressure, and anal sphincter oscillation frequency were 22. 0 +/- 5. 0 mm Hg, 6. 9 +/- 2. 0 mm Hg, and 9. 8 +/- 1. 9 /min, respectively.

On separate days, eight healthy male volunteers (18 - 34 years) received randomized, single-blind, intraduodenal (ID) infusions of 10 % Intralipid (2 kcal min(- 1)), either continuously [CID], or in a pulsatile manner [PID] (5 s on/ 15 s off) and 0. 9 % saline (control) administered continuously, each {{at a rate of}} 1. 8 mL min(- 1) for 3 h. During each infusion, subjective ratings of appetite were assessed and antropyloroduodenal pressures recorded with a 16 -lumen manometric assembly incorporating a pyloric <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor.</b> Plasma cholecystokinin was measured from blood collected at regular intervals throughout the infusion. At the end of each infusion the manometric assembly was removed, subjects were offered a buffet meal and the energy and macronutrient content of the meal was measured. Both ID lipid infusions stimulated isolated pyloric pressure waves (IPPWs) (P 0. 05, CID vs. PID). Both intraduodenal lipid infusions decreased hunger (P < 0. 05), increased fullness (P < 0. 05) and reduced energy intake (P < 0. 05) when compared with controls; again {{there was no difference between}} CID and PID lipid. We conclude that at the infusion rate of similar 2 kcal min(- 1), the acute effects of intraduodenal lipid on antropyloroduodenal pressures, plasma CCK concentration and appetite are not modified by a pulsatile mode of lipid delivery into the duodenum.

40|$|The length {{at which}} a muscle {{operates}} in vivo (operational length) and the length at which it generates maximal force (optimal length) may be quite different. We studied active and passive length-tension characteristics of external anal sphincter (EAS) in vivo and in vitro to determine the optimal and operational length of rabbit EAS. For the in vitro studies, rings of EAS (n = 4) were prepared and studied in a muscle bath under isometric conditions. For in vivo studies, female rabbits (n = 19) were anesthetized and anal canal pressure was recorded by use of a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> placed in the custom-designed catheter holders of 4. 5 -, 6 -, and 9 -mm diameters. Measurements were obtained at rest and during EAS electrical stimulation. Sarcomere length of EAS muscle was measured by laser diffraction technique with no probe and three probes in the anal canal. In vitro studies revealed 2, 054 mN/cm 2 active tension at optimal length. In vivo studies revealed a probe size-dependent increase in anal canal pressure and tension. Maximal increase in anal canal tension with stimulation was recorded with the 9 -mm probe. Increases in anal canal tension with increase in probe size were completely abolished by pancuronium bromide. EAS muscle sarcomere length without and with 9 -mm probe in the anal canal were 2. 11 ± 0. 08 and 2. 99 ± 0. 07 μm, respectively. Optimal sarcomere length, based on the thin filament length measured by thin filament analysis, is 2. 44 ± 0. 10 μm. These data show that the operational length of EAS is significantly shorter than its optimal length. Our findings provide insight into EAS function and we propose the possibility of increasing anal canal pressure by surgical manipulation of the EAS sarcomere length...|$|R

Lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and lower esophageal (LE) pH were measured simultaneously by a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> and a pH probe for 20 minutes before and 90 minutes after intragastric instillation of four test solutions, which contained either regular coffee (C), decaffeinated coffee (D), tea (T) or water (W). C and T solutions had the same caffeine content, 160 mg. As compared with control (W), LESP was significantly lower after C and T, but not after D. The data for LE pH paralleled those for LESP. Thus, {{the greatest number of}} reflux episodes occurred after T and C. Difference from control (W) was statistically significant for T but not for C. We conclude that both regular coffee and tea have adverse effects upon LES function, whereas decaffeinated coffee does not. This study provides a rational basis for limiting intake of both caffeinated coffee and tea in patients with clinically important gastroesophageal reflux.

40|$|Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter (LOS) relaxation is {{the major}} mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux in humans [...] an event unassociated with swallowing. Mechanisms involved in triggering transient LOS relaxation are poorly understood, and their further study requires a small animal model. In this study we aimed to establish methods for prolonged ambulant oesophageal manometry in ferrets, and to determine motor events associated with reflux episodes and their triggering by different gastric nutrient loads. Forty-two studies were performed on nine ferrets with chronic cervical oesophagostomies, through which a manometric assembly was introduced and secured to a collar, which incorporated a microphone for detection of swallows. The assembly included a gastric feeding channel, one gastric and four oesophageal manometric sideholes, a 2. 5 -cm-long LOS <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor,</b> and an oesophageal pH electrode. Intragastric infusions were given over 2 min, the first after a 30 -min control recording period, and in 29 / 42 studies, a second infusion was given 60 min later. Infusions were either 25 mL 10 % dextrose solution, pH 3. 5 (22 studies), 25 mL triglyceride emulsion (Intralipid) pH 3. 5 (11 studies), or 25 mL air (nine studies). Episodes of oesophageal acidification were absent before gastric infusions. After infusion, 2. 1 +/- 0. 2 episodes occurred over the first 30 min. After glucose infusion, 15 / 18 acidification episodes (83 %) occurred during transient LOS relaxation, and 3 / 18 (17 %) occurred after gradual (< 1 mmHg sec- 1) downward drifts in basal LOSP to < 2 mmHg. After lipid infusion two acidification episodes occurred, both during transient LOS relaxation. Mean duration of transient LOS relaxation was 8. 0 +/- 0. 4 sec. All infusions increased occurrence of transient LOS relaxation to a similar extent, each of which ended with primary peristalsis. We conclude that gastric infusion of glucose, lipid and gas are all effective in provoking gastro-oesophageal reflux in ferrets. Reflux occurs through similar mechanisms to those seen in humans, i. e. increased triggering of transient LOS relaxation. The conscious ferret is therefore an appropriate model for future studies of manipulation of mechanisms giving rise to gastro-oesophageal reflux...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate TLOSR in twin pairs who are discordant for gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) symptoms, i. e. only one of the pair has GORD symptoms to establish whether differences in TLOSR may contribute to the aetiology of GORD. Material and methods: 4 monozygotic (MZ) and 12 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, who were repeatedly discordant for GORD symptoms over 2 years, were studied. LOS function using a <b>sleeve</b> <b>sensor</b> and oesophageal pH were monitored for 30 mins before and 60 mins after a 300 mls (1200 kcal) lipid meal. Results: MZ twins were aged mean 63 (range 53 - 75) yrs and DZ twins 57 (44 - 74) years. TLOSR frequency increased from 1 (0 - 2) to 2. 5 (1 - 8) per hour post-prandially (p= 0. 001) in the symptomatic twins and from 0 (0 - 2) to 3 (1 - 6) post-prandially in the asymptomatic twins (Median (range), p= 0. 001). Comparison between groups revealed that there was no difference in pre-prandial and post prandial TLOSR frequency. However no pre prandial TLOSR were associated with acidic reflux (pH< 4) compared with 38 % of post-prandial TLOSR. Acid reflux episodes (pH< 4) increased post-prandiallyin both symptomatic and asymptomatic twins, but there was no differences between the groups in pre or post-prandial acid reflux episode frequency or total post-prandial acid exposure (symptomatic twins median 11 (range 0 - 1051) s, asymptomatic twins 4 (0 - 487) s (p= 0. 4). Moreover preprandial LOS pressure of 13 (4 - 29) mmHg fell to 8 (2 - 13) after the meal (p= 0. 0001). No difference was found in basal and post prandial lower esophageal sphincter pressure readings between asymptomatic and symptomatic twins (p= 0. 2).
