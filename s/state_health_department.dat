The matter went quiet {{for more than a}} year and was resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early 1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs.

Tempest quickly discovered that five people, including the young man’s fiancée, as well as an Arizona resident, all had experienced the same symptoms and all had died within a six-month period. Tempest learned from the young man's family members that his fiancée had the same symptoms and died on the Navajo Reservation five days earlier. Deaths on the reservations are not reported to the <b>state</b> <b>health</b> <b>department</b> because they are sovereign nations. Tempest had considered plague as the cause because it is endemic to the region. But that had already been ruled out by tests on all the victims. Within a short time, a dozen more people contracted the illness, most of them young Navajos in New Mexico. This included two relatives of the young couple who had died within a week of each other.|$|E

METHODS: After analyzing the revised OMB standards, existing MDPH data sets were assessed for {{the impact of the}} revised standards on data collection, tabulation, analysis, and reporting for <b>state</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments.</b> RESULTS: The revised OMB standards {{will have an impact on}} the MDPH and other <b>state</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments.</b> Similarities and differences exist between federal and <b>state</b> <b>health</b> agencies regarding the purpose of data collection, tabulation, analysis, and reporting. These similarities and differences will affect state implementation of the revised OMB standards. CONCLUSIONS: States need to plan for the implementation of the revised OMB standards and to understand the impact of this revision on the collecting and reporting of public health data. The revised OMB standards will introduce added complexities to the collection and analysis of race and ethnicity data, but they will also produce a more nuanced understanding of the relationship of race and ethnicity to the health of the American people...|$|R
