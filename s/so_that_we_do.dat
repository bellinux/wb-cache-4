60|$|But {{the inside}} of the church has many very good things in it, and worth observation; it was for some ages the burying-place of the English Saxon kings, whose reliques, at the repair of the church, were {{collected}} by Bishop Fox, and being put together into large wooden chests lined with lead were again interred {{at the foot of the}} great wall in the choir, three on one side, and three on the other, with an account whose bones are in each chest. Whether the division of the reliques might be depended upon, has been doubted, but is not thought material, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> but believe they are all there.|$|E
6000|$|It {{may be as}} well {{to remark}} here, that the Misses Dunning, {{although}} stiff, and starched, and formal, had the power of speeding nimbly from room to room, when alone and when occasion required, without in the least degree losing any of their stiffness or formality, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not use the terms [...] "rush," [...] "rushed," [...] or [...] "rushing" [...] inappropriately. Nevertheless, {{it may also be}} remarked that they never acted in a rapid or impulsive way in company, however small in numbers or unceremonious in character the company might be--always excepting the servant-girl and the cat, to whose company, from long habit, they had become used, and therefore indifferent.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} three days the track ran on through scattered, rolling bush-veld of the {{character}} that I have described, but tending continually down hill. When we broke camp {{on the morning of the}} fourth day, eating a hasty meal at dawn (for now game had become astonishingly plentiful, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not lack food) the rising sun showed beneath us an endless sea of billowy mist stretching in every direction far as the sight could carry.|$|R
6000|$|Of all quaint places {{this is one}} of {{the most}} charming. I have been rather troubled that antiquity has fled before me where I have gone. It is a {{fatality}} of travelling that the sense of novelty dies away, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not realize that we are seeing any thing extraordinary. I wanted to see something as quaint as Nuremberg in Longfellow's poem, and have but just found it. These high-gabled old Flemish houses, nine steps to each gable! The cathedral, too, affects me more in externals than any yet. And the spire looks as I expected that of Strasbourg would. As to the grammarye of bells and chimes, I deliver that over to Charlie. But--I have seen Rubens's painting! Before I came to Europe, Longfellow said to me, [...] "You must go to Antwerp, to see Rubens." ...|$|E
6000|$|How quaint they were, those home-made rooms! They {{rise out}} of the shadows and shape {{themselves}} again before my eyes. I see the knobbly sofa; the easy-chairs that might have been designed by the Grand Inquisitor himself; the dented settle that was a bed by night; the few blue plates, purchased in the slums off Wardour Street; the enamelled stool to which one always stuck; the mirror framed in silk; the two Japanese fans crossed beneath each cheap engraving; the piano cloth embroidered in peacock's feathers by Annie's sister; the tea-cloth worked by Cousin Jenny. We dreamt, sitting on those egg-boxes--for we were young ladies and gentlemen with artistic taste--of the days when we would eat in Chippendale dining-rooms; sip our coffee in Louis Quatorze drawing-rooms; and be happy. Well, we have got on, some of us, since then, as Mr. Bumpus used to say; and I notice, when on visits, that some of us have contrived <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> sit on Chippendale chairs, at Sheraton dining-tables, and are warmed from Adam's fireplaces; but, ah me, where are the dreams, the hopes, the enthusiasms that clung like the scent of a March morning about those gim-crack second floors? In the dustbin, I fear, with the cretonne-covered egg-boxes and the penny fans. Fate is so terribly even-handed. As she gives she ever takes away. She flung us a few shillings and hope, where now she doles us out pounds and fears. Why did not we know how happy we were, sitting crowned with sweet conceit upon our egg-box thrones? ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 14. But be this as it may, {{the fact}} is, as ill {{luck would have}} it, that profanity of feeling, and skill in art, {{increased}} together; <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not find the backgrounds rightly painted till the figures become irreligious and feelingless; and hence we associate necessarily the perfect landscape with want of feeling. The first great innovator was either Masaccio or Filippino Lippi: their works are so confused together in the Chapel of the Carmine, that I know not to whom I may attribute,--or whether, without being immediately quarrelled with, and contradicted, I may attribute to anybody,--the landscape background of the fresco of the Tribute Money. But that background, {{with one or two}} other fragments in the same chapel, is far in advance of all other work I have seen of the period, in expression of the rounded contours and large slopes of hills, and the association of their summits with the clouds. The opposite engraving will give some better idea of its character than can be gained from the outlines commonly published; though the dark spaces, which in the original are deep blue, come necessarily somewhat too harshly on the eye when translated into light and shade. I shall have occasion to speak with greater speciality of this background in examining the forms of hills; meantime, it is only as an isolated work that it can be named in the history of pictorial progress, for Masaccio died too young to carry out his purposes; and the men around him were too ignorant of landscape to understand or take advantage of the little he had done. Raphael, though he borrowed from him in the human figure, never seems to have been influenced by his landscape, and retains either, as in Plate 11., the upright formalities of Perugino; or, by way of being natural, expands his distances into flattish flakes of hill, nearly formless, as in the backgrounds of the Charge to Peter and Draught of Fishes; and thenceforward the Tuscan and Roman schools grew more and more artificial, and lost themselves finally under round-headed niches and Corinthian porticos.|$|E

6000|$|... 2. Faith, {{as it is}} a gift of God, or an act of ours, take it {{which way}} you will, if we speak {{properly}} of salvation, it is not the first nor the second cause of our salvation, but the third, and that but instrumentally neither--that is, it only layeth hold of and applieth to us that which saveth us, which is the love of God, through the merits of Christ, which are the two main causes of our salvation, without which all other things are nothing, whether it be faith, hope, love, or whatever can be done by us. And to this the great Apostle of the Gentiles speaks fully, for, saith he, [...] "God, who is rich in mercy, loved us, even when we were dead in sins" [...] (Eph 2:4,5). That is, when we were without faith, and that was the cause why we believed for He thereby hath quickened us together, through the meritorious cause, which is Christ, and so hath saved us by grace--that is, of His own voluntary love and good will; the effect of which was this, He gave us faith to believe in Christ. Read soberly Ephesians 2:4-8. Faith, as the gift of God, is not the Saviour, as our act doth merit nothing; faith was not the cause that God gave Christ as the first, neither is it the cause why God converts men to Christ; but faith is a gift bestowed upon us by the gracious God, the nature of which is to lay hold on Christ, that God afore did give for a ransom to redeem sinners; this faith hath its nourishment and supplies from the same God that at the first did give it, and is the only instrument, through the Spirit, that doth keep the soul in a comfortable frame, both to do and suffer for Christ; helps the soul to receive comfort from Christ when it can get none from itself, beareth up the soul in its progress heavenwards. But that it is the first cause of salvation, that I deny, or that it is the second, I deny; but it is only the instrument, or hand, that receiveth the benefits, that God hath prepared for thee before thou hadst any faith; <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> nothing for salvation as we are men. But if we speak properly, it was God's grace that moved Him to give Christ a ransom for sinners; and the same God, with the same grace, that doth give to the soul faith to believe, and so, by believing, to close in with Him whom God out of His love and pity did send into the world to save sinners, so that all the works of the creature are shut out as to justification and life, and men are saved freely by grace. I shall speak no more here; but in my discourse upon the second covenant, I shall answer a Hell-bred objection or two, to forewarn sinners how they turn the grace of God into wantonness.|$|E
