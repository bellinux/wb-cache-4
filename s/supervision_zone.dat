5000|$|A {{small area}} (Hadf and surroundings) on the Arabian Peninsula, {{a part of}} Oman, at one time was jointly ruled with the Emirati member state of Ajman. The {{agreement}} defining the Hadf zone was signed in Salalah on 26 April 1960 by Sultan Said bin Taimur and in Ajman on 30 April 1960 by Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi, ruler of Ajman. This provided for some joint <b>supervision</b> in the <b>zone</b> by the ruler of Ajman and the shaikhs {{under the rule of}} Muscat. It allowed the Ajman ruler to continue collecting zakat (Islamic tax). The ruler of Ajman was, however, not to interfere in the affairs of the local people, the Bani Ka'ab (a branch of the Banu Kaab), which were the sole responsibility of shaikhs who were under Muscat rule. The agreement was later terminated.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presented}} {{an overview of}} the training available to intruder alarm installers. A survey of domestic and commercial intruder alarm systems (n= 20) were completed across Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan area. The gathered data were evaluated against Australian Standard AS 2201. 1 for intruder alarm systems, to determine whether alarm installations comply with two parts of the standard, being that of control panel location and <b>zone</b> <b>supervision.</b> AS 2201. 1 requires that intruder alarm control equipment shall be located within the alarmed area, located outside the entry/exit point and operate as dual endofline supervision. The study presents significant findings into the compliance of installed intruder alarm systems. A significant proportion of the intruder alarms measured did not comply with AS 2201. 1, with the panel located outside an alarmed area (30 %), located in the entry/exit point (15 %) and not capable of dual endofline supervision (30 %). These items contravene Australian Standard AS 2201. 1. Assumptions suggest that noncompliance is {{due to a lack of}} industry focused vocational training, industry self regulation and supervision, licensing regime and legislation. No single aspect could be considered ineffective; rather it is argued that all of these areas need to be addressed. Key words Intruder alarms, legislation, compliance, training, awarenes...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} {{as well as}} modified systems need to {{be tested}} and validated. The laboratory RailSiTe enables a systematic assessment of components and methods. It {{is a model of}} train control systems and can simulate the interaction between trackside and vehicle side equipment. Especially ERTMS can be represented by every element. For LC are dependent of the train control system these components also have to be considered in the laboratory RailSiTe. This presentation will show the RailSiTe and the possibilities of integration LC in a simulated environment. The RailSiTe laboratory has been developed following the standard UNISIG ETCS subset 094. This standard has been widened by adding more railway technology components. An interface for testing a LC has been added within the concept of the standard. The current state shows clearly that the integration of a LC in the RailSiTe is possible and fulfils the intended purpose. The integration of the railway control part has been finalized; the integration of the danger <b>zone</b> <b>supervision</b> technology has {{to be done in the}} next step. The adaptation of the testing method (in correspondence with UNISIG ETCS subset 076) is another step which must be done in future. A further perspective of this modeling is to develop and evaluate new kinds of LC as well as their integration with ETCS...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{an insight into}} the compliance of installed intruder alarm systems against the relevant Australian Standard. A survey of 451 domestic and commercial intruder alarm systems was completed across the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia. The gathered data were evaluated against Australian Standard AS 2201. 1 for the design, installation, commissioning and maintenance of intruder alarm systems to determine whether alarm installations complied with {{two parts of the}} standard, being that of control panel location and <b>zone</b> <b>supervision.</b> Security technicians are tested, and if they pass are awarded a licence, in part, against their knowledge and understanding of AS 2201. 1. The combination of the Western Australian Security Act and Australian Standard AS 2201 provide what could be considered the most robust control of the intruder alarm installers sector within Australia. The Australian Standard AS 2201. 1 required that intruder alarm control equipment shall be located within the alarmed area, located outside the entry/exit point and operate in dual end-of-line supervision. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of the intruder alarms measured did not comply with AS 2201. 1, with 17. 52 per cent of panels located outside an alarmed area, 14. 86 per cent panels located in the entry/exit point, 45. 90 per cent of the panels not capable of dual end-of-line supervision and 58. 75 per cent of the systems configured in single end-of-line supervision. These items contravene sections of the Australian Standard AS 2201. 1 and would appear to demonstrate systemic failure within this sector of the security industry. Further to these findings, the study made a number of conclusions in an attempt to understand why such a level of non-compliance was found. Conclusions included a lack of industry-focused vocational training and education, limited industry self-regulation and supervision, restricted licensing regime, inappropriate legislation and not having a single federal approach to such matters. In addition, the introduction of a new performance based AS 2201 standard may further decrease the ability to measure such non-compliance. However, no single aspect could be considered ineffective; rather, it is argued that all of these areas need to be addressed to significantly reduce the level of systemic non-compliance of intruder alarms systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the Practices and Challenges of Instructional <b>Supervision</b> in Asossa <b>Zone</b> Primary Schools. To conduct the study, descriptive survey design was employed and Multistage sampling technique was employed to select the sample Woredas, cluster centers, school principals and teachers. To this end, 6 Woreda Education Officers, 13 cluster supervisors, 24 primary schools with 24 school principals and 157 teachers were included in this study. Questionnaire was the main data gathering instrument for this study. Thus, 157 teachers, 24 school principals, and 13 cluster supervisors filled the questionnaires. An interview was also conducted to enrich the quantitative data. As a result, six Woreda Education Officers were interviewed. Quantitative data collected through questionnaire was analyzed by using mean scores and „F‟ test by using SPSS v. 16. o. The data gathered through interview was discussed in line with questionnaire. Consequently, the main findings come out from this study were: instructional supervisors attempt to identify strengths and limitations of teachers in the classroom in order to design appropriate intervention was insignificant; in addition, intervention of instructional supervisors so as to assist teachers improve their limitations was insufficient; teachers gained support from supervisors in order to improve their instructional skills was insufficient. Instructional supervisors‟ effort in liaising schools/clusters with various organizations, community groups and other interests in matters that affect quality education were also insufficient. The major challenges that primary school instructional supervisors come across while implementing instructional supervision was multiple. They were overburdened with other tasks, teaches the same credit like other teachers, teachers are challenged to accept recommendation and do not have financial allowances. Finally, to minimize and if possible to solve the problems, the following recommendations were drawn; the Woreda Education office, Asossa Zone Education Department and the region in collaboration with schools should give training for instructional supervisors; instructional supervisors in Asossa Zone should arrange induction training for beginner teachers; experience sharing programs and support teachers in doing action research. In addition to these; instructional supervisors should give professional support to teachers in order to improve their instructional limitations; they also had great responsibility to link the schools with other stakeholders and finally recommended that instructional supervisors were overburdened with other works and the school and woreda education offices should fulfill the required offices with furniture and stationeries.
