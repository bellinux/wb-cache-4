50|$|In June 1920, the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allied</b> {{coalition}} partners withdrew from Vladivostok, after the capture {{and execution of}} the White Army leader, Admiral Kolchak, by the Red Army. However, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of communism so close to Japan and Japanese-controlled Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese Army provided military support to the Japanese-backed Provisional Priamurye Government, based in Vladivostok, against the Moscow-backed Far Eastern Republic.|$|R
5|$|Media {{reports said}} the attack struck {{at the heart}} of American covert {{operations}} in the region, with some characterizing it as the CIA's Pearl Harbor. It raised doubts about the reliability of the Afghan forces that are being trained by the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies,</b> and on the practicality of Western exit strategies that involve training the Afghan army and policy with the aim of enabling them to fight the Taliban on their own.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies,</b> particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates ‘pinkwashing’ – the {{allegation}} that the Israeli <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> portray Israeli society as homogenously tolerant towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people, and portray Palestinian society as homogenously intolerant towards LGBTQ people, {{in order to improve}} the Israeli <b>state’s</b> image abroad <b>and</b> justify <b>its</b> violations of Palestinian rights. Using evidence from interviews with LGBTQ Israelis and Palestinians, as well as other sources, this thesis argues that ‘pinkwashing’ is taking place, and that it harms both Israelis and Palestinians...|$|R

25|$|The Korean War began, {{reinforcing}} the U.S. view that a monolithic communism {{directed by the}} Soviet Union was on the offensive in Asia and threatening to overthrow governments friendly to the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 549th Combat Training Squadron hosts Green Flag-West exercises, a {{realistic}} air-surface integration combat training exercise involving the air {{forces of the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies,</b> is primarily conducted in conjunction with US Army Combat Training Center exercises at Ft Irwin, CA.

25|$|Administration {{officials}} are weighing a new campaign plan for Libya that would deepen the United States' military and diplomatic involvement, {{on yet another}} front against ISIL. The United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> are increasing reconnaissance flights and intelligence collecting there—and even preparing for possible airstrikes and raids, according to senior American officials. Special Operations forces have met with various Libyan groups over the past months to vet them for possible action against ISIL.|$|E
50|$|In June 1920, around 450 Japanese {{civilians and}} 350 Japanese soldiers, along with Russian White Army supporters, were massacred by {{partisan}} forces {{associated with the}} Red Army at Nikolayevsk on the Amur River; the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allied</b> coalition partners consequently withdrew from Vladivostok after the capture and execution of White Army leader Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak by the Red Army. However, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of Communism so close to Japan and Japanese-controlled Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese army provided military support to the Japanese-backed Provisional Priamurye Government based in Vladivostok against the Moscow-backed Far Eastern Republic.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} the 414th Combat Training Squadron (Red Flag) is to {{maximize}} the combat readiness and survivability of participants by providing a realistic training environment and a pre-flight and post-flight training forum that encourages a free exchange of ideas. To accomplish this, combat units from the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allied</b> countries engage in realistic combat training scenarios carefully conducted within the Nellis Range Complex. The Nellis Range complex is located northwest of Las Vegas and covers an area of 60 nmi km by 100 nmi km, approximately half the area of Switzerland. This space allows the exercises {{to be on a}} very large scale.|$|R
50|$|Over 2,500 {{children}} were relocated and adopted by {{families in the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> by <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> The operation was controversial because there was question about whether the evacuation was in the children's best interest, and because not all the {{children were}} orphans.|$|R
25|$|In August 1942, Curts {{was summoned}} to Washington D.C. to join the staff of Admiral Ernest J. King, {{commander}} in chief of the United States Fleet. As communications officer for the United States Fleet, Curts received the Legion of Merit for his part in adopting successful communication agreements and plans between the military services of the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>Allies.</b> Curts is credited with developing the numbering system for organizing fleets and task forces that is still used today.|$|E
25|$|In June, the Korean War {{broke out}} between {{communist}} North Korea (DPRK) supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea (ROK) {{supported by the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> in the UN. The Cold War was turning 'hot' in East Asia, and the American government feared communist domination of the entire region would have deep implications for American interests. The US became strongly opposed {{to the government of}} Ho Chi Minh, in part, because it was supported and supplied by China.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 Marriott Hotel {{bombing was}} also {{perceived}} as targeted at Western interests in Indonesia; Al Qaeda claimed {{the attack was}} carried out by a Jemaah Islamiyah suicide bomber in response to actions of the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies,</b> including Australia. A 2004 attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta by Jemaah Islamiyah resulted in the deaths of nine Indonesians. The following year, Indonesian diplomatic and consular premises in Australia received a number of hoax and threat messages. Since then, both the United States and Australian governments have issued warnings against travel to Indonesia, advising their citizens of a continued risk of attacks.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1965, Kỳ's {{influence}} over the ruling military government was solidified when he forced civilian prime minister Phan Huy Quát from power. [...] Often praising aspects of Western culture in public, Ky {{was supported by the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allied</b> nations, though doubts began to circulate among Western officials by 1966 on whether or not Ky could maintain stability in South Vietnam. [...] A repressive leader, Ky was greatly despised by his fellow countrymen. [...] In early 1966, protesters influenced by popular Buddhist monk Thích Trí Quang attempted an uprising in Quang's hometown of Da Nang. [...] The uprising was unsuccessful and Ky's repressive stance towards the nation's Buddhist population continued.|$|R
50|$|Though {{inspired}} by American protest artists like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, nueva trova criticized {{the abuses of}} the United <b>States</b> government <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> Other major influences include The Beatles, Chilean revivalist Violeta Parra, Uruguayan singer-songwriter Daniel Viglietti and the Catalan protest singer Joan Manuel Serrat.|$|R
5000|$|During the Cold War, {{the term}} [...] "Eastern world" [...] was {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} extension of Eastern bloc, connoting the Soviet Union, China and their communist allies, while the term [...] "Western world" [...] often connoted the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> NATO <b>allies</b> such as the United Kingdom.|$|R
25|$|During the Korean War Puerto Ricans {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} part of the 65th Infantry Regiment receiving many awards and recognitions, including ten Distinguished Service Crosses, however some men were unjustly accused and involved in the largest court martial of said war. Puerto Ricans have continued to fight in every conflict in which the United States has been involved, among which are the Vietnam War in which four Puerto Ricans were awarded the Medal of Honor, Operation El Dorado Canyon, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Restore Hope, Operation Desert Storm and in the military campaigns of Afghanistan and Iraq, in what the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> refer to as the War on Terror.|$|E
25|$|Cambodia's {{relations}} with China {{were based on}} mutual interests. Sihanouk hoped that China would restrain the Vietnamese and the Thai from acting to Cambodia's detriment. The Chinese, in turn, viewed Cambodia's nonalignment as vital {{in order to prevent}} the encirclement of their country by the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Phnom Penh in 1956, he asked the country's Chinese minority, numbering about 300,000, to cooperate in Cambodia's development, to stay out of politics, and to consider adopting Cambodian citizenship. This gesture helped to resolve a sensitive issue—the loyalty of Cambodian Chinese—that had troubled the relationship between Phnom Penh and Beijing. In 1960 the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship and Nonaggression. After the Sino-Soviet rift Sihanouk's ardent friendship with China contributed to generally cooler ties with Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Hayashi {{helped found}} the JSC and the JSDF after Japan regained {{its status as a}} {{sovereign}} state under the Treaty of San Francisco in 1954. As Chairman of JSC, he assisted the Director-General of Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) in formulating defense plans, reviewing proposals as submitted by the JSDF, carrying out defense-related intelligence and investigation work, as well as fostering closer military ties with the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> Having served in the JSC for ten years, he was not only the longest-serving Chairman, but was also the only Chairman with civilian civil service background. In retirement, he took an active part in public affairs, serving as, among others, President of the Japan Housing Corporation from 1965 to 1971, of the Japanese Red Cross from 1978 to 1987, and of the Japan Good Deeds Association from 1983 to 1990.|$|E

40|$|In {{reporting}} on work in progress, this paper considers {{the nature and}} power of everyday violence within the ‘War on Terror’ context. In particular, the impact of suspicion and citizen surveillance on those marked as ‘hyper-visible’, i. e. those seen as South Asian or Arabic and Muslim, is considered {{as a form of}} violence that is sanctioned by the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allied</b> security service agents. It is argued that members of this ethnic group are subjected to emotional and psychological harm as a result of being marked out as a ‘problem group’ or {{as a member of a}} ‘suspect community’, which involves deviant labels, such as anti-British, enemy within, illegal immigrant, sympathiser of terrorist activity, radicalised student, etc., being applied on a regular basis, despite any actual evidence of criminal behaviour on their part...|$|R
25|$|In March 2012, Epic Games {{partnered with}} Virtual Heroes of Applied Research Associates to launch Unreal Government Network, {{a program that}} handles Unreal Engine 3 {{licenses}} for government agencies. With this support agreement, Virtual Heroes was able to license the technology to the departments, agencies and units of the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> across multiple platforms. Epic also revealed that several UGN projects were already underway, including an Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) contract for Virtual Heroes to design serious games with the aim to help intelligence analysts tackle instinctual biases that might colour their findings, an anaesthesiology training application for U.S Army physicians, and a multiplayer crime scene training simulation developed by the FBI Academy. Additionally, Epic's tech was also being used by a top five defense contractor and a national laboratory for custom-made model integrations and visualization. Later in December, defense IT and software firm IPKeys Technologies licensed the third version of the engine for development of I-GAME, a tool intended to train tactics and techniques in regards to Counter-IEDs.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the victorious}} Allies of the Second World War (locally {{known as the}} Second Sino-Japanese War), the Republic of China (ROC) joined the UN at its {{founding}} in 1945. The subsequent resumption of the Chinese Civil War led {{to the establishment of}} the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Nearly all of mainland China was soon under its control and the ROC fled to the island of Taiwan. The One-China policy advocated by both governments precluded dual representation but, amid the Cold and Korean wars, the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> opposed the replacement of the ROC at the United Nations, although they were persuaded to pressure the government of the ROC to accept international recognition of Mongolia's independence in 1961. The United Kingdom, France, and other American allies individually shifted their recognitions of China to the PRC and Albania brought annual votes to replace the ROC with the PRC, but these were defeated since—after General Assembly Resolution 1668—a change in recognition required a two-thirds vote.|$|E
500|$|Six {{months after}} Imperial Japan {{attacked}} Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States won a strategic {{victory at the}} Battle of Midway. [...] Seizing the strategic initiative, the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>Allies</b> landed on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands in August 1942, beginning the Solomon Islands Campaign. [...] The battle for Guadalcanal ended in victory for the Allies with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island in early February 1943. [...] At the same time, Australian [...] and American forces in New Guinea repulsed the Japanese land offensive along the Kokoda Track. Going on the offensive, the Allied forces captured Buna–Gona, destroying Japanese forces in that area.|$|E

50|$|Although the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> ARVN <b>allies</b> won {{several major}} battles with North Vietnamese forces {{and their allies}} {{suffering}} staggering losses, the cost of victory was so high {{in the opinion of}} the US public (58,193 U.S. deaths) that it came to see any further possible gains as not worth the troop losses.|$|R
