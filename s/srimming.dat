40|$|An {{isolated}} {{wind power}} generation scheme using slip ring induction machine (<b>SRIM)</b> is proposed. The proposed scheme maintains constant load {{voltage and frequency}} irrespective of the wind speed or load variation. The power circuit consists of two back-to-back connected inverters with a common dc link, where one inverter is directly connected to the rotor side of <b>SRIM</b> and the other inverter {{is connected to the}} stator side of the <b>SRIM</b> through LC filter. Developing a negative sequence compensation method to ensure that, even under the presence of unbalanced load, the generator experiences almost balanced three-phase current and most of the unbalanced current is directed through the stator side converter is the focus here. The <b>SRIM</b> controller varies the speed of the generator with variation in the wind speed to extract maximum power. The difference of the generated power and the load power is either stored in or extracted from a battery bank, which is interfaced to the common dc link through a multiphase bidirectional fly-back dc-dc converter. The <b>SRIM</b> control scheme, maximum power point extraction algorithm and the fly-back converter topology are incorporated from available literature.

40|$|Ion {{sputtering}} is {{the removal}} of surface atoms or molecules in a solid under energetic ion irradiation. This technique is promising for its applications in material modification and characterization. Sputtering yield, {{the average number of}} atoms removed from a sample per incident ion, is a crucial parameter in material modification. In the present study, a quartz crystal microbalance was used within an ultra-high vacuum chamber (10 E- 8 torr) to measure the sputtering yield of gold. An NTI- 1401 ion gun was used to bombard argon and helium ions onto a gold sample. The argon and helium ions used ranged in energy from 100 – 5000 eV. Theoretical sputtering yield values were determined through simulation with Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (<b>SRIM)</b> software and compared with experimentally measured values. The experimental values show a significantly higher sputtering yield for gold than that of the <b>SRIM</b> values; however they followed the same trend. Another observation was that for a constant ion energy bombardment the sputtering yield decreased with time. An atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed before and after sputtering. The AFM showed that the surface of the sample became smoother after a period of ion bombardment. These observations suggest that surface topography significantly affects the sputtering yield values.

We describe the techniques used for parallelization, and the performance obtained. Several novel approaches to problems of task distribution, data distribution, and direct output were required. These techniques increase performance and appear to have general applicability for massive parallelism. We describe the hierarchy necessary to dynamically manage (i. e., load balance) a large ensemble. The ensemble is used in a heterogeneous manner, with different programs on different parts of the hypercube. The heterogeneous approach takes advantage of the independent instruction streams possible on MIMD machines...|$|R
40|$|The {{stopping}} {{powers in}} silicon of heavy ions, with atomic numbers ranging from 4 to 29, have been determined using a time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF ERDA) set-up. In transmission geometry, the energy loss of heavy elastic recoils in the self-supporting silicon foil of known thickness is measured over a continuous range of recoil energies using time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometry. By essentially calibrating the Si detector {{for each channel}} over the measured energy region using the TOF spectrometer, an uncertainty of less than 4 % is achieved. The stopping powers are parameterized using a sixth order polynomial and compared with the limited experimental data in the literature.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} verification of a novel sensorless control scheme for a super synchronous slip ring induction machine (<b>SRIM).</b> The novel scheme overcomes {{the limitations of the}} encoder-based system, with a reduced cost.;This research re-utilised a LUED slip power facility, previously funded by SERC in the 80 s.;The <b>SRIM</b> uses a conventional current source inverter (CSI) connected between the supply and the rotor windings. Two techniques of slip power recovery, the Kramer and the Scherbius system, are discussed. The Kramer system recovers slip power to the supply. The Scherbius system is capable of four-quadrant operation, with the main advantage of twice the rated shaft output power when operating at twice the rated speed.;The CSI is investigated and its commutation problems studied. For stable operation the commutation sequence in the CSI is synchronised electrically with the varying rotor e. m. f. 's. When motoring sub-synchronously, or generating super-synchronously, the rotor e. m. f. 's are in the direction to aid the commutation process. However, when motoring super-synchronously or generating sub-synchronously, the rotor e. m. f. 's oppose commutation. These limit the performance of the CSI.;Provided the rotor terminal voltages are isolated from the mains, the rotor speed and phase information can be derived from the measured and filtered rotor terminal voltages. The derived signals can synchronise the CSI to the secondary e. m. f., thereby eliminating the need of an encoder. This novel scheme is different to the techniques known for cage type machines, and is not affected by the inherent machine parameter variations.;The <b>SRIM</b> harmonics are analysed. From which, a novel adaptive filter was developed to remove the rotor speed dependent harmonics and to track the varying e. m. f. with negligible phase delay.
