40|$|Given a {{completely}} regular Hausdorff space X, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> A(X) is {{a ring of}} real valued continuous functions between C*(X) and C(X). We discuss two correspondences between ideals in A(X) and z-filters on X, both reviewing old results and introducing new results. One correspondence, ZA, extends the well-known correspondence between ideals in C*(X) and z-filters on X. The other, ζA, extends the natural correspondence between ideals in C(X) and z-filters on X. This paper highlights how these correspondences help clarify what properties of C*(X) and C(X) are shared by all <b>intermediate</b> <b>rings</b> and what properties of C*(X) and C(X) characterize those <b>rings</b> among <b>intermediate</b> <b>rings.</b> Using these correspondences, we introduce new classes of ideals and filters for each <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> that extend the notion of z-ideals and z-filters for C(X), and with ZA, {{a new class of}} filters for each <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> A(X) that extends the notion of e-filter for C*(X) ...|$|R

In {{the case where}} each <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> is affine over R, S {{is said to be}} strongly affine over R. This hypothesis implies that tr. deg. S/R ≤ 1, and in the case where tr. deg.

If R is a Noetherian universally Japanese ring, then S is strongly affine over R for each affine extension S of R such that (R, S) is a Noetherian pair. We consider the strongly affine property for Prüfer domains and show, for example, that an affine overring of a Prüfer domain D with Noetherian spectrum is strongly affine over D if and only if there are only a finite number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>rings...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the free vibration of open circular cylindrical shells with <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> supports. An analytical procedure for determining the free vibration frequencies of such shells is developed based on the Flügge thin shell theory. An open circular cylindrical shell is assumed to be simply supported along the two straight edges and the remaining two opposite curved edges may have any combinations of support conditions. The shell is divided into multiple segments along the locations of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> supports. The state-space technique is employed to derive the exact solutions for each shell segment and the domain decomposition method is applied to enforce the geometric and natural boundary/interface conditions along the interfaces of the shell segments and the curved edges of the shell. Comparison studies are carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed method. Exact vibration frequencies are obtained for open circular cylindrical shells with multiple <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> supports. The influence of the number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> supports, the locations of the ring supports, the boundary conditions and the variation of the included angle of the shells on the natural frequencies are examined. The exact vibration solutions can be used as important benchmark values for researchers to check their numerical methods and for engineers to design such shell structures...|$|R

For any totally ordered field F and a completely F-regular topological space X, let C(X,F) be the ring of all F-valued continuous functions on X and B(X,F) the aggregate of all those functions which are bounded over X. An explicit formula for all the z^∘-ideals in A(X,F) in terms of ideals of closed sets in X is given. It turns out that an <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> A(X,F) ≠ C(X,F) is never regular {{in the sense of}} Von-Neumann. This property further characterizes C(X,F) amongst the <b>intermediate</b> <b>rings</b> within the class of P_F-spaces X.

If A⊆D⊆Ahs is a normal semilocal <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> semilocally dominated by Ahs, then D is a direct limit of semilocal-etale extensions of A. If A is {{an excellent}} normal local domain then the integral closure of A in a finite separable field extension L of the quotient field Q(A) is etale over A {{if and only if}} there is a Q(A) morphism L→Q(Ahs) and Q(Ahs) contains a normal closure of L. We apply these results to the normalizations of an arbitrary excellent reduced local ring A and its strict Henselization Ahs to obtain a characterization for local-etaleness of a local <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> A⊆D⊆Ahs whose total quotient ring L is finitely generated over Q(A). Specifically, such an <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> D is local-etale over A if and only if the normalization D̃ of D is semilocal and has the proper residual field structure relative to Ã and to D. We generalize this result to characterize local-etaleness of arbitrary injective reduced local morphisms A→D, where A is excellent, finding that such a morphism is local-etale if and only if the morphism Ã→D̃ is semilocal-etale and there is an isomorphism D̃≅D⊗AÃ...|$|R

40|$|Recently, in [7], we {{have succeeded}} in {{constructing}} Galois theory of simple rings {{under the assumption that}} the extension R/S considered is hereditarily Galois (h-Galois) and locally fnute. However, we have believed that [7, Theorem 2. 1] and [7, Theorem 3. 1] should be stated under more desirable assumptions. One of the purposes of the present paper is to give a settlement to this problem. Concerning [7, Theorem 2. 1], one will see that the assumption that R/S is locally finite can be excluded from those assumed there (Theorem 1). On the other hand, as was shown in [7, Lemma 3. 4], if R/S is h-Galois and locally finite then GR_r is dense in Hom s_l(R, R). In 1, one will see also that if R/S is locally finite and GR_r is dense in Hom_S_l(R, R) then the fundamental theorems in Galois theory of finite dimension hold still for regular <b>intermediate</b> <b>rings</b> of R/S left finite over S (Theorems 2 ond 3).
