5|$|Following engagements at Bullecourt, the 5th Division—of {{which the}} 55th Battalion was part—spent {{four months in}} reserve, before moving into the Ypres sector in Belgium. Made a regular <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer,</b> Corey was {{decorated}} with a bar to his Military Medal for his actions on 26 September during the Battle of Polygon Wood.

He had served with the battalion earlier while a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer,</b> and began serving as an infantryman at Passchendaele. Passchendaele was characterised by the mud of the battlefield, and has been widely used {{as an example of}} attrition warfare—both the Commonwealth and German forces were suffering heavy casualties. When the Fifth Army was failing to make any appreciable headway, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig put General Herbert Plumer in command of the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Albert Corey, MM & Three Bars (20 December 1891 – 25 August 1972) was a {{distinguished}} Australian soldier {{who served as}} a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer</b> during the First World War. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 13 January 1916, and was allocated to the 55th Battalion, where he was initially posted to a grenade section before volunteering for stretcher bearing duties.

5|$|A brief {{shelling}} of {{the hill}} begins {{the next day at}} dawn. C Company attempts to capture the hill but is repelled by gunfire. Among the first killed is one of the platoon leaders, Second Lieutenant Whyte. During the battle, a squad led by Sergeant Keck hides behind a swell safe from enemy fire to wait for reinforcements. Keck reaches for a grenade but accidentally pulls the pin and dies in the process. Lieutenant Colonel Tall orders the company commander, Captain James Staros, to take the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros refuses and Tall decides to join Staros on the front line to see the situation. The Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros seems to have been sealed. Private Witt, having been assigned punitively as a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer,</b> asks to rejoin the company, and is allowed to do so.|$|E

25|$|On 28 July, {{the several}} companies—consisting of about 400 men—from the 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry Regiment, which had landed at Nassau Bay {{earlier in the}} month, arrived and {{relieved}} some of the Australian forces in the forward positions around Mount Tambu. Australian mortar crews and stretcher bearers remained in the line supporting the US troops, while one company from the Australian 2/5th Infantry Battalion continued to maintain a base around the mountain. On 30 July, an uphill company-level attack {{was made by the}} American troops, which failed. For his efforts in rescuing 12 wounded US soldiers during the attack while under fire, an Australian <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer</b> from the 2/5th Infantry Battalion, Corporal Leslie Allen, was awarded the US Silver Star; his actions were captured in a photograph by Gordon Short.|$|E
25|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Pearson volunteered for service as a medical orderly with the University of Toronto Hospital Unit. In 1915, he entered {{overseas}} service with the Canadian Army Medical Corps as a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer</b> with the rank of private, and was later commissioned as a lieutenant. During this period of service he {{spent two years in}} Egypt and in Greece. He also spent time in the Serbian Army as a corporal and a medical orderly. In 1917, Pearson transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, since the Royal Canadian Air Force did not exist at that time, where he served as a flying officer until being sent home with injuries from two accidents. Pearson learned to fly at an air training school in Hendon, England. He survived an aeroplane crash during his first flight.|$|E

He was a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer</b> with the 3rd Australian Field Ambulance, Australian Army Medical Corps at Gallipoli during the First World War. He landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 and, on that first night, took a donkey and began {{carrying}} wounded from the battle line to the beach for evacuation.

On 26 July, Birks was engaged in duties at Pozières, as the Australian and British forces fought for supremacy of the village. Throughout the day, Birks [...] "continually led his squad of stretcher bearers" [...] through the village and Pozières Wood to the frontline, all the while being [...] "exposed to heavy shell fire". Commended for his [...] "constant good services", Birks was recommended for the Military Medal. The announcement of the decoration was promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 14 November 1916, and he was later presented with his Military Medal by Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood.|$|E

Ottoman losses were so severe that a truce was organised by Aubrey Herbert and others on 24 May, to bury the dead lying in no man's land, which led to a camaraderie between the armies, much like the Christmas truce of 1914 on the Western Front.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the right}} forward section under Corporal Robin Jones {{attacked}} the Viet Cong at close range, inflicting heavy casualties on the defenders with grenades and small arms fire. However, three previously undetected Viet Cong machine-guns subsequently engaged 5 Platoon, which succeeded in {{breaking up the}} Australian attack on the right flank with intense enfilade fire which killed three men and wounded five more.

The Australian assault stalled having covered just [...] Nearly half {{of the men in}} the forward sections had become casualties and the platoon <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer,</b> Private Richard Odendahl repeatedly risked his life dragging men to safety, providing first aid, recovering weapons from the dead, and providing O'Halloran with information on the disposition of his platoon. For his actions Odendahl was also later awarded the Military Medal. Attempting to reinforce his threatened right flank, O'Halloran ordered the M60 machine-gun from his reserve section forward to support Jones while the wounded were recovered, however both the machine-gunner and his offsider were killed attempting to move forward. Surrounded by Viet Cong machine-guns and receiving fire from all sides, the lead Australian elements from B Company could advance no further against a determined and well dug-in force, and all attempts to regain momentum were unable to dislodge the defenders.|$|E

Songs of a Sentimental Bloke includes illustrations of [...] "bloke cupids" [...] by the artist Hal Gye, which were said to resemble the politician Bert Edwards. In 1963, Australian politician Arthur Calwell (1896–1973) told the Australian House of Representatives that he was [...] "an ordinary Australian bloke" [...] in a rhetorical contrast with political opponent Robert Menzies. The aphorist William George Plunkett (1910–1975) described himself as an 'ordinary bloke' who liked to 'play around with words'.

The corps' first deployment was to the Second Boer War, where it provided a field hospital and a <b>stretcher</b> <b>bearer</b> company attached in support of the Australian Commonwealth Horse, the first contingent of Australian troops deployed operationally following Federation. The force's role was limited as {{by the time it was}} deployed the large scale fighting was basically over. Prior to this, though, the various colonial forces had also contributed medical detachments to the war in support of their own and other British and colonial forces, and these units [...] consisting of various types of medical personnel including surgeons, dentists, cooks, drivers, and bearers [...] had been heavily involved. One officer, Lieutenant Neville Howse, of the New South Wales Army Medical Corps, received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the war; [...] Howse eventually rose to become Director of Medical Services within the Australian Imperial Force. An earlier deployment had also occurred in 1885, when a New South Wales Contingent of infantry and artillery was deployed to assist British forces in the Sudan conflict, a small medical detachment had also been deployed.|$|E
