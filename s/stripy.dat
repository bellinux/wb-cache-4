During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles {{that if they}} raise over £2,000,000 she {{will appear on the}} show in a swimsuit. After passing the £2,000,000 mark, Cotton {{appeared}} on the studio webcam in a <b>stripy</b> monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10 am and 10:30 am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played. This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itself was cream double lined. This <b>stripy</b> 2 had been used on {{promotions}} and holding slides for years prior to its launch, {{and now it was}} part of a bigger branding package. For the first few years of the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, was anything but. The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours. However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.|$|E
40|$|Covert spatial {{attention}} {{alters the}} way things look. There is strong empirical evidence showing that objects situated at attended locations are described as appearing bigger, closer, if striped, <b>stripier</b> than qualitatively indiscernible counterparts whose locations are unattended. These results cannot be easily {{explained in terms of}} which properties of objects are perceived. Nor do they appear to be cases of visual illusions. Ned Block has argued that these results are best accounted for by invoking what he calls ‘mental paint’. In this paper I argue, instead, in favour of an account of these phenomena in terms of the perceptual experience of affordances concerning saccadic eye movement. As part of the argument I draw connections with the empirical literature on the way in which performance efficiency also alters visual appearance...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{psychological}} {{research shows}} that attention affects appearances. An “attended item looks bigger, faster, earlier, more saturated, <b>stripier.</b> ” (Block 2010, p. 41). What {{is the significance of}} these findings? Ned Block has argued that they undermine representationism, roughly the view that the phenomenal character of perception is determined by its representational content. My first goal in this paper is to show that Block’s argument has the structure of a Problem of Arbitrary Phenomenal Variation and that it improves on other instances of arguments of the same form along several dimensions (most prominently, these are arguments based on the possibility of spectral inversion). My second goal is to consider responses to Block’s version of the arbitrariness problem. I will show that most of them have serious drawbacks. Overall, the best view is to accept that attention may distort perception, sacrificing veridicality for usability. I end my discussion by showing how to develop that view...|$|R
500|$|Several nods {{to earlier}} outfits {{in the series}} appear in [...] "A Christmas Carol".

60|$|They let the Zebra and the Giraffe get up; and Zebra {{moved away}} to some little thorn-bushes where the {{sunlight}} fell all <b>stripy,</b> and Giraffe moved off to some tallish trees where the shadows fell all blotchy.|$|E
60|$|Leopard stared, and Ethiopian stared, but {{all they}} could see were <b>stripy</b> shadows and blotched shadows in the forest, but never a sign of Zebra and Giraffe. They had just walked off and hidden {{themselves}} in the shadowy forest.|$|E
6000|$|So {{they waited}} till dark, {{and then the}} Leopard heard {{something}} breathing sniffily in the starlight that fell all <b>stripy</b> through the branches, and he jumped at the noise, and it smelt like Zebra, {{and it felt like}} Zebra, and when he knocked it down it kicked like Zebra, but he couldn't see it. So he said, 'Be quiet, O you person without any form. I am going to sit on your head till morning, because there is something about you that I don't understand.' ...|$|E
60|$|After a long time--things {{lived for}} ever {{so long in}} those days--they learned to avoid {{anything}} {{that looked like a}} Leopard or an Ethiopian; and bit by bit--the Giraffe began it, because his legs were the longest--they went away from the High Veldt. They scuttled for days and days and days till they came to a great forest, 'sclusively full of trees and bushes and <b>stripy,</b> speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows, and there they hid: and after another long time, what with standing half in the shade and half out of it, and what with the slippery-slidy shadows of the trees falling on them, the Giraffe grew blotchy, and the Zebra grew <b>stripy,</b> and the Eland and the Koodoo grew darker, with little wavy grey lines on their backs like bark on a tree trunk; and so, though you could hear them and smell them, you could very seldom see them, and then only when you knew precisely where to look. They had a beautiful time in the 'sclusively speckly-spickly shadows of the forest, while the Leopard and the Ethiopian ran about over the 'sclusively greyish-yellowish-reddish High Veldt outside, wondering where all their breakfasts and their dinners and their teas had gone. At last they were so hungry that they ate rats and beetles and rock-rabbits, the Leopard and the Ethiopian, and then they had the Big Tummy-ache, both together; and then they met Baviaan--the dog-headed, barking Baboon, who is Quite the Wisest Animal in All South Africa.|$|E

It {{is supposed to be a}} clouded animal - not <b>stripy,</b> but blotchy, like a tortoise-shell tom-cat. No end of a brute, it is, and a sure sign of war or pestilence or - or something.

Black Emperor’s The Dead Flag Blues and the cartoon series <b>Stripy</b> also feature prominently within the text.

50|$|The Lorne Street Church {{was built}} in 1868 {{as a result of}} the Disruption in the Church of Scotland. The {{architect}} was James Boucher of Glasgow, perhaps inspired by a church recently built in Manchester by the leading Gothic architect of the day, E.W. Pugin. The highly unusual <b>stripy</b> pattern that emerged from the use of differently coloured bands of stone on the east front, rapidly led to the church being named colloquially as The Tartan Kirk.|$|E

5000|$|Both sexes of Furcifer lateralis {{can reach}} a maximum length of {{anything}} between 17 and 25 cm. The males are largely green and females are heavier-bodied {{and have a}} wider range of colours, including bands of white, yellow and orange. Both sexes have <b>stripy</b> throats and lips.

5000|$|Her {{colleagues in}} the colonies were quick to antagonise her claims, {{particularly}} H.S. Stannus, regarded as an expert on African nutritional deficiency, and Williams thus followed up her paper with another, more directly contrasting kwashiorkor and pellagra, published in The Lancet in 1935. This did little to sway the medical opinion, and colonial physicians continued to avoid using the term kwashiorkor, or even acknowledge {{that it was a}} distinct condition from pellagra, despite the continued deaths of thousands of children who were being treated for the latter condition. Williams remarked about the ongoing issue [...] "These men in Harley Street couldn't believe you unless you wore <b>stripy</b> trousers." ...|$|E
50|$|By the 2010s, many American preps {{opted to}} dress in a more classic, {{tailored}} style closer to the original Ivy League look. Popular clothings include loafers, Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes, Aran sweaters, cardigans, Oxford shirts, Cricket pullovers, wingtips, <b>stripy</b> polo shirts, hats like the fedora, khaki or pastel colored Vineyard Vines, Nantucket Reds, white or bright pastel color socks worn with sneakers and Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes, colored jeans, baseball jackets, khaki cargo shorts, and tapered chinos. Blazers, especially those made from seersucker, had made a comeback as informal or smart casual wear by the mid 2010s, and the traditional two button style was updated with throwback styling inspired by The Great Gatsby.|$|E
50|$|The small {{conical shell}} is 1.9 mm high and 1.0 mm wide. The five arched whorls {{increase}} uniformly in size {{up to the}} penultimate whorl - the last whorl becomes smaller towards the aperture. The apertural border with the lip is well formed and slightly folded over towards the spindle. The shell is shiny, slightly <b>stripy</b> and has a weakly developed palatine torus. It has three strong teeth, one columellar, one palatal and one parietal, although the adjacent palatine wall of the specimen is damaged and partially missing. The teeth are almost the same distance apart and their tips almost point towards one another. A characteristic feature is the complete absence of a basal tooth.|$|E

50|$|Carlo Bonomi (born March 12, 1937 in Milan) is an Italian voice {{actor and}} actor. He voiced many {{characters}} for the Italian advertising show Carosello. The language of noises {{he had developed}} and used for the earlier Osvaldo Cavandoli's La Linea from 1971 to 1986, was reinterpreted for the claymated TV series Pingu on SF DRS during its first four seasons produced between 1986 and 2000, where Bonomi voiced all the characters without a script. When the show was renewed for a 5th and 6th season in 2003 and 2006, Bonomi was replaced by voice actors David Sant and Marcello Magni. In 1984 he provided the laughter voices for the cartoon series <b>Stripy.</b> In 1985 he recorded the railway announcements for the central station of Milan which remained in use until 2008. In 2008 he acted the voices for the yellow tribe in Spore and The Garfield Show.|$|E

5000|$|While not as formalised as the Assassins Guild Code of Conduct, Guild thieves are {{expected}} to work to certain standards. The main one is not to cause undue distress; a Guild burglar ransacking a house will be careful to place everything (apart from what he takes) back where he found it. Another rule is that a Guild member must look and sound the part. Guild thieves must wear appropriate clothing (in the case of burglars this means an eye mask, a flat cap, a <b>stripy</b> jumper and a ball bag labelled [...] "SWAG"; other specialities have their own uniforms) and speak in thieves cant, or at least rhyming slang. Members are required to carry their membership cards during all official activities (i.e. crimes). They tend to leave members of the Guild of Seamstresses alone, though this is more from self-preservation than professional courtesy. There is one golden, cardinal rule amongst the Guild thieves: always leave a receipt.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} days of Kaiser Chiefs, Wilson was well known for wearing <b>stripy</b> blazers, waistcoats, turn-up jeans, and winkle picker shoes, a style that won him the Shockwaves NME Award For Best Dressed Person in 2006. Lately, he has adopted a more casual dress code. Wilson is well known for his {{energetic}} stage presence, climbing scaffolding, standing on the safety barrier, and at times crowd surfing. Of crowd surfing, Wilson says he likes to [...] "get out and see the crowd, see what they smell like". Such exploits have occasionally resulted in injury, such as torn ankle ligaments after jumping off stage during a concert in Portugal.In May 2006, Wilson was involved in a hit-and-run accident in his home town of Leeds. He was hit by the car while attempting to walk over a pedestrian crossing, suffering only bruising and a broken toe owing to a 'Ricky trademark jump' which resulted in him hitting the windscreen and being flipped {{over the top of the}} vehicle rather than trapped underneath.|$|E
5000|$|Odge {{is a young}} hag {{who feels}} she is a {{disappointment}} to her parents and therefore {{wants to do something}} big in life to make up for it. Her sisters all have <b>stripy</b> feet, fingernails so long they can dig the garden with them, black hairs like piano wires coming out of their ears, and blue teeth. Odge is the seventh daughter of her mother, who was also a seventh daughter, and the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter is supposed to be special. But when Odge is born, she is almost perfectly ordinary, a completely normal person. Disappointed, Odge's mother does not name her any fearsome name, but Odge, because it rhymes with Splodge, (when Odge was born her aunt said she looked like [...] "a small pink splodge") and hopes that Odge would improve as she got older. Odge does have a blue tooth, but it is a molar and right {{at the back of her}} mouth, and she has a very, very small bump on one foot which she thought was an extra toe for a while, but wasn't. Odge feels that her parents, especially her mother, can never get over just how different Odge is from all her sisters, especially her oldest sister, Fredegonda, who is the fiercest and hairiest of all her sisters.|$|E
