She never took {{me with her}} on these journeys, but nearly always {{when she came back}} at nightfall her eyes would be red, and I knew the two women had been weeping together. There came a certain hot Sunday in July when she went on this errand, and Grandpa Ripley having gone to spend the day at old man Winn's, I was left alone. I {{remember}} I sat on the <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> of the door-step, wondering whether, if I were to make my way to Salisbury, I could fall in with a party going across the mountains into Kentucky. And wondering, likewise, what Polly Ann would do without me. I was cleaning the long rifle,--a labor I loved,--when suddenly I looked up, startled to see a man standing in front of me. How he got there I know not. I stared at him. He was a young man, very spare and very burned, with bright red hair and blue eyes that had a kind of laughter in them, and yet were sober. His buckskin hunting shirt was old and stained and frayed by the briers, and his leggins and moccasins were wet from fording the stream. He leaned his chin on the muzzle of his gun.|$|E

It {{is one of the}} only surviving examples of colonial-era <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> construction. The main block of the house is estimated to have been built c. 1700 based on an analysis of the construction methods used to build it. An ell was added onto {{the rear of the house}} in the late 18th century, and a shed-like wing was added to the west rear in the 19th century.

In this paper, the problem of robust Bayesian prediction and estimation under a <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> error loss function is considered. We find the posterior regret [Gamma]-minimax predictor and estimator in a general class of distributions.

30|$|On {{platinum}} <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> returns, all of {{the tests}} used suggest LM as all the P values are less than 0.01.

So in this case, trend is not due to jumps in the data. It is clear that platinum squared returns have high persistence and it appears they could be explained by a fractionally integrated model.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We propose several serial {{and highly}} parallelized {{approaches}} to modeling causality between hospitalization and healthcare observations, {{using data from}} the Heritage Health Prize competition. As any set of predictors culled from the raw dataset will be very prone to overfitting, we propose some feature selection methods to shrink to a subset of predictors that best represent the data available. We then compare the effectiveness of all our approaches, first against a self-designated test subset of the data, and then against the contest data used for evaluation of ranking and prizes. Our best implementation approach with a RMSLE (root mean <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> error) score of 0. 462678 represents a linear blend of 20 random decision tree models with feature selection.

40|$|Realized {{variance}} {{option and}} options on quadratic variation normalized to unit expectation are analysed {{for the property}} of monotonicity in maturity for call options at a fixed strike. When this condition holds the risk-neutral densities {{are said to be}} increasing in the convex order. For Leacutevy processes, such prices decrease with maturity. A time series analysis of <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> returns on the S&P 500 index also reveals such a decrease. If options are priced to a slightly increasing level of acceptability, then the resulting risk-neutral densities can be increasing in the convex order. Calibrated stochastic volatility models yield possibilities in both directions. Finally, we consider modeling strategies guaranteeing an increase in convex order for the normalized quadratic variation. These strategies model instantaneous variance as a normalized exponential of a Leacutevy process. Simulation studies suggest that other transformations may also deliver an increase in the convex order...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of the measured hadronic total cross sections at the highest energies is empirically described by <b>squared</b> <b>log</b> of center-of-mass energy sqrt s as sigma(tot) = B (log s) 2, consistent with the energy dependence of the Froissart unitarity bound. The coefficient B is argued to have a universal value, {{but this is not}} proved directly from QCD. In the previous tests of this universality, the p(pbar) p, pi p, and K p forward scatterings were analyzed independently and found to be consistent with B(pp) = B(pip) = B(Kp), although the determined value of B(Kp) had large uncertainty. In the present work, we have further analyzed forward Kp scattering to obtain a more exact value of B(Kp). Making use of continuous moment sum rules(CMSR) we have fully exploited the information of low-energy scattering data to predict the high-energy behavior of the amplitude hrough duality. The estimation of B(Kp) is improved remarkably, and our result strongly supports the universality of B. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
