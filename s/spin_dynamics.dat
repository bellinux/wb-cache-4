40|$|We provide {{and analyze}} {{examples}} that counter the widely made claim that tunneling {{is needed for}} a quantum speedup in optimization problems. The examples belong to the class of perturbed Hamming-weight optimization problems.

This, in turn, inspires a classical <b>spin</b> vector <b>dynamics</b> algorithm that is at least as efficient for the plateau problem as the diabatic quantum algorithm. In a second case whose cost function is convex in Hamming weight space, the diabatic cascade results in a speedup relative to both tunneling and classical <b>spin</b> vector <b>dynamics.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|In most {{nucleation}} theories, {{the dynamics}} of nucleation {{is characterized by the}} evolution in time of the mass of droplets, and this time evolution is described as a combination of drift and diffusion. This assumes that the mass fluctations are described by a Markovian, i. e., memoryless, stochastic process. This paper presents a method to assess in how far this assumption of Markovianity is valid. The method is employed in nucleation studies in a two-dimensional Ising model at temperature T= 0. 88 T(c), both with <b>spin</b> flip <b>dynamics</b> and with local <b>spin</b> exchange <b>dynamics.</b> In the first case, it shows that the evolution of droplet masses might be effectively described by a Markov process on large time scales.

The dynamics of m_F= 0 Zeeman component ρ_ 0, {{as well as the}} system magnetization m, are illustrated for both ferromagnetic and polar interaction cases in the mean-field theory. We find that the dynamics of system magnetization can be tuned between the Josephson-like oscillation similar to the case of double well, and the interesting self-trapping regimes, i. e. the <b>spin</b> mixing <b>dynamics</b> sustains a spontaneous magnetization. Meanwhile the dynamics of ρ_ 0 may be sufficiently suppressed for initially imbalanced number distribution in the case of polar interaction. A "beat-frequency" oscillation of the magnetization emerges in the case of balanced initial distribution for polar interaction, which vanishes for ferromagnetic interaction.
