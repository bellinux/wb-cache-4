As the flat sieving has still not been contrasted against the standard rotary sieve method nor the Fryrear et al. equation tested for soils other than US soils, we estimated EF with both dry sieving methods and tested the equation for soils of semiarid regions of Central Aragon (NE Spain) and the Semiarid Pampas (centre of Argentina), two regions prone to wind erosion. Results showed that EF values obtained with the flat sieve were comparable with those obtained using the standard rotary sieve indicating that the flat sieving technique is suitable for EF determinations. The estimation of EF with the model proposed by Fryrear et al. (1994) did not fit with measured EF values, indicating that this model is not useful for predicting EF in Spanish and Argentinian soils. This was attributed to the high CaCO 3 contents of Spanish soils and the low sand/clay ratios and high organic matter contents of some Argentinean soils.

The temperature fluctuation was simulated {{with the use of a}} climatic chamber ex situ. The soil surface was for simplicity reasons considered without any plant or snow cover. The paper deals with the rate of soil erodibility determination – the soil erodibility should increase due to the decrease of soil aggregate stability depending on the number of freeze-thaw cycles and initial soil moisture. Soil samples (taken from three sites) were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under laboratory conditions. Changes in soil agreggate stability were monitored as one of the main soil characteristics which determine the soil erodibility. Two methods were used to determine the soil macroaggregate stability (soil aggregate fraction 1 – 2 mm) : standard single-sieve method <b>of</b> wet <b>sieving</b> (Kemper and Rosenau, 1986), and dry aggregate analysis using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> flat <b>sieves</b> with a diameter of 1 [*]mm and 0. 5 [*]mm. The results of each method are controversial. Intended hypothesis has not been clearly confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of process parameters during the dough formation step on wheat flour gluten agglomeration and composition {{in a laboratory}} scale gluten-starch separation process was studied. In the process, in which a dough {{was transformed into a}} batter then poured over a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> vibrating <b>sieves</b> (400, 250 and 125 mum), increasing water contents, mixing times and speeds during dough development all had a positive effect on gluten agglomeration as indicated by an increased gluten protein recovery on the 400 mum sieve. This showed the importance of optimal gluten hydration and development at the dough making stage of the process. The total level of gluten recovered on the three sieves was not affected significantly by the variables. Changes in gluten agglomeration behaviour coincided with changes in the carbohydrate composition of the gluten fractions. When the gluten protein recovery on the 400 mum sieve increased, the arabinose and xylose contents of the fractions decreased, while the starch content increased. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{effect of}} hammer mill screen size on {{processing}} parameters and particle size of milled sorghum were examined. Sorghum grains were ground through {{two levels of}} hammer mill screen size: 2 mm and 6 mm and then subsequently fractionated by size on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> eight <b>sieves</b> ranging from 0. 045 mm to 2. 8 mm. The objective of this experiment were: i) to characterize the influence of hammer mill screen size (2 and 6 mm) on processing parameters: production output, energy consumption, average particle size (d gw), geometric standard deviation (s gw); ii) to characterize the influence of particle size, after segregation by sieving, on starch enrichment. The {{results of this study}} showed that using 6 mm hammer milling screen size has resulted in a significant effect on production output, energy consumption, d gw with no effect on s gw. Different particle sizes, when segregated by sieving, have shown significant effect on starch content. Particle size retained by sieve size 1. 7 mm had the highest starch content, whereas particles retained by sieve size 0. 125 mm had the lowest, which suggest potential applications in ruminant and monogastric nutrition...|$|R
