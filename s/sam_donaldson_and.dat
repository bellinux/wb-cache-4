2500|$|In October 1984 {{television}} critic Rick Sherwood {{wrote that}} although the sexual tension between Sam and Diane provided a focus for Cheers other characters, their later romance and [...] "the removal of the love-hate subplot [...] much of {{the edge of the}} series [...] lost". In October 1985, Sherwood's interest in the show lessened because of the romance; Diane's affair with Frasier Crane [...] "made things worse". According to Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times in 1986, Glenn Caron (executive producer of Moonlighting) said: [...] "... I think it's masochistic to take two people who seem destined for each other and ask an audience not to see them get together". In 1989, Michael Hill of The Baltimore Evening Sun found the similarity between the Cheers characters and real-life news anchors <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> Diane Sawyer of Primetime Live [...] "remarkable".|$|E

50|$|Over {{the next}} several weeks the ABC News team searched {{archives}} in Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C., London, Berlin and Jerusalem, uncovering numerous documents chronicling Priebke's background and involvement with the notorious Nazi Gestapo in Italy. Among documents discovered in the Public Records Office in London was a confession, written {{a few months after the}} end of World War II, in which Priebke confirmed his role in the Ardeatine Caves Massacre. A document uncovered at Yad Vashem Museum in Israel indicated that Priebke signed off on the transport of Italian Jews to death camps. As their research continued, the ABC team began surveillance of Priebke monitoring his daily routine in Bariloche. In April 1994, ABC News reporter <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> traveled to Bariloche with Phillips and camera crews to confront Priebke with their research in behalf of the ABC Television news magazine Primetime Live. <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> his team first confronted another former Nazi living in the same town, Reinhard Kopps, who, when pressed about his own involvement, took <b>Donaldson</b> aside <b>and</b> told him about Priebke, confirming the ABC research.|$|R
5000|$|The {{documentary}} Framing an Execution: The Media & Mumia Abu-Jamal {{looks at}} the way <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> from the ABC program 20/20 covered the case.

This case only got recognition after people continued to dispute that Mumia's trial was fair or lawful, {{to the extent that it}} reached national and international attention. 20/20 begins to tell this case as an emotional story, making people see it as if it isn't that important. <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> starts his interviewing with the widow, Maureen Faulkner. She is seen as a damsel in distress, which makes it easier to sympathize with her. From the beginning we know the specific angle of ABC News and where the bias of <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> comes from. ABC stated in their letter sent to the Pennsylvania prison authorities when trying to get an interview with Mumia that they were [...] "currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of the Police." ...|$|R
