5|$|About {{the time}} that Edwin died in 633, {{a member of the}} East Anglian royal family, Sigeberht, {{returned}} to Britain after his conversion while in exile in Francia. He asked Honorius, one of the Gregorian missionaries who was then Archbishop of Canterbury, to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> bishop, and Honorius sent Felix of Burgundy, who was already a consecrated bishop; Felix succeeded in converting the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways which he could draw from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> bottle of Valais wine which he could again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva which he could then incorporate into the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, {{as well as the}} road through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Transport {{problems}} {{meant that}} the slate was usually used fairly close to the quarries. There was some transport by sea. A poem by the 15th century poet Guto'r Glyn asks the Dean of Bangor to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> shipload of slates from Aberogwen, near Bangor, to Rhuddlan to roof a house at Henllan, near Denbigh. The wreck of a wooden ship carrying finished slates was discovered in the Menai Strait and is thought to date from the 16th century. By {{the second half of}} the 16th century, there was a small export trade of slates to Ireland from ports such as Beaumaris and Caernarfon. Slate exports from the Penrhyn estate are recorded from 1713 when 14 shipments totalling 415,000 slates were sent to Dublin. The slates were carried to the ports by pack-horses, and later by carts. This was sometimes done by women, the only female involvement in what was otherwise an exclusively male industry.|$|E

5|$|McCudden's {{tenure at}} the aerodrome began ominously. The same day he was granted a request to travel as an {{observer}} in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, disaster struck which could conceivably have ended his career. Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he examined a Caudron Type A, and proceeded {{to turn over the}} engine. The aircraft was listed as unserviceable and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open. Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman MF.11. McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer's car which had been parked nearby. He was able to reach the cockpit and switch off the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done. For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing. Sykes was pleased with his overall progress, which likely saved him, but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident. Five years later Sykes again met McCudden—then {{at the height of his}} fame—and chaffed him on the episode, even jokingly threatening to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> bill for the car.|$|E

He resides on his family's beet farm, alongside his cousin, Mose (played by producer/writer Michael Schur).

25|$|The {{reputation}} of Weldon Kees has seen as much neglect {{as it has}} keen attention. Weeks before his disappearance, a young poet in Florida, Donald Justice, attempted to write Kees a letter of admiration and to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sestina he had written since Kees excelled in that form. His letter {{found its way to}} Kees’s father, John, who eventually gave Justice permission to compile and edit The Collected Poems of Weldon Kees (Iowa City, IA: The Stone Wall Press, 1959), which was subsequently released as a trade paperback in the 1960s. Kees’s work attracted the attention of other younger poets and his work gradually became anthologized and received critical attention.|$|E
25|$|While {{working at}} a Centreville Italian restaurant, she met Ronald Roldan, a Bolivian {{immigrant}} then around 30, and began an extramarital affair with him, possibly because he offered to help her with babysitting. By late 2010, the Deckers' marriage had begun to suffer; Bethany moved to a separate apartment in Ashburn, Virginia, at least temporarily. Roldan soon followed. According to her family, she quickly {{found that he was}} abusive, possessive, and controlling. Several times a day, he demanded that she <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> picture of herself from her cellphone to prove that she was not with anyone else. Her parents began developing a plan {{to get her out of}} the relationship. By the end of the year, she was pregnant again, likely by Roldan.|$|E
25|$|During the Yalta Conference on 4 February, the Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, General Aleksei Antonov, {{raised the}} issue of hampering the {{reinforcement}} of German troops from the western front by paralysing the junctions of Berlin and Leipzig with aerial bombardment. In response, Chief of the British Air Staff Portal, who was in Yalta, asked Bottomley to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> list of objectives to discuss with the Soviets. Bottomley's list included oil plants, tank and aircraft factories and the cities of Berlin and Dresden. A British interpreter later claimed that Antonov and Joseph Stalin asked for the bombing of Dresden, but {{there is no mention of}} these requests in the official record of the conference and the claim was assessed as possible Cold War propaganda.|$|E

25|$|Although Sandford {{accepted}} imprisonment as {{the will}} of God, he had difficulty at first bending to prison regulations. But with sleep, proper nourishment, and enforced exercise, his health gradually improved. He even insisted that Shiloh residents drop whatever they were doing at 11:30 and 4:00 and exercise with him. He was made a gatekeeper and given a pass {{that allowed him to}} spend some time out of doors. He also volunteered to teach a group of prisoners how to read and write and especially enjoyed conducting a weekly Bible class that began with one student and grew to more than a hundred. Eventually Shiloh was allowed to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> harp, and Sandford was not only able to practice, he gave at least two concerts at the prison.|$|E
25|$|During the siege, Chen {{was wounded}} in the foot by a {{catapult}} and supplies became scarce in the city. Chen maintained troop morale by using his personal funds to supply the troops. Seventy days into the siege, Li Heng sent a messenger into the city indicating that he would raise the siege if Chen would <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> maiden. Chen, realizing that the Jin forces were also in a dire situation by proposing such an odd offer, refused despite the entreaties of his commanders. Seizing the critical moment, Chen released a drove of oxen enraged by setting fire to their tail, and personally led a group of 60 fire lancers out from the west gate to make a direct attack on the sky bridge soldiers. Defenders on the walls threw bricks and shot arrows in conjunction with trebuchets hurling bombs and rocks. The sky bridges were burned with incendiary bundles of grass and firewood and their destruction caused the complete collapse of Jurchen morale. The Jin commander Li Heng decided to lift the siege and retreat with severe casualties.|$|E
25|$|In 1684, the {{beginning}} of the Morean War between Venice and the Ottoman Empire resulted in the temporary reconquest of {{a large part of the}} country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3000 inhabitants, ⅔ of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli {{gradually}} became a sharp critic of Peel's government, often deliberately taking positions contrary {{to those of}} his nominal chief. The best known of these stances were over the Maynooth Grant in 1845 and {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws in 1846. [...] But the young MP had attacked his leader as early as 1843 on Ireland and then on foreign policy interventions. [...] In a letter of February 1844, he slighted the Prime Minister for failing to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Policy Circular. [...] He laid into the Whigs as freebooters, swindlers and conmen but Peel's own Free Trade policies were directly in the firing line.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Arles Van Gogh asked his brother to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> copy of Armand Cassagne's Guide to the Alphabet of Drawing. [...] His request was generated by an interest to return to foundational drawing practices, such as his use of a perspective frame for the drawings and paintings that he made of Langlois Bridge. A letter dated March 18, 1888, to his friend Émile Bernard contains a sketch of the bridge (JH 1370 below) and the color scheme he is considering adopting, clearly showing his use of sketching and drawing as a preliminary to his painting. He spoke of how the town (Arles) [...] "projects the strange silhouette of its drawbridge against a huge yellow sun." ...|$|E

The USPS decided he was not a promising target and left him alone.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Alberta {{dominated}} the Flames' focus {{late in the}} season as they continued to struggle against their provincial rival. The two-time defending champion Oilers were nearly unbeatable against Calgary, losing just five of 31 matchups over three years. Calgary's frustration against Edmonton was highlighted by a mid-season game where, after a large brawl that resulted in the ejection of five players from the game, Calgary's Doug Risebrough ended up in the penalty box with Marty McSorley's Oilers jersey. [...] Risebrough shredded the jersey with his skates before tossing it back onto the ice. [...] Oilers' coach Glen Sather, enraged by the act, called Risebrough [...] "childish" [...] and threatened to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> $1000 bill to replace the sweater.|$|E

Cartwright called him, and left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine. Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to <b>send</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes.
