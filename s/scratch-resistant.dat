25|$|Synthetic {{sapphire}}, or sapphire glass, or {{blue glass}} (as sapphires are blue in color) is both highly transparent to wavelengths of light between 150nm (UV) and 5500nm (IR) (the visible spectrum extends about 380nm to 750nm), and extraordinarily <b>scratch-resistant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of applications, it will not shatter. Rather, it breaks into large dull pieces. Since PMMA is softer and more easily scratched than glass, <b>scratch-resistant</b> coatings are often added to PMMA sheets to protect it (as well as possible other functions).|$|E
25|$|It has a {{clamshell}} design, {{featuring a}} small 1.1” <b>scratch-resistant,</b> monochromatic OLED external screen (128 × 36 pixel) that’s {{built into the}} phone’s casing. The main screen is a 2.2” 240 × 320 pixel, 262k colour TFT. It comes in three colours; Mysterious Black, Spring Rose and Lucid Blue.|$|E
25|$|The C651 {{trains are}} the second {{generation}} of train cars used on the SMRT network. It had ordered $259million for the C651 cars. They were bought mainly to complement the existing C151 trains due {{to the opening of}} the Woodlands extension. These trains began revenue service in 1994 as the first train-set rolled out of Singapore plant to increase capacity on 17 July 1994 and delivered to SMRT on 20 September 1994. Unlike its older counterparts, the C651s are painted with a <b>scratch-resistant</b> acrylic finish due to dirt trapping on the aluminum skin of the C151 trains that were difficult to remove.|$|E
25|$|Creative's first flash-based {{portable}} {{media player}} {{was released on}} June 20, 2006. The <b>scratch-resistant</b> models have an OLED display with a resolution of 128×128. They come in white and black with orange trim for the 1GB version, green trim for 2GB, and black with blue trim for the 4GB version and later an 8GB version. The ZEN V Plus plays video and has an FM tuner, while the ZEN V does not. The players support the same formats as the Vision:M, while the videos will be trans coded upon transfer. There are also built-in microphones for voice recording, as well as wires for line-in recording. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a life span of up to 15 hours of continuous audio playback.|$|E
500|$|It is [...] high, [...] wide, and [...] deep, {{compared}} to the iPhone 3GS, which is [...] high, [...] wide, and [...] deep; making the iPhone 4 and 4S 21.5% thinner than the 3GS. The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass, described by Apple as being [...] "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," [...] theoretically allowing it to be more <b>scratch-resistant</b> and durable than the prior models.|$|E
500|$|The iPad's (first two generations) {{touchscreen}} {{display is}} a 1024 by 768 pixel, [...] liquid-crystal display (diagonal [...] ), with fingerprint- and <b>scratch-resistant</b> glass. Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be [...] "too small {{to express the}} software" [...] and that 10inches was the minimum for a tablet screen. Like the iPhone, the iPad {{is designed to be}} controlled by bare fingers; normal, non-conductive gloves and styli do not work, although there are special gloves and capacitive styli designed for this use.|$|E
500|$|The iPad's {{touchscreen}} {{display is}} a 1,024 by 768 pixel, [...] {{liquid crystal display}} (diagonal [...] ), with fingerprint- and <b>scratch-resistant</b> glass. As {{a result of the}} device's screen dimensions and resolution, the screen has a pixel density of 132ppi. The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense the iPad's orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic [...] "native" [...] orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.|$|E

2500|$|On September 25, 2006, Apple updated the Nano line. The second-generation Nano {{featured}} <b>scratch-resistant,</b> anodized aluminum casing {{like the}} earlier Mini's design; the multiple color choices mirrored {{those of the}} Mini as well. However, unlike the second-generation Mini, the button labels were grey instead of matching the Nano's casing (except for the black Nano, which had a black click wheel). The second-generation Nano featured a 40% brighter, [...] "more vibrant" [...] display, a battery life upgrade (from 14 to 24 hours), and storage sizes doubled to 2, 4, and 8 GB models. The second generation also introduced gapless playback of audio files, along with a new search option.|$|E

50|$|Gorilla Glass 3 was {{introduced}} at CES 2013. According to Corning, {{the material is}} up to three times more <b>scratch-resistant</b> than the previous version, with enhanced ability to resist deep scratches that typically weaken glass. The promotional material for Gorilla Glass 3 claims that it is 40% more <b>scratch-resistant,</b> {{in addition to being}} more flexible. The design of Gorilla Glass 3 was Corning's first use of atomic-scale modeling before the material was melted in laboratories, with the prediction of the optimal composition obtained through the application of rigidity theory.|$|E

50|$|While Blu-ray {{mandates}} {{the use of}} a <b>scratch-resistant</b> coating, it {{does not}} specify what coating is used, and both Sony and Panasonic have their own independent hard coating technologies that are primarily in use on Blu-ray pre-recorded discs.|$|E
50|$|Sapphire cuvettes are {{the most}} expensive, though provide the most durable, <b>scratch-resistant,</b> and {{transmissible}} material. The transmission extends from UV light to mid-infrared, ranging from 250 to 5,000 nm. Sapphire withstands extreme natural condition of sample solutions and variances in temperature.|$|E
50|$|The Verneuil process {{allows the}} {{production}} of flawless single-crystal sapphires, rubies and other corundum gems of much larger size than normally found in nature. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and hydrothermal synthesis. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals have become available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental uses, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts), <b>scratch-resistant</b> optics, <b>scratch-resistant</b> watch crystals, instrument windows for satellites and spacecraft (because of its transparency in the ultraviolet to infrared range), and laser components.|$|E
