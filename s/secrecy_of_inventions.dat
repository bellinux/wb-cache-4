40|$|Trade secrets {{offer an}} {{alternative}} to patent - ineligible innovations and to the problems and perils of protecting, defending and enforcing patents. Although there is currently limited trade secret legislation on the national level, nearly all states have adopted, with little substantive variation, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Unlike patent - eligibility requirements that precluded software in Gottschalk, Diehr, Alice, and Tenon from patent protection, no trade secret is automatically deemed out of scope. Trade secrets encompass anything of value, {{so long as it}} is not generally known and reasonable steps are taken, {{such as the use of}} employment agreements that include confidentiality and non-compete clauses, to preserve the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invention.</b> Moreover, there are active efforts to put into place a more robust federal system of trademark protection, including the Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Trade Secret Protection Act, which both seek to create benchmark standards for civil trade secret misappropriations in federal courts by amending the Economic Espionage Act...|$|R
50|$|As {{the series}} carries on, {{a bit more}} of the plot is {{revealed}} (with the principal Washuu commenting on hazy stuff {{at the end of every}} episode). In subsequent episodes we are introduced to Kamome and Tsubame (who start off as an unknown enemy to the four girls until she is cured of her evil finally helps them). It is also revealed that Washuu is the founder of a Celtic organization called Rosenkreuz (Rose Cross in German) and he himself is Christian Rosenkreuz, hiding under the name of Washuu Ryuugasaki to carry out his agenda. He once worked for the famous alchemist Paracelsus and collaborated with a French man, Cigogne Raspailles, and a young American man, Crane Banschteig to invent a device that can grant immortality (Divas). However, due to their <b>secrecy,</b> none <b>of</b> their <b>inventions</b> is revealed to the world. After Crane discovers that inventions made by the world lead to World Wars and the implications of Divas falling into the hands of warmongers, he finally ran off to space in his invented space rocket, together with all the plans on the immortality project.|$|R

This report considers the problem of secret communication between two nodes, over a fading wireless medium, {{in the presence of}} a passive eavesdropper. The assumption used is that the transmitter and its helpers (amplifying relays) have more antennas than the eavesdropper. The transmitter ensures <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> communication by utilizing some of the available power to produce ‘artificial noise’, such that only the eavesdropper’s channel is degraded. Two scenarios are considered, one where the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas, and the other where amplifying relays simulate the effect of multiple antennas. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be publicly known, and hence, the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> communication is independent <b>of</b> the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> CSI...|$|R
