5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>conducted</b> only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all redhead and royal tern records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>conducted</b> of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E

5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>conducted.</b> Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E
5|$|A second county {{bill was}} passed by the 1903 {{legislature}} and approved by Governor Dole, forming Maui County and four other counties on the main Hawaiian Islands. The first local territorial elections for the county boards of Maui and the other counties were held on November3. In this election, White ran as the Home Rule candidate for Sheriff of Maui County and defeated the Republican candidate Lincoln M. Baldwin, who had held the previously appointed position of sheriff. The Home Rule Party ended up dominating in the local elections on Maui. Shortly after his election, White and David Haili Kahaulelio, the elected county clerk for Maui, wrote to Dole's successor, Governor George R. Carter, asking him to assemble a conference where the newly elected county officials across the territory could discuss how the county governments <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>conducted.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>conducted</b> once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>conducted</b> in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
