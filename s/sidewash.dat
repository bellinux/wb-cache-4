40|$|Investigation of the {{downwash}} field {{behind a}} wing with an {{angle of attack}} discontinuity at supersonic speeds by use of linearized conical flow theory has shown the downwash to be of finite magnitude at all points in and behind {{the plane of the}} wing. The downwash at more than five chord lengths behind the wing was found to asymptotically approach the value of downwash calculated in the Trefftz plane. Behind the wing and within the span that is determined by the intersection of the Mach cones from the leading edge with the trailing edge, an unexplicable action of the downwash was found to exist. It was found that at the trailing edge the downwash was a 100 percent of that on the wing surface. At two chord lengths, the downwash was 83 percent. Upon moving aft, {{it was found that the}} downwash increased in magnitude and that at 10 chord lengths, it asymptotically approached the value at the Trefftz plane, namely 100 percent again. By considering an idealized missile configuration, it was found that roll reversal was possible. The possibility of reversal was found to be almost entirely dependent upon the location of the control lifting surfaces with respect to one another.

Pitot- and static-pressure surveys covering a region of flow behind the wing have been made together with detailed pitot surveys throughout the region of the wake. In addition, the flow direction has been measured using a weathercocking vane measurements. Theoretical calculations of the variation of both downwash and <b>sidewash</b> with angle of attack using Lagerstrom's superposition method have been made.

Near an angle of attack of 0, agreement between theory and experiment is good, particularly for the downwash results, except in the plane of the wing, inboard of the tip. In this region the proximity of the shed vortex sheet and the departure of the spanwise distribution of vorticity from theory would account for the disagreement. At higher angles of attack prediction of downwash depends on a knowledge of the location of the trailing vortex sheet, in order that the downwash may be corrected for its displacement and distortion. The theoretical location of the trailing vortex sheet, based on the theoretical downwash values integrated downstream from the wing trailing edge, is shown to differ widely from the experimental case. The rolling-up of the trailing vortex sheet behind the wing tip is evidenced by both the wake surveys and the flow-angle measurements...|$|E

Quite obviously, the windward faces are subjected to positive pressure coefficients because of the undeviating wind force. Because of frictional flow separation and generation of vortices, the leeward faces are exposed to suction. Flow separation characteristics and vortices are quite apparent from the streamlines. The pressure force on the windward side and suction force on the leeward side in combination produce vortices in the wake region, causing the deflection of the body. There may be occurrence of suction even on the windward faces because of the separation of flow in structures with limbs and also due to uplift, <b>sidewash</b> and backwash of wind.|$|E

The whole upwash-sidewaeh field, an infinite distance downstream of the control surface, (in the Trefftz plane), is also calculated. It is shown that a rolling moment is induced on any aerodynamic surface - vertical, horizontal, or oblique - that lies {{in the wake of the}} deflected control surface. This induced rolling moment is in the reverse direction of that prescribed by the deflection of the roll control surface. One simple case is cited where the magnitude of the induced rolling moment is larger than that produced directly by the roll control surface, thus causing a reversal of the roll direction.

The flow visualization tests were conducted in the Northrop water tunnel using a 1 / 72 scale model of the F- 14 with a wing leading-edge sweep of 20 deg. Flow visualization photographs were obtained for angles of attack up to 55 deg and sideslip angles up to 10 deg. The F- 14 model was investigated to determine the vortex flow field development, vortex path, and vortex breakdown characteristics as a function of angle of attack and sideslip. Vortex flows were found to develop on the highly swept glove and on the upper surface of the forebody. At 10 deg of sideslip, the windward glove vortex shifted inboard and broke down farther forward than the leeward glove vortex. This asymmetric breakdown of the vortices in sideslip contributes to a reduction in the lateral stability above 20 deg angle of attack. The initial loss of directional stability is a consequence of the adverse <b>sidewash</b> from the windward vortex and the reduced dynamic pressure at the vertical tails...|$|E

A specialization of this formulation is made to the case where the resultant perturbation consists of semi-infinite flat plates of slightly different incidence to the freestream. The flow over such a shape is divided into an outlying uniform region and a central conefield. Here, the outlying, uniform region solution is found to be trivial. The determination of the conefield gives rise to an elliptic boundary value problem which is solved with the aid of the Tschaplygin transformation and other conformal mappings. Calculations are presented using the Fourier series solution for the perturbation pressure indicating the surface loads associated with the perturbation as well as the shock distortion function. Integral representations are obtained for the downwash and <b>sidewash</b> perturbations using the pressure solution. The results are compared qualitatively with an analogous linear supersonic flow.
