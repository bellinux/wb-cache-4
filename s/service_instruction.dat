500|$|Along {{with several}} other {{graduates}} of the Aviation Section's winter 1916 [...] "Field Officers Course", Dodd was given a temporary wartime promotion to colonel and {{under the command of}} General William L.

Kenly proved to be only an interim commander, though, and on 27 November 1917 he was replaced by Brig. Gen. Benjamin Foulois who arrived in France with a large but untrained staff of non-aviators. This resulted in considerable resentment from Mitchell's smaller, established, staff, many of whom, including Bolling and Dodd, were immediately displaced. Dodd, Bolling, and Mitchell resented their being replaced by non-aviators and after leaving the theater of operations all continued to further the Air Service in their own ways.|$|E

50|$|Documentation of {{the process}} begins with DoDDir 5160.62 that, in {{addition}} to designating SECNAV as Single Manager, directs the appointment by the Navy of an Executive Manager with broad authority to manage the program. It also establishes a Program Board, constituted of flag/general officers from the four Services, to assist the Executive Manager and represent their Services. In addition, the directive establishes a Joint Service Military Technical Acceptance Board (MTAB), which must approve all EOD tools, equipment, procedures, and publications developed by the Navy, prior to their use by the Joint Services. DoDDir 5160.62 (1989), which has recently been revised by the Joint Services {{and is in the}} OSD approval process, is implemented by SECNAVINST 5410.116B and by a Joint <b>Service</b> <b>instruction</b> (OPNAVINST 8027.1G, MCO 8027.1D, AR 75-14, AFR 136-8). In addition to the DoD directive and Service implementing instructions, the Program Board issues detailed program guidance by Policy Agreements (PAs). The Program Board meets three to four times each year, or as otherwise required. Each Service maintains a Detachment at the NAVEODnaveodtechdiv to provide Service participation in all {{of the process}}es. The OICs of the Detachments constitute the MTAB, and Detachment personnel form two sub-groups of the MTAB, responsible for recommendations to the MTAB relative to approval of tools/equipment and procedures. These personnel interact daily with NAVEODTECHDIV personnel in R&D and procedures development.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} six ideas {{relating to}} the work of the Cooperative Extension Service are presented: (1) Giving instruction is the Service's major function; (2) Tyler's curriculum and instruction principles are a good guide in developing the instructional function of the organization; (3) Instruction is the principle tool used in influencing behavior of other Extension personnel; (4) <b>Service</b> <b>instruction</b> principles are applicable {{to the work of}} all personnel who instruct their clientele; (5) Instruction is conducted to influence overt behavior of clientele; and (6) Service personnel need breadth and depth of training. Chapter I presents the legal base for declaring instruction to be the Service's primary function. Chapter II presents a concept of Extension objectives. Chapter III outlines a procedure for selecting objectives. Chapter IV presents some of the learning experiences used by the Extension. Chapter V presents criteria for organizing learning experiences for effective instruction. Chapter VI is a discussion of necessary materials and services which must be available to clientele for success in instruction. Chapters VII, VIII, and IX are devoted to evaluation, organization, and application of the theoretical concept, respectively.

40|$|Higher {{education}} is a labor-intensive industry whose primary <b>service,</b> <b>instruction,</b> is delivered by a lecturer, accompanied by administrative support and various other services. Growing student enrollment necessitates some additional staffing; however, {{one would think that}} the recent and ongoing technological boom would have lessened the labor burden at colleges, but a close examination of the data suggests otherwise. In fact, the data reveals that colleges have generally increased their staff relative to enrollment and the number of degrees awarded, especially in the back office. One problem, critics claim, is that an onerous regulatory environment has been established that requires a myriad of regulations and reporting requirements, which are often unnecessary and redundant in nature. In order to comply with the government's requirements, colleges need to employ a staff that is responsible for providing the multiple state and federal agencies with compliance reports and data. This may be one piece of the puzzle, but it certainly does not tell the complete story of the burgeoning administrative staffs in higher education. This report will analyze employment trends and labor productivity at institutions of higher education over the past twenty years. What I find is that colleges have altered the composition of their work force by steadily increasing the number of managerial positions and support/service staff, {{while at the same time}} disproportionately increasing the number of part-time staff that provides instruction. Meanwhile, employee productivity relative to enrollment and degrees awarded has been relatively flat in the midst of rising compensation...|$|E
