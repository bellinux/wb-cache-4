5|$|A typical {{hyperbaric}} oxygen treatment <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> the US Navy Table 6, {{which provides}} for a standard treatment of 3 to 5 periods of 20 minutes of oxygen breathing at 60fsw (18msw) followed by 2 to 4 periods of 60 minutes at 30fsw (9msw) before surfacing. Air breaks are taken between oxygen breathing {{to reduce the risk}} of oxygen toxicity.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> {{a specified}} ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E

5|$|Trains {{originally}} ran until 01:00, but {{following the}} privatisation {{of the service}} through concession to Metrovías, the company temporarily moved the closing time back two hours in 1994 to carry out works on the lines, a change which was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions {{as well as a}} campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 on weekdays and 3:00 on Fridays and Saturdays. These proposals have been rejected by Subterráneos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E

40|$|Six pigeons {{were trained}} on {{concurrent}} variable-interval schedules in which responding on fixed-interval <b>schedules</b> <b>was</b> {{required to give}} access to the alternate schedule. Responding on the concurrent <b>schedules</b> <b>was</b> not allowed, after changing over had commenced, until the changeover <b>schedule</b> had <b>been</b> completed. In Parts 1 to 3 of the experiment, the changeover fixed-interval <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> equal and were 0 s, 10 s, and 20 s, respectively. In each part, the relative frequency of reinforcement obtained on the concurrent <b>schedules</b> <b>was</b> varied over at least five conditions. In Part 4, the concurrent <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> equal, and one changeover fixed-interval <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> twice the other. Under these conditions, the absolute sizes of the changeover <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> varied. Increasing the changeover requirement from 0 s to 10 s (Parts 1 and 2) resulted in increases in the sensitivity of behavior allocation to reinforcers obtained, but no further increase was obtained when the changeover <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> increased to 20 s (Part 3). In Part 4, performance was biased towards the concurrent schedule that took less time to enter. These {{results are consistent with}} a subtractive punishment model of travel in which the degree of punishment is measured by the number of reinforcers apparently lost from a schedule when the subject changes to that schedule. Absolute times spent on the main keys could be accurately described by a previous model of changeover performance...|$|R

40|$|Five pigeons {{were trained}} under concurrent-chain {{schedules}} {{in which a}} pair of independent, concurrent variable-interval 60 -s <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> presented in the initial link and either both variable-interval or both fixed-interval <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> presented in the terminal link. Except for the baseline, one of the terminal-link <b>schedules</b> <b>was</b> always a two-component chained schedule {{and the other was}} either a simple or a tandem schedule of equal mean interreinforcement interval. The values of the fixed-interval <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> either 15 s or 60 s; that of the variable-interval <b>schedules</b> <b>was</b> always 60 s. A 1. 5 -s changeover delay operated during the initial link in some conditions. The pigeons preferred a simple or a tandem schedule to a chain. For the fixed-interval <b>schedules,</b> this preference <b>was</b> greater when the fixed interval was 60 s than when it was 15 s. For the variable-interval <b>schedules,</b> the preferences <b>were</b> less pronounced and occurred only when the changeover delay was in effect. For a given type of schedule and interreinforcement interval, similar preferences were obtained whether the nonchained <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> a tandem or simple schedule. The changeover delay generally inflated preference and lowered the changeover rate, especially when the terminal-link <b>schedules</b> <b>were</b> either short (15 s) or aperiodic (variable-interval). The results were consistent with the notion that segmenting the interreinforcement interval of a schedule into a chain lowers the preference for it...|$|R
