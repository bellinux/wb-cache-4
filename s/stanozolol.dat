5|$|According to a Sports Illustrated article rotated on August 30, 2007, Copeland {{was named}} one of ten wrestlers found to have {{purchased}} steroids and other drugs from an online pharmacy, {{a violation of the}} WWE Talent Wellness program. Copeland was said to have received somatropin, genotropin, and <b>stanozolol</b> between September 2004 and February 2007.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006 {{the book}} Game of Shadows, written by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, was {{released}} amid {{a storm of}} media publicity including the cover of Sports Illustrated. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges Bonds used <b>stanozolol</b> {{and a host of}} other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's steroid use.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted {{an article}} on its website {{as part of its}} {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained anastrozole, clomiphene citrate, nandrolone, oxandrolone, <b>stanozolol,</b> and testosterone. WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness program launched in February 2006.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fight}} with McGee, Sylvia tested {{positive}} for the banned substance <b>Stanozolol.</b> He voluntarily forfeited his title and was handed a six-month suspension, and fined $10,000 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). He later commented that the steroid usage was for shedding excess weight. Sylvia apologized and made no effort to claim innocence.|$|E
25|$|During the {{mandatory}} drug testing after the de la Hoya fight, Vargas {{tested positive for}} the banned steroid <b>stanozolol</b> better known as Winstrol. Vargas said the steroids were given to him without his knowledge, but he accepted full responsibility. The Nevada Athletic Commission announced on November 20 of 2002 that it would fine Vargas $100,000 because of his use of steroids. Fernando Vargas was suspended for nine months.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), <b>stanozolol,</b> and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Olteanu was {{the silver}} medallist at the 1994 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, setting a {{lifetime}} best of 1:09:15. She was victorious at the 1996 European Cross Country Championships but {{was stripped of}} her title as she had failed a test for the steroid <b>stanozolol</b> and received a two-year competitive ban for doping. After her ban had expired, she was again selected for the Romanian cross country and half marathon teams, but failed to medal. She competed in her first marathon in 2002 but retired from international competition in 2003.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{posted on}} its website an article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. This article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Guerrero, who was alleged to have obtained hCG and the steroid <b>stanozolol</b> in early 2005. At the time of the alleged steroid usage, the WWE had not yet instituted its Wellness Policy in which wrestlers are tested for substances, which was stated by WWE.com on the day the article was released.|$|E
25|$|Aside from 5α-reductase, {{aromatase}} may inactivate testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, {{in addition to}} being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and <b>stanozolol</b> are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|E
25|$|Boldenone {{is among}} the {{substances}} banned by Major League Baseball, {{as well as most}} other major athletic organizations. Los Angeles Angels minor league outfielder Reynaldo Ruiz in September 2010 and Philadelphia Phillies minor league pitcher San Lazaro Solano in January 2011 each received a 50-game suspension for the 2011 season as a result of testing positive for a metabolite of boldenone. Jenrry Mejia, formerly of the New York Mets, was suspended in July 2015 when he tested positive for boldenone and <b>stanozolol,</b> and in February 2016 he again tested positive for boldenone; this marked Mejia's third positive test for a performance-enhancing drug, for which he received the first PED-related lifetime ban in MLB history. Abraham Almonte was suspended for 80 games before the 2016 season after testing positive for boldenone.|$|E
25|$|Olteanu {{ended the}} year with her first win at a major {{continental}} competition, taking the {{gold medal at the}} 1996 European Cross Country Championships. However, her performance did not stand as she had failed an out-of-competition drug test in early December, two weeks before the event. She received a four-year ban from competition for her use of <b>stanozolol</b> (a performance-enhancing steroid. Her ban came at a time when numerous Romanian athletes were punished for doping infractions, marking a determined effort by Iolanda Balaş, the president of the Romanian Athletics Federation (FRA), to clean up the national athletics scene. In spite of this, the FRA opted to give Olteanu a two-year ban for her failed test, superseding the longer four-year ban set in place by the International Association of Athletics Federations. She became eligible for competition again in December 1998.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{posted on}} its website an article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Gutierrez who was alleged to have obtained nandrolone and <b>stanozolol.</b> WWE subsequently stated that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in February 2006. On August 27, 2009, WWE announced that Gutierrez would receive a 30-day suspension due to a violation of the wellness program. Days later Gutierrez defended himself in a newspaper interview by explaining the drugs as being on a prescription for his knee and arm. While the Wellness Policy allows for prescribed drugs, Gutierrez further contested he had been on a family holiday and subsequently in Europe promoting SummerSlam, giving him only a day to provide the prescription after being notified. On April 26, 2012, it was announced that Gutierrez would be suspended for 60 days due to a second violation of the WWE Wellness Program.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and <b>stanozolol</b> are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E
500|$|The first Olympic {{athlete to}} test {{positive}} {{for the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.

2500|$|DHT, via its {{metabolite}} 3α-androstanediol (produced by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD)), is a neurosteroid {{that acts}} via positive allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor. Testosterone, via conversion into DHT, also produces 3α-androstanediol as a metabolite and hence has similar activity. Some AAS that are {{or can be}} 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, <b>stanozolol,</b> and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive.Cl− influx and [...] TBPS binding |journal=J.

2500|$|The {{unification}} bout, labeled [...] "Bad Blood," [...] {{finally took}} place on September 14, 2002, at the Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas Strip. The fight was even {{for the first six}} rounds, with Vargas landing punches on the ropes in the odd rounds, while De La Hoya outboxed him in the even rounds. De La Hoya took over the fight in the seventh round and hurt Vargas with a left hook in the tenth. In the next round, De La Hoya knocked Vargas down with a left hook and stopped him moments later. The win is widely considered to be the biggest of De La Hoya's career. Vargas tested positive for <b>stanozolol</b> after the fight.|$|E

Toney joined Bob Fitzsimmons and Roy Jones Jr. as the only former world middleweight champs to go on & win a legit heavyweight title. However, Toney failed his post-fight drug test, testing positive for the anabolic steroid <b>stanozolol.</b> This led to the New York Athletic Commission changing the bout's official outcome to a [...] "no-contest", deducting the win from Toney's career record and banning him from boxing for 90 days. The WBA ordered that Ruiz be reinstated as its champion and that Toney be ineligible for another WBA Heavyweight title shot for two years. Toney defended himself by claiming that the steroids were {{given to him by}} a doctor to treat the arm injury he suffered during the Rydell Booker fight.|$|E
2500|$|On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro was {{suspended}} for ten days after testing positive for a steroid.

According to The New York Times, Palmeiro {{tested positive for the}} potent anabolic steroid <b>stanozolol.</b> In a public statement, Palmeiro disclosed that an appeal of the suspension had already been denied. He released a statement saying, [...] "I have never intentionally used steroids. Never. Ever. Period. Ultimately, although I never intentionally put a banned substance into my body, the independent arbitrator ruled that I had to be suspended {{under the terms of the}} program." [...] According to Palmeiro, all of his previous tests over the two years including the 2003 sealed test were negative, and a test he took just three weeks after his positive test was also negative. The House Government Reform Committee would not seek perjury charges against Palmeiro, although they were not clearing him.|$|E
2500|$|Virilization {{capacity}} can {{be assessed}} by measuring the response to a trial of exogenous androgens; some studies have measured {{the growth of the}} phallus in response to exogenous testosterone [...] or dihydrotestosterone, while others have measured the change in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in response to the artificial androgen <b>stanozolol</b> to assess androgen sensitivity. [...] Some experts have cautioned that it remains to be proved that a good response to exogenous androgens in neonates is a good predictor of androgen response at puberty. [...] If a mutation in the AR gene is found, it is important to determine whether the mutation is inherited or de novo (i.e. a somatic mutation); a certain amount of the wild-type androgen receptor will be present in cases of somatic mutation, which can induce virilization at puberty. [...] A genital skin fibroblast study [...] and a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test [...] may also provide information helpful in the assessment of virilization capacity.|$|E
2500|$|Palmeiro {{returned}} to Camden Yards following his 10-day suspension on August 11, 2005, {{although he did}} not play in the lineup until August 14. Coincidentally, this was the date that had been planned as [...] "Rafael Palmeiro Appreciation Day" [...] in celebration of his 500-home run, 3,000-hit milestone. It was canceled after Palmeiro's suspension. The Baltimore Sun reported that Palmeiro never offered an explanation for his positive test to the MLB arbitration panel, which ran contrary to his public statements. ESPN later reported that Palmeiro implicated Miguel Tejada to baseball's arbitration panel, suggesting a supplement provided to him by Tejada was responsible for his positive test. This supplement was supposedly vitamin B12, though it could have been tainted. Tejada and two unnamed teammates provided B12 samples to the panel, which did not contain <b>stanozolol.</b> However, the committee did say they found [...] "substantial inconsistencies between Mr. Tejada's accounts and the accounts of players A and B." [...] Tejada, who said he received shipments of B12 from the Dominican Republic, was later implicated for steroid use in the Mitchell Report.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} cases of doping at the Olympics, and in sport as a whole, occurred during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Ben Johnson entered the race as the reigning 100 metres world record holder and won the Olympic final, raising his arm in victory, in a new world record of 9.79 seconds to much fanfare. Soon after being awarded the gold medal the results of his post-race drug test revealed his urine contained traces of <b>stanozolol</b> (a banned steroid). Johnson later admitted to doping, but he and his coach Charlie Francis still claimed he had his drink spiked at the Olympics, as Johnson was taking a different type of steroid at the time. The positive test had long-lasting effects on public perception of the sport and advanced the case for more stringent drug testing. The Canadian government launched an investigation into drugs in sport, known as the Dubin Inquiry, the following year. The 1988 Olympic men's 100 metres final has been referred to as [...] "the dirtiest race in history", as only two of the eight finalists remained free of doping issues during their careers.|$|E
