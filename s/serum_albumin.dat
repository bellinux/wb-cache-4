5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Imipramine {{hydrochloride}} (IMP) is a cationic amphiphilic molecule {{belonging to}} the antidepressant category of drugs. Here we report the interaction of IMP with <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> (i. e., human (HSA) and bovine (BSA)) using various biophysical methods. Absorption spectroscopy provides qualitative information about the interaction and complex formation between IMP and <b>serum</b> <b>albumins.</b> The binding parameters and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters have been estimated by fluorescence quenching method. The results revealed that hydrophobic forces were the predominant intermolecular forces between <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> and IMP. The quenching rate constant (kq) values decrease with increase in temperature which indicates a staticquenching procedure. At very low concentrations of drug, the conformational changes in HSA/BSA due to interaction were investigated by circular dichroism (CD). For different molar ratios of protein and drug, the far-UV CD spectra showed an increase in �-helicity of <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> with the increment in �-helical structural content being slightly higher for IMP-BSA complex...|$|R

40|$|Quaternary amine of diethylaminoethyl {{rosin ester}} (QRMAE), {{chemically}} synthesized biocompatible rosin based cationic surfactant, has various biological applications including its {{use as a}} food product additive. In this study, we examined the amorphous aggregation behavior of mammalian <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> at pH 7. 5, i. e., two units above their isoelectric points (pI ~ 5. 5), and the roles played by positive charge and hydrophobicity of exogenously added rosin surfactant QRMAE. The study was carried out on five mammalian <b>serum</b> <b>albumins,</b> using various spectroscopic methods, dye binding assay, circular dichroism and electron microscopy. The thermodynamics of the binding of mammalian <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> to cationic rosin modified surfactant were established using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). It was observed that a suitable molar ratio of protein to QRMAE surfactant enthusiastically induces amorphous aggregate formation at a pH above two units of pI. Rosin surfactant QRMAE-albumins interactions revealed a unique interplay between the initial electrostatic and the subsequent hydrophobic interactions that {{play an important role}} towards the formation of hydrophobic interactions-driven amorphous aggregate. Amorphous aggregation of proteins is associated with varying diseases, from the formation of protein wine haze to the expansion of the eye lenses in cataract, during the expression and purification of recombinant proteins.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of amaranth with two homologous <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> from human and bovine (HSA and BSA) was studied by microcalorimetry. The binding stoichiometry for the complexation of amaranth to both BSA and HSA was around 1, and the equilibrium constants were (5. 79 ± 0. 07) × 105 and (1. 76 ± 0. 05) × 105 M− 1, respectively. The binding reaction to HSA at 298. 15 K {{was driven by}} a large negative enthalpic contribution and a small but positive entropic contribution, while to BSA, it was entirely enthalpy-driven and the entropic contribution was unfavorable. Parsing of the standard molar Gibbs energy revealed that the complexation was dominated by non-polyelectrolytic forces. Temperature-dependent isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed that the enthalpic contribution increased and the entropic contribution decreased with {{the rise in the}} temperature but the Gibbs energy change remained almost unaltered.

The complexes were characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic techniques and the crystal structures of complexes 2, 3 and 5 were determined by X-ray crystallography. The ability of the complexes to scavenge 1, 1 -diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl, 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) and hydroxyl radicals and to inhibit soybean lipoxygenase was studied and the complexes were more active than free Hdifl. The interaction of the complexes with <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> was monitored by fluorescence emission spectroscopy and the corresponding binding constants were calculated. UV-vis spectroscopy, viscosity measurements and fluorescence emission spectroscopy for the competitive studies of the complexes with ethidium bromide were employed to investigate the interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus DNA and revealed intercalation as the most possible DNA-binding mode. Computational techniques were used to identify possible binding sites of albumins and DNA, and determine the druggability of human and bovine <b>serum</b> <b>albumins</b> with the five novel complexes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{have already}} {{reported}} that A 1 C is elevated because of iron deficiency in late pregnancy among nondiabetic pregnant women. This report examined whether {{the same phenomenon}} is observed in pregnant women with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This longitudinal {{study was conducted in}} 17 pregnant women with diabetes (20 – 35 weeks of pregnancy). A 1 C, <b>serum</b> glycated <b>albumin,</b> erythrocyte indexes, and iron metabolism indexes were measured. RESULTS — A 1 C levels were significantly increased in late pregnancy, whereas <b>serum</b> glycated <b>albumin</b> showed no significant changes. Glycated albumin/A 1 C ratio, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, serum transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin were significantly decreased in late pregnancy. Serum transferrin saturation showed a significant positive correlation with glycated albumin/A 1 C ratio. CONCLUSIONS — A 1 C levels, but not <b>serum</b> glycated <b>albumin</b> levels, are elevated in late pregnancy because of iron deficiency in diabetic women. <b>Serum</b> glycated <b>albumin</b> may offer an adequate marker for glycemic control during pregnancy.

40|$|Zinc {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} micronutrients for virtually all living organisms, and hence, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms for its homeostasis. Besides proteins involved in transmembrane transport, both extra- and intracellular zinc-binding proteins play important roles in the respective metabolic networks. Important examples for extracellular zinc transporters are mammalian <b>serum</b> <b>albumins,</b> and for intracellular zinc handling, certain metallothioneins are of relevance. The availability of protein structures including relevant metal binding sites is a fundamental prerequisite to decipher the mechanisms that govern zinc binding dynamics in these proteins, but their determination can prove to be surprisingly challenging. Due to the spectroscopic silence of Zn 2 +, combinations of biophysical techniques including electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and multinuclear NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling have proven to be valuable approaches to understand not only the zinc-binding properties of metallothioneins and albumins, but also the influence of other physiologically relevant competing agents. These studies have demonstrated why the bacterial metallothionein SmtA contains a site inert towards exchange with Cd 2 +, why the plant metallothionein EC from wheat is partially unfolded in the presence of Cd 2 +, and how fatty acids impact on the zinc-binding ability of mammalian <b>serum</b> <b>albumins...</b>|$|R
