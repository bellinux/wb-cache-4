This paper develops a simplified and experimentally tractable version of Andersson and Krebs‟ (1978) classical model of caching behavior. This study presents three experiments using captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) that test {{the predictions of}} this model. These experiments explore the effects of three theoretically important variables: <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> (denoted by Ta), handling time (h), and the background foraging rate (). Experiment 1 tests the predicted effect of <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> and shows that blue jays cached more food items when <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> was short. Experiment 2 examines the interaction between <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> and handling time. Experiment 2 shows a significant effect of handling time (jays cache more when handling times are short), but no effect of <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> (apparently contradicting experiment 1). Experiment 3 considers the predicted interaction between handling time and habitat richness (as represented by the background foraging rate). This experiment shows significant effects of both handling time and background, but no interaction between the two variables. The implications of these experiments for the further development of our model are discussed...|$|R

50|$|For {{immigrant}} visa allocation, the Form I-140 petition must {{be approved}} and the priority date assigned to that petition must be before the cutoff date (which depends on the country of chargeability and the visa category). Since the cutoff date and the processing time for Form I-140 petitions are independent, the wait time for Form I-140 to be processed is the later of the visa number <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> (the cutoff date) and the Form I-140 processing time. Therefore, Premium Processing can expedite the overall process of obtaining lawful permanent resident status when the Form I-140 processing time is longer than the visa number <b>availability</b> <b>time.</b> In other words, {{if there is no}} visa number <b>availability</b> wait <b>time,</b> either because the category is uncapped or the caps are nowhere near being met, then Premium Processing is advantageous. On the other hand, for a visa category with a country of chargeability where the current cutoff date is far in the past (i.e. there is a long queue), Premium Processing would not expedite the overall process because the cutoff date overwhelms even the standard processing time.|$|R

40|$|Healing {{following}} replantation of avulsed teeth {{is dependent}} upon short unphysiologic periods during the extraalveolar phase. A commercially available tooth rescue box was developed and distributed at schools in Hessen, a state in Germany. Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the <b>availability</b> <b>times</b> of rescue boxes and the storage periods of rescued teeth within the boxes. Two thousand one hundred tooth rescue boxes together with a questionnaire were distributed predominantly at schools. In case of usage of a box, the questionnaire should be filled out by patients and dentists and sent back for evaluation. One hundred seventy-two (8. 2 %) questionnaires were sent back. Eighteen questionnaires were incomplete. In the remaining 154 tooth rescue boxes, a total of 201 avulsed teeth and tooth crown fragments were rescued. When accidents occurred near a stored rescue box, the <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> was short (median: 5 min). It was significantly longer (median: 35 min) when the location of the accident was distant to a stored box. Storage of avulsed teeth in the tooth rescue box was longer (median: 2 h) than storage of fractured crown fragments (median: 1 h). Lay people (teachers, pupils) used the rescue boxes correctly without professional help or even advice through telephone. The usage of the tooth rescue box seemed to be self-explanatory and plausible to lay persons, very short <b>availability</b> <b>times</b> resulted when accidents occurred near stored boxes. Thus, an excellent healing prognosis can be anticipated after replantation. The storage periods of avulsed teeth before the commencement of treatment exceed by far the periods that are acceptable for alternative but unphysiologic media (saline, saliva, milk). It is concluded that tooth rescue boxes should be distributed at locations prone to tooth traumas (schools, kindergartens, sporting facilities, public pools) to enhance the prognosis of avulsed teeth. Emergency units (hospitals, ambulances) should be equipped with tooth rescboxes as well as every dentist. Tooth rescue boxes are recommended for families with children...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} evaluation of two linear algorithms for forecasting reception power for different channels at an assigned spectrum band of global systems for mobile communications (GSM), in order to analyze the spatial opportunity for reuse of frequencies by secondary users (SUs) in a cognitive radio (CR) network. The algorithms employed correspond to seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), which allow for a forecast of channel occupancy status. Results are evaluated using the following criteria: <b>availability</b> and occupancy <b>time</b> for channels, different types of mean absolute error, and observation time. The contributions of this work include a more integral forecast as the algorithm not only forecasts reception power but also the occupancy and <b>availability</b> <b>time</b> of a channel to determine its precision percentage during the use by primary users (PUs) and SUs within a CR system.
