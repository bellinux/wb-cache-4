40|$|The {{workplace}} exposure during welding {{of stainless}} CrNisteel and zinc coated steel with Nd:YAG- and C 02 -lasers {{was investigated in}} a closed work region. The suction concept was changed from global suction via the work table towards local with use of a <b>suction</b> <b>hood</b> or a specially designed nozzle at the laser head. Additionally, the ventilation conditions of the closed work region are changed. The differences of measured durst concentrations show the efficiency of each condition. The results will serve as recommendations for the users of laser processing systems in industry...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Pest {{control in}} organic {{production}} of berries, potatoes and vegetables usually employs spreading technique of registered phytopharmaceutical agents. This technique may be supported or even replaced by pneumatic pest control. Up to {{now there is}} no evaluation of pneumatic pest control available from agricultural engineering point of view. This paper concerns the following questions: Which techniques of pneumatic pest control are available and how may these techniques be improved in terms of technical and physical parameters? Hypothesis: Analysis of pneumatic pest control techniques supports improvement of present available implements. Method: Literature review, process analysis, and evaluation in respect of agricultural engineering parameters (air flow rate, air speed, working hours, energy input, process costs). Results: Success of pneumatic pest control varies in a wide range, and the technique does not always grant satisfying results. Collection of eggs and larvae is more difficult than collection of adult insects. Usually weekly treatment is necessary. Frequent treatments may cause soil compaction. Pneumatic pest control may distribute fungal infection. Beneficial organisms may suffer from pneumatic techniques. Investment costs of pneumatic implements are high (ca. 5000 - 12000 €/row). Simultaneously blowing and sucking hoods work better than common suction hoods. Both the interrelationship and the control of physical parameters is almost not subject of research. An analysis of physical parameters and their interrelationships reveals that airflow rate, working width, and travel speed can be comprised within the term air requirement L=te*V where: te is the effective working time and V the airflow rate. The air requirement correlates with the success of the treatment and is an objective evaluation criterion for the implement and its pneumatic efficiency. The latter may be improved by the following measures: 1) High travel speed prevents pests from escaping the <b>suction</b> <b>hood.</b> 2) Pests sitting upon the plant should start to fly before suction. This may be achieved pneumatically by blowing nozzles and/or mechanically by chains, brushes or similar devices. 3) A <b>suction</b> <b>hood</b> stretched in direction of travel may prolong the duration of pneumatic treatment to ensure successful control. To minimize the tractor power required, the suction airflow velocity under the <b>suction</b> <b>hood</b> should be as low as possible. However, the suction airflow velocity must always be greater than the flying speed of the pest. Low airflow velocity may also contribute to go easy on useful insects.

40|$|Abstract—Public {{awareness}} towards {{green energy}} {{are on the}} rise and this can be prove by many product being manufactured or pre-required to be made as energy saving devices mainly to save consumer from spending more on utility billing. These schemes are popular nowadays and many homemade appliances are turned into energy saving gadget which attracts the attention of consumers. Knowing the public demands and pattern towards purchasing home appliances thus the idea of “energy saving <b>suction</b> <b>hood</b> (ESSH) ” is proposed. The ESSH can be used in many places that require smoke ventilation or even to reduce the room temperature as many conventional suction hoods (CSH) do, but this device works automatically by the usage of sensors that detects the smoke/temperature and automatically spins the exhaust fan. As it turns, the mechanical rotation rotates the AC generator which is coupled together with the fan and then charges the battery. The innovation of this product is, it does not rely on the utility supply as it is also hook up with a solar panel which also charges the battery, Secondly, it generates energy as the exhaust fan mechanically rotates. Thirdly, an energy loop back feature is introduced to this system which will supply for the ventilator fan. Another major innovation is towards interfacing this device with an in house production of generator. This generator is produced by proper design on stator as well as rotor to reduce the losses. A comparison is made between the ESSH and the CSH and result shows that the ESSH saves 172. 8 kWh/year of utility supply which is used by CSH. This amount of energy can save RM 3. 14 from monthly utility bill and a total of RM 37. 67 per year. In fact this product can generate 175 Watt of power from generator(75 W) and solar panel(100 W) that can be used either to supply other household appliances and/or to loop back to supply the fans motor. The innovation of this system is essential for future production of other equipment by using the loopback power method and turning most equipment into a standalone system.
