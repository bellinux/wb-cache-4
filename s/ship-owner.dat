5|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S or Braathens SAFE {{was founded}} by <b>ship-owner</b> Ludvig G. Braathen in 1946. It started as a charter airline based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in Norway, flying to {{destinations}} in the Far East and in South America. At first the airline used Douglas DC-4s, and later also Douglas DC-3s. In 1948, the airline moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and started regular scheduled flights to the Far East. In 1952, the airline started cooperation with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir, where until 1960 the two airlines in cooperation flew flights to Reykjavík. Domestic services started in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo to Stavanger via Tønsberg. Braathens SAFE also established at Stavanger Airport, Sola. A second route was started two years later to Trondheim. The Heron routes also stopped in Farsund, Kristiansand, Notodden to Stavanger and Hamar, Røros to Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} <b>ship-owner.</b> In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to large}} oil supply and stagnating demand {{the oil price}} {{significantly}} decreased in 2014, leaving many actors in the offshore industry with {{a hard time finding}} profitability in their business. Among these actors are the many <b>ship-owners</b> who operate so called offshore supply vessels (OSV: s). These vessels are used to supply the offshore installations of the oil companies and assist with services such as anchor handling, tugging and repair & maintenance. The activity of the offshore installations in Norway has, since the oil price collapse, decreased to the extent that many of the vessels owned by Norwegian <b>ship-owners</b> no longer have enough work to cover their operating expenses. <b>Ship-owners</b> have therefore chosen to put vessels in lay-up. A lay-up means that a ship is temporarily taken out of service for a longer period, awaiting increased rates on the market. The thesis has studied the causes behind the laid up OSV-fleet in Norway, which effects the lay-ups have had on the concerned market and what expectations the industry has on the future. The <b>ship-owners</b> and shipbrokers active in the Norwegian offshore industry interviewed for this thesis have given a unanimous view of the current market situation as a supply-and-demand issue. Too many vessels in combination with too many <b>ship-owners</b> have contributed to a very high competition which has led to low rates on the spot market and difficulties finding long-term contracts. Out of the about 600 vessels in the Norwegian OSV-fleet, about 150 have been laid up. The lay-ups have had a positive, but small, effect on the tough situation that the <b>ship-owners</b> are in, but there is a long way left until the market is in balance again. Moreover, bankruptcy and consolidation among <b>ship-owners</b> have occurred and are expected to continue. There are different opinions regarding whether a further increased oil price or not is what is needed for the <b>ship-owners</b> to regain profitability. None the less, there is a common opinion amongst the <b>ship-owners</b> that the oil companies’ activities must increase is the market is to be stabilised...|$|R

From 14 January 1949, Braathens SAFE received a five-year concession {{to operate a}} route from Oslo to various cities in Asia. This forced OSAS to plan its Asia-routes using only Swedish and Danish crew and planes and not operate from Oslo. This was followed by SAS on 26 October, when they opened a DC-6 route to Bangkok with seven intermediate stops. At first there were two round trips per month, but from 1950 this was increased to two per week.|$|E
25|$|HMS Nimrod was a brig-sloop of the British Royal Navy, {{launched}} in 1812. She spent her war years in north American waters where she captured one small privateer, {{assisted in the}} capture of another, and captured or destroyed some 50 American vessels. After the war she captured smuggles and assisted the civil authorities in maintaining order in Tyne. She was wrecked in 1827 and so damaged that the Navy decided she was not worth repairing. A private <b>ship-owner</b> purchased Nimrod and repaired her. She {{then went on to}} spend some 20 years trading between Britain and Charleston, the Mediterranean, Australia, and India. She was last listed in 1851.|$|E

Latouche was rehabilitated under the Directoire and had his rank reinstated in December 1795, but nonetheless was left for five years without a command in the Navy. From 1797 to 1798, he managed equipment for the Navy with a <b>ship-owner</b> friend, and by 1799 he had grown so desperate that he advertised in Le Moniteur Universel for privateer captainships.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the effect that}} ECA-zone regulation has on the optimal vessel fuel strategies for compliance. The findings of this report are trifold, and this report is coupled with a calculation tool which is released to assist <b>ship-owners</b> in the ECA decision making. The first key insight is the substantial impact of the current and future oil price on the optimal compliance strategies <b>ship-owners</b> choose when complying with the new air emission requirements for vessels. The oil price determines the attractiveness of investing in asset modification for compliance, given the capital investment required. Operating on low-Sulphur fuels remains favourable with a low oil price, as the price spread between high- and low-Sulphur does not outweigh the price of asset investments. <b>Ship-owners</b> who are contemplating future compliance strategies should monitor the developments of the global oil price, and consider how much time their operated vessels navigate the ECA in the future...|$|R

[...] The archive of documents contains much information about {{the work of the}} practice and its clients. [...] Many of the clients were businessmen working from nearby offices, who used the practice not only for works on these and similar premises, but also on their domestic properties. [...] These domestic properties included villas and large houses in the affluent suburbs in and around Liverpool, and further afield. [...] The few domestic commissions outside the immediate area came from the firm's bushiness clients or their relatives.

[...] In his older years, Christen Knudsen decided to gradually hand over control of his shipping company to his two sons, Jørgen Christian Knudsen and Gunnar Knudsen. [...] These men would both go on to become successful politicians in addition to their shipping trade. [...] Jørgen Christian Knudsen, who built the house on Øvre Frednes, was the mayor of Porsgrunn in 1893 as well as a long-running Conservative Party representative in Stortinget for Porsgrunn. [...] He was a polarizing figure in both national and local politics—he argued in Stortinget to continue the union between Sweden and Norway and was the only vote in Porsgrunn City Council against the construction of a bridge across the Porsgrunn River, opting for a steam-powered ferry instead. [...] Gunnar Knudsen was a Liberal Party politician who was Prime Minister of Norway from 1908 to 1910 and from 1913 to 1920, and was pivotal in the creation of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate as well as SKK, the precursor to Skagerak Energi. [...] The two men also both had close descendants that worked in politics—Jørgen Christian Knudsen's son, Christen Knudsen, was the Nasjonal Samling representative for Telemark during World War II, and his grandson, Harald Franklin Knudsen, was Vidkun Quisling's private secretary.
