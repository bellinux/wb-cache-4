5000|$|A {{comparative}} effectiveness review of nonoperative and operative treatments for rotator cuff tears was {{performed at the}} University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Center in 2010. The review identified one study which reported that, [...] "Patients receiving early surgery had superior function compared with the delayed surgical group". The review noted {{that the level of}} significance of the study was not reported, and the review chose not to include it as one of their conclusions. Instead it concluded that [...] "The paucity of evidence related to early versus delayed surgery is of particular concern, as patients and providers must decide whether to attempt initial nonoperative management or proceed immediately with surgical repair". In terms of operative techniques, differences in neither cuff integrity nor shoulder function were reported in studies comparing single-row versus double-row <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> fixation and mattress locking versus absorbable sutures. Postoperatively, a slight advantage was evident in patients who performed continuous passive motion alongside physical therapy, as opposed to those who solely performed physical therapy. There is insufficient evidence to adequately compare the effects of operative against nonoperative interventions. Complications were reported very seldom, or were not determined to be clinically significant.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a unique Knotless <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> for soft tissue repair to bone is described. This device allows for soft tissue repair to bone using a <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> {{without the need for}} knot tying. This provides a particular advantage for arthroscopic repairs, where knot tying can be difficult. The Knotless <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> has a short loop of suture secured to {{the tail end of the}} anchor. A channel located at the tip of the anchor functions to capture the loop of suture after it has been passed through the soft tissue. The soft tissue is ten-sioned as the anchor is inserted into bone to the ap-propriate depth. Biomechanical testing demonstrated increased suture strength in the Knotless suture an-chor compared with standard suture anchors. This is because of the doubled-suture configuration that is created with the Knotless <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> loop. To the author’s knowledge, this paper describes the first knot-less <b>suture</b> <b>anchor.</b> A secure, low-profile repair can be created without knot tying. In recent years, suture anchors have become popular for both open and arthroscopic repairs of avulsed ligaments or tendons, most commonly for Bankart and rotator cuff re-pairs. 12, 21 Many surgeons have been reluctant to perform arthroscopic <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repairs, however. A good qual-ity arthroscopic <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair is technically diffi-cult to achieve. Satisfactory knot tying requires signifi-cant practice with special knot-tying devices and unfamiliar knot designs. This process can be difficult to master and time-consuming to perform. Arthroscopically tied knots are bulky and may be inferior to openly tied knots, even in the best of hands. 13 For these reasons, an arthroscopic <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair using standard suture anchors may not, in fact, be consistently as high quality as an open <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair (S. C Weber, unpublished data, 1995 and 1998). This report describes the {{development of}} a Knotles...|$|E

40|$|Background: This prospective, {{randomized}} {{study was}} conducted to compare clinical outcomes of the modified Broström proce-dure using <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> or transosseous suture technique for chronic ankle instability. Methods: Forty patients were followed for more than 2 years after modified Broström procedure. Twenty procedures using a <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> and 20 procedures using a transosseous suture were performed by one surgeon. The clinical evaluation consisted of the Karlsson scale and the Sefton grading system. Talar tilt and anterior talar transla-tion were measured on anterior and varus stress radiographs. Results: The Karlsson scale had improved significantly to 90. 8 points in the <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> group, and to 89. 2 points in the transosseous suture group. According to Sefton grading system, 18 patients (90 %) in <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> group and 17 patients (85 %) in transosseous suture group achieved satisfactory results.

40|$|Background: The fixable <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> {{plate is}} a new device that has been {{designed}} {{with the intention of}} improving anchorage-to-bone strength during tendon-to-bone repair in patients with compromised bone quality. In this in vitro study we compare the load-to-failure and mode-of-failure results of a fixable <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> plate to that of other devices that are commonly used during rotator cuff repair surgery, including: a buttress plate, metal suture anchors, bioabsorbable suture anchors, and suture through simple tunnels without any augmenting device. We hypothesized that the fixable <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> plate would provide higher load-to-failure measurements compared to the other devices. Methods: Each device was implanted into solid rigid polyurethane foam blocks with densities representing varying degrees of osteoporosis, and then tested to failure. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis tests were used to determine statistical significance. Results: The average load to failure for the fixable <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> plate was significantly greater in low and medium density blocks compared to the other devices tested (p≤ 0. 01). The greatest difference in magnitude was seen in low density blocks (5 pcf), where the fixable <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> plate failed at 278 ± 53 N (mean ± standard deviation), about double the value of the next highest failure at 133 ± 11 N for the buttress plate.

40|$|Background: Although {{many studies}} {{involving}} {{rotator cuff repair}} fixation have focused on ultimate fixation strength and ability to restore the tendon’s native footprint, no studies have characterized {{the stability of the}} repair with regard to motion between the tendon and repair site footprint. Hypothesis: <b>Suture</b> <b>anchor</b> fixation for rotator cuff repair has greater interface motion between tendon and bone than does transosseous suture fixation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Twelve fresh-frozen human cadaveric shoulders were tested in a custom device to position the shoulder in internal and external rotations with simulated supraspinatus muscle loading. Tendon motion relative to the insertional footprint on the greater tuberosity was determined optically using a digital camera rigidly connected to the humerus, with the humerus positioned at 60 ° of internal rotation and 60 ° of external rotation. Testing was performed for the intact tendon, a complete supraspinatus tear, a <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair, and a transosseous tunnel repair. Results: Difference in tendon-bone interface motion when compared with the intact tendon was 7. 14 ± 3. 72 mm for the torn rotator cuff condition, 2. 35 ± 1. 26 mm for the <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair, and 0. 02 ± 1. 18 mm for the transosseous suture repair. The transosseous suture repair demonstrated significantly less motion when compared with the torn rotator cuff and <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair conditions (P <. 05). Conclusion: Transosseous suture repair compared with <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair demonstrated superior tendon fixation with reduced motion at the tendon-to-tuberosity interface. Clinical Relevance: Development of new fixation techniques for arthroscopic and open rotator cuff repairs should attempt to minimize interface motion of the tendon relative to the tuberosity...|$|E

Methods: Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were used: 2 as pilots, 4 as the control group, and 18 as the experimental group. These 18 animals underwent sectioning and reinsertion of the Achilles tendon bilaterally, using the technique of trans-osseous suture on 1 side and <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> on the other. All the pelvic limbs that underwent the procedure were then immobilized for 3 weeks. The experimental group was divided into 3 groups that were sacrificed, respectively, 3, 6, and 12 weeks later. The tendon-bone complex was subjected to biomechanical tests to evaluate the parameters of maximum strength, stiffness, and yield strength. Results: There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> group and the trans-osseous suture group, in relation to yield strength (3 weeks, P =. 222; 6 weeks, P =. 465; and 12 weeks, P =. 200) or maximum strength (3 weeks, P =. 222; 6 weeks, P =. 076; and 12 weeks, P =. 078).

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} effect of the {{insertion}} angle and the angle of applied load on the pullout strength of screw-in suture anchors. Methods Screw-in metallic suture anchors were inserted into a 10 –lb/cu ft synthetic cancellous bone block at 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° to the surface. The suture pull angle was then varied in 30 ° increments between 0 ° and 180 °. Five constructs were tested to failure (anchor pullout) for each combination of angles using a Zwick tensile testing machine (Zwick Roell, Ulm, Germany). Results There were a total of 25 combinations. The greatest pullout strength was seen with a <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> inserted at 90 ° to the bone block with a pull angle of 90 ° to the bone (mean, 306 N; standard deviation [SD], 9 N). The weakest pullout strength was seen with a <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> inserted at 30 ° with the angle of pull at 120 ° (i. e., opposite to the direction of insertion of the anchor) (mean, 97 N; SD, 11 N). A simulated deadman's angle of 45 ° with an angle of pull of 150 ° produced a pullout strength of 127 N (SD, 4 N). The pullout strengths for each insertion angle were greatest when the angle of pull was similar to the angle of insertion (P <. 0001, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Conclusions The angle of applied load to a <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> and the insertion angle significantly influence the biomechanical pullout strength of screw-in suture anchors.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{whether there are}} any differences in clinical outcomes and complications between absorbable and nonabsorbable <b>suture</b> <b>anchors</b> {{in the treatment of}} shoulder instability. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of Medline, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Embase, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, from inception of the databases, using various combinations of keywords.

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of clinically successful rotator cuff repairs are left with residual deficiencies in the cuff itself. 8, 9 <b>Suture</b> <b>anchor</b> fixation for rotator cuff repairs has gained popularity in the recent past. Several studies have investigated the biomechanical characteristics of rotator cuff repairs {{in an effort to}} identify possible sites of failure. These sites have included failure via suture cutting through bone tunnels, suture breakage, knot slippage, <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> pullout, and soft tissue failure at the suture-tendon junction.

Advantages of bioabsorbable suture anchors include lack of interference in magnetic resonance imaging, resorption of anchor, replacement by bone, and no need for hardware removal. However, complications of these bioabsorbable implants include inflammatory response to the material use. We present what we believe to be the first case {{in the hand}} of a poly(l-lactide-co-d,l-lacitide) <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> causing an inflammatory response leading to significant osteolysis 4  months postoperatively after repair of a ring finger flexor digitorum profundus avulsion.

Further research is necessary to better define the contraindications to bioabsorbable <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> use in the hand...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{adequate}} {{restoration of}} the muscle-tendon-bone unit is essential for a successful outcome after rotator cuff reconstruction. We describe a suture grasping technique for rotator cuff repair using suture anchors that can be performed either arthroscopically or during open rotator cuff refixation. The technique we use {{is a combination of}} a mattress and a single suture, thus representing the principles of a Mason-Allen suture technique. The modified Mason-Allen technique for <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair is easy to perform and provides excellent initial fixation strength allowing durable osteofibroblastic integration of the reinserted cuff. Key Words: Rotator cuff repair—Suture anchor technique—Modified Mason-Allen technique. Besides an adequate mobilization of the rotatorcuff, a proper reinsertion technique is of tremen-dous significance for a successful outcome after rota-tor cuff repair. Various reinsertion techniques for ar-throscopic and open rotator cuff repair are reported in the literature. Currently <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> repair repre-sents one of the most commonly used techniques in arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction. The wea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bioabsorbable {{interference}} {{screw fixation}} has superior biomechanical properties compared to <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> fixation for biceps tenodesis. However, {{it is unknown}} whether fixation technique influences clinical results. Hypothesis We hypothesize that subpectoral interference screw fixation offers relevant clinical advantages over <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> fixation for biceps tenodesis. Study Design Case Series. Methods We performed a retrospective review of a consecutive series of 88 patients receiving open subpectoral biceps tenodesis with either interference screw fixation (34 patients) or <b>suture</b> <b>anchor</b> fixation (54 patients). Average follow up was 13 months. Outcomes included Visual Analogue Pain Scale (0 – 10), ASES score, modified Constant score, pain at the tenodesis site, failure of fixation, cosmesis, deformity (popeye) and complications. Results There were no failures of fixation in this study. All patients showed significant improvement between their preoperative and postoperative status with regard to pain, ASES score, and abbreviated modified Constant scores. When comparing IF screw versus anchor outcomes, there was no statistical significance difference for VAS (p = 0. 4), ASES score (p = 0. 2), and modified Constant score (P = 0. 09). One patient (3 %) treated with IF screw complained of persistent bicipital groove tenderness, versus four patients (7 %) in the SA group (nonsignificant). Conclusion Subpectoral biceps tenodesis reliably relieves pain and improves function. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the outcomes studied between the two fixation techniques. Residual pain at the site of tenodesis may be an issue when suture anchors are used in the subpectoral location. </p...|$|E

In contrast, the dynamic intraligamentary stabilization with Ligamys™ device has demonstrated very promising results in different types of clinical studies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract】Objective: To {{evaluate}} clinical {{outcome of}} <b>suture</b> <b>anchors</b> in strengthening both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments in the surgical treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with acute traumatic Rockwood III, IV and V dislocations of the acromioclavicular joint surgically treated at our institute between October 2010 and January 2012 were recruited. All patients underwent open reduction combined with <b>suture</b> <b>anchors.</b> Function was evaluated using the ConstantMurley shoulder score. Clinical and radiographic shoulder ratings were evaluated using Taft criteria at 3, 6 and 12 months. Results:Two cases with fixation loosening {{were not included}} in final statistical analysis. Other patients obtained full joint reposition on immediate postoperative radiographs. Follow-up was performed with an average of 15. 6 months (range, 12 - 19). After early range of motion exercises, 96. 2...|$|R
