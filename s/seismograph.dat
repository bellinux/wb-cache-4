5|$|Seismic {{activity}} in Indonesia is {{monitored by the}} Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Indonesia. The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. They use a <b>seismograph</b> to measure seismic and tectonic activity. Since the 1880 eruption, no significant increase in seismic activity has occurred. Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, especially around the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone.|$|E
5|$|As it {{approached}} the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet {{passed over the}} Swan Islands north of Honduras as a Category5 hurricane on September27. The hurricane caused rough seas, and strong winds uprooted trees and antennas. After gusts exceeded an estimated 100mph (160km/h), officials on the islands took shelter in a Navy <b>seismograph</b> building. Though no deaths were reported, Janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands. The U.S. Weather Bureau and Civil Aeronautics Authority requested food and supplies for 82people on the island after the storm passed.|$|E
5|$|Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National <b>Seismograph</b> Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the range. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if the Itcha Range becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If the Itcha Range were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada.|$|E
