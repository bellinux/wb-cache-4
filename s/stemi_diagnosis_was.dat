40|$|Acute ST-segment {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) {{is a serious}} disease in clinical practice. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of this critical illness can lead to prompt reperfusion, and it enables the reduction of cardiac ischemic damage and results in improved subsequent outcomes. The shorter the time to reperfusion, the gr-eater the benefits. 1) The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association STEMI guidelines recommend primary percuta-neous coronary intervention {{for the treatment of}} STEMI with a door-to-balloon time of less than 90 minutes. 2) Therefore, the prompt and accurate diagnosis of STEMI is an important issue. In the diagnosis of STEMI, the 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is an indispensable diagnostic tool directing the emergent management of patients with acute STEMI. However, a variety of other conditions aside from STEMI can cause ST-segment elevation on the ECG. 3) 4) Several recent studies have found a frequency of false-positive catheterization la-boratory activation. Indeed, a false-positive STEMI diagnosis is rel-atively common in community practice. 5 - 8) One of these studies re-ported that the prevalence of false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activations was between 9. 2 - 14 %. 6) In another study, the prevalence of false-positive <b>STEMI</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> 10. 4 % and the ch-aracteristics and prognosis in patients with a false-positive STEMI diagnosis in an emergency department was investigated. 9) In this study, false-positive STEMI diagnosis patients had a lower incid-ence of typical chest pain or chest tightness.

40|$|Background-—With {{adoption}} of telemedicine, physicians are increasingly asked to diagnose ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) based on electrocardiograms (ECGs) with minimal associated clinical information. We {{sought to determine}} physicians ’ diagnostic agreement and accuracy when interpreting potential STEMI ECGs. Methods and Results-—A cross-sectional survey was performed consisting of 36 deidentified ECGs that had previously resulted in putative STEMI diagnoses. Emergency physicians, cardiologists, and interventional cardiologists participated in the survey. For each ECG, physicians were asked, “based on the ECG above, is there a blocked coronary artery present causing a STEMI? ” The reference standard for ascertaining the <b>STEMI</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> subsequent emergent coronary arteriography. Responses were analyzed with generalized estimating equations to account for nested and repeated measures. One hundred twenty-four physicians interpreted a total of 4392 ECGs. Among all physicians, interreader agreement (kappa) for ECG interpretation was 0. 33, reflecting poor agreement. The sensitivity to identify “true ” STEMIs was 65 % (95 % CI: 63 to 67) and the specificity was 79 % (95 % CI: 77 to 81). There was a 6 % increase in the odds of accurate ECG interpretation for every 5 years of experience since medical school graduation (OR 1. 06, 95 % CI: 1. 02 to 1. 10, P= 0. 01). After adjusting for experience, {{there was no significant}} difference in the odds of accurate interpretation by specialty—Emergency Medicine (reference), General Cardiology (AOR 0. 97, 95 % CI: 0. 79 to 1. 2, P= 0. 80), or Interventional Cardiology physicians (AOR 1. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 93 to 1. 7, P= 0. 15). Conclusions-—There is significant physician disagreement in interpreting ECGs with features concerning for STEMI. Such ECG...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a Bayesian semiparametric multivariate {{model is}} assumed to {{represent}} data including in-hospital and 60 -days survival of patients admitted to a hospital with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (<b>STEMI)</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>is</b> caused by an occlusion of a coronary artery which causes an ischaemia that, if untreated, can damage heart cells and make them die (infarction). It is fundamental for the patient's recovery to do a reperfusion therapy as quickly as possible, since its benefits decrease highly non-linear with delay in treatment. In this study, we consider data collected in the STEMI Archive, a multicenter observational prospective clinical study planned within the Strategic Program of Regione Lombardia. All patients were treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Data was recorded in a registry collecting clinical outcomes, process and time indicators and personal information on patients admitted to hospitals of Regione Lombardia with <b>STEMI</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> We introduce a multivariate regression model, where the response has three mixed components: door to balloon time (DB), i. e. the time between the admission {{to the hospital and}} angioplasty, in-hospital survival and survival after 60 days from admission. As mentioned before, the first response (continuous) is essential in quantifying the efficiency of health providers and {{plays a key role in}} the success of the therapy; the second is the basic indicator of success or failure of the treatment, while the third concerns a 60 -days period, during which the effectiveness of the treatment, in terms of survival and quality of life, can be truly evaluated. Note that the last two responses are binary, so that, as a whole, the multivariate response is of mixed type. For each patient, the joint conditional distribution of the three responses (i. e. the likelihood), given the âparametersâ, is modeled as the product (i) of the distribution of the continuous response (DB time), (ii) of the distribution of the in-hospital survival given DB time, and (iii) of the 60 -days survival, given DB time and in-hospital survival. All these conditional distributions lie within the class of (univariate) generalized linear mixed models, with random-effects given by hospital intercepts. Covariates corresponding to the other regression parameters include hospital admission variables (i. e. times to treatment, mode of transportation to hospital), patient's clinical variables at hospital admission and patient's general health status variables. As usual, we assume conditional independence among patients. The prior for the hospitals effects is given non-parametrically, as an ANOVA-Poisson-Dirichlet process prior, that is a family of distribution of dependent random probability measures, with (marginal) almost surely discrete trajectories generalizing the Dirichlet process. Such priors induce a random partition of the hospital labels. This is particular useful when we want to estimate a âlatentâ clustering among hospitals of our dataset, identifying groups of providers affecting outcomes at patientsâ level in a similar way. Therefore, in this context, a clustering analysis of the hospitals is straightforward, based on posterior estimates of the random partition âparameterâ itself. The posterior inference provided here includes posterior distributions of all parameters, predictive survival probabilities, and hospitals clustering...|$|R

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} U. S. physicians' knowledge and perspectives regarding the 2004 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients who have ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We invited 45, 998 physicians from the American Medical Association's roster to take an Internet survey of U. S. cardiologists and emergency physicians who were hospital-based or who had hospital-admitting privileges. To represent individual and combined populations, data were weighted {{on the basis of}} years in practice, sex, and geographic region. Of 505 cardiologists and 509 emergency physicians who completed the survey, 90 % worked in an urban or suburban setting and 82 % at hospitals with a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Sampling error was ± 3. 4 %. Most respondents (61 %) believed that overall myocardial infarction treatment needed a “great deal” or “fair amount” of improvement; 24 % were “somewhat” or “not at all” familiar with the guidelines. Although 84 % knew the recommended STEMI treatments for a patient who presents within 3 hours of symptom onset without contraindications to reperfusion or delay to invasive treatment, only 11 % knew that there is no preferred approach. If percutaneous coronary intervention proved impossible within 90 minutes of presentation, 21 % reported that eligible patients—assuming early presentation, confirmed <b>STEMI</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> and no high-risk STEMI or contraindications to fibrinolysis—would “rarely” or “never” receive guideline-recommended fibrinolysis...|$|R
40|$|ORIGINAL RESEARCH Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a major}} public health problem which in turn imposes a {{significant}} burden on health care systems because of high morbidity and mortality. Although the multifactorial etiology of CAD increases with age, but in recent years, the incidence is increasing among younger age groups. Objectives: In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of age on risk profile, inflammatory response and the angiographic findings in patients with ACS. Patients and Methods: The study comprised 253 ACS patients. Seventy six (30 %) with UA, 56 (22 %) with NSTEMI and 121 (48 %) with <b>STEMI</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> The value of Hs-CRP, lipid profile, cardiac enzymes, risk factors, EF % and angiographic score were analyzed and compared in different age groups. Results: Group 1 (n = 68) with age � 45 years, group II (n = 110) with age � 45 –� 65 years and group III (n = 75) � 65 years. Group I had more prevalence of male sex, smoking, family history, hypertriglyceridemia {{and low levels of}} HDL (P � 0. 01), higher incidence of STEMI (P � 0. 01) and lower prevalence of UA (P � 0. 01). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and female gender were more common in older groups. Hs-CRP was significantly lower in the young age (group I).
