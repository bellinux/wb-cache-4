5|$|After a {{bruising}} primary {{battle with}} another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank, he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following an unsuccessful {{run in the}} adjacent Second District in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 he unsuccessfully <b>sought</b> <b>the</b> Republican nomination for Congress in the Second District special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, and promising to limit taxes and government spending. In 2006, he unsuccessfully <b>sought</b> <b>the</b> Republican nomination in the Second District.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the first}} part of the {{analysis}} failed to produce a dispositive result, Marshall then turned to the type of relief <b>the</b> plaintiffs <b>sought.</b> [...] <b>The</b> only remaining remedy <b>the</b> plaintiffs <b>sought</b> against <b>the</b> union was compensatory damages, which are the traditional legal remedy. [...] While restitutionary remedies such as back pay and benefits may be characterized as equitable when sought from an employer, the damages here were <b>sought</b> from <b>the</b> Union. [...] Thus, Marshall held that the plaintiffs were requesting a legal remedy, and therefore, on the balance of the issues, were entitled to have their case heard by a jury.|$|R

A bill passed {{in the state legislature}} in 1912 created a State Insurance Rating Board under the office of state auditor, and Bosworth appointed Laffoon chairman of the board due to his experience in the insurance field and as a reward for his loyalty to the party. In 1915, Laffoon <b>sought</b> <b>the</b> post of Commonwealth's Attorney for the Fourth Judicial District, which comprised Hopkins, Caldwell, Crittenden, and Livingston counties. He lost in the primary to J. Elliott Baker, but the Republican candidate, Charles Ferguson, won the general election.|$|E
