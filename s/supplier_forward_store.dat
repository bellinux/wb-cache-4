40|$|We model {{strategic}} {{behavior of}} {{two types of}} suppliers in B 2 B spot markets: a supplier that has forwardcontracts and uses the spot market only for inventory liquidation, and a supplier that uses the spot market as its sole selling channel. We find that when the spot market demand is small, the <b>supplier</b> that has <b>forward</b> contracts has a higher incentive to invest in expanding the spot market. When the spot market demand exceeds a threshold size, this situation is reversed, and the supplier with no contracts benefits more from making the spot market more prevalent. We show that a <b>supplier</b> with <b>forward</b> contracts benefits from {{the existence of the}} spot market more than a supplier with no contracts and that this result holds with both negative and positive correlation between spot market demand and contracted demand. We find that suppliers producing only for the spot market gain from working in industries where contracted demand and spot market demand are positively correlated, whereas <b>suppliers</b> that have <b>forward</b> contracts benefit from working in industries with a negative correlation between demands, since it allows them to better manage risk. In addition, both total industry supply and spot market supply are higher in industries where demands are negatively correlated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{forwarding}} mechanism for IP multicast based on Explicit Multicast (Xcast). Compared with traditional IP multicast, our mechanism achieves {{a more flexible}} allocation of multicast forwarding states among routers. Previous works only focus on {{reducing the number of}} routers which <b>store</b> the <b>forwarding</b> states, ignoring the distribution of forwarding states among routers. The number of <b>forwarding</b> states <b>stored</b> in each router may be unbalanced. In this paper, we formulate the assignment of the routers with forwarding states as two optimization problems. The first one is to minimize the number of routers with the forwarding states in each multicast tree. The second one is to minimize the maximum number of <b>forwarding</b> states <b>stored</b> in a router. We design several algorithms for both problems. We prove that our algorithms can find the optimal solution to the first problem. By simulation, we also show that our algorithms perform well in the second problem. Moreover, we prove that assigning all branching routers as the only routers with the forwarding states is a special case in our mechanism. Due to higher flexibility, we show that our mechanism use fewer forwarding states, and the distribution of forwarding states is more balanced.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we provide}} a new {{methodology}} for optimizing {{a portfolio of}} wind farms within a market environment, for two Market Designs (exogenous prices and endogenous prices).

Assuming rational expectation of the agents with respect to the outcome of the real-time market, <b>suppliers</b> take <b>forward</b> positions, which act as signals in the day-ahead market, to compensate for the uncertainty associated with supply and demand. Then, generators optimize their bilateral trades with the generators in the other markets. The Nash Equilibria resulting from this Signaling Game are characterized using Game Theory.
