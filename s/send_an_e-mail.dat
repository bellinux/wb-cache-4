500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated {{that a couple of}} sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma <b>send</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up with}} new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E

50|$|Setting up a {{usability}} test involves carefully creating a scenario, or realistic situation, wherein the person performs {{a list of}} tasks using the product being tested while observers watch and take notes (dynamic verification). Several other test instruments such as scripted instructions, paper prototypes, and pre- and post-test questionnaires are also used to gather feedback on the product being tested (static verification). For example, to test the attachment function of an e-mail program, a scenario would describe a situation where a person needs to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> attachment, and ask {{him or her to}} undertake this task. The aim is to observe how people function in a realistic manner, so that developers can see problem areas, and what people like.

50|$|In March 2005, Barry Clinton Eckstrom, 51, of Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania, {{began to}} send {{threatening}} e-mails to Jason Hawes, founder of TAPS. Hawes alerted the FBI in Providence. When the e-mails began to include threats against then President George W. Bush, the Secret Service became involved. Eckstrom also used Hawes's name to send e-mails to some female members of TAPS, {{in which he}} threatened to rape and murder them. While under surveillance by federal agents, Eckstrom used a Bethel Park, Pennsylvania library computer to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> in Hawes' name to Roto Rooter's Cincinnati headquarters, threatening to shoot employees there. Next, Eckstrom typed a message threatening to kill President Bush, again in Hawes' name, using the Department of Homeland Security's website. Before he could send the message, he was arrested. Because of these activities, Eckstrom was sentenced {{to two years in}} federal prison in January 2006.|$|E
50|$|Excel 2002 and Word 2002 {{introduce}} {{support for}} smart tags, commands for {{specific types of}} text including addresses, calendar dates, personal names, telephone numbers, ticker symbols, or tracking numbers in documents. A smart tag is denoted by a dotted purple underline underneath actionable text in a document; hovering over this text with the mouse cursor displays an icon that presents a list of related commands when invoked with a mouse click or the ++ keyboard shortcut. A ticker symbol smart tag in Excel can present the latest stock information in a cell within a workbook, for example, while a contact name smart tag in a Word document can display options to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> message to or schedule a meeting with that contact. Excel and Word support extensible smart tags that allow developers and organizations to display custom commands related to specific information. The smart tags used by Word are also available in Outlook 2002 if the former is configured as the default e-mail editor.|$|E
