40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} investigating ship emissions, the plume capture and analysis system (PCAS), and its application in measuring airborne pollutant emission factors (EFs) and particle size distributions. The current investigation was conducted in situ, aboard two dredgers (Amity: a cutter suction dredger and Brisbane: a <b>hopper</b> <b>suction</b> dredger) but the PCAS is also capable of performing such measurements remotely at a distant point within the plume. EFs were measured relative to the fuel consumption using the fuel combustion derived plume CO 2. All plume measurements were corrected by subtracting background concentrations sampled regularly from upwind of the stacks. Each measurement typically took 6 minutes to complete and during one day, 40 to 50 measurements were possible. The relationship between the EFs and plume sample dilution was examined to determine the plume dilution range over which the technique could deliver consistent results when measuring EFs for particle number (PN), NOx, SO 2, and PM 2. 5 within a targeted dilution factor range of 50 - 1000 suitable for remote sampling. The EFs for NOx, SO 2, and PM 2. 5 {{were found to be}} independent of dilution, for dilution factors within that range. The EF measurement for PN was corrected for coagulation losses by applying a time dependant particle loss correction to the particle number concentration data. For the Amity, the EF ranges were PN: 2. 2 - 9. 6 × 1015 (kg-fuel) - 1; NOx: 35 - 72 g(NO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1, SO 2 0. 6 - 1. 1 g(SO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1 and PM 2. 5 : 0. 7 – 6. 1 g(PM 2. 5). (kg-fuel) - 1. For the Brisbane they were PN: 1. 0 – 1. 5 x 1016 (kg-fuel) - 1, NOx: 3. 4 – 8. 0 g(NO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1, SO 2 : 1. 3 – 1. 7 g(SO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1 and PM 2. 5 : 1. 2 – 5. 6 g(PM 2. 5). (kg-fuel) - 1. The results are discussed in terms of the operating conditions of the vessels’ engines. Particle number emission factors as a function of size as well as the count median diameter (CMD), and geometric standard deviation of the size distributions are provided. The size distributions were found to be consistently uni-modal in the range below 500 nm, and this mode was within the accumulation mode range for both vessels. The representative CMDs for the various activities performed by the dredgers ranged from 94 - 131 nm {{in the case of the}} Amity, and 58 - 80 nm for the Brisbane. A strong inverse relationship between CMD and EF(PN) was observed...|$|R

The pipe, which is {{fitted with a}} dredge drag head, loads the dredge spoil into one or more hoppers in the vessel.When the hoppers are full, the TSHD sails to a disposal area and either dumps the material through doors in the hull or pumps the material out of the hoppers. Some dredges also self-offload using drag buckets and conveyors.|$|E

50|$|Now {{complete}} is a £10,000,000 renovation {{to rebuild}} and improve Newbiggin's rapidly eroding beach. This involved importing 500,000 tonnes of sand from Skegness, {{delivered by the}} trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> dredger (TSHD) Oranje and deposited on the beach through a pipe approximately 1 m in diameter. A new offshore breakwater was installed to accompany the matching breakwater {{on the opposite side}} of the bay. Also installed is a brass statue by sculptor Sean Henry named Couple, anchored in the centre of the bay.|$|E
50|$|Jan De Nul has a {{fleet of}} 75 vessels, {{including}} 14 cutter suction dredgers, 28 trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> dredgers, 20 split barges, 6 backhoe dredgers, 1 oil recovery vessel, 5 rock installation vessels and one cable installation vessel under construction. This includes the Cristobal Colon, launched in 2008, and the world's largest dredger with a capacity of 46,000 m³. It can dredge to a water depth of 155m. Joined by her near-sister ship Leiv Eiriksson in 2010, Jan De Nul {{has one of the}} world's largest, if not the largest, fleets of hopper dredgers.|$|E
50|$|The deepest {{section of}} the Fehmarn Belt Trench is 35 metres and the tunnel {{sections}} will be about 10 metres high, thus the dredging barges {{will need to be}} capable of reaching depths of over 45 metres. Dredging will produce a trench some 40-50 m wide and 12-15 m deep. These parameters give a total of some 20 million cubic metres of soils to be dredged. Conventional dredging equipment can only reach to a depth of about 25 m. To excavate the middle portion of the Fehmarn trench - deeper than 25 m below the water's surface - will likely require grab dredgers and trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> dredgers.|$|E
50|$|The vessel {{should always}} have a {{positive}} speed over the ground. It is possible to regulate {{the density of the}} sucked substance. If the head is lowered, more material will be sucked but there is a greater possibility of damaging the installation because the material can get stuck inside the pipes. Once the mixture is loaded inside the hopper, the substance will sink and the water is discharged overboard, creating more room for extra substance. A trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> dredger is only capable to suck relatively loose substance because the steel teeth are not so big. Harder substances such as rock, or ironbased rock must be destroyed by a cutter.|$|E
50|$|DEME invests some €200 {{million per}} year in {{construction}} of new vessels. Under the current investment programme 2008-2012, some fifteen major vessels will be launched for an estimated value of €1.26 billion. By the end of 2010, seven have already been launched; eight vessels are under construction. The latter include the 11,650 m3 trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> dredger Breughel and the 28,000 kW cutter suction dredger Ambiorix, a sister ship of d'Artagnan. Other ships to be commissioned before 2012 are the 5,000 m3 gravel dredger Victor Horta; the 19,000 tons fallpipe vessel Flintstone; the self-propelled seagoing dredgers Al Jarraf and Amazone, each with a total installed power of 12,860 kW; the mega-trailer Congo River which has a hopper capacity of 30,000 tonnes; and the jack-up Neptune.|$|E
