5|$|Since the 1970s an {{important}} focus of <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the ozone layer}} in the atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.|$|E

5|$|This <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that {{measurement of the}} northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{conducted by}} the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) in collaboration with Wetlands InternationalSouth Asia, supported by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility, implementing a project on Sustainable Development and Water Resources Management of the Loktak Lake. The project addresses the issues relating to water management, sustainable fisheries development, community participation and development, catchment area treatment and conservation of wildlife. The Planning Commission of the Government of India, decided in September 2008 that these policies would be implemented {{over a period of}} 56 years at an estimated cost of over Rs500crores (US$100million), and extended the area under management to also incorporate the water of Nambul and other rivers and their tributaries, which are primarily responsible for polluting the Loktak Lake.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To give an {{up-to-date}} {{overview of}} the research in pharmacogenetics of cardiovascular disease, and the clinical implications of this research. • Methods: In this lecture I will focus on these groups cardiovascular drugs where many pharmacogenetics <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed (including statins, coumarins, clopidogrel). • Results: Many <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed {{in this area of}} research. These pharmacogenetic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dealing with many methodological issues, such as power issues, issues with exposure and outcome definition etcetera. This is also {{at least part of the}} reason that many gene-drug associations that were initially reported were not replicated. For some gene-drug interactions trials <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed to <b>study</b> the clinical utility of implementing genetic testing. • Conclusion: Even though many <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed for many different drugs currently there are hardly any clinical implications in cardiovascular pharmacogenetics...|$|R
5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E
5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think {{it could have been}} bi-polar disorder), most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease may have affected her grandfather, George III and this could give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation that one of her great-great-grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> sanctioned by the Royal Family.|$|E
