25|$|Due to the {{economic}} crisis, the President enacted a pay freeze for <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff making more than $100,000 per year. The action affected approximately 120 staffers and added up to about a $443,000 savings for the United States government.|$|E
25|$|On December 15, 2015, three <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officialsValerie Jarrett, Cecilia Munoz, and Ben Rhodesmet with American Muslim and Sikh {{leaders to}} discuss the {{increase}} in violent attacks upon members of the American Muslim and Sikh community following the attack (Sikhs are not Muslims but have been occasionally targeted in anti-Islamic bias-motivated crimes).|$|E

25|$|According to <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{correspondent}} Bill Sammon and his {{inside look}} at the Bush administration's response to 9/11, Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism from Inside the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was holding up a legal pad upon which he had written a message telling Bush {{not to say anything}} yet.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, if law {{enforcement}} interviews of the President, Vice President or other <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials become subject to routine public disclosure, even upon {{the conclusion of}} an investigation, there is an increased likelihood that such officials could feel reluctant to participate in voluntary interviews or, if they agree to such voluntary interviews, could decline to answer questions on certain topics.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak has met several Trump {{campaign}} {{members and}} administration nominees; involved people dismissed those meetings as routine conversations {{in preparation for}} assuming the presidency. Trump's team has issued at least twenty denials concerning communications between his campaign and Russian officials; several of these denials {{turned out to be}} false. In the early months of 2017, Trump and other <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.|$|E

25|$|I also do {{not believe}} it would be {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that White House officials took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E
500|$|The Senate Judiciary Committee {{was also}} {{involved}} in investigating the matter, holding hearings beginning June 29, 1996, and focussing on allegations that White House was engaged in a [...] "dirty tricks" [...] operation reminiscent of the Nixon administration. Looking into accusations that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials or the First Lady may have inappropriately perused the files, in October 1996 Republican committee chair Orrin Hatch requested that the FBI do a fingerprint analysis of them. [...] On November 3, 1996, the FBI informed the committee that no fingerprints of either the First Lady or any other named senior official were on the files.|$|E
500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of June 1996 arose concerning improper {{access by}} the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, {{head of the}} White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined {{that there was no}} credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, [...] "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> official was involved" [...] in seeking the files.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 Demarest was the {{communications}} director on the Bush-Quayle presidential campaign. He then served {{four years as}} member of the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>senior</b> staff. As <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Communications Director, he worked directly with the President, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Chief of Staff, and the Cabinet, and in that capacity managed {{a broad range of}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> communications activities, including presidential speechwriting, public liaison, media relations, and intergovernmental affairs.|$|R
5000|$|March 1, 2005 - Attorney General Gonzales {{signed a}} {{confidential}} order, not {{published in the}} Federal Register, that formally delegated his authority to <b>senior</b> DOJ staff, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> liaison and public affairs officer Monica Goodling and {{deputy chief of staff}} for the A.G. Kyle Sampson to hire and dismiss political appointees.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Maloney {{began working}} on Bill Clinton's first {{campaign}} for President as Deputy to Susan Thomases, the chief scheduler, and in Clinton's re-election campaign Maloney worked as Director of Surrogate Travel. After the successful campaign Maloney was offered {{a position in the}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff and served as a <b>senior</b> advisor and <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Staff Secretary from 1999 through 2000, among the youngest to serve in that capacity. At a campaign event Clinton stated that Maloney worked closely with him.|$|R
500|$|The {{matter was}} {{investigated}} by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Whitewater Independent Counsel. [...] In 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr exonerated President Bill Clinton {{as well as the}} First Lady of any involvement in the matter. [...] In 2000 Independent Counsel Robert Ray issued his final report on Filegate, stating that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> figures or the First Lady had requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone's hiring. [...] A separate lawsuit on the matter brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, lingered on for years and was dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.|$|E
500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of the Clinton Administration, {{often referred}} to as Filegate, arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. [...] The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top presidential advisors. [...] Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. [...] Allegations were made that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> figures, including First Lady Hillary Clinton, may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.|$|E
500|$|After {{the repeal}} of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama {{included}} openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. <b>Senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E
50|$|Leo Thomas McGarry is {{a fictional}} {{character}} played by American actor John Spencer {{on the television}} serial drama The West Wing. The role earned Spencer the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2002. McGarry's character, the former United States Secretary of Labor, begins the series as the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Chief of Staff. He is President Josiah Bartlet's best friend and a father figure to the <b>Senior</b> Staff, particularly <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman and Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn.|$|R
50|$|Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs, {{served as}} an advisor to the fund. In 2013, Jonson Cox, the {{chairman}} of the UK's Water Services Regulation Authority, was appointed as a senior policy advisor of I Squared. Tom J. Donohue, President & CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce and Ginger Lew, former <b>Senior</b> Counsel to <b>White</b> <b>House</b> on Economic Policy, are advisors to I Squared.|$|R
5000|$|During most of {{the series}} Donna works as the <b>senior</b> {{assistant}} to <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (or, as she jokingly calls herself in one episode, the [...] "deputy deputy chief of staff"). Although all the senior staff's assistants are continuing characters with personal backgrounds, Donna is the best defined and most often featured staff member on the assistant level, and her difficult, semi-romantic relationship with Josh is a major plot device during later seasons.|$|R
500|$|The Soviet Union, {{then led}} by Joseph Stalin, became an enemy in the Cold War. Truman oversaw the Berlin Airlift of 1948 and the {{creation}} of NATO in 1949 but was unable to stop Communists from taking over China, and survived unharmed from an assassination attempt in 1950. When communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, he sent U.S. troops and gained UN approval for the Korean War. After initial successes in Korea, however, the UN forces were [...] thrown back [...] by Chinese intervention, and the conflict was stalemated throughout the final years of Truman's presidency. [...] On domestic issues, bills endorsed by Truman often faced opposition from a conservative Congress dominated by the Southern legislators, but his administration was able to successfully guide the American economy through the post-war economic challenges. Truman maintained that civil rights were a moral priority, and in 1948 submitted the first comprehensive civil rights legislation and issued Executive Orders to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies. Allegations were raised of corruption in the Truman administration, linked to certain cabinet members and <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff; this became a central campaign issue in the 1952 presidential election, and helped account for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's electoral victory. Scholars, starting in 1962, ranked Truman's presidency as [...] "near great"; since then he has been ranked between 5th and 9th in historical rankings of U.S. Presidents.|$|E
2500|$|The powerful, non-elected [...] "chief executive" [...] {{position}} envisaged for insertion {{into the}} Afghan government {{was characterized by}} a <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> official as [...] "a prime minister, except not prime minister because he wouldn’t be responsible to a parliamentary system." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} reports that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials, and Trump himself, asked intelligence officials {{if they could}} intervene with the FBI to stop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats later said he had [...] "never felt pressured {{to intervene in the}} Russia investigation in any way".|$|E
5000|$|Plame's {{identity}} as a covert CIA agent was leaked to the media by <b>senior</b> Bush <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials to discredit and retaliate against her husband, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, who had alleged the Bush administration misrepresented intelligence information {{to make the case}} {{to go to war with}} Saddam Hussein. I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby, the chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was later convicted on federal charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in an attempt to conceal his own role and that of others in the Bush <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in outing Plame, although President Bush would later commute Libby's thirty-month prison sentence. Waas not only wrote the first story disclosing that Libby had leaked Plame's identity to New York Times reporter Judith Miller, but the same story also paved the way for Miller, then in jail for more than a hundred days, to be released and testify against Libby.|$|R
50|$|Fagen {{became the}} Deputy to Matthew Dowd, Chief Strategist for the Bush-Cheney 2004 {{re-election}} campaign. Sara earned her {{reputation as one}} of the nation’s leading political and issue campaign strategists, serving as a <b>senior</b> aide and <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Political Director for President George W. Bush, and playing a pivotal part in the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. During the campaign, The Wall Street Journal called her a “data whiz,” and said: “As a top strategist for the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election efforts Fagen helped perfect political micro-targeting.” She also served as a senior strategist helping to direct the President’s message development, paid media strategy, and opinion research.|$|R
5000|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} as a journalist with The Charleston News and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina, he became {{a reporter for the}} Washington Star in 1979. He covered the Supreme Court and the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> for the Star before moving to the Baltimore Sun. He was the national political correspondent at the Baltimore Sun. From 1985 to 1995, he was <b>senior</b> editor and <b>White</b> <b>House</b> correspondent for The New Republic. He also wrote the [...] "Presswatch" [...] media column for the American Spectator. He was a panelist on the public affairs show The McLaughlin Group from 1988 to 1998, where he was often referred to by the show's host as Freddy [...] "the Beadle" [...] Barnes. Barnes hosted the radio show What's the Story for Radio America. He is currently a moderator for the Voice of America show Issues in the News.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989, in the George H. W. Bush administration, Zelikow was {{detailed}} to {{join the}} National Security Council, where he was involved as a <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staffer in the diplomacy surrounding the German reunification and the diplomatic settlements accompanying {{the end of the}} Cold War in Europe. During the first Gulf War, he aided President Bush, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and Secretary of State James Baker in diplomatic affairs related to the coalition. He co-authored, with Condoleezza Rice, the book Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft (1995), an academic study [...] of the politics of reunification.|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson filed a {{civil lawsuit}} against Libby, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and other unnamed <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{officials}} (among whom they later added Richard Armitage) for {{their role in the}} public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified CIA status. [...] Judge John D. Bates dismissed the Wilsons' lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds on July 19, 2007. [...] The Wilsons appealed Bates's district-court decision the next day. Agreeing with the Bush administration, the Obama Justice Department argued that the Wilsons had no legitimate grounds to sue. Melanie Sloan, one of the Wilsons' attorneys, said: [...] "We are deeply disappointed that the Obama administration has failed to recognize the grievous harm top Bush White House officials inflicted on Joe and Valerie Wilson. The government’s position cannot be reconciled with President Obama's oft-stated commitment to once again make government officials accountable for their actions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, British Prime Minister Edward Heath {{decided to}} {{negotiate}} with the hijackers, ultimately agreeing to release Khaled and others in exchange for hostages. [...] This was bitterly opposed by the United States:"Tensions between London and Washington are reflected in a bitterly acrimonious telephone conversation between top Foreign Office official Sir Denis Greenhill and <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> aide Joseph Sisco. ... 'I think your government would want to weigh very, very carefully the kind of outcry that would occur in this country against your taking this kind of action.' Greenhill replied: 'Well, they do, Joe, but there is also an outcry in this country,' expressing concern that 'Israel won't lift a bloody finger and ... our people get killed. You could imagine how bad that would look, and if it all comes out that we could have got our people out but for the obduracy of you and other people so to speak. ... I mean people say, why the bloody hell didn't you try?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Relations {{were again}} {{severely}} strained by {{the outbreak of}} the 2011 Libyan Civil War, in which Gaddafi attempted to crush first protests, and then an armed rebellion against his rule. The U.S. government cut ties with the Gaddafi regime, and enacted sanctions against <b>senior</b> regime members. <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the legitimacy of Gaddafi's regime had been [...] "reduced to zero". The US, along with several European and Arab nations, then began to call for the United Nations to authorise military intervention in the conflict. US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice successfully pressured Russia and China not to veto the resolution, and it passed on March 17, 2011.|$|R
2500|$|Vladimir Putin {{denied any}} Russian {{involvement}} {{and said the}} incident had personally caught him [...] "off guard" [...] and that [...] "Neither Russia nor your humble servant nor Russian officials {{have anything to do}} with these events". Michael McFaul, a <b>senior</b> United States <b>White</b> <b>House</b> adviser on Russian affairs stated in Prague that the seizure of power by the Kyrgyz opposition was not anti-American in nature, and was not a Russian backed coup. However, Omurbek Tekebayev, who is in charge of constitutional matters in the new government, said: [...] "Russia played its role in ousting Bakiyev. You've seen the level of Russia's joy when they saw Bakiyev gone." [...] Furthermore, Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, was the first foreign leader to recognise Roza Otunbayeva as the new Kyrgyz leader, and rang her soon after she announced she was in charge, while the deputy head of the interim Kyrgyz government, Almazbek Atambayev, flew to Moscow on 9 April for consultation with unspecified Russian government officials, ITAR-Tass news agency reported.|$|R
5000|$|On April 13, 2007, {{documents}} were released {{in response to}} further Congressional inquiry that appeared to contradict parts of Sampson's testimony. Sampson said during his testimony that [...] "he did not have in mind any replacements {{for any of the}} seven who were asked to resign" [...] on December 7, 2006. The released emails showed that Sampson had identified five Bush administration insiders as potential replacements for sitting U.S. attorneys months before those prosecutors were fired: Jeffrey A. Taylor, now chief prosecutor in the District of Columbia, Deborah Rhodes, now the U.S. attorney in Alabama, Rachel L. Brand, head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, Daniel Levin, a former <b>senior</b> Justice and <b>White</b> <b>House</b> official who was listed as a San Francisco candidate, and Tim Griffin, a former aide to presidential adviser Karl Rove who was later appointed the top federal prosecutor in Little Rock. In response to this information, Sampson's attorney stated that these candidates were only tentative suggestions and never seriously considered. Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said the list [...] "reflects Kyle Sampson's initial thoughts" [...] and [...] "in no way contradicts the department's prior statements" [...] about the lack of a candidate list." ...|$|R
