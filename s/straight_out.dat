He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E

5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract <b>straight</b> <b>out</b> of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E

There are also four other players that would be named All-Stars {{at some point in}} their careers, and Al Jefferson would be named to an All-NBA team. The draft is also notable for many high schoolers being drafted within a few picks from each other.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} their territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head <b>straight</b> <b>out.</b> Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E

5|$|McGrady {{entered the}} NBA <b>straight</b> <b>out</b> {{of high school}} and was {{selected}} as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1997 NBA draft. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin Vince Carter. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the Orlando Magic, where {{he became one of the}} league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. In 2004, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he paired with center Yao Ming to help the Rockets become a perennial playoff team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive <b>straight</b> <b>out</b> of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

Trailing 8-2, the Angels scrounged together one more run with Wade Davis pitching (Howie Kendrick doubled, to third on an Erick Aybar single, scoring on a Josh Hamilton ground out), but closer Greg Holland's effort was superb, racking three <b>straight</b> <b>outs,</b> two on strikeouts. The Royals advanced to the ALCS, and the Angels' highly anticipated season ended, with star center fielder Mike Trout striking out swinging.|$|R

50|$|In {{their first}} game of the Cathedral City Classic, the Gators forced another mercy-ruled ended game, this time against the No. 14 Fresno State Bulldogs. In the first, after Aja Paculba drew a lead-off walk and two quick outs, left fielder Francesca Enea belted one over the fence in left center. In the bottom of the inning, the Bulldogs managed to get their first two batters on board with {{back-to-back}} singles, but three <b>straight</b> <b>outs</b> ended the threat. Florida scored again in the second to make it 3-0 when Kim Waleszonia singled to center with runners on first and second because of a hit by pitch and a walk.|$|R
5000|$|In poker, an out is any unseen card in {{the deck}} that will give a player the best hand. A wrap is a {{straight}} draw with 9 or more outs.

But in Omaha, there are 4 hole cards and this results in straight draws that can have up to 20 outs.

25|$|Dynamic {{tidal power}} (or DTP) is an untried but {{promising}} technology that would exploit {{an interaction between}} potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows.

Tidal phase differences are introduced across the dam, leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas – featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK, China, and Korea.|$|E
