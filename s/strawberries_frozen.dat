40|$|Strawberry halves were {{infused with}} pectinmethylesterase (PME) and calcium and {{subsequently}} frozen by slow, rapid, cryogenic or high-pressure shift freezing (HPSF). A microscopic procedure including detailed image {{analysis was used}} to study the effect of vacuum infusion (VI) and/or freezing on the strawberry tissue structure. Hereto, parameters characterizing the size, the shape and/or smoothness of tissue particles were compared for the different samples. It was found that VI seemed to stabilize the cell walls and the cell-cell contact and did not affect the integrity of the strawberry tissue. Structural damage of untreated strawberry tissue due to freezing was large for all freezing methods applied. Rapid and cryogenic freezing conditions were most favorable. VI was effective to minimize the structural damage of rapidly, cryogenically and high-pressure shift frozen strawberries. Infused <b>strawberries</b> <b>frozen</b> by HPSF showed the most smooth and largest particles from all the frozen samples, indicating the importance of both infusion and a high and homogenous degree of undercooling to obtain maximal structure retention of frozen strawberries. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of heating shelf temperature on selected physical properties of freeze-dried <b>strawberries.</b> <b>Frozen</b> strawberries were freeze-dried at heating shelf temperature of 10, 30, 50 and 70 °C for 24 hours. Rehydration, adsorption rate and sorption isotherms were determined for freeze-dried strawberries. With increase the temperature of heating shelves in the range 10 - 50 °C, rehydration capacity was increased. After 30 minutes of the rehydration process there was a decrease in water content, which is probably connected with changes in structure. Sorption isotherms were included to II isotherms type and have a sigmoidal shape characteristic for most food products. For the mathematical description Peleg’s model was used. For freeze-dried strawberries obtained in the range from 10 to 50 °C isotherms have the same courses. Increase of temperature to 70 °C resulted in obtaining the lowest water content in the water activity range from 0. 113 to 0. 648. There is a statistically significant influence of temperature of heating shelf on water vapour sorption for freeze-dried strawberries.

40|$|Vacuum {{infusion}} (VI), freezing, frozen {{storage and}} thawing conditions were optimized {{in order to}} minimize the texture loss of frozen strawberries. Slow freezing caused severe loss in textural quality of the strawberries. This quality loss could not be prevented by the application of VI prior to slow freezing, or by the application of rapid, cryogenic or high-pressure shift freezing conditions on non-infused fruits. A remarkable texture improvement was noticed when infusion of pectinmethylesterase (PME) and calcium was combined with rapid or cryogenic freezing. The highly beneficial effect of PME/Ca-infusion followed by HPSF on the hardness retention of frozen strawberries was ascribed to the combined effect of the infused PME (53 % reduction in degree of esterification (DE) of the strawberry pectin) and the high degree of supercooling during HPSF. During frozen storage, textural quality of PME/Ca-infused high-pressure frozen strawberries was maintained at temperatures below - 8 degrees C, whereas the texture of PME/Ca-infused <b>strawberries</b> <b>frozen</b> under cryogenic freezing conditions was only preserved at temperatures below - 18 degrees C.

Epidemiological studies suggested that <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries</b> represented the vehicle of infection. We describe here {{the analysis of}} <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries</b> {{for the presence of}} norovirus. Samples were taken by applying a stratified subsampling scheme. Two different methods for virus extraction from strawberries were compared. First, viruses were eluted from strawberries under alkaline conditions and concentrated using a polyethylene glycol precipitation. Second, ultrafiltration was applied for concentration of viruses rinsed off of the berries. In both cases, RNA was extracted and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Application of the ultrafiltration method generally resulted in a lower detection rate. Noroviruses were detected in 7 / 11 samples derived from the lot of strawberries implicated in the outbreak using the precipitation method. Typing of norovirus revealed three different genotypes including a combination of norovirus genotype II. 16 (viral polymerase) and II. 13 (viral capsid). This genotype combination was also found in some of the patients that were involved in the outbreak, but that had not been reported in Germany so far. In conclusion, heterogeneously distributed noroviruses in <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries</b> can be detected by applying an optimized combination of sampling procedures, virus extraction methods, and real-time RT-PCR protocols.

The formation of ice III, which has been proven to inactivate the microbial load of a frozen food, occurred when pressure was increased to 250 MPa or higher. Volume changes related {{to the formation of}} ice III affected the cell wall integrity of infused <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries</b> and caused a 42 - 46 % reduction of the fruit's hardness. These textural and structural changes were not affected by the pressure holding time (30 s versus 10 min), and thus by partial thawing during the pressure holding time, and were absent in frozen fruits treated at pressures lower than 250 MPa. The structure and texture of frozen carrots were respectively not and only slightly altered during high-pressure-low-temperature (HP-LT) treatments at all pressure levels studied. However, if carrots were blanched (30 min at 60 degrees C, 2 min at 90 degrees C and a combination of both) prior to freezing, structural damages during pretreatment and freezing made the tissue, in terms of both structural and textural quality, unsuitable for a post-freezing HP-LT treatment. These observations should be taken in mind when analyzing the possibilities of HPIC processes as a tool for post-freezing microbial reduction when applied to tissue based systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Preservation of food by {{freezing}} is {{a common}} method of processing. Of relatively recent origin is the freeze-drying method. This method has several advantages over other methods of preservation, but is not free of problems, {{one of which is}} the maintenance of appearance and texture. In the present study, the effects of freezing, thawing, freeze-drying, and reconstitution on the physico-chemical properties of Northwest variety strawberries with particular reference to textural characteristics were investigated. Very little prior work is reported with regards to the effect of these factors on fruits. <b>Strawberries</b> were <b>frozen</b> at two different rates of freezing - slow frozen at 0 °F and quick frozen in a blast freezer at - 20 °F. Frozen berries were examined by physical and chemical methods to evaluate the changes. In a separate study, berries were thawed under standard conditions of relative humidity and temperature and the drip collected for analysis. Thawed berries were examined by both physical and chemical methods. To study the reconstitution behaviour of the berries, they were freeze-dried and reconstituted under standard conditions of berry to water ratio, temperature of water and time of reconstitution. Reconstituted berries and the remaining solutions were then examined. Measurements of the texture, color, total solids, alcohol insoluble solids, pectins, cellulose, ash, and constituents of ash were made on raw, frozen, thawed, and reconstituted berries. The results indicated the following conclusions: 1. An increase in percent soluble solids, pH, and titratable acids and a decrease in total solids and AIS of the berries were observed upon freezing. Slow frozen berries showed more pronounced effects. Smaller berries were observed to change the least. No significant differences were found in the other constituents. 2. Strawberries lose weight upon thawing depending on the chemical composition of the berries. An inverse relationship was observed between weight loss and total solids, AIS, pectic substances, cellulose, ash and mineral content of the berries. With gradual increase in the weight loss upon thawing, there was a progressive softening of the berries. A direct relationship was found between weight loss and the amount of pectic substances, sugars, titratable acids, ash, and minerals found in the drip. Slow freezing resulted in higher weight loss and smaller berries lost the least. 3. A linear relationship exists between weight loss of the berries upon thawing and the area of the drip. This method offers a convenient and quick procedure for evaluation of the quality of <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries,</b> with the added advantage of collecting the drip and storing it for further analysis at a convenient time. 4. Ability to reconstitute was found to be related to rate of freezing and size of berry. Quick freezing and smaller berries gave the best results. 5. Direct relationship was found between the degree of reconstitution and total solids, AIS, pectic substances, cellulose, ash, and minerals. The amount of pectic substances, sugar, titratable acids, ash, and minerals leaching out of the berries into the reconstituting solution were smaller and were independent of the degree of reconstitution. 6. Individual berries showed a large variation in their chemical constituents, which was responsible for the differences in the thawing and reconstitution behavior of Northwest strawberries...|$|R

In order {{to determine whether the}} consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo antioxidant capacity, <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries</b> (250 g) were administered daily for 3 weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 2, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -hydroxy- 3 -[2 H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20 % (P<. 01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary ingestion in healthy individuals difficult.

In a cell-based assay of patient blood samples, basophil degranulation could be induced by strawberry protein extract and by Bet v 1 and Mal d 1. Conclusions: We conclude that strawberry homologues to Bet v 1 may be allergens of importance for adverse reactions to strawberry...|$|R
40|$|Although {{freezing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important preservation methods for fruits and vegetables, the evolution of texture in frozen fruits and vegetables is very complex and difficult to understand. As freezing damage is the consequence of many separated processes, it is not always clear whether the damaging step occurs during pretreatment, freezing, storage or thawing. For each of these steps, but especially for the pretreatment and the conventional freezing step, a lot of research has been carried out in order to optimize the final quality of the frozen products. At the level of pretreatment, enzyme technology offers, among other treatments, some possibilities to improve the suitability of fruits and vegetables to be frozen. In this context, a controlled activity of pectinmethylesterase is sometimes desired because the enzyme catalyzed de-esterification of pectin creates the possibility of intermolecular interactions between Ca++ ions and low esterified pectin and can consequently reinforce cell-cell adhesion. At the level of optimization of the freezing and thawing step, high pressure-low temperature processes are relevant to mention. Of the latter emerging processes, the most promising processes in the food domain are high pressure shift freezing and high pressure thawing as a tool to increase the freezing and thawing rate and high pressure induced crystallization processes as a tool to reduce the microbial load of frozen foods. The experimental part of the work is hypothesis driven: throughout the work a number of hypotheses concerning the optimization of textural quality of frozen fruits and vegetables by the use of different high pressure-low temperature processes as well as pectin modifying treatments were evaluated. In the context of these pectin modifying treatments, two case studies were selected: carrots, a system where mainly endogenous pectinmethylesterase is responsible for pectin conversions and strawberries, a system suitable for enzyme infusion. Next to this, the use of a microscopy based approach including image analysis and detailed tissue particle parameter analysis to study freezing damage in fruits and vegetable was examined. In this way, evaluating the hypothesis that textural quality of frozen fruits and vegetables is closely related to their tissue integrity is included in the work. First it was investigated whether the freezing damage of frozen fruits and vegetables could be reduced (compared to slow, rapid, and cryogenic freezing at atmospheric pressure) by the use of high pressure shift freezing. This question was answered negatively: although the freezing time was remarkable reduced by high pressure shift freezing, the extensive hardness loss of slowly <b>frozen</b> carrots and <b>strawberries</b> could not significantly be reduced by the application of high pressure shift freezing. This observation was correlated with serious microstructural damage that arose mainly during the completion of the freezing process (at atmospheric pressure). Rapid and cryogenic freezing on the other hand could reduce the structural damage of frozen carrots and thus could be used to improve the textural quality of frozen carrots. This was however not the case for <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries.</b> Secondly, it was studied to what extent textural and structural changes during different freezing processes were related to pectin conversions and thus whether pectin modifying pretreatments could enhance the suitability of fruits and vegetables to be frozen. Calcium soaking followed by a thermal (60 °C) or high pressure (300 MPa/ 60 °C) treatment and vacuum infusion with pectinmethylesterase and Ca++ reduced the degree of esterification of respectively carrot and strawberry pectin. These respective pretreatments were effective in minimizing the structural damage and thus in obtaining an improved textural quality of high pressure frozen carrots and of rapidly, cryogenically and high pressure <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries.</b> Adding pectinmethylesterase and Ca++ by the use of vacuum in osmodehydrated and osmodehydrofrozen strawberry fruits resulted in a minor positive effect in terms of hardness values, but the positive effects on drip loss and visual appearance after thawing were obvious. Next, the use of another high pressure-low temperature process, namely high pressure thawing, for texture preservation was studied. High pressure thawing noticeably reduced the thawing time of both carrots and strawberries, but remarkable textural quality improvements were not observed when compared to thawing at atmospheric pressure. This observation, together with the finding that textural and structural quality of both carrots and strawberries were not altered considerably during frozen storage, led to the statement that the combination of pretreatment and freezing conditions is the most important factor for texture preservation/optimization of frozen fruits and vegetables. The last high pressure-low temperature process, whose possibilities in the food domain were studied, is high pressure induced crystallization. Although post-freezing high pressure induced crystallization processes have recently been proven to reduce the microbial load of frozen products, the possibility of these processes to replace a pre-freezing blanching step for fruits and vegetables seemed rather limited. Post-freezing high pressure induced crystallization processes above 200 MPa (up to 500 MPa) in combination with temperatures of - 10 °C down to - 26 °C were able to sufficiently inactivate lipoxygenase in frozen model and real systems but were not able to sufficiently inactivate other quality related enzymes such as pectinmethylesterase, polygalacturonase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase. Moreover, volume changes during high pressure induced crystallization due to the transformation of ice I to ice III crystals negatively affected the textural and structural quality of pectinmethylesterase/Ca++-infused, <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberries</b> and pretreated, <b>frozen</b> carrots. Throughout the work, a high correlation between textural quality, measured as instrumental hardness, and structural integrity, analyzed by light microscopy followed by image analysis, was observed. Moreover, the detailed image analysis step allowed detecting changes in tissue particle size and shape and thus quantifying the tissue damage due to cell wall breakage. Therefore it could be concluded that the the microscopy based approach evolved in this work is, in addition to conventional analytical tools, useful to study freezing damage in frozen fruits and vegetables. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFrozen berries {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} identified as vehicles for norovirus (NoV) transmission causing large gastroenteritis outbreaks. However, virus detection in berries is often {{hampered by the}} presence of RT-PCR-inhibiting substances. Here, several virus extraction methods for subsequent real-time RT-PCR-based NoV-RNA detection in strawberries were compared and optimized. NoV recovery rates (RRs) between 0. 21  ±  0. 13 % and 10. 29  ±  6. 03 % were found when five different artificially contaminated strawberry batches were analyzed by the ISO/TS 15216 - 2 method indicating the presence of different amounts of RT-PCR inhibitors. A comparison of five different virus extraction methods using artificially contaminated strawberries containing high amounts of RT-PCR inhibitors revealed the best NoV RRs for the ISO/TS 15216 method. Further improvement of NoV RRs from 2. 83  ±  2. 92 % to 15. 28  ±  9. 73 % was achieved by the additional use of Sephacryl®-based columns for RNA purification. Testing of 22 <b>frozen</b> <b>strawberry</b> samples from a batch involved in a gastroenteritis outbreak resulted in 5 vs. 13 NoV GI-positive and in 9 vs. 20 NoV GII-positive samples using the original ISO/TS 15216 method vs. the extended protocol, respectively. It can be concluded that the inclusion of an additional RNA purification step can increase NoV detection by the ISO/TS 15216 - 2 method in frozen berries containing high amounts of RT-PCR inhibitors...|$|R
