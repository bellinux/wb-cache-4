5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at a {{distance}} of about 584,000km, being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E
