5|$|In {{the second}} week of play, Vanderbilt {{defeated}} Southwestern 47–0 on a <b>slippery</b> field. All points were scored in the first half.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slippery</b> {{surfaces}} or bumpy surfaces. Under {{front wheel}} braking, the lower {{coefficient of friction}} may cause the front wheel to skid which often results {{in a loss of}} balance.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and <b>slippery</b> conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were created}} in 2001 to realign {{portions}} of the Columbia Park jogging path that were in lower areas or overlapped by sprinklers, to prevent flooded and <b>slippery</b> paths. The city added decomposed granite as part of fixing the problem, by draining water off the new raised sections.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} rock {{are found in}} the pass and its vicinity. Quartz {{monzonite}} forms many of the cliffs, while the crags are biotite gneiss. The glaciation, which dates to as recently as 12,000 years ago, smoothed much of the rock to the point of it being <b>slippery.</b>|$|E
5|$|He started 2017 {{season with}} his fourth win in All England Open. He nearly {{missed out on}} the tournament after tearing the medial {{collateral}} ligament during a training session at the new Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM), this caused his feud with technical director Morten Frost, as Frost was not receptive to his complaint, asking for the <b>slippery</b> mats to be replaced. Lee lost to Lin Dan for two consecutive tournaments, {{the first in the}} final of Malaysia Open, and the second in semifinals of Badminton Asia Championships.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant <b>slippery</b> surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the <b>slippery</b> slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and <b>slippery</b> making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as skunk cabbage seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains <b>slippery</b> elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{began his}} Michigan {{career in the}} {{starting}} lineup on November 9. In his first career game, Robinson nearly posted a double-double with ten points and eight rebounds in a 10062 victory against <b>Slippery</b> Rock. In his second game, Robinson had 21 points, while making his first eight field goals in a 91–54 victory against the IUPUI Jaguars on November 12. On November 23, he posted 12 rebounds in the championship game victory in the NIT Season Tip-Off tournament against Kansas State.|$|E
5|$|Some millipedes are {{considered}} household pests, including Xenobolus carnifex which can infest thatched roofs in India, and Ommatoiulus moreleti, which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical swarming behaviour, which {{can result in}} home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become <b>slippery</b> with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the spotted snake millipede (Blaniulus guttulatus) is a noted pest of sugar beets and other root crops, {{and as a result}} {{is one of the few}} millipedes with a common name.|$|E
5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in <b>slippery</b> footing, the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was {{in stark contrast}} to the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a <b>slippery</b> ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping <b>slippery</b> prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>slippery</b> {{concrete}} surfacing, steep left-side ramps, center breakdown lane, and wide-open alignment {{built for}} high speeds all {{contributed to a}} high number of crashes. Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City passed an ordinance in November 1933 banning trucks from its section of the skyway, which effectively banned them from the whole road. Enforcement began on January 15, 1934, when Jersey City police began arresting truck drivers using the skyway. The New Jersey State Highway Commission approved the ban on January 23.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} enemies: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which {{requires}} two hits to flip over; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping {{and can only}} be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice, which turns platforms into <b>slippery</b> ice. When bumped from below, the Slipice dies immediately instead of flipping over; these enemies do not count toward the total number that must be defeated to complete a phase. All iced platforms return to normal {{at the start of}} each new phase.|$|E
5|$|Unlike , {{a fellow}} American-Hawaiian ship that was plagued with labor difficulties, Kentuckian {{seems to have}} escaped much of the {{maritime}} labor turmoil of the mid-1930s. One incident was reported by the Los Angeles Times in August 1936. The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was <b>slippery</b> and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{not only}} affects {{in-flight}} operations but can affect ground-based airport operations as well. Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create <b>slippery</b> runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft. Ash accumulation {{of more than}} a few millimeters requires removal before airports can resume full operations. Ash does not disappear (unlike snowfalls) and must be disposed of in a manner that prevents it from being remobilised by wind and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|While RCT-31 {{was under}} siege, Almond finally {{instructed}} the 1st Marine Division to rescue RCT-31 by {{breaking out of}} Yudam-ni—an impossible order for Smith to implement. Only the 31st Tank Company tried to rescue RCT-31 by attacking Hill 1221, but without infantry support, the two armored attacks on 28 and 29 November were stalled by <b>slippery</b> roads, rough terrain, and close infantry assaults. By 30 November the US forces evacuated Hudong-ni in order to defend Hagaru-ri, leaving the rest of RCT-31 completely stranded.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal <b>slippery</b> and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and <b>slippery</b> ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a <b>slippery</b> surface in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog <b>slippery</b> and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{started from}} the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the start. There he {{remained}} to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's induction system during a pit stop, costing him {{three and a half}} minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit <b>slippery</b> and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an average speed of , and cemented his reputation as the Regenmeister.|$|E
5|$|During the La Course by Le Tour de France {{the rain}} poured down {{and made the}} course and cobbles <b>slippery.</b> Van Dijk was {{involved}} {{by one of the}} many crashes. She broke het collarbone and had to abandon the race. At home she had installed a high-altitiude tent, and with a speedy recovery she went with Iris Slappendel to Switzerland to train at high altitude. Six weeks after her crash she could race again and started in the 2015 Boels Rental Ladies Tour on 1 September. She rode in the stage race stronger every day and finished second in the time trial, two seconds behind of Lisa Brennauer. She moved to the third place in the general classification and was able to keep this position.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, {{two people}} died of {{injuries}} suffered from <b>slippery</b> roads. One man drowned in El Centro. and two people drowned when their cars tumbled {{into the water}} near the city. Record flood stage was attained at numerous streams near the Coachella Valley. Widespread property damage was recorded on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada {{as well as the}} nearby desert. Across the San Joaquin Valley, 2/3 of the $150 million raisin crop was threatened. Crops including cotton, lettuce, and hay were damaged. About half of the lettuce in the Palo Verde Valley were lost.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, <b>slippery</b> road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon recorded the fastest lap, ahead of Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe, the Andretti Autosport car of Tony Kanaan and Briscoe's teammate Will Power. Due to the <b>slippery</b> {{nature of the}} circuit, drivers were caught out and ended up inflicting damage to their cars. Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the escape road before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position. Other drivers to hit the wall included Romancini and Milka Duno. Incidents continued in the second practice session, with no less than five drivers spinning or making {{contact with the outside}} retaining walls. The session saw the same top four drivers as the first session.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known {{for his ability to}} improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in <b>slippery</b> conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with less than a minute left by swinging around the goalpost with his arm to get open.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is a bolete fungus, and {{the type}} species of the genus Suillus. A common fungus native to Eurasia, from the British Isles to Korea, it has been {{introduced}} widely elsewhere, including North and South America, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Commonly referred to as <b>slippery</b> jack or sticky bun in English-speaking countries, its names refer to the brown cap, which is characteristically slimy in wet conditions. The fungus, initially described as Boletus luteus by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, is now classified in a different family as well as genus. Suillus luteus is edible, though not as highly regarded as other bolete mushrooms, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, stews or fried dishes. The slime coating, however, may cause indigestion if not removed before eating.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{ended with}} an 11–3 record the {{following}} year and comfortably won the East {{for the second year}} in a row. That set up a second straight appearance in the NFL Championship game in Green Bay against the Packers. The teams battled it out on a <b>slippery,</b> mucky Lambeau Field on January 2, 1966. While score was close early on, Vince Lombardi's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half, winning 23–12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown. Despite Jim Brown's retirement after the 1965 season, the Browns had another four consecutive winning seasons and advanced to the NFL championship game in 1968 and 1969 under Collier, but lost both times.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting tandem axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on <b>slippery</b> surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or <b>slippery</b> terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were <b>slippery</b> from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E
5|$|Bradman’s batsmen {{set about}} {{building}} on their lead and Lindwall was initially {{not expected to}} bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch {{on the fourth day}} so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a <b>slippery</b> surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.|$|E
5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the <b>slippery</b> run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
