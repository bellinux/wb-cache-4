40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the variability in spark assisted chemical engraving (SACE) gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> in glass. SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory. One problem SACE faces is it has issues with reproducibility. This is why the variability of the process is studied here. The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling.</b> This goal is accomplished through three steps. First, the process is modeled to provide an efficient way to quantify variability. Two new stochastic models are presented that relate the depth evolution of SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> to the voltage. Statistical tests are used to validate the models. Second, experimental studies of the variability of the depth evolution are discussed. The effect on the variability of having poorly regulated bulk electrolyte temperature and level is studied. Finally, experimental results from two feedback controllers that are capable of reducing the variability in SACE gravity <b>feed</b> <b>drilling</b> are discussed. The results from these controllers are compared with the predictions of one of the models developed...|$|R

The problem faced is the damage that often occurs suddenly on the blowmould machine so that corrective maintenance must be done. The purpose of this research is to know the cause of the damage and to propose the action plan to minimize downtime. The method used is Reliability Centered Maintenance to determine the selection of action and time interval of replacement for critical components on the blowmould machine. From the FMEA analysis, it is known that the critical components of each blowmould machine subsystem are bearing <b>roller</b> <b>feed,</b> mandrel, seal gasket, and fitting. The results of LTA analysis are the category of failure (outage problem and economic problem) and the selection of action for the critical component (time directed). From the calculation of Total Minimum Downtime, known that the replacement schedule for critical component are 23 days for bearing <b>roller</b> <b>feed,</b> 9 days for mandrel, 8 days for seal gasket, and 8 days for fitting, that is resulting in decreased downtime of 1. 56 % with a value of 99. 63 % availabilit...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into material wrinkling failure mechanics of conventional metal spinning {{and the effects}} of process parameters and material properties are presented in this paper. By developing finite element (FE) models using the Box-Behnken design of experiments, the effects of six key process and material parameters on the start of material wrinkling have been investigated. These key factors include <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> per pass, feed rate, blank thickness, tool path profile, material Young’s modulus, yield stress and strain hardening exponent. The results of FE simulation are validated by comparing the modelled roller tool forces and spun part end shape with those measured during a spinning experiment. From FE simulations, large residual stresses in the form of bending moments are found to be present in the flange of the blank, induced by the roller contact. It is found that material wrinkling failure begins when a plastic hinge is formed between the roller and the edge of the blank. It is found that both <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> per pass and feed rate produce the most significant effect on the initiation of wrinkling failure, as they increase the bending stresses causing a plastic hinge to form more rapidly, thus wrinkling to occur more quickly...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlow forming is {{gradually}} employed in production of high precision seamless {{components in the}} field of aerospace and defense. Rocket & missile casing, rocket motor case, cartridge case, rocket nose cones are few examples of flow forming process. The nature of process is non linear with complex deformation behavior. There are mainly two strategies used during the process viz. forward and backward/reverse. In forward method, the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> and material deformation is same and in reverse method, the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> and material deformation is opposite. Usually there are three force components encountered during the process i. e. axial, radial and circumferential. The understanding and knowledge of forces are crucial for tooling design for various geometrical and material conditions. The online force measurement during the process is quite difficult in commercial machines. Therefore, a simulation model is developed to estimate forces during the process. Taguchi L 9 design has been used to develop the model because it is a well established design of experiment method to solve complex and time consuming problems. Three levels of three operating variables (rotational speed, axial feed and depth of forming) along with friction factor have been used during the study. The material utilized as Aluminum Alloy 6063 due to its light weight, excellent corrosion resistance, recyclable, cost effectiveness, ease of availability, durability etc. It has been observed that axial force is found to be highest followed by the radial and circumferential force. Also it has been discerned that axial feed and friction factor are the most prominent factors affecting axial and circumferential forces during the process. Further, radial force is influenced by friction factor only. The effect on von mises stress and equivalent plastic strain also studied and reported...|$|R

This paper investigates {{the effects of}} drilling parameter such as spindle speed, <b>feed</b> rate and <b>drill</b> diameter on the surface roughness and surface texture of drilled hole by applying RSM. There are three factors (spindle speed, <b>feed</b> rate and <b>drill</b> diameter) under investigation, therefore, by applying RSM there will be 20 experimental observations. The minimum surface roughness measured for the hole was 1. 06 μm at combination of 2000 rpm spindle speed, 78 mm/min feed rate and 2. 5 mm drill diameter. While the maximum surface roughness of 2. 59 μm was measured at the combination of 250 rpm spindle speed, 153 mm/min feed rate and 3. 5 mm drill diameter. One factor plot analysis found that the most significant parameter was spindle speed followed by <b>drill</b> diameter and <b>feed</b> rate. Thus, surface roughness decreased when increasing the spindle speed, <b>feed</b> rate and <b>drill</b> diameter. There were interactions between all the parameter of spindle speed, <b>feed</b> rate and <b>drill</b> diameter in drilling process under investigation...|$|R

Wear will be minimum for rubber material with high hardness but indeed it pronounce the breakage of rice. Hence, for efficient husking the rubber roll material should possess the balance of physico-mechanical properties. Rice breakage depends on several other parameters like the type of harvest, drying temperature, drying methods, physical characteristics of paddy, husking characteristics, paddy moisture content, rubber roller speed, rubber roll pressure, paddy feed rate and fissures.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{wrinkling}} {{failure in}} conventional spinning of a cylindrical cup {{has been investigated}} by using both finite element (FE) analysis and experimental methods. FE simulation models of a spinning experiment have been developed using the explicit finite element solution method provided by the software Abaqus. The severity of wrinkles is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the radial coordinates of element nodes {{on the edge of}} the workpiece obtained from the FE models. The results show that the severity of wrinkles tends to increase when increasing the <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> ratio. A forming limit study for wrinkling has been carried out and shows that there is a feed ratio limit beyond which the wrinkling failure will take place. Provided that the feed ratio is kept below this limit, the wrinkling failure can be prevented. It is believed that high compressive tangential stresses in the local forming zone are the causes of the wrinkling failure. Furthermore, the computational performance of the solid and shell elements in simulat-ing the spinning process are examined and the tool forces obtained from wrinkling and wrinkle-free models are compared. Finally, the effects of the feed ratio on variations of the wall thickness of the spun cylindrical cup are investigated...|$|R
