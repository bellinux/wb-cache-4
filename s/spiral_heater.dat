40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation of double spiral shape micro-heater using ANSYS 10. 0 and MATLAB, which requires 12. 5 mW- 78. 3 mW powers to create the temperature 181 °C- 1002 °C for gas sensing applications. The results obtained from ANSYS simulation were verified using MATLAB Tool. A platinum-based bulk micro-machined hotplate of size 500 mm × 500 mm has been designed for fabrication as a multi-layer structure on a silicon substrate with thermal silicon dioxide as the supporting membrane, followed by LPCVD (Low pressure chemical vapor deposition) silicon nitride film. Gas sensing film (SnO 2) will be deposited on the interdigitated Pt electrodes formed on the PECVD oxide layer. The temperature uniformity of microhotplate (as {{it is essential for}} better sensing mechanism) based on double <b>spiral</b> <b>heater</b> has been reported in this paper. To estimate the resistance of the Pt heater, a 2000 Aº thick platinum film has been deposited by sputtering on silicon and its sheet resistance has been measured as 2. 5 Ohm/□. We have used this value to calculate the resistance of Pt resistor, which was found 319 Ohm. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{framework}} of thermal sensor-actuator structures is proposed for measuring the parameters pressure p, dynamic viscosity μ, thermal conductivity, specific heat c, density and fluid velocity v. All structures are based on simple resistive elements {{that can be used}} as actuator and sensor simultaneously. Making use of a lot of simple structures has an added value: an array of resistors makes it possible to eliminate the Temperature Coefficient of Resistance of the metal by measuring the quotient of the temperature distribution of the array to the temperature at the center. The shape of the temperature distribution is determined by the heat transfer through the carrier to the support and the heat transfer to the fluid. Using the temperature distribution the loss of heat to the support can be taken into account, independent of the applied fluid, pressure or flow. The design considerations for the structures are given and the measurement methods are discussed. Each structure has been optimized for a certain parameter by taking a specific geometry: a thin or a thick beam or a membrane, near or far away from a heat sink and with or without forced convection. The basic element is a heater along the center of the beam. The heater is divided into segments that are connected individually. Making use of four points measurements we are able to measure the temperature distribution. The shape of the temperature distribution depends on the heat transfer from the beam to the support and the heat transfer by conduction and forced convection from the beam to the fluid. Based on this principle a flow sensor, a v-grooved Pirani sensor and a bending membrane pressure sensor with thermal readout have been fabricated and characterized. Two types of flow sensors with distributed temperature sensing are presented: a probe having a thin beam between the ends of two legs and several beams in a micromachined hexagonal channel. The cooling down of the probe by a uniform flow can be described by a one dimensional differential equation in carthesian coordinates. In the micromachined channel the parabolic flow profile will result in a dip in the temperature distribution at the center. A lumped element model has been used for calculating the temperature distribution. DC measurements are carried out for the gases nitrogen, carbondioxide and helium on beams having 25 segments. A thermal conductivity sensor consisting of a thin beam with distributed temperature sensing above a v-grooved heat sink has been discussed. For characteristic lengths smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules the thermal conductivity depends on pressure, which makes it suitable as a pressure sensor. The heater has five segments. The model takes in account that the temperature has been averaged over a segment in stead of being measured in a single point. For a characteristic length of 20 μm a transition pressure of about 20 mbar has been found. The possibility of taking the heat transfer to the support in account enlarges the measurent range. A mechanical pressure sensor with thermal readout is shown. A differential pressure over a thin circular membrane results in a deflection. The membrane is placed 1 μm above a heat sink. The heat transfer from the membrane to the heat sink depends on the deflection. Two types of sensors have been realized: one with a <b>spiral</b> <b>heater</b> and one with a meandering heater with distributed sensing. The transition pressures are around 0. 2 bar. For the non-deflected membrane an analytical model can be derived, like done for the flow sensor with uniform flow profile except using cylindrical coordinates. For a deflected membrane a lumped element model has been used. A dip arises in the temperature distribution, like for the flow sensor with parabolic flow profile, when the membrane deflects towards the heat sink. The thermal conductivity of the fluid between the membrane and heat sink depends on the pressure, like for the v-grooved pressure sensor. A second sensor is needed to compensate for this and {{can also be used to}} measure the absolute pressure. The designs of the TCR-sensor and kinematic viscosity sensors have been fabricated. The two versions of the TCR-sensor consist of a thick beam with distributed temperature sensing. One has a heater with five segments, the other only a heater at the center and several sensors at on side. From the known temperature distribution, given by the thermal properties of the beam, and the electrical resistance the TCR can be obtained...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{response}} of a marine heat flow probe has been modelled in detail by a semi-analytic solution for a 1 -D multi-layered cylinder. The simulation {{was done for}} the probe used for measurements reported by Lister et al. (1990). These measure-ments were reduced by the conventional method of subtracting a time delay to maximize the linearity of temperature plotted against Bullard's (1954) F (a, z) function. The frictional heating from entry into the sea-floor could be extrapolated to equilibrium {{by the use of}} small, but rather variable, time delay. However, the decays from a calibrated heat pulse, used to calculate thermal conductivity, required large time delays that increased up the probe. We have found that the heater-pulse decays are correctly reproduced by a multi-cylindrical model corresponding to the measured dimensions and materials of probe construction, except for some super heating at early times due to the non-cylindrical nature of the <b>heater</b> <b>spiral.</b> The increase in delay up the probe is modelled well by the increasing thermal resistance of incomplete oil fill between probe contents and metal probe, and not by any plausible disturbed sediment layer outside that tube.
