50|$|In {{comparison}} to most other knives, which are commonly heat {{treated to a}} very high degree of hardness, many machete blades are tempered to maximum toughness, often nearly <b>spring</b> <b>tempered.</b> This results in a tougher blade, more resistant to chipping and breaking, with an edge that is easier to sharpen but does not retain sharpness as well, due to its lower hardness.|$|R
40|$|Seats {{have been}} {{developed}} and optimized with an anti-vibration suspension system (<b>Tempered</b> <b>Springs)</b> for agricultural tractor. These seats were examined and determined their static and dynamic physical characteristics. These seats are designed {{on the basis of}} ISO standards. An artificial track was constructed to simulate a farm field based on BIS (Bureau of Indian Standard) and to examine vibration the transmissibility of the seats when installed in tractor. The results indicated that the transmissibility from under the seat to on the seat in the vertical direction (Oblique <b>Tempered</b> <b>Spring</b> Q) was approximately 0. 22, although little reduction of vibration was observed in the fore-aft direction. The results of these experiments indicate that significant differences exist between the characteristics of <b>tempered</b> <b>springs</b> and non- <b>tempered</b> <b>springs</b> of seat. This suggests that the oblique seats with <b>tempered</b> <b>springs</b> are applicable to the agricultural field. Considerable effort has been made to establish the optimum design parameters for tractor seats. Further reductions in the level of ride vibrations experienced by tractor seats appear to be necessary and some possible methods of achieving significant improvements have been outlined. These methods have led to the evolution of several seat suspension systems and emphasize the use of the principles of ergonomics in the operator's seat design. In this paper, a review of the work done in this area, particularly with respect to tractor seat, is presented and discussed. Standardized (ISO) methods of agricultural vehicle WBV measurement require further development to permit quantification of the likely effectiveness of tractor WBV-reducing design features during in-field operation(s).

A vague shadow glided swiftly among the trees. An enormous white wolf appeared, vanished, came near them again, and crouched down under a low spruce branch waiting.|$|R
40|$|Dynamo (DYNAmic MOtion capture) is an {{approach}} to controlling animated characters in a dynamic virtual world. Leveraging existing methods, characters are simultaneously physically simulated and driven to perform kinematic motion (from mocap or other sources). Continuous simulation allows characters to interact more realistically than methods that alternate between ragdoll simulation and pure motion capture. The novel contributions of Dynamo are world-space torques for increased stability and a weak root spring for plausible balance. Promoting joint target angles from the traditional parent-bone reference frame to the world-space reference frame allows a character to set and maintain poses robust to dynamic interactions. It also produces physically plausible transitions between motions without explicit blending. These properties are maintained {{over a wide range}} of servo gain constants, making Dynamo significantly easier to tune than parent-space control systems. The weak root <b>spring</b> <b>tempers</b> our world-space model to account for external constraints that should break balance. This root spring provides an adjustable parameter that allows characters to fall when significantly unbalanced or struck with extreme force. We demonstrate Dynamo through in-game simulations of characters walking, running, jumping, and fighting on uneven terrain while experiencing dynamic external forces. We show that an implementation using standard physics (ODE) and graphics (G 3 D/OpenGL) engines can drive game-like applications with hundreds of rigid bodies and tens of characters, using about 0. 002 s of CPU time per frame.

50|$|Tempering is {{a process}} of heat treating, which is used to {{increase}} the toughness of iron-based alloys. Tempering is usually performed after hardening, to reduce some of the excess hardness, and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time, then allowing it to cool in still air. The exact temperature determines the amount of hardness removed, and depends on both the specific composition of the alloy and on the desired properties in the finished product. For instance, very hard tools are often tempered at low temperatures, while <b>springs</b> are <b>tempered</b> to much higher temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The work {{hardening}} {{effect of the}} shot peening affected layer of hardened and low temperature <b>tempered</b> <b>spring</b> steel was investigated using the method for determining the yield strength of a metallic surface with biaxial residual stress. The results show that for the surface layer of the specimens, the microhardness and half-width values of X-ray diffraction lines is decreased, whereas the yield strength is increased during shot peening. Thus, shot peening leads the surface layer of steel in hard state to {{work hardening}} instead of work softening...|$|R

50|$|The {{tempering}} colors {{can be used}} {{to judge}} the final properties of the tempered steel. Very hard tools are often tempered in the light to dark straw range, whereas <b>springs</b> are often <b>tempered</b> to the blue. However, the final hardness of the tempered steel will vary, depending on the composition of the steel. Higher-carbon tool steel will remain much harder after <b>tempering</b> than <b>spring</b> steel (of slightly less carbon) when tempered at the same temperature. The oxide film will also increase in thickness over time. Therefore, steel that has been held at 400˚F {{for a very long time}} may turn brown or purple, even though the temperature never exceeded that needed to produce a light straw color. Other factors affecting the final outcome are oil films on the surface and the type of heat source used.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of heat treatment (Normalizing and Hardening) on the mechanical properties of springs. The springs were made from mild steel rod having a diameter of 6 mm, a total of 15 springs were made. The springs were then subjected to various heat treatment processes which included; normalizing, hardening and tempering. The heat treated springs were then subjected to various test in other to determine their mechanical properties, these included; impact toughness test, hardness test and tension test. The normalized spring had more strength, was harder and was much tougher than both the annealed and as received springs. The water quenched springs were the hardest of all the heat treated springs, were very brittle and had the lowest percentage elongation. Their strength was also {{lower than that of}} the normalized and as received springs. The water quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>springs</b> had better mechanical properties required for spring making, they had the optimum combination of hardness, strength and tough-ness when compared with the other heat treated springs...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a brief}} silence which Jimmy, at least, found embarrassing, for {{it seemed}} to him that {{everybody}} was watching the two girls with sudden interest. He also felt that when Anthea Merril moved forward, Eleanor, as it were, receded into second place against her will. His sister was wholly Western, tall, and somewhat spare, with the suppleness of a finely <b>tempered</b> <b>spring</b> rather than that of the willow in her figure. Her quick glance and almost incisive speech matched her bearing. One could see that she was optimistic, daring, strenuous; but with Anthea Merril it was different. There was a reserve about her, and a repose in voice and gesture which in some curious fashion made both more impressive. She was also a trifle warmer in coloring and fuller in outline, and stood for, or so it seemed to Jimmy, cultivated ripeness as contrasted with his sister's vigorous and brilliant crudity. Quite apart from this, he had noticed Eleanor's brows straighten almost imperceptibly, and the slight hardness that crept into her eyes. The others apparently did not see it, but her brother understood those signs.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{had already}} {{provided}} herself with somber garments, and they emphasized {{the severity of}} contour of her supple figure. They also forced up the pallor of her face, which was relieved only by a faint blotch of color in either cheek, and, in spite of this, in a curious fashion made her beautiful. Jimmy had hitherto admitted that his sister was pretty, but, as he recognized, that word was not the right one now. She was imperious, dominant, a force embodied in a woman's shape, and her brother was vaguely conscious that he shrank a little from her. Eleanor {{did not seem to}} want his sympathy. The coldness of her face repelled him, the fastidious neatness of her gold-bronze hair appeared unnatural, and her pale-blue eyes had a hard glitter like that of a diamond in them. It was evident that in place of being crushed, she was filled with an intense suppressed virility. Indeed, there was something in her appearance and manner that was suggestive of a beautifully <b>tempered</b> <b>spring,</b> one that would fly back the moment the strain slackened, and, perhaps, cut deep into the hand that compressed it. It was the girl who spoke first, and her voice had a certain incisive quality in its evenness.|$|R
60|$|Another {{bitterness}} in her cup at {{this period}} was her inability to revive Fan's interest in sacred things, for {{she had begun to}} notice an increasing indifference in the girl. All the religious teaching, over which she had spent so much time and labour, seemed to have failed of its effect. She had planted, apparently in the most promising soil, and the vicar and the vicar's wife had watered, and God had not given the increase. This was a new mystery which she could not understand, in spite of much pondering over it, much praying for light, and many conversations on the subject with her religious friends. So sweet and good and pure- hearted and pliant a girl; but alas! alas! it was only that ephemeral fictitious kind of goodness which <b>springs</b> from <b>temper</b> or disposition, which has no value in the eyes of Heaven, cannot stand the shocks of time and circumstance. It was not through any remissness of her own; she had never ceased her efforts, yet now after many months she was fain to confess that this young girl, who had promised such great things, seemed further than at the beginning from that holiness which is not of the earth, and which delights only in the contemplation of heavenly things. She could see it now with what painful clearness! for her eyes in such matters were preternaturally sharp, like those of a sailor who has followed the sea all his life with regard to atmospheric changes; no sooner would the lesson begin than all brightness would fade from that too expressive countenance, and the girl would listen with manifest effort, striving to keep her attention from wandering, striving to understand and to respond; but there was no response from the heart, and in spite of striving her thoughts, her soul, were elsewhere, and her eyes wore a distant wistful look. And Mrs. Churton was hot-tempered; in all the years of her self-discipline she {{had never been able to}} wring from her heart that one drop of black blood; and sometimes when she talked to Fan, and read and prayed with her, and noticed that impassive look coming over her face to quench its brightness like a cloud, her old enemy would get the best of her, and she would start up and hurriedly leave the room without a word, lest it should betray her into passionate expression.|$|R
