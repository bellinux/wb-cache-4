40|$|The {{efficient}} {{assembly and}} manufacturing of micro-components are becoming ever more important with the technological industry becoming larger and the electronic components {{in this industry}} decreasing in size. This is why the efficient handling of micro-parts is becoming a great challenge, with micro-parts with dimensions less than 20 mm being handled during the assembly process. Mechanical and vacuum grippers currently utilized in this field pose a risk of the micro-parts being strained or broken during the handling process. Therefore, this paper presents a solution through using a single polyurethane gripper, actuated only by Van-der-Waals forces. This polyurethane gripper is more efficient than conventional micro-grippers, and can handle and assemble simultaneously up to 10 micro-parts without leaving residual stresses, charges and strains on the micro-components. Polyurethane micro-grippers do not require a power supply or pressurized air to be operated. A motoman robot coupled with different polyurethane grippers was utilized to perform the simultaneous <b>pick-up,</b> <b>transfer</b> and placement operations of up to 10 micro-elements of less than 20 mm dimensions in an assembly operation...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} magnetic <b>pick-up</b> coil <b>transfer</b> functions on mode number analysis in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Magnetic probes mounted inside the vacuum chamber are widely used to characterize the mode structure of magnetohydrodynamic modes, as, due to their relative simplicity and compact nature, several coils can be distributed over the vessel. Phase differences between the transfer functions of different magnetic pick-up coils lead to systematic errors in time- and frequency resolved mode number analysis. This paper presents the first in-situ, end-to-end calibration of a magnetic pick-up coil system which {{was carried out by}} using an in-vessel driving coil on ASDEX Upgrade. The effect of the phase differences in the <b>pick-up</b> coil <b>transfer</b> functions is most significant in the 50 - 250 kHz frequency range, where the relative phase shift between the different probes can be up to 1 radian (60). By applying a correction based on the transfer functions we found smaller residuals of mode number fitting in the considered discharges. In most cases an order of magnitude improvement was observed in the residuals of the mode number fits, which could open the way to investigate weaker electromagnetic oscillations with even high mode numbers...|$|R

40|$|Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) is a {{promising}} material for electronic and mechanical micro- and nanodevices. Here we introduce a versatile pick-up and drop technique {{that makes it}} possible to investigate the electrical, optical and mechanical properties of as-grown NCD films. Using this technique, NCD nanosheets, as thin as 55 nm, can be picked-up from a growth substrate and positioned on another substrate. As a proof of concept, electronic devices and mechanical resonators are fabricated and their properties are characterized. In addition, the versatility of the method is further explored by transferring NCD nanosheets onto an optical fibre, which allows measuring its optical absorption. Finally, we show that NCD nanosheets can also be transferred onto 2 D crystals, such as MoS 2, to fabricate heterostructures. <b>Pick-up</b> and drop <b>transfer</b> enables the fabrication of a variety of NCD-based devices without requiring lithography or wet processing.

40|$|Oxide scale {{behaviour}} in thermomechanical processing {{has been}} the subject of intensive research for several years that allowed development of a finite element (FE) based model to simulate a range of events of relevance to the process and to the surface quality of the hot rolled product. Oxide scale failure is predicted taking into account the main physical phenomena such as stress-directed diffusion, fracture and adhesion of the oxide scale, strain, strain rate and temperature. The most critical parameters for scale failure are measured during modified hot tensile testing and depend on the morphology of the particular oxide scale, scale growth temperature, and are also very sensitive to the chemical composition of the underlying metal. The work integrates finite element analysis with a range of experiments each to provide partial insight into oxide fracture, friction, heat <b>transfer,</b> <b>pick-up</b> and descaling, amongst others. An overview of this research is presented, revealing a variety of phenomena of considerable technological importance...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze the non-thermal loss rates of O+, O 2 + and CO 2 + ions over the last 4. 5 billion years (Gyr) in the Martian history by using a 3 D hybrid model. For this reason we derived the past solar wind {{conditions}} in detail. We {{take into account the}} intensified particle flux of the early Sun as well as an Martian atmosphere, which was exposed to a sun's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation flux 4. 5 Gyr ago that was 100 times stronger than today. Furthermore, we model the evolution of the interplanetary magnetic field by a Weber & Davis solar wind model. The ‘external’ influences of the Sun's radiation flux and solar wind flux lead to the formation of an ionospheric obstacle by photoionization, charge exchange and electron impact. For the early Martian conditions we could show that charge exchange was the dominant ionization mechanism. Several hybrid simulations for different stages {{in the evolution of the}} Martian atmosphere, at 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 100 EUV, were performed to analyze the non-thermal escape processes by ion <b>pick-up,</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> from the solar wind to the ionosphere and detached ionospheric plasma clouds. Our results show a non-linear evolution of the loss rates. Using mean solar wind parameters the simulations result in an oxygen loss equivalent to the depth of a global Martian ocean of about 2. 6 m over the last 4. 5 Gyr. The induced magnetic field strength could be increased up to about 2000 nT. A simulation run with high solar wind density results in an oxygen loss of a Martian ocean up to 205 m depth during 150 million years after the sun reached the zero age mean sequence (ZAMS) ...|$|R
40|$|Naked DNA is a {{non-toxic}} vector for {{therapeutic gene}} delivery. However, current methods of transfection with naked DNA reach a {{limited range of}} susceptible tissues and have a low efficiency. The transfection of clinically important post-mitotic cells is particularly challenging because in these cells DNA need to pass the nuclear barrier. Thus, new principles for the transfer of naked DNA into human cells are required {{and can be found}} among the genetic exchange mechanisms in bacteria, where gene entry into cells via <b>pick-up</b> and <b>transfer</b> of naked DNA is known as “transformation”. In a number of bacteria, dedicated molecular machinery facilitates cell entry of free DNA by the process of “natural transformation”. In transformation-competent bacterial cells, specialised protein complexes mediate the binding of free double-stranded DNA, its fragmentation, cell entry and conversion to single-stranded DNA. I propose to exploit bacterial natural transformation machinery for a two-step transfection of human cells with therapeutic naked DNA. Firstly, the bacterial transformation protein complexes are inserted into the plasma membranes or nuclear envelopes of the target human cells and, secondly, the double-stranded vector DNA is supplied for the processing by the installed DNA transfer apparatus. I hypothesize that non-toxic bacterial transformation complexes residing in their new human milieu can promote the ultra-efficient transfer of exogenous therapeutic naked DNA. As the introduction of DNA into mammalian cells by non-viral means is called “transfection”, I propose to name the bacterial transformation complexes functioning in their new eukaryotic surroundings as “transfectosomes”. The initial step of the gene delivery should exploit the modern methods of extraneous protein insertion into mammalian cells, such as cell painting, engineering of cell permeable proteins with targeted intracellular localization, physical techniques of protein transfer like electroinsertion and electroporation. Sequence-selective natural transformation systems are known and can be taken advantage of to exclude undesired (e. g. gene silencing) portions of vector DNA from entering human nucleoplasm. Improved transfectosomes can possibly be engineered for better establishment and performance in human membranes. The hypothesis can be tested by comparing the naked DNA transfer efficiency into the transfectosome-bearing and the naive human cells in ex-vivo and in-vivo gene therapy settings. Immunogenicity of the transfectosomes can be modulated by protein engineering. As the delivered fragments of single-stranded DNA are highly recombinogenic, the confirmation of the hypothesis can lead to a breakthrough in gene repair therapy of dominantly inherited familial hypercholesterolemia, polycystic kidney disease and trinucleotide repeat disorders.

40|$|Purpose Apart from freezing/thawing related cryodamage, several {{additional}} {{factors have}} been identified as major players in the reduction of success rates after frozen embryo transfers. The post-thaw culture is particularly relevant as it may amplify environmental influences over a stressed em-bryo. In the present study the influence of the post-thaw culture duration on the implantation and developmental potential of cleavage stage embryos was evaluated. Methods In this retrospective evaluation, that spanned an 8 -year period, 631 frozen-thawed embryos were allocated to one of two study groups, depending on their post-thaw culture period: 1) the long (18 – 24 h), or 2) the short (2 – 5 h) culture group. Groups were compared regarding im-plantation rate and live birth rate per embryo transferred. This comparison was corrected for the most common confounding factors such as maternal age at oocyte <b>pick-up,</b> number of <b>transferred</b> embryos, developmental day at freezing, blastomere survival after thawing, catheter used for transfer and year of procedure. Results Implantation and live birth rate per embryo trans-ferred were inversely related to the duration of the post-thaw culture, as diminishing this period significantly increased both rates. Moreover, no advantage could be found for a long post-thaw culture period, even for embryos with ob-served mitotic activity. Conclusion This retrospective analysis indicates that a short post-thaw culture period is associated with higher implanta-tion and live birth rates per embryo. This study supports selection of frozen-thawed embryos strictly based on blasto-mere cryosurvival and raises the hypothesis that environmen-tal factors may have an important role on embryo implantation and developmental potential during post-thaw culture...|$|R
40|$|Background: Different {{combination}} of gonadotropin preparation {{has been introduced}} with no definite superiority of one over others in in vitro fertilization (IVF), but individualized regimens for each patient are needed. Objective: The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of controlled ovarian stimulation with recombinant- follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH) plus recombinant-luteinizing hormone (rLH) versus human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) plus r-FSH on fertility outcomes in IVF patients. Materials and Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial study that was performed from October 2014 -April 2016 on 140 infertile patients with a set of inclusion criteria that referred to infertility clinics in Vali- asr and Gandhi Hospital in Tehran. The women were randomly divided into two treatment groups. The first group (n= 70) received rFSH from the second day of cycle and was added HMG in 6 th day and the 2 nd group (n= 70), received rFSH from the second day of cycle and was added recombinant-LH in 6 th day. Then ovum <b>Pick-Up</b> and embryo <b>transfer</b> were performed. In this study, we assessed the outcomes such as; chemical and clinical pregnancy rate, live birth and abortion rate. Results: Number of follicles in ovaries, total number of oocytes or M 2 oocytes and quality of fetuses has no significant differences between two groups (p> 0. 05). Total number of fetuses were significantly higher in patients who received rFSH + HMG (p= 0. 02). Fertility outcomes consisted of: live birth rate, chemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rate were higher in rFSH + HMG group in comparison to rFSH +r-LH group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: It seems that in IVF patients, HMG + rFSH used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation have better effects on fertility outcomes, but in order to verify the results, it is recommended to implement studies on more patients...|$|R
