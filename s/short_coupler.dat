40|$|Twin core {{nonlinear}} couplers {{that include}} gain and loss are examined. Of various structures (ranging from couplers {{composed of two}} active cores and two lossy cores to those composed of one active or lossy core and one conventional core) considered, the most interesting case is the coupler composed of' one core {{with a certain amount}} of gain and the other core with an equal amount of loss where ideal low power switching is possible in a comparatively <b>short</b> <b>coupler.</b> The presence of gain in one core is found to be responsible for reduction in switching power and/or shortening in the device length, while the introduction of the loss in the other core plays a role of idealizing switching. A physical model is also presented to explain the demonstrated merits based on the operation of linear couplers with gain and loss...|$|E

40|$|A {{fabrication}} {{technique for}} fused taper couplers is described. Coupling coefficients are calculated for fibres with raised, depressed and matched refractive-index profiles, and optimum V-values for coupling are found. These suggest a <b>shorter</b> <b>coupler</b> geometry differing from the biconical taper. The high taper loss in depressed cladding fibres {{is shown to}} correspond {{to the presence of}} the leaky LP-mode. The wavelength response has been measured for various couplers and fitted theoretically. Coupling periods as small as 12 nm demonstrate potential use for couplers as wavelength-division multiplexers. The dependence of coupling on the refractive index of the surrounding medium has been measured. Thus couplers have also demonstrated potential as temperature sensors and optical switche...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first {{microring}} resonators device fabrication at wafer-level using adhesive bonding with BCB (benzocyclobutene) intermediate layers. The vertical coupling concept was used {{because it offers}} major advantages: Realisation of ultra <b>short</b> <b>couplers</b> (some tens of micron); coupling strength can be precisely controlled with epitaxial growth accuracy; material composition and pattern of the passive and active waveguides can be optimised independently (optical I/O ports are located in a passive, transparent optical lower waveguide layer vertically coupled to an active, highly confined upper waveguide layer in which micro-ring cavities are formed). The high warpage in case of using eutectic bonding {{is a result of}} the different thermal expansion of the two substrates and to the rigid interface formed during eutectic bonding. In case of BCB intermediate layers the post-bond warpage is lower as the stress at the bonded interface can relax due to the mechanical properties of BCB after bond process. Preliminary passive devices as shown have been fabricated to proof the wafer bonding and the technological integration concept. Vertically coupled wafer-bonded single ring resonator devices were successfully produced. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{compared}} {{with each other}} that MMIs made of SOI wafers with different thickness of upper Si layer have different properties. MMI coupler made of SOI wafers with thinner Si layer has better self-image effect and <b>shorter</b> <b>coupler</b> length. So SOI wafer with thinner up Si layer is more adapted for MMIs. Besides, a modification that substitute nr in equation(1) by the real refraction index of the core layer {{will lead to more}} accurate parameters of MMIs. Multimode interferences(MMI) based on Silicon-on-Insulator(SOI) are widely used in passive and active waveguide-based devices and planar lightwave circuits, such as switches, couplers, splitters and so on[1]. It is not paid more attention that MMIs made of SOI wafers with different thickness of upper silicon(Si) layer have different performance. In this paper, it {{is compared}} with each other that MMIs made of SOI wafers with upper Si layer 5 μm and 8 μm thick. Generally, SOI waveguide is designed as rib structure, as shown in Fig. 1, in order to satisfy single-mode propagation[2], due to its large refraction index difference. By conventional method, a three dimensional SOI rib waveguide is simplified as a two dimentional structure. It is because that the horizontal size of a rib waveguide is much larger than the vertical dimension. Fig. 1.

A <b>short</b> circuit limiting <b>coupler</b> is designed and the transient and voltage stability studies are performed with a <b>short</b> circuit limiting <b>coupler</b> (SLC) applied at the two 132 kV incoming supply lines from Eskom. The simulations are based 011 solving ordinary loadflow cases augmented with dynamic models of the system elements. Motor loads were modelled in detail incorporating their dynamic characteristics. 75 % of the Sasol Three system load constitute induction motors and 25 % is constant impedance and constant current load models. Power System Simulator (PSS/E) package was utilized in carrying out these studies. The most impressive results {{is the way the}} Sasol Three System recovers in the range of milliseconds when subjected to severe disturbance with regard to voltage and transient stability. With a <b>short</b> circuit limiting <b>coupler</b> included at the two incoming supply lines, the system still recovers after being subjected to a disturbance. In this project it is shown that {{there is no need to}} install {{reactive power compensation}} system on the Sasol Three System. This is because of the capabilities of the present system in regulating reactive power through the network during abnormal system conditions. It is also shown in this thesis that the Sasol Three network is transient and voltage stable when a short circuit limiting reactor is applied at the incoming lines from Eskom. The extent to which the-network is transiently stable is also determined...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} of {{an investigation into the}} detection of partial discharges on the rise of impulse voltages from a point-to-plane gap in SF 6. A parallel RC detection impedance is placed in the earth path of a point. Computer simulations are done to determine the values of R and C that will result in the smallest impulse voltage signal and the largest discharge signal across the detection impedance. These simulations and the experimental work show that the impulse voltage signal can not be sufficiently attenuated during the rise time of the applied voltage impulse using the RC detection impedance alone. An alternative discharge detection method is proposed in which a resonant partial discharge coupler is used. Elimination of noise and the impulse voltage signal can be achieved by <b>shorting</b> the <b>coupler</b> plate to the ground plane {{in the middle of the}} disk. However, due to the bandwidth of the measuring equipment and noise from the impulse generator it was not possible to detect discharges on the rising edge of a 1. 5 s voltage impulse using a <b>coupler</b> <b>shorted</b> in the middle. It was found that for this particular <b>coupler,</b> with no <b>shorting</b> points, and if the rising edge of the voltage impulse is longer than 5 us, ( 10 us) PD activity can be detected on the rising edge...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of photonics with microfluidic techniques {{has been discovered}} {{to be a viable}} new technology to make inexpensive, flexible and reconfigurable devices for many applications ranging from datacom to sensing and biomedical lab on a chip applications [1]. Recently polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gained a lot of interest to fabricate microfluidic flexible channels. Optical waveguides made of PDMS channels filled with nematic liquid crystals (LC), referred as LC:PDMS waveguides, were demonstrated showing polarization independent transmission of light at both visible and near infrared wavelengths [2]. LC molecules are homeotropically aligned to the PDMS surface, without using any alignment layer as usually required in LC standard electro-optic devices. This is due to the interface hydrophobic interaction between the PDMS inner surface and the nematic LC molecules. Such optical waveguides can be made through a standard casting and molding technique, combined with filling procedure by capillarity to infiltrate the LC in its isotropic phase at 80 °C under vacuum in the PDMS channels. Such solution allows the design and fabrication of switchable and tunable devices by exploiting the efficient electro-optic and nonlinear optical effects in LC. One advantage of such approach with respect of classical integrated devices is a strong reduction of the power budget in terms of both energy dissipation and driving power. In this paper we show fabrication techniques and characterization of LC:PDMS waveguides and the potentialities to obtain low consuming power integrated electro-optic devices. As an example we report <b>short</b> directional <b>couplers</b> in view of low power flexible optical switches, which are polarization insensitive with an extinction ratio of over 20 dB at the wavelength of 1550 nm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wafer fusion {{technique}} for realization of compact waveguide switches and three-dimensional (3 -D) photonic integrated circuits is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Calculations based on beam propagation method show that very <b>short</b> vertical directional <b>couplers</b> with coupling lengths from 40 to 220 m and high extinction ratios from 20 to 32 dB can be realized. These extinction ratios {{can be further}} improved using a slight asymmetry in waveguide structure. The optical loss at the fused interface is investigated. Comparison of the transmission loss in InGaAsP-based ridge-loaded waveguide structures with and without a fused layer near the core region, reveals an excess loss of 1. 1 dB/cm at 1. 55 m wavelength. Fused straight vertical directional couplers have been fabricated and characterized. Waveguides separated by 0. 6 m gap layer exhibit a coupling length of 62 m and a switching voltage of about 2. 2 V. Implications for GaAs-based fused couplers for 850 nm applications will also be discussed.

40|$|This thesis reports {{experimental}} and theoretical studies on photonic crystal waveguides in the silicon-on-insulator platform. The work presents a new variant of Fabry-Pérot method for waveguide characterization. In this method, the reflectivity {{at the ends}} of the waveguide under study is enhanced by lithographically patterned mirrors. The thesis also studies a new type of photonic crystal, where the planar photonic crystal lattice is defined with ring-shaped holes (RPhC). By choosing a suitable ring parameter, the RPhC waveguide exhibits low and quasi constant group velocity over a wavelength range of several nanometers. The effect of the modefield width on the dispersion properties of the waveguide is discussed. A <b>short</b> and efficient <b>coupler</b> between the slow mode in an RPhC waveguide and the mode in a conventional silicon waveguide is designed. A relationship between coupling efficiency and the phase match between the coupler mode and the slow mode is observed. These results and observations are important in designing slow-light devices for all-optical signal processing and communication systems. Use of RPhC waveguides in other applications, particularly in biosensing, is also studied. An electron beam writing method that minimizes the writing time of the RPhC lattice is presented. The experimental results on an RPhC waveguide are the first reported for such structure and they show slowdown factors of up to 22 for the group velocity, compared to the group velocity in vacuum...|$|R
