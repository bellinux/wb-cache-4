40|$|The {{ultimate}} photovoltaic efficiencies {{are usually}} determined {{with the use}} of the Shockley-Queisser detail balance theory. Discussed many times and generally accepted as the theoretical efficiency limit for single junction solar cells, the “detailed balance ” in question indicates that the electron (particle) current produced by the solar cell can be equated to the difference between the absorbed and emitted photon fluxes. In the original SQ paper [1], the emitted photon flux was equated to the equilibrium photon flux scaled by the factor (np/ni 2) where n,p and ni are the electron, hole and intrinsic carrier concentrations in the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>converter</b> (the solar cell), respectively. In a later modification, the theory was formulated in terms of the “generalised Planck distribution ” for photons with non-zero chemical potential. Unlike the theoretical treatment of chemical conversion devices such as fuel cell or battery, the voltage generated by the solar cell is almost incidental to this argument. We shall find it useful to obtain it directly, from an argument based on thermodynamics. Suppose that the solar cell is considered as a cavity or “box ” filled with photons which are to be converted into electricity. The box (of volume V, say) is maintained at temperature To, assumed to be equal to the temperature of the surroundings. If multiplied by the electron charge, the voltage generated by the cell is equivalent to the useful work (to be denoted by w) that can be produced for one photon of this radiation. As the process takes place at constant volume, this is equal to the Helmholtz free energy F per photon – in other words, the chemical potential: sTu...|$|E

The main emphasis of this work {{is focused on the}} analysis of phase currents taken by <b>semiconductor</b> <b>converters</b> from a power distribution network which are influenced by circuit dynamic changes. This effect leads to higher distortion of phase currents. There are additional frequency components (interharmonics) presented in the frequency spectrum of these currents. Problems concerning with characteristic and non-characteristic harmonic currents are known. In practice and literature there is less attention concentrated on interharmonic current components. The main attention is paid to 2 types of converters: a three-phase fully controlled bridge rectifier working to inductive load and an uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier with capacitive load which is designed as an input part of the frequency converter for supplying voltage inverters. The harmonic analysis from interharmonic components viewpoint is considered to the changes of load, power source voltage and dynamic changes of firing pulses for semiconductor devices. The interharmonic components magnitudes are not so high in comparison with values of the characteristic and non-characteristic harmonics but may cause interference in neighbouring electronic equipment, distortion of supply voltage, disturbance of connected equipment and losses in power distribution network. The result of this work is an explanation of interharmonics physical patterns arising, including their dependence on the value of effects noticed above.
