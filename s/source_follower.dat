25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, <b>source</b> <b>follower,</b> or cathode follower.|$|E

40|$|Buried channel (BC) MOSFETs {{are known}} to have better noise {{performance}} than surface channel (SC) MOSFETs when used as <b>source</b> <b>followers</b> in modern Charge Coupled Devices (CCD). CMOS image sensors find increasing range of applications and compete with CCDs in high performance imaging, however BC transistors are rarely used in CMOS. As a part of the development of charge storage using BC CCDs in CMOS, we designed and manufactured deep depletion BC n-type MOSFETs in 0. 18 μm CMOS image sensor process. The transistors are designed in a way similar to the <b>source</b> <b>followers</b> in a typical BC CCD. In this paper we report the results from their characterization and compare with enhancement mode and “zero-threshold” SC devices. In addition to the detailed current-voltage and noise measurements, semiconductor device simulation results are presented to illustrate and understand the different conditions affecting the channel conduction and the noise performance of the BC transistors at low operating voltages. We show that the biasing of the BC transistors has to be carefully adjusted for optimal operation, and that their noise performance at the right operating conditions can be superior to SC devices, despite their lower gain as in-pixel <b>source</b> <b>followers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a collection of}} new novel techniques using the bulk-driven approach, {{which can lead to}} performance enhancement in the field of CMOS analogue amplifier design under the very low-supply voltage constraints. In this thesis, three application areas of the bulk-driven approach are focused – at the input-stage of differential pairs, at the <b>source</b> <b>followers,</b> and at the cascode devices. For the input stage of differential pairs, this thesis proposes two new novel circuit design techniques. One of them utilises the concept of the replica-biased scheme in order to solve the non-linearity and latch-up issues, which are the potential problems that come along with the bulk-driven approach. The other proposed circuit design technique utilises the flipped voltage scheme and the Quasi-Floating Gate technique in order to achieve low-power high-speed performances, and furthermore the reversed-biased diode concept to overcome the issue of degraded input impedance characteristics that come along with the bulk-driven approach. Applying the bulk-driven approach in <b>source</b> <b>followers</b> is a new type of circuit blocks in CMOS analogue field, in which to the author’s best knowledge has not been proposed at any literatures in the past. This thesis presents the bulk-driven version of the flipped voltage <b>followers</b> and super <b>source</b> <b>followers,</b> which can lead to eliminating the DC level shift. Furthermore, a technique for programming the DC level shift less than the threshold voltage of a MOSFET, which cannot be achieved by conventional types of <b>source</b> <b>followers,</b> is presented. The effectiveness of the cascode device using the bulk-driven approach is validated by implementing it in a complete schematics design of a fully differential bulk-driven operational transcoductance amplifier (OTA). This proposal leads to solving the lowtranconductance problem of a bulk-driven differential pair, and in effect the open loop gain of the OTA exceeds 60 dB using a 0. 35 ?m CMOS technology. The final part of this thesis provides the study result of the input capacitance of a bulk-driven buffer. To verify the use of the BSIM 3 MOSFET model in the simulation for predicting the input capacitance, the measurement data of the fabricated device are compared with the postlayout simulation results...|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} CMOS APS pixel today {{consists of}} a photodetector (a pinned photodiode), a floating diffusion, a transfer gate, reset gate, selection gate and source-follower readout transistor—the so-called 4T cell. The pinned photodiode was originally used in interline transfer CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the pinned photodiode to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to {{the gate of the}} read-out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated double sampling (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are easier. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion which acts in this case as the photodiode. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in soft reset. The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a <b>source</b> <b>follower),</b> an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked {{on top of each other}} using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed.|$|E

40|$|CMOS imagers are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in astronomy. A very low noise level is required to observe extremely faint targets and to get high-precision flux measurements. Although CMOS technology offers many advantages over CCDs, a major bottleneck is still the read noise. To move from an industrial CMOS sensor to one suitable for scientific applications, an improved design that optimizes the noise level is essential. Here, we study the 1 /f and thermal noise performance of the <b>source</b> <b>follower</b> (SF) of a CMOS pixel in detail. We identify the relevant design parameters, and analytically study {{their impact on the}} noise level using the BSIM 3 v 3 noise model with an enhanced model of gate capacitance. Our detailed analysis shows that the dependence of the 1 /f noise on the geometrical size of the <b>source</b> <b>follower</b> is not limited to minimum channel length, compared to the classical approach to achieve the minimum 1 /f noise. We derive the optimal gate dimensions (the width and the length) of the <b>source</b> <b>follower</b> that minimize the 1 /f noise, and validate our results using numerical simulations. By considering the thermal noise or white noise along with 1 /f noise, the total input noise of the <b>source</b> <b>follower</b> depends on the capacitor ratio CG/CFD and the drain current (Id). Here, CG is the total gate capacitance of the <b>source</b> <b>follower</b> and CFD is the total floating diffusion capacitor at the input of the <b>source</b> <b>follower.</b> We demonstrate that the optimum gate capacitance (CG) depends on the chosen bias current but ranges from CFD/ 3 to CFD to achieve the minimum total noise of the <b>source</b> <b>follower.</b> Numerical calculation and circuit simulation with 180 nm CMOS technology are performed to validate our results.
