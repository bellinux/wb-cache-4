Male broodfish were injected with either 0. 9 % saline solution (control), or a single dose of DOM [20 mg/kg body weight (BW) ], LHRHa (20, 50, or 80 μg/kg BW), or HCG (500, 1000, or 1500 IU/kg BW). Milt samples were collected before hormone induction (0 h) to assess original milt condition, and at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post injection (p. i.). Results showed that treatment with saline solution, DOM, or LHRHa did not significantly alter milt physical properties, <b>sperm</b> motility <b>parameters,</b> or <b>sperm</b> morphology. Treatment with HCG at a dose of 1000 IU/kg BW significantly increased milt volume, total sperm production, and <b>sperm</b> motility <b>parameters,</b> but decreased spermatocrit and sperm concentration at 48 h p. i. These parameters were significantly reduced at 72 h p. i. In conclusion, our results suggest that Waigieu seaperch milt should be collected 48 h after hormonal stimulation with a single dose of HCG (1000 IU/kg BW) to ensure high properties of milt such as milt volume, total sperm production, and <b>sperm</b> motility <b>parameters...</b>|$|R

DESIGN: <b>Sperm</b> kinetic <b>parameters,</b> hyperactivation, and the acrosome reaction were evaluated after 6 hours of incubation in HTF, Ham's F- 10 medium, FF, and GC cultures. SETTING: Infertility and In Vitro Fertilization Centre, Reproductive Endocrinology Unit, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. PATIENT(S) : Sixteen normal semen samples. INTERVENTION(S) : <b>Sperm</b> kinetic <b>parameters</b> and hyperactivation were analyzed using an automated videomicrography system, the acrosome reaction was performed using a triple-stain technique, and progesterone and 17 OH-progesterone levels were measured {{with the use of}} commercially available kits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : <b>Sperm</b> kinetic <b>parameters,</b> hyperactivation, acrosome reaction. RESULT(S) : The percentage of motile sperm, the mean curvilinear velocity, and the mean of the maximum amplitude of lateral head movement were increased significantly after 6 hours of incubation in FF or GC cultures compared with incubation in HTF or Ham's F- 10 medium, whereas the mean linearity was decreased significantly. Follicular fluid and GC cultures significantly increased hyperactivation and the acrosome reaction compared with the values obtained using HTF and Ham's F- 10 medium. Progesterone and 17 OH-progesterone levels were increased significantly after incubation in FF and GC cultures compared with HTF and Ham's F- 10 medium.

40|$|The {{conservation}} {{status of the}} species studied in this thesis (European eel and pufferfish) is currently frail, thus the main goal {{of this research was}} to develop, improve and apply several techniques and protocols with the aim of increasing the knowledge about their sperm biology, improving their reproductive performance and even helping future breeding in captivity. The reproductive performance of the males is often assessed through the <b>sperm</b> motion <b>parameters</b> analysed by the CASA system, so first we focused on how to standardize this technique in terms of procedural and biological settings. In this respect, we laid the foundations for applying a standard method to assess sperm quality in fish, making it possible for sperm studies to be compared both intra- and inter-laboratories using the proper CASA settings. Secondly, with the aim of improving the reproductive performance of European eel males, 3 thermal regimes (two of them variable: T 10 and T 15; and one of them constant: T 20) and 3 hormonal treatments (hCG, hCGrec and PSMG) were assessed based on different <b>sperm</b> quality <b>parameters.</b> In the case of the thermal regimes, our results demonstrated that the onset and progression of spermiation are strongly influenced by water temperature, with treatment T 20 showing the best results in all the <b>sperm</b> quality <b>parameters.</b> In the case of hormonal treatments, hCGrec produced the best results in all the <b>sperm</b> quality <b>parameters,</b> becoming an economically profitable/viable treatment and an effective alternative to the standard hCG treatment often used to induce spermiation in eel species. A preliminary physiological study regarding the changes to the main ions involved in the fish sperm activation process was carried out. Our results showed that intracellular concentrations of Ca 2 + and K+ increased upon eel sperm activation, while pH gradually decreased over time, thus it is likely that all of them {{play an important role in}} the initiation of sperm motility in the European eel, as with other marine and freshwater teleosts. In the second part of this thesis, which focuses on the pufferfish, an in-depth study into the sperm of this species was carried out for future application in aquacultural matters. A short-term storage method for pufferfish sperm was developed, enabling us to preserve the <b>sperm</b> quality <b>parameters</b> for a relatively long time period (7 days) compared to fresh sperm samples. Moreover, the effects of both the osmolality and the ion composition of the activation media on the <b>sperm</b> motion <b>parameters</b> were evaluated, concluding that both factors play an essential role in the initiation of sperm motility of pufferfish sperm and probably, in marine fish sperm. Finally, in vitro fertilization trials were developed to assertain how the quantity and quality of male gametes affects the fertilization and hatching rates. We demonstrated that sperm/egg ratio and sperm quality are strongly related factors, suggesting that both should be taken into account as unique interrelated elements. In addition, coefficients of correlation among all the spermatozoa motion parameters provided by a CASA system and fertilization and hatching rates were estimated for the first time in a marine species. Spermatozoa velocities showed the highest coefficients (¿ 0. 80), suggesting that the kinetics of the spermatozoa are a key factor in the fertilization process. Gallego Albiach, V. (2013).

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of using a synthetic oviductal fluid medium supplemented with either heparin–hypotaurine alone, in combination with progesterone (P 4), 17 β-estradiol (E 2), or BSA, or just β-cyclodextrin, in replacement for estrous sheep serum (ESS) for ram sperm capacitation. After incubation in the corresponding media for 15 (time 0) or 60 minutes, sperm function was evaluated by computerized sperm motility analysis and flow cytometry (plasma membrane status and fluidity). Treatments rendering the best results in regards to <b>sperm</b> function <b>parameters</b> related to capacitation were used for an IVF test. Herein, neither heparin–hypotaurine (alone), or in combination with P 4, or E 2, nor β-cyclodextrin induced capacitation-related changes in frozen–thawed ram spermatozoa. Only the medium supplemented with heparin–hypotaurine–BSA was able to induce changes compatible with in vitro capacitation relating to sperm motility pattern and plasma membrane fluidity, comparable to those in ESS-containing medium. Both media yielded <b>sperm</b> <b>parameter</b> values that differed (P < 0. 05) from those obtained in the rest of the media tested. However, after the IVF trial, BSA was unable to support cleavage rates (21. 80 %) comparable to those obtained with ESS (52. 60 %; P < 0. 05). We conclude that heparin–hypotaurine, P 4, E 2, β-cyclodextrin, or BSA is not suitable for replacing ESS in capacitation and fertilization media for ram spermatozoa. M.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{characterize}} sperm quality and to quantify seasonal changes in sexual hormone (testosterone [T], 11 -ketotestosterone [11 -KT] and 17, 20 β-dihydroxypregn- 4 -en- 3 -one [17, 20 β-P]) levels in male brill (Scophthalmus rhombus) plasma, as well as to test a more intensive sampling strategy to establish relationships between sex steroid levels and <b>sperm</b> production <b>parameters.</b> <b>Sperm</b> concentration ranged from 0. 5 to 3. 1 × 109 spermatozoa mL- 1, and changes in <b>sperm</b> quality <b>parameters</b> depending on sampling date were observed. Plasma sexual steroid levels remained high and changed in parallel during the spawning season and afterwards decreased to very low levels in summer. The analysis of annual changes of 11 -KT and T ratios suggests that 11 -KT can be the main circulating androgen for stimulating spermatogenesis in S. rhombus and that T could be involved in the beginning of spermatogenesis through the positive feedback on brain-pituitary-gonad axis. Finally, daily 11 -KT and T levels showed similar patterns of variation in males sampled, whereas 17, 20 β-P amounts showed somewhat opposite trends. These differences could be related with the different role of androgens and progestin during the spermatogenesis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B. V.

40|$|The {{selenoenzyme}} phospholipid hydroperoxide {{glutathione peroxidase}} (PHGPx) {{is regarded as}} the major molecular target of selenodeficiency in rodents, accounting for most of the histopathological and structural abnormalities of testicular tissue and male germ cells. PHGPx exists as a cytosolic form, mitochondrial form, and nuclear form (nPHGPx) predominantly expressed in late spermatids and spermatozoa. Here, we demonstrate that mice with a targeted deletion of the nPHGPx gene were, unlike mice with the full knockout (KO) of PHGPx, not only viable but also, surprisingly, fully fertile. While both morphological analysis of testis and epididymis and <b>sperm</b> <b>parameter</b> measurements did not show any apparent abnormality, toluidine blue and acridine orange stainings of spermatozoa indicated defective chromatin condensation in the KO sperm isolated from the caput epididymis. Furthermore, upon drying and hydrating, KO sperm exhibited a significant proportion of morphologically abnormal heads. Monobromobimane labeling and protein-free thiol titration revealed significantly less extensive oxidation in the cauda epididymis when compared to that in the wild type. We conclude that nPHGPx, by acting as a protein thiol peroxidase in vivo, contributes to the structural stability of sperm chromatin...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to design demembranation method on four {{freshwater}} species and its application on study of the influence of HgCl 2 on the axoneme and motity <b>sperm</b> motility <b>parameters.</b> Demembranation was designed and examined for all investigated species common carp (Cyprinus carpio), sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and african catfish (Clarias gariepinus). One-step and two-step method was designed and tested for common carp. One-step method was designed for sterlet and perch. Two-step method of demembranation was designed for african catfish. Demembranation was designed and examined for all species under examination. Sperm motility was evidently increased above normal physiological value. Other <b>sperm</b> motility <b>parameters</b> (velocity, percent of motile cells) slightly decreased. HgCl 2 in concentration 0, 01 mM to the demembranation medium didn't show effect on flagellar microtubule aparat and then to the motility parameters, except sterlet; demembranated sterlet sperm was inhibited at all used concentration of HgCl 2.

40|$|International audienceAlteration of <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> {{related to}} {{occupational}} exposures {{is the subject}} of several studies, often on a case-control approach. The study populations usually comprise men consulting in infertility clinics for couple infertility. The objective of this review is to identify, from these case-control studies, the main occupational factors that may be associated with altered <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters.</b> We selected 13 articles in the PubMed database. Participation in these studies varied from 61 to 2619 subjects, with great methodological heterogeneity, particularly in the characterization of exposure. The main occupations that appear significantly associated with a risk of altered <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> are workmen, painters, farriers, welders, plumbers and technicians. When analysis focuses on occupational exposures, a significant result is reported for solvents, heavy metals, heat, vibrations and non-ionizing radiation. None of the selected studies has found a link with exposure to pesticides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Studies {{confirm that}} a number of {{nutritional}} and environmental factors may negatively affect spermatogenesis and cause male infertility. Carnitine is an important factor for sperm motility. Carnitine deficiency decreases sperm motility and may cause male infertility. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of carnitine on <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> in infertile males with idiopathic asthenospermia. Materials & Methods: This study is a before and after clinical trial performed on 40 asthenospermia men who were treated with 750 mg per/day carnitine in Fatemieh infertility research center in years 2006 - 2007. <b>Sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> were assessed before and after treatment. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS 10 and paired T-test Results: The results showed a significant increase in sperm concentration, morphology, sperm total motility and rapid progressive motility after treatment by carnitine (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Carnitine supplementation has a significant effect on <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> in men with idiopathic asthenospermia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Some {{medicinal}} plants with their antioxidant properties have protective effects on <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> and neutralize {{the harmful effects}} of lead exposure. Objectives: The present study aimed {{to determine the effects of}} Melissa on <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> and spermatogenesis quality in adult rats exposed to lead. Methods: This animal experimental study was conducted on 45 male Wistar rats weighing 180 ± 20 g, which were allocated randomly into five groups (n= 9) : distilled water gavages (control) (0. 5 ml); intraperitoneal distilled water (i. p. control) (0. 5 ml); Melissa (100 mg/kg/bw); lead acetate (10 mg/kg/bw); and lead acetate (10 mg/kg/bw) plus Melissa (100 mg/kg/bw). After a 30 -day treatment, the animals were sacrificed. <b>Sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> (count, motility, morphology, and chromatins assay) and weighing of the epididymis and testis were performed. Results: The results showed that in the lead acetate plus Melissa group, epididymis weight (0. 37 gr vs. 0. 32 gr), testis weight (1. 40 vs. 1. 28 g), sperm motility (4. 44 % vs. 33. 2 %(and viable sperm (90 vs. 50) were higher than the lead group. However, testicular weight, normal morphology, and DNA percentage showed insignificant differences among the study groups (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate the protective effects of Melissa officinalis on some <b>sperm</b> <b>parameters</b> and spermatogenesis quality in rats exposed to lead...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate variation in the ratio of X- to Y-bearing sperm of individual ejaculates and to determine any relationship between skewed sex ratio and either routine mor-phological evaluation or computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Semen was collected from bulls weekly for 6 consecutive weeks, sperm DNA was recovered and quantitative, and real-time PCR was used to determine the ratio of X- to Y-bearing sperm in each ejaculate. The overall mean of X-bearing sperm within ejaculates was 54. 7 % over the 6 weeks of semen collections. The percen-tages of X-bearing sperm were similar (P> 0. 5) across all collections. Between bulls, there were differences (P < 0. 05) in the mean percentage of X-bearing sperm. No significant correlations were found between CASA parameters and percentage of X-bearing sperm across bulls, so analysis was done within each bull. Different combinations of CASA and/or morphological parameters were found to correlate with the percentage of X-bearing sperm but the prediction equations were spe-cific for individual bulls and unlikely to be of use across bulls. These results confirm that the ratio of X- to Y-bearing sperm may be skewed in some ejaculates of bull semen. Some <b>sperm</b> <b>parameter...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Germany the {{selection}} of the cells for the embryo transfer has to be made before the membrane breakdown of the pronuclear. The morphologic characteristics of the gamets and pronuclear stage have been examened to find the cells with the highest implantation potential. Method: In this prospective multicenter study morphologic light microscope evaluation were made from 564 spermiogramms (amount, motility, morphology); 4778 Oocytes (cytoplasm, inclusion bodys, vacuols, pvs, zona, polar body) and 3342 pronuclear stages (amount, pronuclear position, halo, nucleoli pattern). Results: There is no relationship between <b>sperm</b> <b>parameter</b> and therapy outcome with ICSI as long as motil sperms exist. For the quality of the oocyte it is essential how many defects are shown in a cell. On the other hand it does not make any difference what kind of abnormality the cell shows considered separately. The position of the pronuclear in the cell whether central oder peripher- and the halo had no significant influence whereas the pattern of the nucleoli (z-score) reflected the development potential. To select the cells for the embryo transfer with respect of the German embryo protection law it is essential to make a oocyte and pronuclear selection to achieve high pregnancy results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In porcine oocytes, the {{function}} of the zona pellucida (ZP) with regard to sperm penetration or prevention of polyspermy is not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the ZP on sperm penetration during in vitro fertilization (IVF). We collected in vitro-matured oocytes with a first polar body (ZP+ oocytes). Some of them were freed from the ZP (ZP − oocytes) by two treatments (pronase and mechanical pipetting), and the effects of these treatments on <b>sperm</b> penetration <b>parameters</b> (<b>sperm</b> penetration rate and numbers of penetrated sperm per oocyte) were evaluated. There was no evident difference in the parameters between the two groups. Secondly, we compared the <b>sperm</b> penetration <b>parameters</b> of ZP+ and ZP − oocytes using frozen-thawed epididymal spermatozoa from four boars. Sperm penetration into ZP+ oocytes was found to be accelerated relative to ZP − oocytes. Thirdly, we evaluated the sperm penetration of ZP+ and ZP − oocytes at 1 − 10 h after IVF (3 h gamete co-incubation). The proportions of oocytes penetrated by sperm increased significantly with time in both groups; however, the number of penetrated sperm per oocyte did not increase in ZP − oocytes. Finally, we performed IVF using ZP − oocytes divided into control (3 h) and prolonged gamete co-incubation (5 h) groups. Greater numbers of sperm penetrated in the 5 h group than in the control group. These results suggest that the ZP and oolemma are not competent factors for prevention of polyspermy in our present porcine IVF system. However, it appears that ZP removal is one of the possibilities for reducing polyspermic penetration in vitro in pigs...|$|R
