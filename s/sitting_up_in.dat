Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, but was still battling an infection. By 8 November, she was photographed <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed.|$|E
5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient <b>sitting</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E

25|$|Early {{ambulation}} also prevents venous stasis {{and physicians}} order OOB {{activities on the}} same day of surgery. This is accomplished in increments. The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by: raising the head of the bed, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, moving {{to the edge of the}} bed, dangling the legs off the bed and then ambulating to a close chair.|$|E
25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} week of his life, he {{concluded}} this retreat on Tuesday, November 12, worked with a student artist to complete a statue of Amitabha, talked with many of his students, and led a training in phowa (transference of consciousness at the moment of death) for more than two hundred people. He continued teaching with great vigor until about 9 pm on Saturday night November 16. Then on Sunday morning of the 17th, at about 4:15a.m., Brazilian daylight time, he suffered massive heart failure while <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed.|$|E

25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that {{to a certain extent}} this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and {{ceremonial}} puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife's past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. [...] Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, [...] "Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the press box as a healthy scratch to be standing here in front of you is quite amazing." [...] By having his jersey retired, he became the third player in team history to receive the honour, after Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.|$|E

500|$|With a {{temperature}} of , Warrant Officer Patrick M. Hamilton, serving with the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance, (Australian Mounted Division) {{became one of the}} earlier cases of Spanish flu, being reported sick on 20 September. At 18:00 on 21 September he was evacuated from Jenin, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> one of the returning supply lorries, to the Australian Receiving Station at Tulkarm. He became very sick the next day [...] "with pains all over, especially in the back" [...] and became a stretcher case just before the receiving station was taken over by the 4th Cavalry Divisional Receiving Station, where he remained until 24 September. From Tulkarm he was evacuated to the 15th British Casualty Clearing Station at Wilhelma in a motor ambulance, then by train to the 26th British Casualty Clearing Station at Ludd, before arriving by troop train back at the 47th Stationary Hospital at Gaza on 27 September, seven days after falling ill. Here he slowly recovered, before being evacuated once more, by train on 1 October back across the Sinai , to be admitted to the 24th British Stationary Hospital at Kantara, where he recovered. He rejoined the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance in the middle of November, arriving by boat at Tripoli.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simon Hoggart, {{writing in}} The Guardian, related an anecdote of Soames' childhood: [...] "He {{gave me the}} true version of what I had always {{suspected}} was an apocryphal story. In or around 1953, when Soames was five, he didn't know how important his grandfather was until someone told him. So {{he walked up to}} the old man's bedroom, managed to get past the valets and the secretaries, and found him <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed.|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{function}} was studied in 19 patients placed {{in both the}} supine and sitting positions in the early postoperative period. Although the sitting position was expected to improve respiratory function, no such advantage was found; instead, a small but statistically significant deterioration in arterial oxygenation was found in most patients when <b>sitting</b> <b>up.</b> It is concluded that no respiratory benefit should be expected from <b>sitting</b> patients <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the early postoperative period...|$|R
2500|$|The {{last part}} of the novel is devoted to the {{circumstances}} of Norkus' (or Heini Völker's) death. According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a [...] "thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection": When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there [...] "suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, his eyes wide open. He is singing. They don't recognise the words, but they know the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{rated the}} album three stars {{out of five}} and {{compared}} it to Janet Jackson's 1986 album Control, commenting: [...] "For the most part, Full Moon is certainly a forward-minded album, lifting Brandy's typically schmaltzy brand of pop-R to a new, edgier plateau [...] The all-grown-up Miss Moesha seems to be making her final transition from <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her room to {{sitting on top of}} the world." [...] Billboard magazine praised Full Moon for its ballads and the leading single but was unsatisfied with the album as a whole, stating that [...] "those expecting more from the same [...] will be disappointed, it's a fairly paint-by-numbers affair." [...] Devon Thomas, writer for The Michigan Daily, was generally disappointed with the album. He said that [...] "heavily producer-driven, the album follows the template that catapulted her sophomore album to multi-platinum status. The tradition (or condition) continues on her junior outing, [...] exhibits the same ole Jerkins production we've heard time and time before, just slightly altered (or [...] "updated") and equipped." [...] Critical with mainstream R in general, he further summed: [...] "We know it'll be another hit, another platinum plaque for the Moe-ster, but will this album go down on any 'Best of the Decade' lists? Highly unlikely." [...] Rolling Stone dismissed the album as [...] "frantic, faceless, fake-sexy R" [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating.|$|E
