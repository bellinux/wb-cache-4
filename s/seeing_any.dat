5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{beginning}} principal photography, Refn {{went to the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film. In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager {{to get their hands}} on Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Vérité {{took the}} French President on a {{goodwill}} trip to Russia in 1908 and visited America in September 1909. In September 1911, she was {{damaged by the}} explosion that destroyed her sister Liberté in Toulon. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she covered troop convoys from North Africa to France {{along with the rest}} of the French Mediterranean Fleet. She spent the rest of the war based at Corfu and later Mudros, without <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> action at either location. After the end of the war, she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Justice was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. In September 1909, she traveled to the United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she {{was assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first days of the war, and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> action. After the war ended, she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet's withdrawal. Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
5|$|Péron did {{not report}} <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E

5|$|He ran in {{the primary}} {{elections}} of the Justicialist Party (PJ) for the 1989 presidential elections. Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, prevailed in both the primary and the main elections and became {{the new president of}} Argentina. Rodríguez Saá was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election. Not <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> chance of prevailing against the president, he abandoned his candidacy. He also attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} that Ganteaume gleaned from his captive was largely false. A large expeditionary force and fleet under Lord Keith {{was in the}} Mediterranean but would not arrive in Egypt {{for more than two}} weeks, British landings eventually going ahead on 8 March. At the time Ganteaume questioned Peard, the force was anchored at Karamania on the southern coast of Anatolia, struggling with reluctant Ottoman allies and bad weather. In addition, there was little active pursuit of his squadron during February: when Concorde reached Plymouth on 3 February, urgent messages were sent to Earl St Vincent at the Admiralty who ordered the despatch of a fast squadron of six ships of the line, two frigates and a brig in search of Ganteaume's ships. However, attached to command this force was Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, who traveled in a slow second rate ship of the line that significantly delayed the passage of his squadron. In any case, a miscalculation of Ganteaume's intentions at the Admiralty resulted in orders for Calder's squadron to sail to the West Indies, and they played no further part in the campaign. Warren, whose squadron was based off Cádiz, had learned of Ganteaume's passage on 8 February and sailed to Gibraltar in pursuit before continuing to Menorca on 13 February, arriving on 20 February without <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> sign of the French and subsequently sailing for Sicily in March after hearing news of the impending Treaty of Florence between France and the Kingdom of Naples. Despite the lack of genuine pursuit, Ganteaume was unnerved by the information gleaned from Peard, and ordered the squadron to sail for Toulon, arriving on 19 February without any further contact with the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|In May 1806, general Walther {{replaced}} Ordener. Due to his seniority, Walther {{was also}} second-in-command {{of the entire}} Guard cavalry and exercised this command whenever Marshal Bessières was not available for service. The blitz 1806 campaign against Prussia went on without the regiment <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> action. Nonetheless, war continued the next year in Poland, with the French {{in pursuit of the}} Russian army.|$|E

25|$|Fremantle married {{shortly after}} his return to Great Britain, and served with his {{regiment}} until 1880, when he was placed on half pay after 28 years of service without <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> active duty.

The Attacker was replaced in the front line squadrons by the later and more capable Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom.|$|E
25|$|The test {{described}} here is more fully the null-hypothesis statistical significance test. The null hypothesis represents {{what we would}} believe by default, before <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> evidence. Statistical significance is a possible finding of the test, declared when the observed sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the tolerable risk of error.|$|E

25|$|Mallory's {{daughter}} said that Mallory carried {{a photograph of}} his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit. This photo was not found on Mallory's body. Given the excellent preservation of the body, its garments and other items including documents in his wallet, this points to the possibility that he may have reached the summit and deposited the photo there. On the other hand, Wang (who is known to have taken Mallory's ice-axe) might also have taken the photograph for identification purposes, and no one who has subsequently reached the summit has reported <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> evidence of the photograph, or any other trace of their presence there.|$|E
25|$|The newly founded company Sonorous {{provided}} audio post-production. Broadchurch was {{its first}} television project. Sonorous' Howard Bargroff {{was involved in}} the post-production process even before the first episode had been fully edited. Bargroff held meeting with the producers and post-production as every episode neared completion, and they jointly identified elements of the sound which were in good shape, and those which needed work. Sound mixing was done using PMC Ltd. TB2 speakers. The company delivered streaming QuickTime files to the producers to keep them up to date with mix changes. To maintain secrecy, actors had to loop dialogue without seeing the accompanying footage. This prevented workers at the audio post-production facility from <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> critical visual information and leaking it to the press.|$|E
25|$|At McCook Field in 1923, Hegenberger (who {{had also}} become a Robins protégé) worked closely with {{engineer}} Bradley Jones, a leading authority on air navigation, to test and adapt for military purposes an earth inductor compass developed by the Pioneer Instrument Company {{in conjunction with the}} National Bureau of Standards. Hegenberger designed an instrument panel incorporating the earth inductor compass, a driftmeter, and a magnetic compass for a navigation station at which sextant readings could also be taken; and a cockpit panel with a dial connected to the navigation station that indicated to the pilot if he was steering to the right or left of the course set by the inductor compass. On September 6, 1923, Hegenberger and Jones successfully tested the equipment by navigating from Dayton to Boston, Massachusetts in a DH-4, above unbroken clouds that completely prevented them from <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> landmarks on the ground.|$|E

6000|$|The {{boat was}} indeed a large one, and would have very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and {{therefore}} was rather too big for them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, they did well enough; they had made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily enough; the Spaniards called after them, [...] "Bon veajo;" [...] and no man ever thought of <b>seeing</b> them <b>any</b> more.|$|R
25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Hill was {{positioned}} near the Confederate right along a ridge; {{because of some}} swampy ground along his front, there was a 600-yard gap in Hill's front line, and the nearest brigade behind it was nearly a quarter mile away; the dense vegetation prevented the brigade commander from <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> Union troops advancing on his position. During the battle, Maj. Gen. George Meade's division routed two of Hill's brigades {{and part of a}} third. Hill required the assistance from Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division to repulse the Union attack. Hill's division suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, which was nearly two-thirds of the casualties in Jackson's corps; two of his brigade commanders were wounded, one (Maxcy Gregg) mortally. After the battle one of his brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, criticized him about the gap left in the division's front line, saying that Hill had been warned about it before the battle but had done nothing to correct it. Hill was also absent from his division, and there is no record of where he was during the battle; this led to a rumor spread through the lines that he had been captured during the initial Union assault.|$|E
500|$|Another {{eyewitness}} was a fan, Alena Rozsívalová, {{who testified}} {{that she saw}} Blythe shove Nosek, saying [...] "e climbed onto the stage, and {{when he tried to}} stand up, Blythe shoved him." [...] According to her, the shove was strong enough for Nosek to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment. She testified that Nosek fell backwards. Another attendee of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall <b>seeing</b> <b>any</b> fall {{by the end of the}} concert.|$|E
5000|$|After Sarcasm {{wins the}} Preakness, Joe returns to New York, where Jean is back from Europe.

Before Joe shows up with the check, however, Paul arrives at Jean's apartment. They argue when he sees that she plans to run out on him with the money. Jean threatens him with a gun, and during a scuffle, kills her.|$|R
5000|$|In {{their role}} as {{livestock}} guardian dogs, Akbash Dogs frequently spend long hours lying with flocks or herds. The Akbash is a relatively low energy breed, although {{they are said to}} always be thinking and taking in what is happening around them (and that they [...] "sleep with one eye open"). They regularly patrol the perimeters of their territories; listening, scenting and <b>seeing</b> beyond <b>any</b> fence lines. Like their sighthound ancestors, the vision of Akbash Dogs is excellent. They reserve much of their physical energy for possible encounters with predators.|$|R
