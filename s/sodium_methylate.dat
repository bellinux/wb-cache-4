40|$|ABSTRACT. Glycerol is the {{principal}} by-product of biodiesel production. For each gallon of biodiesel produced, approximately 0. 3 kg of crude glycerol accompanies. Such crude glycerol possesses very low value because of the impurities contained. As the demand and production of biodiesel grow exponentially, the utilization of the glycerol becomes an urgent topic. The make-up of crude glycerol varies depending on the parent feedstock and the biodiesel production process. Before the crude glycerol could be considered for possible value-added utilizations, {{it is necessary to}} characterize it on its physical, chemical, and nutritional properties. This article reports the characterization of crude glycerol obtained from different seed oil feedstocks of mustard, rapeseed, canola, crambe, soybean, and waste cooking oils. Batch processes of biodiesel production were used as the means of crude glycerol preparation using unrefined vegetable oils, methanol, and <b>sodium</b> <b>methylate</b> as the catalyst.

In this study, we report the direct utilization of two different sources of crude glycerol in glycerolysis reaction with urea for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate using potassium silicate containing boiler ash as a catalyst. The level of interference of moisture and methanol content in crude glycerol was studied by mimicking conditions in pure glycerol and it was found that moisture at 10 wt% significantly effects the conversion of glycerol while methanol at 5 wt% affects the selectivity towards glycerol carbonate. However, due to the low moisture and methanol content in crude glycerol, comparable yield % of glycerol carbonate with commercial pure glycerol as starting feedstock was noted. Besides, the study also found that the potassium methylate and <b>sodium</b> <b>methylate</b> used as catalysts for the commercial production of biodiesel can be also used as an effective catalyst for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate.

The relative acidity scale tetrahydrofuran was determined from the difference half-neutralization potentials of perchloric acid and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH), which were measured by using both H 2 /Pd-SCE and glass-SCE electrode pairs. The experimentally obtained value of Es scale THF with a H 2 /Pd-SCE electrode pair was 1155 mV, and those obtained with glass-SCE electrode pair 880 mV. By using a H 2 /Pd indicator electrode, the individual acids (benzoic acid, palmitic acid, maleic acid, acetyl acetone, α-naphthol) and two component acid mixtures (benzoic acid + α-naphthol, palmitic acid + α-naphthol, maleic acid + α-naphthol and maleic acid + ftalic acid) were titrated with a standard solution of TBAH.

30|$|Although {{homogeneous}} catalysts are advantageous {{in terms}} of fast reaction rates, the drawback of this application is that the reaction products require longer separation and purification times. Use of heterogeneous catalysts can be advantageous in microwave-enhanced transesterification reactions since the catalyst can provide locations for hotspots for rapid heating. In addition, they are recyclable and reusable with acceptable performance. Patil et al. employed heterogeneous catalysts such as BaO, CaO, MgO, and SrO for transesterification of Camelina Sativa oil into biodiesel. They reported the kinetic rate constants for different catalysts. Two orders of magnitude of difference in the kinetic rate constants between the conventional heating method and microwave heating methods was reported in their study [159]. Sol gel type catalysts were also developed and tested by {{the same group of}} researchers. Heterogeneous catalysts also reportedly provide for cleaner products and easier separation of the end products. Variety of heterogeneous catalysts were tested. Few examples include: diphenylammonium salts - DPAMs (mesylates), DPABs (benzenesulfonate), DPATs (tosylate), sulfated zirconia, ZnO/ La 2 O 2 CO 3, TiO 2 /SO 4, heteropolyacids, aluminum oxides with sulfuric acid. whether reactions involving homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts, when the reaction is carried out under microwaves, transesterification is efficiently activated, with short reaction times, and as a result, a drastic reduction in the quantity of by-products and a short separation time is obtained (> 90 % reduction in separation time), and all with a reduced energy consumption [66, 136]. The rate acceleration in solid-state catalytic reactions, on exposure to microwave radiation, is attributed to high temperatures {{on the surface of the}} catalyst. The increase in the local surface temperature of the catalyst results in enhancement of the catalytic action, leading to an enhanced rate of reaction. It has been observed that when the catalyst is introduced in a solid granular form, the yield and rate of the heterogeneous oxidation, esterification and hydrolysis reactions increases with microwave heating, compared to conventional heating under the same conditions [160]. Solid base catalysts are more efficient than solid-acid catalysts. The advantage with the solid catalysts is that they are not sensitive to the presence of water in the reactants [25]. Breccia et al. reported on the use of a domestic microwave apparatus for the synthesis of biodiesel by reaction between methanol and commercial seed oils [161]. In this work, they found that the reaction was complete in less than 2  min under microwave irradiation.

40|$|O uso de biocombustíveis geralmente apresenta inúmeros benefícios, incluindo sustentabilidade, redução dos gases estufa, desenvolvimento regional, social e agrícola. Assim, o uso de biocombustíveis, como o biodiesel, é visto hoje como uma alternativa extremamente viável. O processo produtivo gera, em média, para cada tonelada (1000 kg) de biodiesel, 100 kg de glicerina. O grande receio é que o excesso de glicerina produzida, altamente poluidora, possa vir a ser descartada de maneira irresponsável no ambiente. O presente trabalho foi dividido em duas etapas distintas. A primeira compreende os testes físico-químicos com as misturas binárias gasolina/glicerina P. A., gasolina/glicerina loira, etanol/glicerina P. A. e etanol/glicerina loira, para verificar a possibilidade do uso destas em motores de ciclo Otto. Na etapa seguinte, foram analisados os resíduos recolhidos de motor (após 50 horas funcionando com AEHC/glicerina loira e funcionando apenas com AEHC e gasolina C). Todas as amostras de glicerina foram miscíveis em álcool combustível nas proporções de 1, 2 e 5 % v/v. Foi obtida uma mistura homogênea das misturas de 1 % de glicerina com até 20 % de AEAC em gasolina tipo A. O pH do AEHC ficou abaixo do mínimo recomendado pela ANP com a adição de glicerina loira, porém a adição de glicerina P. A. não modificou significativamente seu valor. As curvas de destilação da gasolina C e da mistura de gasolina C com glicerina foram semelhantes. As medidas de condutividade do AEHC e AEAC com glicerina loira e glicerina P. A. ficaram dentro da faixa dos valores permitidos pela ANP (350 &# 956;S. m- 1). No ensaio de corrosividade ao cobre, a mistura de gasolina com glicerina apresentou características típicas da gasolina comercial. Nos ensaios onde foram introduzidas ligas metálicas de cobre, alumínio e latão em soluções de AEHC com 2 % glicerina P. A. e AEHC com 2 % glicerina loira ficou evidente a corrosão provocada pela glicerina loira após 23 dias. Os espectros de XPS mostram os componentes do resíduo retirado da câmara de combustão, do pistão e da cuba do carburador do motor de ciclo Otto. Cloro e o sódio estão presentes na glicerina obtida no processo de obtenção do biodiesel, devido à lavagem da mesma com ácido clorídrico. O sódio é proveniente do resíduo de catalisador do processo de transesterificação, o metilato de sódio. Na análise usando absorção atômica por chama, confirmou-se a presença de cobre no resíduo encontrado no motor de ciclo Otto que foi alimentado com AEHC e 5 % de glicerina loira. A maior dificuldade encontrada na utilização da glicerina loira se deve aos contaminantes presentes. The use of {{biofuels}} {{generally has}} numerous benefits, including sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases, regional, social and agricultural developments. Thus, {{the use of}} biofuels such as biodiesel {{is seen as an}} extremely viable alternative. The production process generates on average, for every ton (1000 kg) of biodiesel, 100 kg of glycerin. The major problem is that great quantity of glycerin produced, highly polluting, might be irresponsibly discharged in the environment. This work was divided in two distinct stages. The first comprises the physicochemical tests with binary mixtures: gasoline / P. A. glycerin, gasoline/ blonde glycerin, ethanol / P. A. glycerin and ethanol / blonde glycerin, to verify the possibility of using these in Otto cycle engines. In the next step it was analyzed the collected deposit from engine (after running 50 hours with AEHC / blonde glycerin and working only with AEHC and gasoline C). All samples of glycerin were miscible in ethanol in the proportions of 1, 2 and 5 % v / v. A homogeneous mixture was obtained, of mixtures of 1 % glycerol with 20 % of AEAC in gasoline A. The AEHC pH was below the minimum recommended by the ANP with the addition of blonde glycerin, but the addition of P. A. glycerin does not significantly modify its value. The curves of distillation of gasoline C and mixture of gasoline C with glycerin were similar. The conductivity measurements of the AEHC and AEAC with blonde glycerin and P. A. glycerin were within the range of values allowed by the ANP (350 &# 956;S. m- 1). In copper corrosiveness test the mixture showed typical features of commercial gasoline. In the tests which were introduced metal alloys of copper, aluminum and brass in solutions containing AEHC with 2 % P. A. glycerin and AEHC with 2 % blonde glycerin was evident corrosion caused by the glycerin blonde after 23 days. The XPS spectra show the components of the deposit removed from the combustion chamber, the piston and the float chamber of carburetor of Otto cycle engine. Chlorine and sodium are present in the glycerin obtained in the biodiesel process, due to washing with hydrochloric acid. Sodium comes from the catalyst residue of transesterification process, <b>sodium</b> <b>methylate.</b> Analysis using flame atomic absorption confirmed the presence of copper in the residue found in the Otto cycle engine that was fed with AEHC and 5 % blonde glycerin. The difficulty encountered in the use of blonde glycerin is due to its contaminants...|$|E
