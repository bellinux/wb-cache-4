5|$|Boosted by this <b>spiritual</b> <b>experience,</b> Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's five wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E

There she carried out experiments {{in the production of}} soy milk, subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to sell her products and publishing The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians in 1925. It was while working at the base that she underwent a <b>spiritual</b> <b>experience</b> and subsequently further immersed herself in theosophical literature. After doing so, she became preoccupied by the idea of the 'Ascended Masters' or 'Secret Chiefs', claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the Master Jesus and the Master Rakoczi.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> are {{profound}} {{moments of}} personal transcendence, connection, and wonder. Five studies (total N = 1064) investigate how <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> induce feelings of awe, in both religious and non-religious people, through {{a sense of}} small self. Recalling <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> increased feelings of Awe (Studies 1 - 5), Small Self (Studies 2, 4, & 5), and Spiritual Humility (Studies 3 & 4), but did not impact Intellectual Humility (Studies 3 & 4). We thus note a paradox– spirituality promotes humility toward the divine, but not humility about one’s beliefs. Moreover, the effect of <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> on Awe was mediated by feelings of Small Self (Studies 2, 4 & 5) and Spirituality Humility (Studies 3 & 4). The effects of <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> on Awe and Small Self were found in both religious and non-religious individuals, but religious people recalled more explicit religious events and life and death events as sources of spirituality, whereas non-religious people {{were more likely to}} report experiences in nature, peak experiences, science, and yoga/ meditation as <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences.</b> We conclude that religious and non-religious people may generate different types of <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences,</b> but spirituality induces awe through a sense of small self shared by both religious and non-religious individuals, and this may help us to understand the meaning of spirituality without religion...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> {{seem to be}} an {{important}} component in Religious and spiritual life of some one. Aim {{of the present study was}} to determinate relation between daily <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences,</b> and psychological variables in students of Qom University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this descriptive and analytical study, 138 students of the Qom University of Medical Sciences were selected via random sampling methods. These students completed the Daily <b>Spiritual</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS- 21) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Data were analyzed in SPSS 16 software environment utilizing descriptive statistics and the Independent t-test, ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Mean and standard deviations of daily <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> scores was 28. 27 (4. 90).  The daily <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> was associated with mental health (r = - 0. 22, P-value = 0. 01) depression(r = - 0. 25, P-value = 0. 005), and stress (r = - 0. 23, P-value = 0. 01).

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary (Dazhuan) or Xi ci, which dates to roughly 300 BC. The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the <b>spiritual</b> <b>experience</b> of the I Ching, the Great Commentary states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe. Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three bifurcations. The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint, giving ancient, cosmic authority to the I Ching. For example, the Wenyan provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams, 乾 (qián) and 坤 (kūn), with Heaven and Earth, and the Shuogua attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self, world, and destiny. Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text, pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Hensley's first {{experience}} with snake handling occurred between 1908 and 1914, after which he held snake-handling services in parts of rural Tennessee. His supporters later asserted that a revival broke out {{at the start of}} his ministry, a claim considered dubious by historians. At first, the Church of God did not object to his snake-handling services, and, in 1914, he held a snake-handling meeting with a Church of God bishop in Cleveland, Tennessee. The next year, Hensley applied to be licensed as a Church of God minister, but required his wife's assistance to complete the paperwork owing to his illiteracy. He had memorized some Bible verses but also stated that he received divine revelation while speaking. After being licensed, Hensley held Church of God services throughout Tennessee, including revival services at church general assemblies. He preached about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, a Pentecostal teaching that referred to an additional <b>spiritual</b> <b>experience</b> after conversion. His ministry was often mentioned in Church of God newsletters, and his wife Amanda contributed an article about him. In the 1910s, Hensley is thought to have led churches in Grasshopper Valley (northwest of Cleveland, Tennessee); Cleveland; and Birchwood, Tennessee.|$|E

40|$|Research into opera audiences {{has taken}} up a {{predominance}} of emotion in opera lovers’ responses to opera, in particular, and music in general (including opera). For the field of music psychology, there has been increased interest in strong emotions in relation to music, physically manifested as, for example, chills, shivers down or up the spine, or an increase of the heart rate. <b>Spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> feature among the range of strong emotions thus identified. It is on those that I focus in this article. Not only opera audiences report spiritual experiences: opera singers do so as well. Some contextual frameworks {{have been developed to}} explain such <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences,</b> predominantly for audiences, but they are also relevant for singers. While the libretto is in many cases not likely to support the onset and development of <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences,</b> some opera librettos might be argued to provide such support. In this article, I discuss <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> reported by singers and review the literature on <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> reported by audience members in relation to opera, proposing, along the way, relevant additions to the clarification of terminology for, and the explanation of, such experiences. Finally I add a section on the importance of mise-en-scène in relation to the potential of a libretto to induce and maintain <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> in opera...|$|R

In this article, we have created instruments measuring spirituality without including interpretations of <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences,</b> as well as modifying two most commonly used scales, Piedmont’s Spiritual Transcendence Scale and Cloninger’s Self-Transcendence Scale, so that they also consisted exclusively of descriptions of <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences</b> with no interpretations added.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relations between altruism, empathy, and spirituality {{in a sample of}} 186 university students. Zero-order and partial correlations controlling for age, sex, and social desirability indicated that, although altruism and empathy are related to each other {{in a manner consistent with}} previous research, the association of both of these to spirituality is complex and multidirectional.

Altruism, on the other hand, was most strongly linked to <b>spiritual</b> <b>experiences,</b> followed by <b>spiritual</b> cognitions.
