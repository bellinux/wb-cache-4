However, {{little is known about}} the epidemiology and type of problems experienced. We conducted a cross-sectional survey con-sisting of a questionnaire and a clinical assessment of the amputation stump.

40|$|Abstract—Problems {{with skin}} {{integrity}} can disrupt daily pros-thesis use {{and lead to}} decreased mobility and function in indi-viduals with lower-limb loss. This study reviewed the literature to examine how <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> are defined and diagnosed and to identify the prevalence and types of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> in indi-viduals with lower-limb loss. We searched the literature for terms related to amputation and <b>skin</b> <b>problems.</b> We identified 777 articles. Of the articles, 90 met criteria for review of research methodology. Four clinical studies met our selection criteria. The prevalence rate of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> was 15 % to 41 %. The most commonly reported <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> were wounds, abscesses, and blisters. Given the lack of standardized defini-tions of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> on residual limbs, we conclude this arti-cle with a system for classification...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{influence}} of stump <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> on functioning in daily life in lower limb amputees. A cross-sectional study was performed by means of a questionnaire containing 9 questions assessing functioning in daily life. Question scores were added to give a total score (range 0 (no influence) to 27 (maximum negative influence)). Two thousand and thirty-nine people were invited to participate, with 805 participants completing a questionnaire. Of these, 507 reported one or more <b>skin</b> <b>problems.</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>problems</b> had a negative influence on ability to perform household tasks, prosthesis use, social functioning, and participation in sports. The mean total score was 5. 5 +/- 4. 1. This correlated significantly with the number of skin complaints (r= 0. 483; p= 0. 01). In linear regression analyses, gender (beta=- 0. 15) and number of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> (beta= 0. 25) accounted for 23 % of the total score.

40|$|Cancer {{patients}} may experience <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Frequency of skin reactions {{may be influenced}} by skin pigmentation and psychological factors. A Symptom Inventory completed by 656 cancer patients nationwide before and after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy was analysed to determine if treatment type, race (Black vs White), and pretreatment expectations influenced post-treatment skin reactions. Subsequent analysis of a local Symptom Inventory completed weekly for 5 weeks by 308 patients receiving radiation therapy examined severity of reported skin reactions. Significantly more patients receiving radiation therapy had stronger expectations of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> (62 %) than patients receiving chemotherapy (40 %, P= 0. 001) or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (45 %, P= 0. 003). Overall, expectations did not correlate with patient reported post-treatment <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> in white (r= 0. 014, P= 0. 781) or black (r= 0. 021, P= 0. 936) patients. Although no significant difference was found between black and white patients in their pretreatment expectations of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> (P= 0. 32), black patients (10 out of 18, 56 %) reported more <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> than white patients (90 out of 393, 23 %, P= 0. 001). Similarly, the local study showed that significantly more black patients (1 out of 5, 20 %) reported severe skin reactions at the treatment site than white patients (12 out of 161, 8 %). A direct correlation was observed between severity of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> and pain at the treatment site (r= 0. 541, P< 0. 001). Total radiation exposure did not significantly correlate with the report of <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> at the treatment site for white or black patients. Overall, black patients reported more severe post-treatment <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> than white patients.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between liner-related <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> of the stump in patients with a lower limb amputation and impaired hand function. Sixty patients who were treated in a rehabilitation hospital from 1998 - 2006 were included in an historic cohort study. Data were collected concerning the amputation, <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> of the stump, co-morbidity, hand function, the prosthesis, liner use and mobility score. The study population consisted of 50 trans-tibial and 10 knee disarticulation amputees, 43 male and 17 female, with a mean age of 62. 3 years. The majority (63 %) had a vascular reason for amputation. Blisters, folliculitis, rash and surface wounds on the stump were operationalized as being liner related. In patients with an impaired hand function, 70 % had experienced liner-related <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> of the stump, whereas 32 % of the patients with a normal hand function had experienced <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> (p= 0. 035).

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{determinants of}} <b>skin</b> <b>problems</b> in lower-limb amputees. Design: Survey, using a questionnaire. Setting: Not applicable. Participants: Lower-limb amputees (N= 2039) who either obtained their prosthesis through the Orthopedische Instrument Makerij (a group of orthopedic workshops in the Netherlands) or were {{a member of}} the (Dutch) National Society of Amputees (Landelijke Vereniging van Geamputeerden) were invited to participate. In total, 872 lower-limb amputees agreed to participate. Intervention: Amputees filled in the questionnaire to assess characteristics of the amputation and prosthesis, level of activity, slump and prosthesis hygiene, and <b>skin</b> <b>problems.</b> Stepwise backward logistic regression was performed to analyze determinants of <b>skin</b> <b>problems.</b> Main Outcome Measure: <b>Skin</b> <b>problems</b> in the month prior to completing the questionnaire. Results: A total of 816 questionnaires were received. Eventually 805 questionnaires were suitable for statistical analysis, Protective determinants were (in order of magnitude of association) older age, male sex, and amputation because of peripheral arterial disease and/or diabetes. Provocative determinants were (in order of magnitude of association) use of antibacterial soap, smoking, and washing the stump 4 times a week or more often. In total, 63 % of the participants (95 % confidence interval, 60 %- 67 %) reported 1 or more <b>skin</b> <b>problems.</b> Conclusions: The provocative determinants identified in this study-use of antibacterial soap, smoking, and stump washing frequency-have to be studied for their clinical relevance...|$|R

50|$|Relevance is {{determined}} by exposure to the positive allergen(s), and is rated as definite, probable, possible, past, or unknown. For an allergen to have definite relevance, the product the patient is exposed to must be tested and also be positive {{in addition to the}} test allergen. Probable would be used to describe a positive allergen ingredient which is in a product the patient uses (i.e., quaternium-15 listed in a moisturizing cream used on the sites of dermatitis). Interpretation of the results requires considerable experience and training. A positive patch test might not explain the present <b>skin</b> <b>problem,</b> since the test only indicates that the individual became allergic during encounters with that chemical {{at some point in their}} life. Relevance, therefore, has to be established by determining the causal relationship between the positive test and the eczema. The confirmation of relevance will occur after the patient has avoided exposure to the chemical and after he has noticed that the improvement or clearance of his dermatitis is directly related to this avoidance. This outcome usually occurs within four to six weeks after stopping the exposure to the chemical.|$|E
