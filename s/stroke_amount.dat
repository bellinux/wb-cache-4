It can be assumed that approx. 5 - 7 % of the Swiss population suffers from hyperhomocysteinemia.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{the next}} decades, {{the number of}} stroke {{patients}} is expected to increase. Furthermore, organizational changes, such as stroke services, {{are expected to be}} implemented on a large scale. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate the future healthcare costs by taking into account the expected increase of stroke patients and a nationwide implementation of stroke services. METHODS: By means of a dynamic multistate life table, the total number of stroke patients can be projected. The model calculates the annual number of patients by age and gender. The total healthcare costs are calculated by multiplying the average healthcare costs specified by age, gender, and healthcare sector with the total number of stroke patients specified by age and gender. RESULTS: In the year 2000, the healthcare costs for <b>stroke</b> <b>amounted</b> to euro 1. 62 billion. This amount is approximately 4. 4 percent of the total national healthcare budget. Projections of the total costs of stroke based on current practice result in an increase of 28 percent (euro 2. 08 billion) in the year 2020. A nationwide implementation of stroke services in 2020 would result in a substantial reduction of the costs of stroke (euro 1. 81 billion: 13 percent cost reduction) compared with the regular care scenario.

Methods This study was a prospective population-based study of 2493 Danish men and women, age 41 – 72 years, without major CVD at baseline. At baseline, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and traditional and new risk factors were recorded. Results Over a median follow-up of 12. 6 years, the incidence of a combined CV event (CV death, nonfatal ischemic heart disease, and nonfatal <b>stroke)</b> <b>amounted</b> to 328 cases. Of the various measures of overweight and obesity, in Cox-proportional hazard models, adjusted for age, only WHR was significantly associated with incident CVD with a hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) in women of 2. 22 (1. 31 – 3. 77; P= 0. 0032) in the highest compared with the lowest quartile, and a hazard ratio in men of 1. 73 (1. 12 – 2. 66; P= 0. 014) in the highest compared with the lowest quartile.

The incidence of stroke analyzed on “intention-to-treat” was 0. 7 per 100 patient-years in the anticoagulant group and 1. 2 per 100 patient-years in placebo, a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 60 with a 95 % confidence interval (Cl) of 0. 40 to 0. 90, a 40 % reduction {{in the risk of}} stroke in the anticoagulated group. A total of 19 intracranial bleeding was observed. The risk of hemorrhages was 8 times greater for anticoagulated patients compared to placebo. Eight of the 17 bleedings were fatal in the anticoagulant group and no fatal hemorrhages occurred in placebo. A total of 15 cerebral infarctions occurred in the anticoagulated group and 43 in placebo. Of the 14 hemorrhagic strokes, 6 were within INR 3. 0 – 4. 0 and 8 with an INR> 4. 0, Of the 7 non-hemorrhagic strokes, 2 were at INR 4. 0, and no measurement was available in one patient.

40|$|Abstract Background Stroke {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} reasons of death and disability worldwide. Many cost of illness studies have been performed to evaluate direct and indirect costs of ischaemic stroke, especially within the first year after the acute episode, using different methodologies. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, retrospective, bottom-up cost of illness study, to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes of a cohort of patients affected by a first cerebrovascular event, including subjects with ischaemic, haemorrhagic or transient episodes. The analysis intended to detect direct costs, within 1, 2 and 3 years from the index event. Clinical patient data collected in regional disease registry were integrated and linked to regional administrative databases to perform the analysis. Results The analysis of costs within the first year from the index event included 800 patients. The majority of patients (71. 5 %) were affected by ischaemic stroke. Overall, per patient costs were € 7, 079. Overall costs significantly differ according to the type of stroke, with costs for haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic <b>stroke</b> <b>amounting</b> to € 9, 044 and € 7, 289. Hospital costs, including inpatient rehabilitation, were driver of expenditure, accounting for 89. 5 % of total costs. The multiple regression model showed that sex, level of physical disability and level of neurological deficit predict direct healthcare costs within 1 year. The analysis at 2 and 3 years (per patient costs: € 7, 901 and € 8, 874, respectively) showed that majority of costs are concentrated in the first months after the acute event. Conclusions This cost analysis highlights the importance to set up significant prevention programs to reduce the economic burden of stroke, which is mostly attributable to hospital and inpatient rehabilitation costs immediately after the acute episode. Although some limitation typical of retrospective analyses the approach of linking clinical and administrative database is a power tool to obtain useful information for healthcare planning. </p...|$|R

What is particularly uncertain are the neural variables and processes that mediate the effects of environment on developmental outcomes. Accordingly, in this dissertation, a neurobehavioral model of sensitivity to the environment is proposed and tested in a large sample of human subjects. First, the different patterns of environmental sensitivity are defined to identify the significant factors involved in the manifestation of these patterns. Second, the mechanisms of neurobiological reactivity underlying variation in sensitivity to the environment are proposed by providing an organizing threshold model of elicitation of emotional neurobiology by environmental context. Third, developmental predictions of the model are explored, namely that reactivity of emotional systems will reflect endogenous sensitivities and environmental history. Finally, an empirical investigation of this model is presented. The sensitivity of three emotional systems (social bonding, incentive approach, and stress reactivity) was assessed by exposing participants (N = 398) to stimuli that elicit their activity. In particular, 1) soft touch is a potent social reward activating the social bonding system; 2) anticipation of winning a monetary reward activates the incentive motivation system; and 3) uncertainty of an aversive noise activates the stress response. First, the magnitude of soft touch, monetary reward and uncertainty was varied (i. e., number of brush <b>strokes,</b> <b>amount</b> of monetary reward, and degree of uncertainty), and participants reported immediate emotional feelings in response to each intensity level. Second, participants engaged in an associative conditioning procedure in which each stimulus was paired with a neutral context. The degree of conditioning represents how deeply the emotional experiences were processed to affect learning, and hence, plasticity. Results show that momentary responses to each emotional stimulus strongly predicted degree of associative conditioning and that emotional sensitivities were related in expected ways to early environmental experience and personality traits. These {{findings suggest that the}} proposed emotional systems are mechanisms of adaptation to the environment, and that the function of these systems reflect environmental history. 2018 - 11 - 3...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: We have {{previously}} {{shown in a}} rat model of focal cerebral ischemia that sleep deprivation after stroke onset aggravates brain damage. Others reported that sleep deprivation prior to stroke is neuroprotective. The main {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that the neuroprotection may be related to an increase in sleep (sleep rebound) during the acute phase of stroke. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n= 36) were subjected to continuous polygraphic recordings for baseline, total sleep deprivation (TSD), and 24 h after ischemia. TSD for 6 h was performed by gentle handling and immediately followed by ischemia. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of distal branches of the middle cerebral artery. Control experiments included ischemia without SD (nSD) and sham surgery with TSD (n= 6 /group). RESULTS: Shortly after <b>stroke,</b> the <b>amount</b> of slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) increased significantly (p< 0. 05) in the TSD/ischemia, resulting in an increase in the total sleep time by 30 % compared to baseline, or by 20 % compared with the nSD/ischemia group. The infarct volume decreased significantly by 50 % in the TSD/ischemia compared to nSD group (p< 0. 02).

We used spectroscopic imaging to measure N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, {{a marker of}} normal neurons) and lactate (a marker of ischemia) to compare with diffusion and perfusion values in the diffusion lesion in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke prospectively and performed MR diffusion weighted (DWI), perfusion, and spectroscopic imaging. We coregistered the images, outlined the visible diffusion lesion, and extracted metabolite, perfusion, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from the diffusion lesion. RESULTS: 42 patients were imaged, from 1. 5 to 24 hours after stroke. In the DWI lesion, although NAA was reduced, there was no correlation between NAA and ADC or perfusion values. However, raised lactate correlated with reduced ADC (Spearman rho= 0. 32, P= 0. 04) and prolonged mean transit time (MTT, rho= 0. 31, P= 0. 04). Increasing DWI lesion size was associated with lower NAA and higher lactate (rho=- 0. 44, P= 0. 003; rho= 0. 49, P= 0. 001 respectively); NAA fell with increasing times to imaging (rho=- 0. 3, P= 0. 03), but lactate did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Although larger confirmatory studies are needed, the correlation of ADC and MTT with lactate but not NAA suggests that ADC and MTT are better markers {{of the presence of}} ischemia than of cumulative neuronal loss. Further studies should define more precisely the rate of neuronal loss and relationship to diffusion and perfusion parameters with respect to the depth and duration of ischemia...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the diesel}} engine's popularity, its {{emission}} of {{high levels of}} nitric oxide (NO) is problematic. Reduction of pollutant emissions requires a profound understanding of the combustion process {{and in particular the}} exact NO formation pathways. Since the latter are not entirely understood, accurate quantitative experiments are necessary to provide new insights and to validate existing combustion models. To date, reliable experimental techniques for in-cylinder NO concentration measurements are scarce. This thesis is dedicated {{to the development of the}} laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique to a level at which quantitative, in-cylinder concentration measurements of NO can be realised in a heavy-duty diesel engine. A number of laser techniques are investigated, allowing a correction for the severe attenuation that is experienced by both the laser beam and the induced fluorescence in the combustion chamber. Additionally, a spectroscopic model accounting for the pressure and temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity per molecule is discussed. By applying these two corrections, quantitative in-cylinder NO concentrations are obtained. An important observation is that, during the combustion <b>stroke,</b> significant <b>amounts</b> of NO are observed before the most important NO formation mechanism (the Zeldovich mechanism) can come into play, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the early NO formation. Furthermore, measured in-cylinder NO concentration histories are compared with calculated concentrations. Although the agreement between experiment and calculation suggests that the Zeldovich mechanism is a major contributor to the formation of the observed NO, the contribution of other mechanisms early in the combustion cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Introduction This {{study was}} planned to {{investigate}} the impact of severe bleeding and blood transfusion {{on the development of}} stroke after coronary surgery. Methods This cohort study includes 2357 patients undergoing isolated CABG from the prospective European Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (E-CABG) registry. Severity of bleeding was categorized according to the Universal Definition of Perioperative Bleeding (UDPB), E-CABG and PLATO definitions. Results Thirty patients (1. 3 %) suffered postoperative <b>stroke.</b> The <b>amount</b> of transfused red blood cell (RBC) (OR 1. 10, 95 %CI 1. 03 – 1. 18), preoperative use of unfractioned heparin (OR 4. 49, 95 %CI 1. 91 – 10. 60), emergency operation (OR 3. 97, 95 %CI 1. 47 – 10. 74), diseased ascending aorta (OR 4. 62, 95 %CI 1. 37 – 15. 65) and use of cardiopulmonary bypass (p =  0. 043, OR 4. 85, 95 %CI 1. 05 – 22. 36) were independent predictors of postoperative stroke. Adjusted analysis showed that UDPB classes 3 – 4 (crude rate: 3. 6 % vs. 1. 0 %; adjusted OR 2. 66, 95 %CI 1. 05 – 6. 73), E-CABG bleeding grades 2 – 3 (crudes rate: 6. 3 % vs. 0. 9 %; adjusted OR 5. 91, 95 %CI 2. 43 – 14. 36), and PLATO life-threatening bleeding (crude rate: 2. 5 % vs. 0. 6 %, adjusted OR 3. 70, 95 %CI 1. 59 – 8. 64) were associated with an increased risk of stroke compared with no or moderate bleeding. Conclusions Bleeding and blood transfusion are associated with an increased risk of stroke after CABG, which is highest in patients with severe bleeding...|$|R
40|$|Questions: In people {{receiving}} rehabilitation {{aimed at}} reducing activity limitations of the lower and/or upper limb after stroke, does adding extra rehabilitation (of the same content as the usual rehabilitation) improve activity? What {{is the amount of}} extra rehabilitation that needs to be provided to achieve a beneficial effect? Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants: Adults aged 18 years or older that had a diagnosis of stroke. Intervention: Extra rehabilitation with the same content as usual rehabilitation {{aimed at reducing}} activity limitations of the lower and/or upper limb. Outcome measures: Activity measured as lower or upper limb ability. Results: A total of 14 studies, comprising 15 comparisons, met the inclusion criteria. Pooling data from all the included studies showed that extra rehabilitation improved activity immediately after the intervention period (SMD =  0. 39, 95 % CI 0. 07 to 0. 71, I 2  =  66 %). When only studies with a large increase in rehabilitation (> 100 %) were included, the effect was greater (SMD 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 23 to 0. 94, I 2  =  44 %). There was a trend towards a positive relationship (r =  0. 53, p =  0. 09) between extra rehabilitation and improved activity. The turning point on the ROC curve of false versus true benefit (AUC =  0. 88, p =  0. 04) indicated that at least an extra 240 % of rehabilitation was needed for significant likelihood that extra rehabilitation would improve activity. Conclusion: Increasing the amount of usual rehabilitation aimed at reducing activity limitations improves activity in people after <b>stroke.</b> The <b>amount</b> of extra rehabilitation that needs to be provided to achieve a beneficial effect is large.

60|$|Nineteen {{persons were}} {{gathered}} here. Of these, five women, wearing gowns of various bright hues, sat in chairs along the wall; girls shy and not shy filled the window-bench; four men, including Charley Jake the hedge- carpenter, Elijah New the parish-clerk, and John Pitcher, a neighbouring dairyman, the shepherd's father-in-law, lolled in the settle; {{a young man}} and maid, who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a life-companionship, sat beneath the corner-cupboard; and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was. Enjoyment was pretty general, and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional restrictions.

40|$|A {{modified}} parameter named " Homogeneity Factor (HF) of in-cylinder charge" {{has been}} introduced as a new measure for supporting {{the understanding of the}} air-fuel mixing and combustion process in diesel engines. The effects of this parameter on engine performance and pollutant emissions have been studied using various EGR and split injection schemes on a DI diesel engine. In this study, twelve different injection strategies for which two injection pulses with different fuel amount for each pulse (up to 30 % for the second pulse) and different separation between two pulses (up to 30 ?? CA) were evaluated using CFD modeling. Results show the higher Homogeneity Factor will result in higher rate of air-fuel mixing and more complete combustion process. It was found when the dwell delay between injection pulses becomes longer, as it leaves more time for the air-fuel mixing during the late compression <b>stroke,</b> the maximum <b>amount</b> of Homogeneity Factor will be obtained at a later stage of combustion process and it can caused a reduction of NOx formation. This suggests, by optimizing split injection configurations accompanied with appropriate EGR rate, pollutant emissions can be decreased and controlled more accurately. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Recombinant tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (rtPA; Actilyse) is not as widely used in clinical practice as it could be. Have new data since 1995 strengthened the evidence sufficiently to justify more widespread use of rtPA? Methods—We performed a sequential year-to-year cumulative meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of rtPA in acute ischemic <b>stroke.</b> Results—Although the <b>amount</b> of data has doubled since 1995, effect estimates for key outcomes remain imprecise, and significant between-trial heterogeneity persists. In the most recent analysis, rtPA up to 6 hours after stroke yielded 55 fewer dead or dependent people per 1000 treated (95 % CI, 18 to 92) despite some risk (nonsignificant excess of 19 deaths per 1000 patients treated; 95 % CI, 6 fewer to 48 more). Severity of stroke, patient age, and aspirin use were possible sources of heterogeneity. Conclusions—Despite doubling of the data since 1995, the magnitude of risks and benefits with rtPA remains imprecise. This gap in knowledge may be hindering clinical use of rtPA and can be filled only by new trials designed to address these specific issues. (Stroke. 2003; 34 : 1437 - 1442.)

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the timings and ranges of linear displacements of the pelvis and feet occurring {{in a healthy}} older population when stepping up (SU) onto a step; and to describe variations noted in {{a small sample of}} subjects with hemiplegia. Design: An observational case series. Setting: Gait Laboratory in a General Hospital. Subjects: Convenience sample of subjects (< 60 years). Interventions: Participants stepping up onto 18 cm step. Main outcome measures: SU cycle time, pelvic lateral displacement (PLD), footbase and heel clearance using CODA- a three dimensional movement analysis system. Results: Mean SU time of normal subjects was 1. 68 sec. Total range of PLD during one SU cycle was 70 mm. PLD was asymmetrical being significantly greater towards the initial weight bearing leg. (p< 0. 0001). Older subjects (60 +years) had less heel clearance than (p< 0. 03) than younger. SU performance by subjects with hemiplegia observed to be up to three times slower, to use up to 4 times the range of PLD and to be asymmetrical in timing and ranges of movement. Conclusions: This kinematic study describes a 'normal' SU pattern not previously reported. Age and <b>stroke</b> influenced the <b>amount</b> and speed of movement adopted during the task. Information about the movement strategies used by the elderly and those with stroke should guide therapists in their management of physical function...|$|R
