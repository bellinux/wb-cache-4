The communal rooms for the students of Civil Engineering Faculty of Semarang State University could be divided into three types; the rooms being used as planned for, the rooms being used not as intensively as planned for, and the rooms which were not planned but which became existed due to the students' behaviors This study was intended to produce some profiles and descriptive formulations for the physical and attribute settings of the communal rooms used by these Civil Engineering students for their social interactions. This study was confined to the communal rooms, within the Civil Engineering environment, used both for indoor and outdoor informal social interactions by the students. The communal rooms preferred here were the ones originally planned for circulation. The steps taken {{in this study were}} as follow: 1. 	Defining the cases for the communal rooms and the sample. 2. 	Searching for the needed data by means of field observations, documentation, interviews and closed questionnaires responded by the respondents who were in the rooms when this study was being conducted. 3. 	Presenting and analyzing the obtained data. 4. 	Providing some meanings for the existing phenomena by means of categorization 5. 	Drawing some conclusions. This study showed that several different settings of the communal rooms could be identified based on the dominant activities conducted by these Civil Engineering students. The categorization resulted in communal rooms for waiting for lecturing or practicing times, communal rooms for waiting for the lecturers, communal rooms for HIMA activities and communal rooms for eating and drinking. The attributes arising from each of the settings varied in both their types and order of importance. The communal rooms for waiting for lecturing or practicing times were primarily dominated (in the order of importance) by their visibility, comfortableness, accessibility and socializing qualities. These rooms also needed some secondary attributes such as territoriality, freedom, refreshing qualities and sensory stimuli. The communal rooms for waiting for the lecturers were dominated primarily (in the order of importance) by their visibility, comfortableness and accessibility and also by secondary attributes such as socializing qualities, territoriality, freedom, refreshing qualities and sensory stimuli. The communal rooms for HIMA activities were dominated by their visibility, territoriality, freedom, sensory stimuli, comfortableness and accessibility. The communal rooms for eating and drinking were dominated by their comfortableness, socializing qualities, freedom, territoriality, and refreshing qualities. From the above findings, it can be concluded that the communal rooms for the students of the Civil Engineering Faculty of Semarang State University had different characteristics in their settings, attributes and setting systems. The arising attributes can be divided into primary and secondary attributes. The existences of these informal rooms for communal interactions among the students were closely related to other formal ones, which as a whole constituted a broader setting system.
