For maximum efficiency, gravure presses operate at high speeds producing large diameter, wide rolls. These are then cut or slit down to the finished roll size on a slitting machine or slitter rewinder. Additional operations may be in line with a gravure press, such as <b>saddle</b> <b>stitching</b> facilities for magazine or brochure work.|$|R

50|$|A board {{book is a}} type of book {{printed on}} thick {{paperboard}}. The paperboard is printed and used for both the cover and the interior pages.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the human needs in the prepress and postpress areas of the graphic arts industries in selected midwest states. A needs assessment instrument was designed to achieve this purpose;A random sampling technique was utilized to select the sample size of 450 companies from the population of the printing companies in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin;A paired t-test analysis was done to determine if there existed a difference between the current need and the need in ten years for some production processes. The analysis showed that current need is greater than the need in ten years in paste-up and copy preparation and proof reading. Contrastingly, the need will be greater in ten years than currently in color stripping and masking, process color, scanner, hard cover binding by machines, perforating, embossing, laminating, perfect binding, <b>saddle</b> <b>stitching,</b> shrink wrapping, punching and foil stamping operations;A one-way analysis was applied to determine if a statistical significant difference existed between the companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes (large, medium, and small) and their opinions about competencies for new employees, graphic arts curricula adequacy, manpower needs, periodic conduction of manpower surveys and technology changes;The results of the analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes and their opinions about the need for competencies for new employees and for graphic arts curricula to reflect technological changes. Also, there were no significant differences between the companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes and their opinions about the manpower needs, changes and the need to conduct periodic manpower needs surveys to determine future manpower needs;However, the results showed that a significant difference existed between companies 2 ̆ 7 sizes and technology changes in the graphic arts industry...|$|R
