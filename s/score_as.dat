5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable <b>score.</b> <b>As</b> a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
5|$|Despite his struggles, Affeldt {{was named}} to the Giants' playoff roster. Affeldt made his first playoff {{appearance}} for the Giants in Game 2 of the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia. He struck out one batter and intentionally walked another one, but Santiago Casilla allowed him to <b>score</b> <b>as</b> the Giants lost 61. Affeldt faced (and retired) one batter in Game 5, but the Phillies won that game 42. In Game 6, Affeldt entered the game in the third inning with runners on first and second and nobody out after starting pitcher Jonathan Sánchez was taken out early. He pitched two hitless, scoreless innings, and the Giants won the game 32 to advance to the World Series. Affeldt pitched in two games in the World Series, which the Giants won in five games to give Affeldt his first World Series ring.|$|E

5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard {{was incapable of}} creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's <b>score,</b> <b>as</b> suggested by Madonna.|$|E
5|$|In a December 22, 1990, {{win against}} in-state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted {{a new career}} high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point {{attempts}} of the game. He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3, 1991, contest against Georgia, when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble. Farmer suffered a black eye during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to the basket to <b>score,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest first-class <b>score,</b> <b>as</b> well as centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.|$|E

Oklahoma recovered the ball at the Nebraska 2-yard-line and scored a touchdown {{to take the lead}} 70 with 48seconds expired off the clock. It was the fastest score in Big12 Championship Game history. With 5:35 left in the first quarter, Oklahoma's quarterback completed a touchdown pass to Malcolm Kelly to go up 140. With 4:37 left in the first half, Nebraska's Zach Taylor threw a touchdown pass and the extra point shaved Oklahoma's lead to 147, which was still the <b>score</b> <b>as</b> the game went to half-time.|$|E

These successes represented his 26th and 27th aerial victories. Thereafter, details vary as to his <b>score</b> <b>as</b> all records were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons Johnson {{featured}} intermittently in the first team. He scored five goals in 12 appearances for the first team in 1920–21, playing more regularly for the reserves, for whom he was the leading goalscorer with 18 goals. He became a regular first team selection in 1922–23, playing 35 matches. In 1923 Manchester City moved from Hyde Road to a new stadium, Maine Road, in the Moss Side area of the city. Johnson scored in the first match at the new stadium, against Sheffield United. While Johnson was a regular goalscorer {{at this point in}} his career, he did not <b>score</b> <b>as</b> frequently as teammates Frank Roberts and Horace Barnes.

After Rube Walker's hit the Giants threw Hodges out at home plate, and two further outs ended their turn at bat. The Giants had two consecutive hits in their half, a double hit by Thomson and a single hit by Mays, but they failed to <b>score</b> <b>as</b> well after two groundouts, leaving the score 2–0.
