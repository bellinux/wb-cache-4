25|$|Frozen dinners, pies, and {{microwave}} popcorn bags often contain a <b>susceptor</b> made from thin aluminium {{film in the}} packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a single use and are then discarded as waste.|$|E
25|$|Microwave heating can be {{deliberately}} uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) {{may include}} materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which {{are designed to}} absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with Hot Pockets, which have a silver surface on the inside, are {{a good example of}} such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a <b>susceptor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Conduction heating {{occurs with}} good thermal contact between <b>susceptor</b> and food. Because {{of the lower}} temperatures, there is less browning, but more than {{if there were no}} <b>susceptor</b> at all.|$|E
50|$|In a {{ferromagnetic}} workpiece, plastics can be induction-welded by formulating {{them with}} metallic or ferromagnetic compounds, called <b>susceptors.</b> These <b>susceptors</b> absorb electromagnetic energy from an induction coil, become hot, and lose their heat {{energy to the}} surrounding material by thermal conduction.|$|R

50|$|A reactor is {{a chamber}} {{made of a}} {{material}} that does not react with the chemicals being used. It must also withstand high temperatures. This chamber is composed by reactor walls, liner, a <b>susceptor,</b> gas injection units, and temperature control units. Usually, the reactor walls are made from stainless steel or quartz. Ceramic or special glasses, such as quartz, are often used as the liner in the reactor chamber between the reactor wall and the <b>susceptor.</b> To prevent overheating, cooling water must be flowing through the channels within the reactor walls. A substrate sits on a <b>susceptor</b> which is at a controlled temperature. The <b>susceptor</b> is made from a material resistant to the metalorganic compounds used; graphite is sometimes used. For growing nitrides and related materials, a special coating on the graphite <b>susceptor</b> is necessary to prevent corrosion by ammonia (NH3) gas.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} an air gap (or at least, poor thermal contact) between the <b>susceptor</b> and food, the <b>susceptor</b> will heat to much higher {{temperature}} (due to its smaller effective heat capacity when in poor contact with food), and at these higher temperatures, will radiate strongly in the infrared. This infrared radiation then shines onto the food below or next to the <b>susceptor,</b> causing a [...] "broiling" [...] type effect (high skin heating), due to lower ability of infrared to penetrate foods, vs. microwaves. Conversion of some microwave to infrared is particularly useful for goods which require {{a large amount of}} crust-browning from infrared, such as frozen pies.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{silicide}} {{process with}} two-step low temperature microwave annealing (MWA) achieves NiSi thickness of 10 nm while maintaining low resistance, and an ultra-thin Ni silicide film, only 4. 5 nm, has been realized. In this MWA system, we insert quartz and Si <b>susceptors</b> {{to change the}} absorption efficiency of the process wafer and provide fine turning in temperature control during annealing. The thickness of NiSi film is determined by microwave power and by changing the number and the position of quartz and Si <b>susceptors</b> in {{the first step of}} the anneal process.

50|$|<b>Susceptors</b> {{built into}} {{packaging}} create high temperatures {{in a microwave}} oven. This is useful for crisping and browning foods, as well as concentrating heat on {{the oil in a}} microwave popcorn bag (which is solid at room temperature) in order to melt it rapidly.|$|R

40|$|Titanium is a {{paramagnetic}} metal which couples weakly with microwaves. This work reports our experimental {{observations of}} microwave (MW) sintering of CP-Ti, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al in a 3 kW, 2. 45 GHz multi-mode high-vacuum (103 Pa) MW system, {{with the assistance}} of MW <b>susceptors.</b> Controllable heating rates up to 50 °C/min were readily achievable by MW radiation. This significantly reduces the overall sintering cycle compared with conventional vacuum sintering. MW sintering is capable of consolidating titanium powder compacts to similar densities by conventional vacuum sintering.

50|$|Metallised {{films are}} used as a <b>susceptor</b> for cooking in {{microwave}} ovens. These increase the heating capacity and help make foods crisp and brown. Plastic microwavable containers are also used for microwave cooking.|$|E
50|$|In {{microwave}} cooking, susceptors {{are built}} into paper packaging of certain foods, where they absorb microwaves which penetrate the packaging. This process raises the <b>susceptor</b> patch temperature to levels {{where it may}} then heat food by conduction or by infrared radiation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>susceptor</b> (which may {{be located}} on {{examination}} from its gray or blue-gray color, which {{is different from}} paper) is the reason products meant to be browned via susceptor-generated thermal radiation carry instructions to microwave the food while still inside its packaging.|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} pure {{microwave}} (MW) radiation, without {{the assistance of}} MW <b>susceptors,</b> can rapidly heat titanium hydride (TiH 2) powder to 1300 C for isothermal sintering. The release of hydrogen, however, induces low-temperature plasmas which reflect incident MWs, leading to cyclic temperature fluctuations. Commercially pure titanium fabricated by MW radiation of TiH 2 powder exhibits much higher sintered densities, tensile strength and ductility together with finer residual pores, compared to that sintered from hydride-dehydride titanium powder. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

50|$|One type of reactor used {{to carry}} out MOCVD is a cold-wall reactor. In a cold-wall reactor, the {{substrate}} {{is supported by a}} pedestal, which also acts as a <b>susceptor.</b> The pedestal/susceptor is the primary origin of heat energy in the reaction chamber. Only the <b>susceptor</b> is heated, so gases do not react before they reach the hot wafer surface. The pedestal/susceptor is made of a radiation-absorbing material such as carbon. In contrast, the walls of the reaction chamber in a cold-wall reactor are typically made of quartz which is largely transparent to the electromagnetic radiation. The reaction chamber walls in a cold-wall reactor, however, may be indirectly heated by heat radiating from the hot pedestal/susceptor, but will remain cooler than the pedestal/susceptor and the substrate the pedestal/susceptor supports.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the growth}} process of {{magnesium}} diboride thin films by HPCVD, the carrier gas is purified hydrogen gas H2 at a pressure of about 100 Torr. This H2 environment prevents oxidation during the deposition. Bulk pure Mg pieces are placed {{next to the}} substrate {{on the top of}} the <b>susceptor.</b> When the <b>susceptor</b> is heated to about 650°C, pure Mg pieces are also heated, which generates a high Mg vapor pressure in the vicinity of the substrate. Diborane (B2H6) is used as the boron source. MgB2 films starts to grow when the boron precursor gas B2H6 is introduced into the reactor chamber. The growth rate of the MgB2 film is controlled by the flow rate of B2H6/H2 mixture. The film growth stops when the boron precursor gas is switched off.|$|E

5000|$|Nonmagnetic {{materials}} and electrical insulators such as plastics can be induction-welded by implanting them with metallic or ferromagnetic compounds, called <b>susceptors,</b> that absorb the electromagnetic {{energy from the}} induction coil, become hot, and lose their heat to the surrounding material by thermal conduction.
