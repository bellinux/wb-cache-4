40|$|Aims: Five {{bacterial}} strains {{belonging to}} Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ps. corrugata and two fungal strains belonging to Trichoderma viride and Gliocladium virens were evaluated for their efficacy in controlling sugar beet and cucumber damping-off caused by Pythium ultimum. Methods and Results: The in vitro antagonistic activity of bacteria against various Pythium spp. was evaluated with dual cultures in various media. Pseudomonas strains inhibited the pathogen better than Bacillus strains. To identify potentially useful antagonist combinations, dual compatibility of antagonists was also evaluated, based on growth in two liquid media containing substrate previously used by other antagonists. Four pairs of bacteria were selected. Sugar beet damping-off biocontrol was attempted with bacterial seed treatments (individually and in pairs). Cucumber damping-off biocontrol was attempted with bacterial seed treatments and bacterial and fungal compost treatments. In sugar beet, satisfactory biocontrol was only achieved with Pseudomonas antagonists. Antagonist combinations {{did not show}} any superior biocontrol ability to individual antagonists and compatibility of bacteria in vitro did not correlate with compatibility in vivo. Bacterial seed treatments and fungal compost treatments failed to control cucumber damping-off. Better biocontrol in cucumber was achieved when bacterial antagonists were applied by drenching or by coating seed with bacteria in a peat carrier. Conclusions: Pseudomonas antagonists were superior to Bacillus antagonists in controlling damping-off in cucumber and sugar beet. Pseudomonas peat inocula maintained a good <b>shelf-life</b> <b>2</b> <b>years</b> after preparation.

40|$|Nitroimidazoles {{have been}} applied {{in the past to}} poultry and pigs to treat {{protozoan}} diseases and the combat bacterial infections, but due to adverse health effects their use in food-producing animals has meanwhile been banned in the EU. The request for a certified reference material in a representative matrix was stipulated by the responsible Community Reference Laboratory and is underpinned by the need to improve the accuracy and comparability of measurement data and to establish metrological traceability of analytical results. The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) has responded to this demand by developing and producing a new certified matrix reference material, ERM-BB 124. This incurred lyophilised pork meat material was certified according to ISO Guides 34 and 35 for the mass fractions of six nitroimidazole compounds. Processing of the frozen muscle tissue to the final material was accomplished by application of cutting, freeze-drying, mixing and milling techniques. Homogeneity and stability measurements were performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The relative standard uncertainty due to possible heterogeneity showed to be below 1. 8 % for all analytes. Potential degradataion during transport and storage was assesssed by isochronous stability studies. No significant instability was detected at a storage temperature of - 20 °C for a <b>shelf-life</b> of <b>2</b> <b>years.</b> the certified mass fraction values were assigned upon evaluation of the data acquired in an international laboratory inter-comparison involving 12 expert laboratories using different sample preparation procedures, but exclusively LC-MS/MS metehods. Relative standard uncertainty contributions for the characterisation (between-lab variation of mean values) were found to be between 1. 6 and 4. 8 %. Certified values for five analytes were in the range of 0. 7 to 6. 2 ug/kg, with expanded relative uncertainties ranging between 7 and 14 %. Dimetridazole could be certified as "< 0. 25 ug/kg with a probability of 95 %". All values are traceable to the International System of Units (SI). The material is intended to be used for method validation purposes (including trueness estimation) and for method performance. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} was aimed {{to establish a}} validated stability-indicating liquid chromatographic method for the estimation of etoposide (ETP) in bulk drug and self-nano emulsifying formulation. ETP was successfully separated from the degradation products formed under stress conditions on LiChrospher 100 C 18 reverse-phase column (a 250 mm× 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 -μm particle size) using 55 : 45 (v/v) acetonitrile–phosphate buffer saline (pH 4. 5) as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mLmin− 1 and detection at 283 nm. The response was a linear function of analyte concentration (R 2 > 0. 9997) over the concentration range of 0. 05 – 50 μgmL− 1. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, robustness, sensitivity and specificity. The % recovery of ETP at three different levels (50 %, 100 % and 150 %) ranged between 93. 84 % and 100. 06 % in optimized self-nano emulsifying formulation, Etosid® soft-gelatin capsule and Fytosid® injection. First-order degradation kinetics of ETP were observed under acidic and alkaline conditions. The method was also applied for the stability assessment of self-nano emulsifying formulation under accelerated conditions, the formulation {{was found to be}} stable at all storage conditions with the <b>shelf-life</b> of <b>2.</b> 37 <b>years</b> at 25 °C. The method holds promise for routine quality control of ETP in bulk, pharmaceutical formulations as well as in stability-indicating studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this investigation}} is to determine how an existing building of spatial and programmatic rigidity {{can serve as a}} framework for designing a more integrated center for personal and community development. This project is an exploration of what a building can evolve into after its <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>shelf-life</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 has expired, {{with the aid of a}} reconsidered architectural vision. Formulated within criteria individual to its context, it is intended to be an investigation of possibility and the testing of a nascent potential, not an attempt to serve as a prescriptive, panacea solution. It is an examination of a creative vision in the development of a more responsive and expressive community space. Through this exploration, the architectural experience as derived from a subject-object perspective will be investigated and considered, as well as the art of placemaking in crafting a design strategy that is responsive to its immediate context, reconsidering the ability of architecture to generate meaning and experience outside of its prototypically considered building-envelope boundaries. By focusing on the potential to for personal and community-based growth and development, three avenues of program will be explored: Education, Experience, and Expression. Serving as an intersection point between cultural production and cultural consumption, the transmission of this cultural capital has the ability to gestate a deeper sense of identity amongst the embedded community...|$|R
