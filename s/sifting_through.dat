5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E

The first batch of E.T. games was discovered after about three hours of digging, and hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. In the deal between the City of Alamogordo and Fuel Entertainment regarding the excavation, Fuel Entertainment was to be given 250 games or 10 percent of what was found.|$|E

25|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} that Kelvin had most certainly died from massive blood loss from an anal injury, probably {{caused by the}} insertion of a blunt object, such as a beer bottle, {{and that he had}} suffered bruising and injuries to his head and back, which were likely to have been caused by blows. Analysis of Kelvin's bloodstream revealed traces of four hypnotic drugs, including Mandrax and Noctec. With the drugs as their only firm lead at that stage, police began <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> prescriptions for those drugs. During their search they found a prescription for Mandrax issued to a B. von Einem, a name familiar to police as he had been questioned previously over the deaths of three young men and the alleged sexual assault of another.|$|E

[...] The recording process took place over a period of ten months, due largely to the band's touring schedule, but the majority of actual studio time was spent experimenting with different instruments and miking techniques.

500|$|Writings on more {{permanent}} media {{have also been}} lost in several ways. Stones with inscriptions were frequently re-used as building materials, and ceramic ostraca require a dry environment to ensure {{the preservation of the}} ink on their surfaces. Whereas papyrus rolls and packets were usually stored in boxes for safekeeping, ostraca were routinely discarded in waste pits; one such pit was discovered by chance at the Ramesside-era village of Deir el-Medina, and has yielded the majority of known private letters on ostraca. Documents found at this site include letters, hymns, fictional narratives, recipes, business receipts, and wills and testaments. Penelope Wilson describes this archaeological find as the equivalent of <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> a modern landfill or waste container.

U2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in the 1980s. However, for the new album, the band was interested in no longer making obvious sense. Accordingly, the lyrics for [...] "Zoo Station" [...] were inspired by the surrealism of a story about Berlin during World War II that Bono heard. Animals escaped the city's zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing, and as a result, rhinoceroses, pelicans and flamingoes wandered around the next morning while people were <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> the rubble. Bono was also inspired by Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, also known as [...] "Zoo station", previously the main railway station in West Berlin. The station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps, pick-pockets and transients, particularly prior to German reunification, when it was run by the East German railway. He compared the song to the station, saying [...] "it was written as an opening track, the beasts breaking out of their cages", and was interested in using the zoo as a metaphor and he took further inspiration from the subway station representing Europe at a crossroads.|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} {{wake of the}} tornado, The Salvation Army and American Red Cross set up temporary shelters for residents in Fairdale. The Rochelle Community Hospital was shifted into [...] "disaster mode" [...] to quickly handle {{the large number of}} casualties. Equipment and resources from over a dozen nearby fire departments aided in <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> the remains of dozens of houses. More than 675 volunteers, coordinated by the Virginia faith-based nonprofit organization Operation Blessing, and countless residents from surrounding areas assisted in cleanup efforts. AmeriCorps coordinated their own operations beginning on April12. Switchyard Bar and Grill in Rochelle hosted a donation drive to provide victims with new household items. Ogle County Sheriff Brian VanVickle and DeKalb County Sheriff Roger Scott set up a lost-and-found for residents to retrieve missing items. Workers from [...] "Bees Designs" [...] created and sold shirts in Rochelle, with all proceeds donated to help tornado victims. A check from near Rochelle was discovered approximately 80mi (130km) northeast in Racine, Wisconsin, a common occurrence with violent tornadoes. Widespread severe weather across northern Illinois prompted the cancellation of more than 850 flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Governor Bruce Rauner declared DeKalb and Ogle counties as state disaster areas, freeing up a wide variety of resources for response efforts. Both the governor and Illinois U.S. Senator Mark Kirk toured the area. Total economic losses from the tornado reached $19 million (2015 USD).|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re <b>sifting</b> <b>through,</b> figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for the New York Daily News, Mary Talbot said {{listening}} to Dreaming of You was [...] "akin to <b>sifting</b> <b>through</b> a dead woman's scrapbook" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disparate jottings and snapshots some artful, some light, all weighted with nostalgia". Talbot said the album showcases [...] "Selena's past and outlines {{what could have been}} her future", and because of the singer's death, the story is incomplete. She called the English offerings [...] "sturdy, generic pop numbers" [...] that would be favored among her Tejano following [...] "but there aren't enough of them to prove her strength or breadth as an English-language artist". Talbot said Selena was skillful in crisscrossing [...] "traditional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop sensibility, and that skill doesn't figure with these songs". Towards the end of her review, Talbot said Dreaming of You is [...] "the effervescent pop of her generation". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said the album [...] "doesn't deliver", writing that Selena was [...] "revamped to sound like one of pop radio's many generic female vocalist" [...] and that her English recordings lack [...] "the bubbly, effervescent personality, the chica-del-barrio charm" [...] found on her Tejano songs. Tarradell said the English songs were [...] "tepid imitations of Amy Grant and Abdul". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called Dreaming of You [...] "a collection of leftovers" [...] and said the Spanish-language songs [...] "sound better" [...] than Selena's English ones. Watrous said the producers did not ameliorate Selena's English-language tracks and gave their all. He further wrote that [...] "the music is faceless commerce" [...] but that Selena recorded them [...] "so well on the album" [...] that it suggested [...] "she had a good chance of success, working lush ballads in an anonymous pop style that Disney has mastered". Rock music contributor Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant described Dreaming of You as [...] "a package that hints at the overall talent and immense potential of the young star". Catlin said her English-language works were lacking [...] "technical heroics that have defined [...] in the '90s." [...] but states the singer [...] "is understandably assured" [...] on her Spanish offerings. He said Selena was [...] "low key" [...] and that the material seemed that way because she had only recorded four English-language tracks before her death.|$|E
