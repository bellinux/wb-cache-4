40|$|This general paper {{suggests}} that the scope of a country's food and nutrition policy should embrace three related objectives: (1) the design and implementation of an agricultural strategy that achieves an appropriate rate and pattern of expansion of food and other farm products; (2) action to bring nutritional objectives to bear in influencing the combination of foods produced and the processing techniques employed; and (3) the identification and implementation of <b>supplementary</b> <b>programmes</b> of nutrition intervention aimed directly at certain important welfare objectives, such as overcoming nutritional deficiencies that may be common among some segments of the under-five age group. Principal emphasis is given in this, paper to the first objective. It is argued that an agricultural strategy that brings about the progressive modernisation of a large and increasing fraction of a country's farm households is fundamental {{to the success of}} efforts to promote overall economic growth and structural transformation as well as achieving the social goals of employment creation, better income distribution, and improvements in nutrition and health...|$|E

40|$|This work forms {{part of the}} {{research}} programme into the properties of colliery discards undertaken in Durham since the Aberfan disaster of 1966. The discussion relating to residual strength in the paper 'Colliery Spoil Tips - after Aberfan' was summed up by the authors, McKechnie Thomson and Rodin, with the words "The information currently available on residual strength poses {{a number of questions}} and further studies are needed to clarify such factors as the effect of normal pressure and magnitude ofstrain". The current work attempts to clarify some of these problems. Large strain (1. 5 to 2. 5 metres total displacement) 12 -inch shear-box tests have been undertaken on selected samples from different National Coal Board coalfield areas. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>programmes</b> of tests in a 60 mm shear-box were used to confirm the results of the large-scale tests. Similarly, additional tests have been conducted at normal stresses which are generally higher than those customarily adopted for normal soils testing. The results show that at low normal stresses (80 kN/m (^ 2), shear strength reduction in most discards is limited (15 - 25 per cent) for a displacement of one metre. The exception is extreme low rank material from the West Midlands coalfield, for which a strength reduction of over 40 per cent was obtained. Tests revealed a marked increase in the rate of shear strength reduction for most discards at a normal stress value between 200 - 300 kN/m (^ 2). Above 500 kN/m (^ 2) increase in the rate of breakdown is limited. Correlation of shear strength characteristics with the rank code number of the associated coal show generally negative results, the exception being extreme 'low rank' discard from collieries in the West Midlands. Statistical treatment of the results has revealed significant correlations between the shear strength properties and the grading parameters. In practical terms, vehicular activity is unlikely to cause shear planes to develop in the majority of new or existing tips during emplacement or regarding operations...|$|E

The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] onlangse verslae het minder as 10 % van alle graad 6 -leerders in Suid-Afrika wat die geletterdheidstoetse afgelê het, op ’n internasionaal aanvaarbare vlak presteer (WCED 2009). Kenners is van mening dat hierdie resultate daarop dui dat ons nie gehalte-onderwys in ons skole toepas nie (Bloch 2009). Volgens navorsers begin die probleem in die grondslagfase waar leerders nie die nodige vaardighede van geletterdheid baasraak nie (Jansen 2008; Yeld 2009). In hierdie artikel word gefokus op een van die moontlike oorsake vir die agteruitgang van geletterdheid in Suid-Afrika ten spyte van die Onderwysdepartement se talle pogings om die situasie te verbeter: die wyse waarop onderwysers 1 lees onderrig. Daar sal gevolglik gefokus word op onderwysers se metodiek in leesonderrig aangesien daar rede is om te glo dat die tradisionele manier van leesonderrig steeds in die meeste skole geld. Die artikel sal van die standpunt uitgaan dat onderwysers hul denke oor leesonderrig sal moet verander. ’n Raamwerk vir die onderrig van lees volgens die skema-teorie-model asook die rol van die onderwyser daarin word beskryf. Ditword gevolg deur ’n bespreking van die tradisionele manier van leesonderrig volgens die bottomup en top-down- benaderings. As alternatief vir die tradisionele bottom-up of top-down-benaderings word die interaktiewe benadering voorgestel, asook hoe dit onderrig en assesseer moet word. Die skrywer kom tot die slotsom dat met behulp van die interaktiewe model ons wel die prestasie van sukkelende lesers kan verbeter (Albright & Luke 2008). Recent literacy results show that only 15 % of all grade 3 learners and less than 10 % of all grade 6 learners performed at an appropriate level (WCED 2009). According to education specialists {{the results of these}} tests show that we do not practise quality teaching (Bloch 2009). Many researchers argue that the problem starts in the foundation phase where learners fail to acquire the basic skills in literacy (Jansen 2008; Yeld 2009). This article wil focus on one of the possible reasons for the deterioration of literacy in South Africa despite considerable efforts by die Education Department to rectify the situation. The didactics used by teachers when teaching reading will be investigated as we believe that this aspect {{is one of the main}} reasons for the poor literacy results. Focus will be placed on the methodologies used by teachers in most schools, as it is believed that they rely mainly on the traditional approach of teaching reading. The article will argue that teachers need to change the way they think about teaching reading. The methodologies of teaching reading and the role of the teacher in this process will be described in a framework according to the schema-model. This is followed by a discussion of the traditional way of teaching reading according to the bottom-up and the top-down approaches. As opposed to the traditional bottom-up or top-down approaches an interactive approach is recommended. The article also gives a framework of what learners should be taught and assessed on within the interactive model. Although individual teachers can inspire their students to great achievements, the needs of the nation’s huge number of poor readers call for systemic change. Low levels of adolescent literacy is not a problem that can be solved in isolation with some extra tutoring or <b>supplementary</b> <b>programmes</b> for those unable to read well – it will take a concerted nationwide policy and an execution thereof that reaches deep into districts and the instructional practices of teachers across the curriculum. Change must occur at the classroom level, as well as at the school, district and government levels. It is only through both a change in perspective – by looking for new ways to teach reading – and a change in practice – where all teachers regard themselves as reading teachers – that we will be able to make a sustained difference in the lives of struggling readers. The paper concludes therefore that with the interactive model we can improve the performance of most struggling readers (Albright & Luke 2008). Publishers' Versio...|$|E

40|$|The study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the challenges faced by NGOs in carrying out <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> in Zimbabwe’s rural areas. CARE and PLAN International in Zimbabwe were the two NGOs used as case studies and their operations in the Lower Gweru district of the Midlands Province Zimbabwe provided the empirical data for this study. This study was principally qualitative in nature as it sought to provide an in-depth analysis of the main challenges that NGOs face when carrying out <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> {{in the rural areas}} of Zimbabwe. For the purpose of collecting data the study relied on Focus Group Discussions, in-depth interviews with key informants and document study. The key informants included Country Directors, Programme and Field officers at both CARE and PLAN International who had intimate knowledge of some of the challenges that their <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> faced. Challenges that faced CARE and Plan International’s <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> were categorized into two themes, internal and external organizational challenges. Internally the study revealed that the NGOs were unable to retain critical personnel such as nutritionists and programme officers. It also emerged from the study that field officers were involved in the thefts of food meant for the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes.</b> The management of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> was made difficult by lack of adequate information about the target beneficiaries. Further the study noted that there were contestations {{when it came to the}} selection of the beneficiaries of the programme. It was also found that during the rainy season it was difficult to 8 avail food timeously to the beneficiaries of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes.</b> It emerged from the study that <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> were victims of political interference as the government and war veterans were suspicious that the programmes were being used to influence the voting behavior of the recipients. The global financial crisis also limited the capacity of the donors to continue availing substantial amounts of money for food procurement. As part of the broader strategy to increase the effectiveness of the NGOs in carrying <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programmes</b> this study recommended that NGOs should re-strategize on how they remunerate key personnel such as nutritionists. The NGOs through their mother body NANGO should constantly engage government so that there is a good working relationship supportive of poverty reduction through <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{widespread}} tools in the conservation of scavenger species is the provision of supplementary food. However, scientific studies on its effectiveness have been rarely conducted. Here, we present the first results of an experimental specific <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme</b> applied from hatching to 45 – 60  days, aimed at increasing the breeding success of an obligate brood reducer, the threatened bearded vulture. We tested its effectiveness in the Spanish Pyrenees, the locale {{of the most}} important population of this species in the European Union, in which a regressive trend in breeding parameters has been observed in recent years. We compared the breeding success in nests with supplementary food to non-supplemented control nests. Supplementary food did not significantly increase global breeding success (supplemented nests, 0. 793 [*]±[*] 0. 193 chicks per pair with eggs hatched vs non-supplemented nests, 0. 771 [*]±[*] 0. 185) or the individual breeding performance of the territories (supplemented period, 0. 712 [*]±[*] 0. 307 vs non-supplemented period, 0. 642 [*]±[*] 0. 311). The similar values obtained suggest that the specific <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme</b> applied during the chick-rearing period is apparently ineffective at increasing breeding success. The results suggest that, at least in the study area, factors that provoke breeding failure after hatching continue to operate independently of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>programme.</b> Although more research on this subject is required, these preliminary conclusions should be taken into account by managers in order to optimise the investment of economic resources and to better prioritise the future establishment of alternative conservation actions...|$|R
