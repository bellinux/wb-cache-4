The Factory and Workshop Act 1907 amended the law in respect of laundries by generally applying the provisions of 1901 to trade laundries while granting them choice of new exceptional periods, and by extending the provisions of the act (with certain powers to the Home Office by Orders laid before parliament to allow variations) to institution laundries carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to employment of women in flax scutch mills, thus bringing this employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of employment.|$|E

This <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> is an invaluable resource for epidemiological research. A comment on its efficiency is provided here by a comparison of the system with an independently ascertained series of breast cancers. Fifty verified breast cancer cases were identified during a study of a flagged cohort of British women taking hormone replacement therapy. At the time of analysis (May 1985), some 2. 5 years after diagnosis of the most recent case, twenty-eight of the 50 cases had not been notified to the investigators by the NHSCRs. Of these, fourteen had not been registered. Eight had been duly registered, but had not yet been recorded at the NHSCRs. Five of the remaining six cases {{were in the process of}} being notified. The implications of these findings for cancer researchers are discussed. The potential for omission and delay between the diagnosis of cancers in a flagged population and their notification to the investigators must be taken into account, if underestimation of the true level of cancer risk is to be avoided...|$|E

Material and method: After an exhaustive analysis of the available systems, it was decided to develop an own system, SISNOT (<b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of incidents without damage), which followed the characteristics recommended by the international organisms in relation to these systems in the health field. Results: 3249 notifications were made through SISNOT, between primary and specialized care, of which 48 % could have had high damage in case of reoccurrence of the incident. Conclusions: The implementation of SISNOT has been carried out in all hospitals and in primary care. The results obtained are unequal in each unit.

METHOD A descriptive and qualitative study, based on the collective subject discourse technique, was conducted in four healthcare centers of reference in Fortaleza, Cear√°, from March to July 2014. The sample comprised 21 subjects (11 index patients and 10 notified partners). RESULTS The index patients reported complicity, concern about the partner's health and revelation of diagnosis aiming to preserve the relationship. The partners showed antagonistic perceptions: tranquility-betrayal, fear of death, of incurability and the diagnosis, especially of HIV. The reasons for coming to a healthcare center were: fear of being sick, attenuation of guilt of infection transmission, need for diagnosis, early start of treatment. CONCLUSION Fear of losing trust, insecurities when dealing with a sexual infection and being responsible or co-responsible for the transmission were the predominant feelings.

40|$|The 2006 FIFA World Cup {{was held}} in 12 German cities between 9 June and 9 July 2006.

Enhanced surveillance, based on Germany's pre-existing <b>system</b> <b>of</b> mandatory <b>notifications</b> was conducted between 7 June and 11 July 2006 in the 12 World Cup cities by: accelerating frequency of electronic data transmission of case-definition based notifiable diseases from weekly to daily transmission, additional reporting of non-case definition-based infectious disease events, lay and expert press screening and intensifying communication between all stakeholders <b>of</b> the surveillance <b>system.</b> Median delay <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> data transmission from the community to the federal level was reduced from three days to one day.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study a novel {{surveillance}} system introduced in Mpumalanga Province, {{a rural area}} in the north-east of South Africa, {{in an attempt to}} address deficiences in the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> for infectious conditions that have the potential for causing outbreaks. METHODS: Hospital-based infection control nurses in all of Mpumalanga?s 32 public and private hospitals were trained to recognize, report, and respond to nine clinical syndromes that require immediate action. Sustainability of the system was assured through a schedule of regular training and networking, and by providing feedback to the nurses. The system was evaluated by formal review of hospital records, evidence of the effective containment of a cholera outbreak, and assessment of the speed and appropriateness of responses to other syndromes. FINDINGS: Rapid detection, reporting and response to six imported cholera cases resulted in effective containment, with only 19 proven secondary cholera cases, during the two-year review period. No secondary cases followed detection and prompt response to 14 patients with meningococcal disease. By {{the end of the first}} year of implementation, all facilities were providing weekly zero-reports on the nine syndromes before the designated time. Formal hospital record review for cases of acute flaccid paralysis endorsed the value of the system. CONCLUSION: The primary goal of an outbreak {{surveillance system}} is to ensure timely recognition of syndromes requiring an immediate response. Infection control nurses in Mpumalanga hospitals have excelled in timely weekly zero-reporting, participation at monthly training and feedback sessions, detection of priority clinical syndromes, and prompt appropriate response.

The EU Council called for 'the establishment of a multilateral <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and registration of geographical indications for wines and spirits and additional protection for other products. Comment: The outcome of the June 26 th EU Agricultural Council meeting on the reform of the CAP will place a number of constraints on the Commission's room for manoeuvre on agricultural issues at the Cancun WTO Ministerial. The partial nature of the decoupling which has occurred {{as a result of the}} June 26 th EU Council agreement means that in the coming years a higher level of EU agricultural aid will remain coupled to production and subject to WTO disciplines than the Commission initially hoped. This means that the EU will have less flexibility in agreeing to reductions in domestic support than the Commission expected. The reduction of the extent of modulation will reduce the financial leeway the EU has to pursue further sectoral reforms (particularly in the sugar sector) and this will harm its ability to reduce export refunds in a multilateral framework. Similarly the failure to cut cereal prices by 5 % will reduce the ability of the EU to accept cuts in allowed export-refund expenditures.

40|$|A Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN) report {{reviewing}} the {{debates in the}} WTO on geographical indications (GI) was released by the USDA FAS in August 2003. It notes that the EU, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Moldova, India, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Pakistan, Thailand, Nigeria, Mauritius and Kenya favour broadening the scope of GI protection, while the USA, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Argentina and Uruguay oppose any broadening. In particular, the EU wants to treat GIs 'strictly {{as a matter of}} trade, rather than as an intellectual property matter' (see also the previous news item). It notes that the EU is proposing: to have international recognition move beyond wines and spirits to include other food stuffs; an international registration system for GIs in which all WTO members would participate; the restriction of the use of such registered terms. EU proposals would permanently restrict the use of such terms to those who have registered the terms. This would give the EU 'worldwide exclusive rights to terms, which they believe, represent a valuable marketing premium'. The USA believes that the EU proposals go beyond the Doha mandate. The paper outlines the scope of GI protection that the EU is seeking, including the list of the top 30 products to be covered, which range from well known wines and spirits (Champagne, Chianti, Chablis, Cognac, Porto, Sherry etc) to special cheese and meat products (such as Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Grana Padano, Jambon de Bayonne, Prosciutto di San Danielle) The USA sees the EU position on GIs as a product of the political dynamic of CAP reform, with certain EU member states believing that broader international recognition of GIs will serve to insulate EU farmers from any adverse income consequences of CAP reform. The Commission therefore wants to secure international agreement on GIs as a means of placating concerns in EU member states over the income effects of CAP reform. The paper notes that many of the divergences of opinion hinge upon problems of implementation, with the USA believing that the EU proposals would be costly and extremely difficult to implement. It thus prefers a voluntary <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of GIs and the use of existing trade-mark law. The paper explains in detail how the EU's system of GI protection works and contrasts this with the US approach. The USA argues that the EU system does not allow for the registration of foreign GIs, which, it argues, violates the 'national treatment' and 'most favoured nation' obligations established under Articles I and III of the GATT and Articles 3 and 4 of TRIPS. Comment: The failure to reach any agreement in Cancun will mean that the EU will increasingly push for recognition of GIs through bilateral and regional trade negotiations. ACP countries can expect the EU to take a hard line on recognition of EU GIs in the on-going EPA negotiations. Securing ACP endorsement of the EU's approach to GIs through regional and bilateral negotiations would greatly strengthen the EU's position in the WTO when it once again raises this issue.

40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2009 This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Globalization of Science and InnovationGlobalization is a relevant issue for policymakers and firms alike. Although individuals, firms, and countries have always been connected in various ways throughout history, commentators generally claim that globalization has caused a once-unfathomable new height of connectedness {{at the dawn of the}} 21 st century. This is typically considered to be the outcome of the combined effects of regulatory, political, and market liberalization combined with technological change, especially in information and communication technologies (ICT). In short, globalization might be defined as "the high and increasing interdependency and interrelatedness among different and geographically dispersed actors" (Archibugi and Iammarino, 2002, p. 99; for a popularized discussion see also Friedman (2005)). The most visible trend of globalization, from the viewpoint of firms, has been foreign direct investment (FDI), in the form of the outsourcing and offshoring of manufacturing. However, the rapid change in the global division of manufacturing has perhaps overshadowed another phenomenon: the internationalization of research and development (R&D) (UNCTAD, 2005). Globalization of R&D means researchers and inventors increasingly tend to be located outside the home country of their companies. Despite this trajectory, Patel and Pravit present the non-globalization argument in a seminal paper (Patel and Pavitt 1991), suggesting that the actual inventive activities of multinational corporations (MNCs) tend to be significantly less globalised than the international distribution of R&D expenditures seems to indicate. Patel and Pavitt (1991) suggest that this may be because country-specific characteristics of national systems of innovation still matter for more strategic R&D activities; they highlight such issues as the importance of physical proximity and tacit knowledge, education, training, and basic research. Indeed, R&D internationalization is still today a much-debated subject. Several studies, which will be reviewed in later sections, have recently documented that a growing share of R&D of MNCs is off shored, but evidence is mixed and the "non-globalization" argument also finds support in other empirical analyses. My focus on the wireless telecommunications industry is particularly interesting and relevant to this debate for three reasons. First, this industry has benefited from trade liberalization, deregulation, and technological change, as governments around the world are developing and upgrading their ICT infrastructures (Zysman and Newman, 2006). Second, the industry has also changed its technological core due to the convergence of data- and telecommunications and the emergence of the Internet, thus providing multiple entry points for firms and inventors, including new geographical locations outside the US and Europe. Third, much of the extant research on the internationalization of R&D tends to treat R&D as a 'black box' where the specificities of different types of R&D are undisclosed. This is partly a consequence of the lack or inaccessibility of detailed data on the different types of R&D and inventive activity at the firm level. Due to the significance of standardization, a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of patents deemed essential to specific standards has been set up. This system provides an interesting analytical lens for identifying R&D and inventive activities that lie closest to the technological core of the industry in a strategic, and perhaps also commercial, sense. I will argue that entering into the discussion of patents and Intellectual Property (IP) is beneficial to an examination of the internationalization of R&D as it allows a closer look at the ways the management of intangibles can influence the exploitation of international R&D investment. This paper contributes to research providing a new interpretation for the homeboundedness of critical industrial R&D, and in general to the literature on appropriability and maturation of R&D off shoring. I was able to discuss the result of my quantitative empirical analysis directly with the managers involved in key decisions relating to the development of some of these technologies. Their viewpoint suggests the presence of what I have defined "Safe R&D nests". I will discuss that such "safeness" derives by a close coordination between scientific and technological research and management of intangible assets...|$|E

40|$|Title: (New) {{registration}} <b>system</b> <b>of</b> partner <b>notification</b> for {{sexually transmitted}} infections. Usable for nurses, doctors and index patients? Background: Since 1985, partner notification (PN) {{is an essential}} method in the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the Netherlands. It is the aim of PN to timely screen and treats STIs {{in order to prevent}} transmission. The RIVM and Erasmus MC developed a PN registration system for clients with HIV. This system to gain answers on the following five essential questions. These questions are: how many partners does the index patient have? How many partners need to be notified? Are the partners notified? Did they get a STI test and were they infected by the index patient? Aim: To determine whether the PN registration system is a usable instrument for clients with gonorrhea, syphilis and Chlamydia. Method: A descriptive quantitative longiditudinal cohort study in 26 professionals and 117 index patients from STI clinics of Municipal Health Services. Data were collected through a questionnaire, specifically developed for this study. Results: The response of the professionals was 58...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify whether {{pregnancy}} was a risk factor for death in influenza A (H 1 N 1) / 2009 infection. We compared the case-fatality rates for pandemic influenza among non-pregnant women of childbearing age and pregnant women, besides investigating other factors that differentiated the groups in relation to the outcomes. The data were collected from the National Information <b>System</b> on Diseases <b>of</b> <b>Notification</b> (SINAN), <b>of</b> the Ministry of Health. The study used cases with laboratory confirmation and included 1, 861 women from 10 to 49 years of age, of whom 352 were pregnant. The case-fatality rate during the 2009 pandemic was 4. 5 % for pregnant women and 6. 4 % for non-pregnant women (p = 0. 197). Logistic regression did not show an association between pregnancy and death (OR = 0. 7; 95 %CI: 0. 41 - 1. 21). However, there were significant differences between the two groups in relation to mean age, treatment with oseltamivir, schooling, and presence of other risk factors...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{dengue fever}} {{remains to be}} a disease of serious public health concern, and its {{incidence}} has increased in the past decades. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiological incidence of dengue in the period 2001 - 2010. METHODS: This is an epidemiological study of dengue in the municipality of Aracaju, state of Sergipe, in the period between 2001 and 2010, whose data {{were obtained from the}} Information <b>System</b> <b>of</b> Diseases <b>Notifications.</b> A descriptive analysis of the number of confirmed cases of dengue, according to year, semester, sanitary district, age, and sex, was performed. RESULTS: There were 16, 462 confirmed cases, especially in 2008, which obtained the highest incidence of the disease, with 10, 485 confirmed cases. The first semester obtained the highest registration of cases during the years of research; this was predominated by females between 15 and 49 years old. With regard to the territorial distribution, the second district of the municipality obtained the highest number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: In 2008, in the City of Aracaju, SE, {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of dengue cases compared with other years was verified. However, a fast decline in the other years was observed, possibly because of the intensification of preventive actions to combat the mosquito that transmits the dengue virus...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis in the City of Birmingham {{during the}} three-year period 1960 - 62 {{related to the}} population data from the Census of 1961 showed important differences between the <b>notification</b> rates <b>of</b> groups defined by their place of birth, and also differences in the age distributions <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> rates between these groups (Springett, 1964). A survey <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> throughout England and Wales during a three-month period in 1965 (British Tuberculosis Asso-ciation, 1966) showed similar differences on a national scale; the survey <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> throughout England and Wales was repeated during a four-month period {{around the time of}} the 1971 Census, and these results are being prepared for publication.

40|$|Following a {{high wind}} event on January 24, 2006, {{at least five}} people claimed to have seen or felt the {{superstructure}} of the Saylorville Reservoir Bridge in central Iowa moving both vertically and laterally. Since that time, the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) contracted with the Bridge Engineering Center at Iowa State University to design and install a monitoring <b>system</b> capable <b>of</b> providing <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the occurrence of subsequent high wind events. In subsequent years, a similar system was installed on the Red Rock Reservoir Bridge to provide the same wind monitoring capabilities and notifications to the Iowa DOT. The objectives <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> development and implementation are to notify personnel when the wind speed reaches a predetermined threshold such that the bridge can be closed {{for the safety of}} the public, correlate structural response with wind-induced response, and gather historical wind data at these structures for future assessments. This report describes the two monitoring systems, their components, upgrades, functionality, and limitations, and results from one year of wind data collection at both bridges...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> syphilis {{in pregnancy}} and congenital syphilis in Amazo- nas State, Brazil, from 2007 to 2009 and verifies underreporting in databases in the National Information <b>System</b> on Diseases <b>of</b> <b>Notification</b> (SINAN) and {{the occurrence of}} perinatal deaths associated with congenital syphilis and not reported in the Mortality Information System (SIM). This was a cross-sectional study with probabilistic record linkage between the SINAN and SIM. There were 666 reports of syphilis in pregnant women, including 224 in 2007 (3. 8 / 1, 000), 244 (4. 5 / 1, 000) in 2008, and 198 (4. 0 / 1, 000) in 2009. The study found 486 cases of congenital syphilis, of which 153 in 2007 (2. 1 / 1, 000), 193 in 2008 (2. 6 / 1, 000), and 140 in 2009 (2. 0 / 1, 000). After linkage of the SINAN databases, 237 pregnant women (35. 6 %) had cases of congenital syphilis reported. The SIM recorded 4, 905 perinatal deaths, of which 57. 8 % were stillbirths. Probabilistic record linkage between SIM and SINAN-Congenital Syphilis yielded 13 matched records. The use of SINAN and SIM may not reflect the total magnitude of syphilis, but {{provide the basis for}} monitoring and analyzing this health problem, with a view towards planning and management...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users‚Äô acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home‚Äîif people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
