5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|The Percheron is a {{breed of}} draft horse that {{originated}} in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed {{were present in the}} valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{recession}} of 1969-1970 greatly affected Boeing. For {{the year and}} a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years. When economic problems in the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijet wide bodies (and later the 767 and A300/A310 twinjets). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft; Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years. Later, Delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines, although it intends to retire them from service by 2018.|$|E
