40|$|Wireless {{sensor network}} is {{becoming}} an attractive application for monitoring systems such as energy conservation systems of buildings and houses, traffic management systems, environment monitoring systems etc. One of the critical issues of the wireless sensor network {{is the way to}} supply electric power for sensor terminals. Primary batteris need to be changed soon or later even though power consumption of the sensor terminals is quite small. Natural energy utilization like solar cells with a charging system will drive the <b>sensor</b> <b>terminal</b> permanently; however their installation location and regular operation are limited because the natural energy is quite unstable. We therefore suggest wireless power supply to the sensor terminals by microwave power transmission (MPT), in order to realize a fruitful wireless sensor network. The objective of the present study is to drive or charge a wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>terminal</b> by MPT. We adopt a ZigBee device as wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>terminal</b> because of its low power consumption. ZigBee is one of the radio communication standards and appropriate for the sensor network for the following reasons: its power consumption is lower than wireless LAN and Bluetooth, its production cost is low, and its network capacity is large. Its low power consumption is beneficial for a MPT system from the viewpoint of electromagnetic compatibility between MPT and ZigBee. We experimentally investigated electromagneti...|$|E

30|$|Piezoresistive SU- 8 {{cantilever}} sensors with Au immobilization layer depict {{better performance}} metrics (electrical sensitivity and specificity) compared to sensors with SU- 8 as the immobilization surface. However, incorporating Au immobilization layer in the cantilever stack increases the net TCE {{difference in the}} multilayer structure, thereby enhancing TCE-induced thermal drift in the <b>sensor</b> <b>terminal</b> characteristics. TCE-induced cantilever deflection becomes a serious problem, especially when metal piezoresistors and bias voltage more than 1  V are used. The aforementioned factors combined with low thermal conductivity of SU- 8 polymers result in sensor failure due to plastic deformation of cantilever structure. Possible solutions to overcome thermal drift include direct immobilization of SU- 8 surface, lower bias voltage, and complete polymeric cantilevers. However, for maintaining high degree of specificity and sensitivity, thickness and coverage of Au immobilization layer can be carefully optimized to minimize TCE-induced deflection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To achieve {{efficient}} presence sensing within {{home network}} system (HNS), an inexpensive and elastic {{system that can}} be shared by various HNS applications is required. This paper presents Presence Sensor Service Framework, which can uniformly manage presence information in various places using various types of sensors. The framework consists of Presence Sensor Device (PSD), Presence <b>Sensor</b> <b>Terminal</b> (PST) and Presence Sensor Aggregator (PSA). A PST monitors PSDs to detect any changes of presence, and notifies a PSA of the changes. Upon the notifications from PSTs, the PSA estimates human presence around each PSD. The estimation process is deployed as Presence Sensor Service (PSS), which is used by various HNS applications. The proposed framework can dynamically add or change sensing places within a HNS by adding PST and PSD as needed. It can also integrate presences in multiple HNSs by deploying PSA on an external cloud. In this paper, we implement a prototype of the proposed framework by using Phidgets sensors and Java Web service. Moreover, we develop a presence visualization application to conduct a preliminary evaluation.

40|$|Over the years, piezoresistive nano {{cantilever}} sensors {{have been}} extensively investigated for various biological sensing applications. Piezoresistive cantilever sensor {{is a composite}} structure with different materials constituting its various layers. Design and modeling of such sensors become challenging since their response is governed by the interplay between their geometrical and constituent material parameters. Even though, piezoresistive nano cantilever biosensors have several advantages, they suffer from a limitation {{in the form of}} self-heating induced inaccuracy which is seldom considered in design stages. Although, a few simplified mathematical models have been reported which incorporate the self-heating effect, several assumptions made in the modeling stages result in inaccuracy in predicting <b>sensor</b> <b>terminal</b> response. In this paper, we model and investigate the effect of self-heating on the thermo-electro-mechanical response of piezoresistive cantilever sensors {{as a function of the}} relative geometries of the piezoresistor and the cantilever platform. Finite element method (FEM) based numerical computations are used to model the target-receptor interactions induced surface stress response in steady state and maximize the electrical sensitivity to thermal sensitivity ratio of the sensor. Simulation results show that the conduction mode of heat transfer is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the isolation and immobilization layers play a critical role in determining the thermal sensitivity of the sensor. It is found that the shorter and wider cantilever platforms are more suitable to reduce self-heating induced inaccuracies. In addition, results depict that the piezoresistor width plays a more dominant role in determining the thermal drift induced inaccuracies compared to the piezoresistor length. It is found that for surface stress sensors at large piezoresistor width, the electrical sensitivity to thermal sensitivity ratio improves...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the beginning, the {{classical}} one-dimensional analysis of piezoelectric active sensors is reviewed. The complete derivation for a free-free sensor is then extended {{to cover the}} cases of clamped and elastically constrained sensors. An analytical model based on structural vibration theory and theory of piezoelectricity was developed and used to predict the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance response, {{as it would be}} measured at the piezoelectric active <b>sensor’s</b> <b>terminals.</b> The model considers one-dimensional structures and accounts for both axial and flexural vibrations. The numerical analysis was performed and supported by experimental results. Experiments were conducted on simple beam specimens to support of the theoretical investigation, and on thin gauge aluminum plates to illustrate the method’s potential. It was shown that E/M impedance spectrum recorded by the piezoelectric active sensor accurately represents the mechanical response of a structure. It was further proved that the response of the structure is not modified by the presence of the sensor, thus validating the sensor’s non-invasive characteristics. The sensor calibration procedure is outlined and statistical analysis was presented. It was found that PZT active sensors have stable and repeatable characteristics not only in as-received condition, but also while mounted on 1 -D or 2 -D host structure. It is shown that such sensors, of negligible mass, can be permanently applied to the structure creating a non-intrusive sensor array adequate for on-line automatic structural identification and health monitoring...|$|R
