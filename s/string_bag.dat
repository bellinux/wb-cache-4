6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} she was gone, to walk the {{two and a half}} miles to Keston Station. All the things she was taking him she had in her bulging <b>string</b> <b>bag.</b> Paul watched her go up the road between the hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her, that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she, {{tripping}} so quickly in her anxiety, felt {{at the back of her}} her son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden he could, even supporting her. And when she was at the hospital, she thought: [...] "It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is. I'd better be careful." [...] And when she was trudging home again, she felt he was coming to share her burden.|$|E
60|$|On Tuesday morning came a {{telegram}} from London {{that he was}} ill. Mrs. Morel got off her knees from washing the floor, read the telegram, called a neighbour, went to her landlady and borrowed a sovereign, put on her things, and set off. She hurried to Keston, caught an express for London in Nottingham. She had to wait in Nottingham nearly an hour. A small figure in her black bonnet, she was anxiously asking the porters if {{they knew how to}} get to Elmers End. The journey was three hours. She sat in her corner in a kind of stupor, never moving. At King's Cross still no one could tell her how to get to Elmers End. Carrying her <b>string</b> <b>bag,</b> that contained her nightdress, a comb and brush, she went from person to person. At last they sent her underground to Cannon Street.|$|E
60|$|For some {{minutes they}} had the shop almost to themselves, as far as {{customers}} were concerned, but while they were debating the respective virtues and blemishes of two competing brands of anchovy paste they were startled by an order, given across the counter, for six pomegranates and a packet of quail seed. Neither commodity was in general demand in that neighbourhood. Equally unusual was the style and appearance of the customer; about sixteen years old, with dark olive skin, large dusky eyes, and thick, low-growing, blue-black hair, he might have made his living as an artist’s model. As {{a matter of fact}} he did. The bowl of beaten brass that he produced for the reception of his purchases was distinctly the most astonishing variation on the <b>string</b> <b>bag</b> or marketing basket of suburban civilisation that his fellow-shoppers had ever seen. He threw a gold piece, apparently of some exotic currency, across the counter, and did not seem disposed to wait for any change that might be forthcoming.|$|E

50|$|In Czechoslovakia, the {{production}} of <b>string</b> <b>bags</b> dates back to 1920s {{to the town of}} Žďár nad Sázavou/Saar in former Czechoslovakia, present day Czech Republic, when a salesman Vavřín Krčil, representing Jaro J. Rousek company, began to produce <b>string</b> <b>bags</b> under the trademark Saarense (EKV) at the local chateau Ždár. They formerly made hair nets, which had become obsolete due to shorter hairstyles coming into fashion. This led to years of prosperity for the company. The hand made shopping bags were made of artificial silk yarn, woven by women working at home (this was often their second job) or by using child labour, the finished bags were then given to Vavřín Krčil. The bags quickly became very popular due to their low price, light weight, and compactness. Krčil soon extended the range of designs, including bags to be carried at the elbow or on the shoulder, and bags for sporting equipment. In the late 1920s <b>string</b> <b>bags</b> were being produced in Switzerland and Italy, and were distributed around the world. Krčil himself exported the bags to Canada, France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria and North African countries.|$|R

5000|$|<b>String</b> <b>bags</b> {{were popular}} in Russia and other former USSR republics {{where they were}} called avoska (авоська), which may be {{translated}} as perhaps-bag. The avoska was a major cultural phenomenon of Soviet daily life. They were manufactured using various kinds of strings. With the advent of synthetic materials, {{some of them were}} made of stretchable string, so that a very small net could be stretched to a very large sack. With the popularization of plastic bags (which had the same important trait of convenient foldability) avoskas gradually went into disuse, but recent political trends banning plastic bags may bring it back.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Karl Hurm {{increasingly}} integrated {{objects of}} everyday life into his paintings, in order to add a third dimension. Fragments of panty hoses, shoelaces, brush bristles, chain links, wire mesh, <b>string</b> <b>bags,</b> twigs and beechnuts were pasted into compositions in the collage technique. Chewing gum, pressed flat into moulds as bas-reliefs, slightly raise figures above the surface to produce sculptural effects. During that same period, Karl Hurm also experimented with different surfaces like old furnace doors, iron plates, metal sheets, or pieces of wood as base materials {{in order to create}} paintings that seem to have originated in distant prehistoric times. The specific fabrics and structures were interpreted and accentuated by the colours.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} relationships between language, geography and material culture in the upper Sepik region of New Guinea. We used Mantel tests and principal coordinate analysis to assess and compare the associations between arrow and <b>string</b> <b>bag</b> crafts and language and geographical distance. The Mantel tests resulted in a significant association between each class' craft variability and both geographical distance and language, however, after statistical control was applied to either {{of the independent variables}} only a significant association with geographical distance remained. We argue that these results indicate craft techniques were readily disseminated and that craft distributions are unlikely to reflect any deeper historical relationships between groups. The spatial autocorrelation of arrow crafts was particularly great. A comparison of the principal coordinate analysis plots indicates a greater degree of diffusion and synthesis had taken place between lowland and highland arrow craft traditions. We conclude that the more intensive learning regimes needed to master <b>string</b> <b>bag</b> craft techniques, as well as a greater degree of interdependence between <b>string</b> <b>bag</b> components, had ensured more abrupt differences between bag types resulting in a more moderate degree of spatial autocorrelation.
