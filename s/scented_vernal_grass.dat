30|$|The grass populations sampled, for {{all species}} except Harding grass, were spread {{throughout}} a 150 m × 150 m area; the Harding grass population {{was less than}} 1 km away. Species were sampled {{in the same order}} on each date to maximize efficiency and maintain consistency. To evaluate the effect that time of collection had on fuel moisture values, we sampled from a subset of four species every two hours over an eight-hour period, on a single day on 10 October 2012. Two native species, California fescue and blue wildrye, and two non-native species, Harding <b>grass</b> and sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass,</b> were sampled. We sampled these species at two-hour intervals between 0900 hr and 1700 hr. Due to the small amount of Harding grass remaining at our study site, only two to three samples of this species were collected at each interval. The number of samples collected for the other species depended upon the abundance of easily accessible material; three samples were collected for blue wildrye, four for California fescue, and five for sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass.</b> Throughout the eight-hour sampling period, the air temperature ranged from 12.8 °C to 16.7 °C, relative humidity ranged from 62 % to 80 %, and wind speeds ranged from 3.2 km h− 1 to 9.7 km h− 1.|$|R

30|$|In many ecosystems, {{non-native}} grass {{species have}} been implicated in altering fire regimes, particularly where they invade areas with no native analogues (Brooks 1999, D’Antonio 2000, Brooks et al. 2004, Brooks 2008). In the Bald Hills, potential effects on the fire regime are complex, depending {{to a large extent}} on {{the degree to which the}} composition of the fuelbed has shifted with species invasions. Of the four non-native species that we studied, one of these, Harding grass, sustained high moisture content throughout the growing season and may act to delay ignition and dampen fire spread and intensity. In contrast, the non-native annual dogtail might decrease fuel moisture levels and increase their ignitability earlier in the fire season compared to most native perennial species. Two of the non-native species that we studied, sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> and tall oatgrass, did not differ from the native species’ moisture contents.|$|R
30|$|By {{the early}} 1990 s, tall oatgrass (Arrhenatherum elatius [L.] J. Presl & C. Presl), sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> (Anthoxanthum odoratum L.), and dogtail (Cynosurus echinatus L.), {{were among the}} most {{dominant}} non-native species in the grasslands of the Bald Hills (Saenz 1983, Grenier 1989, Arguello 1994). Harding grass (Phalaris aquatica L.) was first detected in the park at this time, and quickly spread throughout the grasslands. Due to its tendency to form dense monocultures, Harding grass is currently the most problematic non-native grass in the park (S. Samuels, National Park Service, Orick, California, USA, personal communication). A prescribed fire program was initiated in the early 1990 s to control invasion of the native conifer Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb] Franco var. menziesii) and to maintain native herbaceous species richness (Underwood et al. 2003). The fire season for the area spans early summer to late fall; prescribed fires typically occur between September and early November each year.|$|R
30|$|The {{non-native}} dogtail {{had significantly}} lower mean moisture content {{than all other}} species except sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> and California oatgrass (Tukey HSD P < 0.05). On 6 August, the mean moisture content of dogtail and California oatgrass were 21 % and 42 %, respectively. They were the only species to fall below an ignition threshold at this date, assuming a conservative moisture of extinction value of 55 % (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010). Mean moisture content of all other species ranged from 57 % to 182 % in August. By the next sampling date, 5 September, the mean moisture content for all other species except Harding grass and California fescue ranged from 6 % to 29 % (Figure 3) and fell below a probable threshold for moisture of extinction. On this date, the mean moisture content of California fescue was 59 %, while the moisture content of Harding grass remained much higher {{with a mean of}} 117 %.|$|R
30|$|The only annual {{species that}} we studied, the {{non-native}} dogtail, had significantly lower moisture content {{than all other}} study species across all dates except for the non-native sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> and the native California oatgrass, which also had relatively low moisture content. These three grasses are relatively small-statured (Figure 2). Dogtail reached its maximum height early and flowered quickly, fitting with its sharp decline in moisture content early in the growing season. After this species senesced (at approximately the end of July), samples of this species contained primarily dead material. California oatgrass is unique among the study species because, when its seeds are mature, the dried culms detach from the still-green basal leaves and fall on the ground. This occurred between the 6 August and 5 September sampling dates, when the moisture content for this species decreased sharply (Figure 3). For the remainder of sampling dates, both basal leaves and detached culms were included in samples. With the exception of Harding grass, the moisture content of the four larger perennials (Figure 2; the native California brome, blue wildrye, California fescue, and the non-native tall oatgrass) {{did not differ significantly}} from each other.|$|R
40|$|An {{ecological}} monitoring {{was carried out}} {{to find out how}} the vegetation succeeded on permanent set-aside fields over 18 and 21 years, respectively. Furthermore, the vegetation of field margins under permanent monitoring was surveyed over 10 and 12 years, respectively. The surveys took place on diluvial sites in the federal states Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg. Plant diversity depends on the site, landscape and period of set-aside. Even after an extended period of setaside a few rare arable weeds like Anthoxanthum aristatum (annual <b>vernal</b> <b>grass)</b> and Consolida regalis (field larkspur) were found. A poor sandy site has been colonized by an interesting flora including plants typical of sandy dry meadow. Field margins adjacent to fields or permanent fallows partly showed considerable plant diversity. It depends on the site, landscape and management of adjacent fields and includes the sporadic but also permanent occurrence of arable weeds like Consolida regalis, Veronica triphyllos (fingered speedwell) or Camelina microcarpa (little-pod false flax). The long-term vegetative monitoring shows that permanent set-aside fields may produce remarkable plant diversity. However, 20 -years set-aside with self-greening supports the maintenance of rare arable weeds to a very limited extent only. Field margins could be used as refuge for arable weeds...|$|R
40|$|The genus Anthoxanthum (sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass,</b> Poaceae) {{represents}} a taxonomically intri-cate polyploid complex with large phenotypic variation and its evolutionary relationships still poorly resolved. In {{order to get}} insight into the geographic distribution of ploidy levels and assess the taxonomic value of genome size data, we determined C- and Cx-values in 628 plants representing all currently recognized European species collected from 197 popula-tions in 29 European countries. The flow cytometric estimates were supplemented by con-ventional chromosome counts. In addition to diploids, we found two low (rare 3 x and common 4 x) and one high (~ 16 x– 18 x) polyploid levels. Mean holoploid genome sizes ranged from 5. 52 pg in diploid A. alpinum to 44. 75 pg in highly polyploid A. amarum, while the size of monoploid genomes ranged from 2. 75 pg in tetraploid A. alpinum to 9. 19 pg in diploid A. gracile. In contrast to Central and Northern Europe, which harboured only limited cytological variation, a much more complex pattern of genome sizes was revealed in the Mediterranean, particularly in Corsica.

40|$|Objective: We {{conducted}} a large observational study in 193 {{children and adolescents}} with allergic rhinitis due to grass or tree pollens to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an ultrarush high-dose sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) regimen reaching a maintenance dose of 300 index of reactivity within 90 minutes. Methods: Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years {{with at least a}} 1 -year medical history of allergic rhinitis with or without mild to moderate asthma due to tree pollens (birch, alder, hazel) or grass pollens (cocksfoot, meadow grass, rye <b>grass,</b> sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass,</b> timothy) were recruited. Standardized grass and tree pollen allergen extracts were used for ultrarush titration and subsequent coseasonal maintenance. Results: During ultrarush titration, 60 patients (31 %) reported 117 predominantly mild and local adverse events, which resolved within 150 minutes. During the maintenance phase, 562 adverse events were reported; the most frequent local events were oral pruritus, burning sensation, lip or tongue swelling, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and the most frequent systemic events were rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. There was 1 clinically signifi cant asthma event in an 11 -year old boy with known asthma in whom SLIT was resumed after an interval of 4 days.

30|$|The {{relative}} {{dominance of}} non-native species in a fuelbed {{will have a}} significant impact on the overall contribution of the species on the fire regime. A survey of understory vegetation in the oak woodlands of the Bald Hills found that the mean cover of dogtail was 9 % (Livingston 2014). Comparatively, mean cover for tall oatgrass, sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass,</b> California brome, blue wildrye, and California fescue in oak woodland understories ranged from only 1 % to 4 %. California oatgrass occurred in woodland understory sampling rarely, and Harding grass was not detected in this survey (Livingston 2014). California oatgrass is one of the more common native grass species in the prairies of the Bald Hills, however, and Harding grass has primarily invaded prairies. Although its overall cover was low in the oak woodland understory survey, California fescue is dominant in several areas of the Bald Hills (Engber et al. 2011), and where it does occur, its cover is generally very high. The non-native species that we studied commonly invade other grasslands and woodlands ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (Dennehy et al. 2011, Stanley et al. 2011) and elsewhere (Hitchcock 1971), making the results of this study relevant at broader geographic scales.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{divergent}} selection can drive genome-wide population differentiation remains unclear. Theory predicts that {{in the face of}} ongoing gene flow, population differentiation should be apparent only at those markers that are directly or indirectly (i. e. through linkage) under selection. However, if reproductive barriers limit gene flow, genome-wide population differentiation may occur even in geographically proximate populations. Some insight into the link between selection and genetic differentiation in the presence of ongoing gene flow can come from long-term experiments such as The Park Grass Experiment, which has been running for over 150 years, and provides a unique example of a heterogeneous environment with a long and detailed history. Fertilizer treatments applied in the Park Grass Experiment have led to rapid evolutionary change in sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> Anthoxanthum odoratum, but until now, nothing was known of how these changes would be reflected in neutral molecular markers. We have genotyped ten A. odoratum populations from the Park Grass Experiment using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Our data show that nutrient additions have resulted in genome-wide divergence among plots despite the high potential for ongoing gene flow. This provides a well-documented example of concordance between genomes and environmental conditions that has arisen in continuous populations across a time span of fewer than 75 generations...|$|R
40|$|In {{early work}} on {{coumarin}} in sweetclover, the assumption {{was made that}} the free form of the compound predominated in the intact plant. Subsequent investigations demonstrated the presence of bound coumarin in addition to free, {{and it was then}} thought that both forms were normally present. Recent work indicates that when suitable extraction procedures are used, virtually all the coumarin is obtained in the bound form. Such extraction procedures must provide for the rapid inactivation of β-glucosidase, thus preventing the hydrolysis of bound coumarin (apparently the glucoside of cis-o-hydroxycinnamic acid) during the extraction process. In the present study, inactivation of β-glucosidase was achieved by submersion of the plant tissue in boiling water. When this step was incorporated into the extraction procedure, leaf samples of 4 homozygous genotypes (cucubb, cucuBB, CuCubb, and CuCuBB) and 9 coumarin-containing varieties of sweetclover, and of sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> and sweet grass were found to be essentially devoid of free coumarin. In general, any treatment that caused disruption of cellular or tissue organization prior to inactivation of β-glucosidase resulted in conversion of bound coumarin to the free form. Therefore, care in handling the plant tissue is essential. Implications of the apparent absence of free coumarin in the intact sweetclover plant are discussed with respect to the possible roles of the B/b alleles and β-glucosidase in coumarin biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|The spatial genetic {{structure}} of plant populations {{is determined by}} a combination of gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Gene flow in most plants can result from either seed or pollen dispersal, but detailed investigations of pollen and seed flow among populations that have diverged following local adaptation are lacking. In this study, we compared pollen and seed flow among 10 populations of sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> (Anthoxanthum odoratum) on the Park Grass Experiment. Overall, estimates of genetic differentiation that were based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and, which therefore resulted primarily from seed flow, were lower (average F ST = 0. 058) than previously published estimates that were based on nuclear DNA (average F ST = 0. 095). Unlike nuclear DNA, cpDNA showed no pattern of isolation by adaptation; cpDNA differentiation was, however, inversely correlated with the number of additions (nutrients and lime) that each plot had received. We suggest that natural selection is restricting pollen flow among plots, whereas nutrient additions are increasing seed flow and genetic diversity by facilitating the successful germination and growth of immigrant seeds. This study highlights the importance of considering all potential gene flow mechanisms when investigating determinants of spatial genetic structure, and cautions against the widespread assumption that pollen flow is more important than seed flow for population connectivity in wind-pollinated species...|$|R
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the biology of Anthoxanthum odoratum have been studied in this thesis. The results are based on {{evidence}} obtained from the literature and on findings from experiments {{carried out by the}} candidate. This thesis has been arranged to give a balanced picture of the biology of sweet <b>vernal</b> <b>grass</b> without over-emphasis on the experiments carried out as it was felt that this would disjoint the lay-out. The main experiments are contained in Chapters 2, 5, 6 and 7. Since A. odoratum is a very polymorphic grass, plants have been collected from five localities in New Zealand (Kaikohe, Te Awa, Lincoln, Gore, and Porter's Pass) to reduce bias in the experimental results. Although this grass has been in New Zealand for about one hundred years only, physiological and morphological differences were found to occur among the plants from these localities. These findings may reduce the significance of the results obtained with A. odoratum as an indicator plant for nutrient availability in different soils. Therefore, it has been recommended in Chapter 6 to use only those A. odoratum plants with known-fertility response pattern for nutrient availability studies. In Chapter 10, the importance of this ecotypic differentiation, its evolutionary significance and its use for plant breeders has been discussed. Only incipient ecotypy could be recognized and no new taxa have been described...|$|R
