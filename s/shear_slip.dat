In the Cascadia, the return period for SSEs is approximately 14.5 months, but varies along {{the margin of the}} subduction zone. In the Shikoku region in southwest Japan, the interval is shorter at approximately 6 months, as determined by crustal tilt changes.

50|$|Low {{frequency}} earthquakes (LFEs) are seismic events {{defined by}} waveforms with periods {{far greater than}} those of ordinary earthquakes and abundantly occur during slow earthquakes. LFEs can be volcanic, semi-volcanic, or tectonic in origin, but only tectonic LFEs or LFEs generated during slow earthquakes are described here. Tectonic LFEs are characterized by generally low magnitudes (M<3) and have frequencies peaked between 1 and 3 Hz. They are the largest constituent of non-volcanic tremor at subduction zones, {{and in some cases}} are the only constituent. In contrast to ordinary earthquakes, tectonic LFEs occur largely during long-lived slip events at subduction interfaces (up to several weeks in some cases) called slow slip events (SSEs). The mechanism responsible for their generation at subduction zones is thrust-sense slip along transitional segments of the plate interface. LFEs are highly sensitive seismic events which can likely be triggered by tidal forces as well as propagating waves from distant earthquakes. LFEs have hypocenters located down-dip from the seismogenic zone, the source region of megathrust earthquakes. During SSEs, LFE foci migrate along strike at the subduction interface in concert with the primary <b>shear</b> <b>slip</b> front.|$|E

Although the rate- and state-dependent friction law can account for the propagation of a slow slip without fluid (Liu and Rice 2005), it would be natural that slow slips are associated with fluid, as suggested by the existence of fluid on the plate interface (Kato et al. 2010; Kodaira et al. 2004; Shelly et al. 2006) where tremors and slow slip events are observed.|$|R

Thermal expansion and dilatation of oil sand formation causes horizontal and vertical displacements in the overburden.

In order to explain this observation, the 3 D dynamic rupture process of the 2000 Tottori (Japan) earthquake was simulated. The attractive feature of the problem under consideration {{is the possibility of}} introducing internal new cracks that propagate under tensile stress {{as a consequence of the}} dynamic process of <b>shear</b> <b>slip</b> propagation. The discrete element method was used to solve this problem because it can introduce internal tensile cracks. For the shear rupture propagation the simple slip-weakening model was used as a friction law on the fault. The new tensile cracks occur, following the classical Griffith theory, when the critical value of tensile fracture surface energy has been reached. The first step to solve the problem was the estimation of the dynamic parameters, such as stress drop, strength excess, and critical slip, which were recov-ered from the results of waveform inversion. In the second step, a shear dynamic rupture process was simulated assuming that <b>shear</b> <b>slip</b> occurs only on the pre-existing fault, and the tensile stress concentration resulting from <b>shear</b> <b>slip</b> causes the new cracks that propagate away from the pre-existing fault.

In the absence of thermal fluctuations, the expected shear thinning viscosity is observed in steady shear, and a striped phase is seen to rapidly form in a uniaxial field, with a <b>shear</b> <b>slip</b> zone in each sheet. However, as the influence of Brownian motion increases, the fluid stress decreases, especially at lower Mason numbers, and the striped phase eventually disappears, even when the fluid stress is still high.

However, the mechanisms of unloading-induced coal strength reduction are still poorly understood. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of confining pressure unloading on soft coal strength reduction for borehole stability analysis. A series of mechanical tests were conducted on both the traditionally and newly reconstituted coal samples under two different experimental stress paths, including conventional uniaxial/triaxial compression and triaxial compression with confining pressure unloading. The unloading stress path was obtained by analyzing the stress redistribution around a borehole, to capture a more accurate coal mechanical response. According to our experimental results, plastic deformation generated before failure under the unloading stress path is smaller than that generated under the conventional loading stress path. Furthermore, the cohesion of the traditionally and newly reconstituted samples diminishes approximately by 44. 77 and 29. 66 %, respectively, with confining pressure unloading, indicating that there is a significant reduction in coal strength due to confining pressure unloading. The mechanism for unloading-induced coal strength reduction comes from confining pressure unloading-induced increase in shear stress on the fracture surface and a decrease in shear strength.
