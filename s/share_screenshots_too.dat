The Xbox One {{version of the}} service was started in February 2017 for the Xbox Games Store, and covers only Neo Geo games.

30|$|Therefore, {{we propose}} {{a tool that}} allows the {{participants}} to share their projects many times during a workshop and aim {{to increase the number}} of opportunities not only to share but also to reflect. We think that posting project-in-progress enables children not only to understand their own project process after completing the project but also to gain some ideas from other children’s posts. Some research proposed systems to share project-in-progress in programming education for elementary school students. In Jots, the users <b>share</b> <b>screenshots</b> of Scratch screen and comments on the shared screen (Rosenbaum 2009). By doing so, it has been reported that there were various advantages such as recognising the usefulness of mistakes and comparing the learning process with others. However, <b>sharing</b> <b>screenshots</b> provides only the appearance of the program but not how the program works. There is also a research which proposed a system to create project progress documents of a workshop for children and share the data on the web (Katterfeldt and Schelhowe 2014). In this research, however, it was found that documenting the project progress is not suitable for reflection as it requires children additional efforts. Tools need to be user-friendly so that the children can easily post and browse as those actions occur many times during a workshop. Therefore, we intend to solve these issues by building a SNS site as its users are not required complicated operation to share, can easily view own posts, and can write comments on others’ posts.|$|R
50|$|Patari was {{launched}} in February 2015 in beta version {{with a collection of}} 20,000 songs and 600 artists and was accessible only through invites and later by registration, which led to an increase in access across Pakistan.“We honestly just kept our heads down and kept working on it. Just another {{day in the life of}} a start-up we thought, and the next thing we knew, it was everywhere. People were <b>sharing</b> <b>screenshots,</b> making memes, trading tips on how to get invites and reaching out to us to tell us how much they love Pakistani music and Patari.” said Khalid Bajwa. Patari was opened for public on September 4, 2015.|$|R

5000|$|The webcomic {{was taken}} offline in 2014 {{and is no}} longer available. As Pictures for Sad Children was taken offline, Kickstarter backer Jacob Weiss {{suggested}} that he would send his copy of the book to anyone who was not able to read it, as he had already finished reading it himself. Within a week, there were over 100 people asking for the book, and Weiss decided to send it to one of them along with $15 so that they could send it to someone else. Along with this process of sending the book to different interested parties came offers from other people who were also interested in sending books around or uploading PDF versions. Some users <b>shared</b> <b>screenshots</b> of Campbell's blog, audio interviews Campbell had done, and so on. Meanwhile, Campbell had expressed a desire for a diminished internet presence and did not want their work to be publicly hosted or reposted, turning Weiss' [...] "Book Club" [...] into a more private gathering. Weiss wanted to take the Google Drive with all the Pictures for Sad Children content down in late 2014, but felt unable to do so at the time.|$|R
5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could <b>share</b> <b>screenshots</b> on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{social media}} users {{frequently}} quote, recontextualize, or remix dril tweets {{for their own}} satirical purposes, and some accounts are even exclusively dedicated to this purpose. One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, <b>shares</b> <b>screenshots</b> of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice. Another, [...] "wint MP" [...] or @parliawint, attaches dril tweets styled like teletext closed captions to images from BBC News of British politicians and journalists speaking. Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: [...] "there are people who get the in-jokey references; there's a broader level of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond {{that there are people}} who just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous. It's an onion of silliness." [...] Koshy commented that wint MP [...] "stands out from traditional forms of satire because it has no normative force. It recommends nothing about the way things should be. The political field it presents is slack-jawed, demented, putrid and amoral – there is no value beyond the scope of its image." [...] According to Shaw, the absurd political atmosphere of the mid to late 2010s made it [...] "the Age of Dril": ...|$|R
