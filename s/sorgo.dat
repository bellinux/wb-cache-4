40|$|Obtaining higher sugar yield is a {{major focus}} of {{sugarcane}} variety improvement programs, however the complex genome of sugarcane has hindered research and development of the crop. Sorghum and sugarcane are both members of the Andropogoneae tribe and comparative mapping has revealed a high level of synteny among the two closely related species. Sorghum is a diploid species with a small genome unlike sugarcane which {{has one of the most}} complex genomes of any organism. Particular varieties of sorghum, known as sweet sorghums or <b>sorgos,</b> accumulate high levels of sugar in stalk juice near the time of maturity, as does sugarcane. Based on this relationship between sorghum and sugarcane, this study aimed to investigate sweet sorghum as a genetic and physiological model for sugar accumulation in sugarcane. An F 6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) segregating population with 184 progeny lines was developed from a cross between R 9188, a dwarf conversion of the sweet sorghum line Rio, and R 403463 - 2 - 1, a Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (QDPIF) elite grain sorghum R-line. The population was evaluated in two field trials for 16 agronomic traits and eight sugar-related traits. A genetic linkage map of R 9188 x R 403463 - 2 - 1 was constructed integrating 225 polymorphic bands produced by 38 AFLP primer pairs, 37 Xtxp SSR and six sugarcane SSR markers. The constructed map had 16 linkage groups (LG), of which 10 could be assigned a chromosome on the basis of shared markers between this map and previously published maps of sorghum and sugarcane, and spanned a total length of 2012. 9 cM (including unknown LG). Eleven traits were analysed for QTL identification; seven sugar-related traits (sucrose content, glucose content, fructose content, sugar content, sucrose yield, sucrose to sugar ratio and Brix) and four agronomic traits (height, DTF, total dry matter and grain yield). Fifty-five marker were associated with the 11 traits from the two field trials, of which 15 were identified in both trials which is not unexpected considering the high heritability of the traits in the field trials. QTL generally colocated to five major locations. QTL from R 9188 were found for sucrose content, sugar content and sugar yield on chromosomes SBI- 01, SBI- 05 and LG-U 6. R 9188 also contributed QTL for Brix on SBI- 05 and LG-U 6, and sugar content on SBI- 03. QTL from R 403463 - 2 - 1 were found for sucrose content and sucrose yield on SBI- 10, and glucose content on SBI- 07. QTL for height, days to flowering and total dry matter, were located on SBI- 01 from R 403463 - 2 - 1, and on LG-U 6 from R 9188. QTL for grain yield from both R 403463 - 2 - 1 and R 9188 were found on SBI- 03. Three of the sorghum chromosomes (SBI- 01, SBI- 03 and SBI- 05) that contained QTL for sugar-related traits, also contained sugarcane SSRs that mapped in sugarcane to three homology groups (2, 3 and 4) with strong QTL for sugar-related traits suggesting that similar loci for sugar-related traits are being detected between sweet sorghum and sugarcane. Field and glasshouse trials were conducted to investigate the accumulation of sugars spatially within the stem and developmentally at anthesis and post-black layer in sweet sorghums. A stem sugar profile in sweet sorghums had not previously been created at post-black layer and it was found that in the glasshouse trial, the sucrose increased toward the base of the stem, in the same manner of accumulation seen in sugarcane. Like sugarcane, the sucrose in the sweet sorghums accounted for 90 % of the soluble solids (sucrose to total ratio) at the end of the crop cycle. A comparison of profiles was also conducted between a sweet and grain sorghum, fertile sorghum and their sterile counterpart, sweet sorghum and the dwarf conversion, and high Brix and low Brix progeny of the R 9188 x R 403463 - 2 - 1 population. At post-black layer, the sweet sorghum had higher sucrose than the grain sorghum, and higher sugars were found in the sterile versions compared to the fertile versions. Sugar accumulation had not been previously investigated in dwarf converted sweet sorghums; R 9188, the dwarf version of Rio, was significantly lower in whole-plant sucrose at post-black layer, but no difference was noted in individual stem sections. No clear distinction could be made between the high Brix lines and the low Brix lines, sampled at post-black layer, for sugar-related traits at a whole-plant or stem section level. The genetic relationship of sweet and grain sorghums, within S. bicolor ssp. bicolor, was investigated for the first time. Ninety-five genotypes, including 31 sweet sorghums and 64 grain sorghums, representing all five races within the subspecies bicolor, were screened with 277 polymorphic AFLP markers. The sweet sorghum lines were largely distinguished from the others, particularly by a group of markers located on SBI- 08 and SBI- 10, and although the clusters obtained did not group clearly on the basis of racial classification; the sweet sorghum lines often clustered with grain sorghums of similar racial origin thus suggesting that the high stem sugar in sweet sorghums occurred independently or was independently selected in several different genetic backgrounds within S. bicolor ssp. bicolor. In this study, great steps have been made in determining the use of sweet sorghum as a genetic and physiological model for sugar accumulation in sugarcane. From a genetic perspective, similar loci for sugar-related traits were detected between sweet sorghum and sugarcane, thus indicating that sweet sorghum is likely to be a good genetic model for sugar accumulation in sugarcane. In sweet sorghum, the markers associated with the sugar-related traits will be a valuable resource for future markerassisted selection for these traits in a sweet sorghum breeding program. However, the diversity study suggested that the high stem sugar in sweet sorghum occurred independently or was independently selected in several different genetic backgrounds, which is in contrast to the possible monophyletic origin of high stem sugar in sugarcane. From a physiological perspective, the sucrose levels increased toward the base of the stem in sweet sorghum and accounted for 90 % of the soluble solids at the end of the crop cycle, in the same manner of accumulation seen in sugarcane, suggesting that sweet sorghum could be a physiological model for sugarcane. Thus, sweet sorghum could be used as both a genetic and physiological model for sugarcane...|$|R

50|$|Corn was {{the second}} major food crop, and its {{importance}} was growing. Corn covered more hectares than any other crop. In the late 1980s, approximately 300,000 hectares provided more than 475,000 tons of white corn, the traditional corn of Bolivia. Yellow Cuban corn, grown in the tropical areas of Santa Cruz, was becoming more common; 160,000 hectares produced 350,000 tons of yellow corn in 1988. Sixty percent of the corn, including both white and yellow varieties was grown by small farmers in the valleys, with the remaining 40 percent planted by medium-large farmers in Santa Cruz. Small farmers used {{at least half of}} their corn for human consumption, as animal feed, or for brewing chicha, the primary intoxicating beverage consumed by Bolivian Indians. The other half of their production and most of the commercially farmed corn were sold to Bolivia's forty private animal-feed plants, which bought 50 percent of the country's annual corn output. Many corn farmers were members of the Corn and Sorghum Producers Association (Productores de Maíz y <b>Sorgo</b> Promasor).

50|$|Pedagogical Anthropology (Pädagogische Anthropologie): Wulf's basic thesis for the {{justification}} {{of the necessity}} of pedagogical anthropology states that upbringing and education constantly contains images of people - anthropological images. Without anthropological assumptions about people and about how upbringing, education, and socialization is to occur, upbringing and education is not possible. In order to bestow continuity on the research in the field of pedagogical anthropology, in 1992 Wulf initiated the founding of the Pedagogical Anthropology Commission in the German Society for Educational Science (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Erziehungswissenschaft). This initiative was supported by Dieter Lenzen, Klaus Mollenhauer, Konrad Wünsche, Theodor Schulze, Eckart Liebau, and Max Liedtke. It was later joined by the following: Johannes Bilstein, Jörg Zirfas, Michael Göhlich, Birgit Althans, Micha Brumlik, Maike Sophia Baader, Doris Schuhmacher-Chilla, Helga Peskoller, Stephan Sting, Ursula Stenger, Hans-Rüdiger Müller, Gabriele <b>Sorgo,</b> Edgar Forster, Christian Rittelmeyer, Gisela Miller-Kipp, Anja Tervooren, Kristin Westphal and many other colleagues. This research takes its starting point in the works of pedagogical anthropology which were created after the Second World War and whose most important representatives included: Otto Friedrich Bollnow, Heinrich Roth, Andreas Flitner, Rudolf Lassahn, and Hans Scheuerl. Over the years, this commission initiated and led by Wulf treated many fundamental topics. The approx. 20 books that have been issued in the meantime cover a broad spectrum of pedagogical-anthropological research. They include books on the history and theory of pedagogical anthropology, on anthropology of perception and aesthetics, on play, imagination, and work, on pedagogical action, including its anthropological and ethical basic conditions, on the role of space, time, and institutions in pedagogical work, on the meaning of nature and religion, generation, love, and friendship, on the senses, and on questions regarding gender. What the authors of these studies {{have in common is that}} they are convinced of the importance of the historical and cultural dimension of anthropology and they are attempting to develop important perspectives for the understanding of upbringing, education, and socialization in the world of today using philosophical reflection as well as historical and ethnographic research. They are also convinced that, due to European and global changes, pedagogical research and work sorely need fundamental anthropological research that is to contribute to a better understanding of upbringing, education, and socialization in the various parts of the world. It is no longer sufficient to localize upbringing and education in national contexts. The European orientation also needs to be supplemented through the recognition of Asian, Latin American, and African perspectives, i.e., global influences need to be taken into account.|$|E

After 60 days and the fermentation stage of the material already completed, the silos were opened. The treatments were: Brachiaria singles in planting, planting sorghum in singles, sorghum intercropped with grass in row and between rows of planting sorghum intercropped with grass planted between the rows, intercropped withsorghum grass in the row. We used a randomized complete block design with five replicates per treatment. The higher content of organic matter such as sorghum was unmarried, with no difference between the consortia and Brachiaria single. The consortium did not differ amongthemselves and had higher values than the single grain sorghum in the contents of mineral matter. The planting of sorghum intercropped with sorghum and grass in line with grass between the rows increased the lignin content. In vitro digestibility of dry matter was decreased by the mixed stands compared to sorghum silage single. The crude protein were higher in mixed stands and Brachiaria unmarried singles in sorghum silage. There was no difference between the variables dry matter, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, hemicellulose, and total digestible nutrients. Already in production parameters of the consortium did not exert signi ficant influence on the heights of sorghum plants and grass. The stands were greater in mixed stands than in sorghum that being unmarried, sorghum grass with the line had the best result. The best production of greenBrachiaria was unmarried, and sorghum in line with grass and rows of sorghum with planting and grass between the lines were better than the single grain sorghum and sorghum with grass on the line. The production of green matter was influenced by the mixed stands, being better at planting of sorghum grass with the line and with canopy and grass between the lines but they did not differ from that increased production of Brachiaria was unmarried...|$|E

However, when using the LDA as marker there was significant difference to ADF, where the sorghum silage without additive was higher then sorghum silage with Lacto Silo. The sorghum silage with corn meal was similar to other two silages. There was significant correlation only to TC and HEM, between the two methodologies used to estimate. digestibility. Este trabalho teve como objetivos avaliar o consumo médio diário da silagem de <b>sorgo,</b> da silagem de <b>sorgo</b> aditivada com fubá e da silagem de <b>sorgo</b> aditivada com Lacto Silo., bem como estimar a digestibilidade aparente in vivo e pelo uso da lignina em detergente ácido (LDA) como indicador, e correlacionar os valores das digestibilidades aparentes de alguns componentes nutritivos destas três silagens. Foram utilizados nove ovinos machos, castrados, sem raça definida, com peso médio inicial de 30, 7 Kg, distribuídos em três tratamentos e dois períodos, alojados em gaiolas metabólicas. A silagem de <b>sorgo</b> sem aditivos proporcionou maiores níveis de consumo de matéria seca (MS), matéria orgânica (MO), fibra em detergente ácido (FDA), fibra em detergente neutro (FDN), carboidratos totais (CT) e hemicelulose (HEM). Os coeficientes de digestibilidade aparente dos componentes nutritivos das três silagens foram semelhantes quando avaliados pela coleta total de fezes. Já utilizando a LDA como indicador houve diferença significativa apenas para a FDA, onde a silagem de <b>sorgo</b> sem aditivos foi superior a silagem de <b>sorgo</b> aditivada com Lacto Silo. A silagem de <b>sorgo</b> com fubá foi semelhante às duas. Houve correlação significativa apenas para CT e HEM entre as duas metodologias usadas para estimar as digestibilidades...|$|E
