40|$|A fire burst {{within a}} diving chamber {{indicates}} greatest risk for diver's health. The burning behavior of some materials typically fitted within diving chambers was analysed within diving mixed gas atmospheres consisting of 5 % nitrogen, oxygen varying and helium filled up to 100 %, {{which are used}} for saturation diving down to 600 m waterdepths. With reference to the minimum oxygen concentration necessary for flammability/burning of these materials no disadvantageous properties could be demonstrated compared with already known worst-case-conditions of hyperbaric burning. Consequently the test results confirm the conservative nature of fire safety evaluation for saturation diving based on the paper <b>strip</b> <b>burning</b> experiments performed by Dorr. Further experiments related to the composition of some smoke fumes which will be expected after a fire at a typically equipped pressurized air building site. (orig.)

5000|$|Tallow {{once was}} widely {{used to make}} moulded candles before more {{convenient}} wax varieties became available—and for some time after, as they {{continued to be a}} cheaper alternative. For those too poor even to avail themselves of homemade, moulded tallow candles, the [...] "tallow dip"—a <b>strip</b> of <b>burning</b> cloth in a saucer of tallow grease—was an accessible substitute.|$|R

How I see those bright coral and sandy beaches, <b>strips</b> of <b>burning</b> {{sunshine}} fringing the masses of forest rising into ridges of hills, covered with a dense mat of vegetation.

60|$|Two men {{brought the}} log, which was unusually long and heavy for that region, where the stoutest trees are small, and Boone and I {{staggered}} with {{the butt of}} it into the smoke. The rest grasped the thinner end, swung it back, and drove the other forward with all the impetus they could furnish. The door creaked, but the most manifest result was the fall of a further <b>strip</b> of <b>burning</b> thatch on us.|$|R
50|$|In Michigan, strip clearcuts in a conifer swamp {{resulted}} {{in an increase in}} the relative abundance of meadow voles. They were most abundant in clearcut strip interiors and least abundant in uncut <b>strip</b> interiors. Slash <b>burning</b> did not appear to affect meadow vole numbers about 1.5 years after treatment.|$|R
50|$|In August 1999, Biscet, {{along with}} two dozen other dissidents, were {{detained}} by Cuban police for organizing meetings in Havana and Matanzas. He was released five days earlier on August 17, 1999. He claimed that while in custody, the police tortured him by beating, kicking, <b>stripping,</b> and <b>burning</b> him. The government then threatened to detain him longer if he continued promoting his counterrevolutionary activities in Cuba. Later in 1999, he was sent back in prison for a three-year sentence for dishonoring a national symbol, public disorder, and instigating to commit crime, after having protested Cuba's lack of freedom by showing the Cuban flag upside down. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. He was released from a high-security prison in the Holguín Province after having served his full sentence.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} forbear shaking my head, and smiling {{a little at}} his ignorance. And being no {{stranger}} to the art of war, I gave him a description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets, powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines, countermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs flying in the air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses’ feet, flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases, left for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, <b>stripping,</b> ravishing, <b>burning,</b> and destroying. And to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them blow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the spectators.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The Molotov {{cocktail}} is {{an improvised}} incendiary grenade prepared from a glass bottle filled with gasoline (petrol) or other flammable liquid, ignited by an attached <b>burning</b> <b>strip</b> of cloth when the thrown bottle shatters against its target, dousing {{the immediate area}} in flames. The Molotov cocktail received its name during the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939 Winter War, but had been used earlier in the decade by Franco's troops during the Spanish Civil War. It was named by Finnish troops during the Winter War, after the former Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov, whom they deemed responsible for the war, and a humorous reference to the Soviet bombs nicknamed [...] "Molotov bread baskets" [...] in Finland.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} of the light bulb is without any doubt {{one of the major}} inventions of the nineteenth century. It changed life profoundly in that it made human activities independent of the natural light circumstances on a hitherto unknown scale. The idea of electric light goes back to Humphrey Davy. He discovered that an electric arc between two poles could produce light. This phenomenon, however, was rather unpractical for home applications and could not be an alternative to existing gas light. New ideas were explored {{on the basis of the}} theoretical work on heat production in resistant conductors. An electric current could heat a conductor to such an extent that it would glow white-hot. Joseph Wilson Swan was the first to construct an electric light bulb on these physical principles. It contained a thin strip of material (filament) in an oxygen-free environment to prevent the <b>strip</b> from <b>burning.</b> An electric current heated the strip. He had, however, serious trouble maintaining the vacuum in the light bulb. Thomas Edison was able to solve this problem and at the same time to construct stable enough carbon wire that could function as filament. On October 21, 1879, he illuminated an electric lamp that glowed continuously for 40 h. That was an enormous achievement in those days...|$|R
50|$|Local South Bronx {{residents}} themselves also {{burned down}} vacant properties {{in their own}} neighborhoods. Much of this was reportedly done by those who had already worked <b>stripping</b> and <b>burning</b> buildings for pay: the ashes of burned down properties could be sifted for salable scrap metal. Other fires were caused by unsafe electrical wiring, fires set indoors for heating, and random vandalism associated with the general crime situation. Flawed HUD and city policies also encouraged local South Bronx residents to burn down their own buildings. Under the regulations, Section 8 tenants who were burned out of their current housing were granted immediate priority status for another apartment, potentially in a {{better part of the}} city. After the establishment of the (then) state-of-the-art Co-op City, there was a spike in fires as tenants began burning down their Section 8 housing in an attempt to jump {{to the front of the}} 2- to 3-year-long waiting list for the new units. HUD regulations also authorized lump-sum aid payments of up to $1000 to those who could prove they had lost property due to a fire in their Section 8 housing; although these payments were supposed to be investigated for fraud by a HUD employee before being signed off on, very little investigation was done and some HUD employees and social services workers were accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious fires or even advising tenants on the best way to take advantage of the HUD policies. On multiple occasions, firefighters were reported to have shown up to tenement fires only to find all the residents at an address waiting calmly with their possessions already on the curb.|$|R
5000|$|Biodiversity loss (including the {{potential}} extinction of charismatic species) {{is one of}} the most serious negative effects of oil palm cultivation. Large areas of already threatened tropical rainforest are often cleared to make way for palm oil plantations, especially in Southeast Asia, where enforcement of forest protection laws is lacking. In some states where oil palm is established, lax enforcement of environmental legislation leads to encroachment of plantations into protected areas, [...] encroachment into riparian <b>strips,</b> [...] open <b>burning</b> of plantation wastes, and release of palm mill pollutants such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) in the environment. [...] Some of these states have recognised the need for increased environmental protection, resulting in more environment-friendly practices. Among those approaches is anaerobic treatment of POME, which can be a good source for biogas (methane) production and electricity generation. Anaerobic treatment of POME has been practiced in Malaysia and Indonesia. Like most wastewater sludge, anaerobic treatment of POME results in dominance of Methanosaeta concilii. It plays an important role in methane production from acetate, and the optimum condition for its growth should be considered to harvest biogas as renewable fuel.|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. The Georgia Geologic Survey (GGS) has mapped 29 7. 5 minute quadrangles in the Upper Coastal Plain {{of southwestern}} Georgia {{during the past}} eight years as part of the U. S. Geological Survey’s STATEMAP program. Exposed sediments in these quadrangles consist of Upper Cretaceous to Tertiary sand, sandstone, clay, and limestone. Two {{geological}} rock units, the Eocene-ageClaiborne Group and the Cretaceous Providence Formation consist mainly of sand or soft sandstone that are easily eroded when exposed to concentrated storm runoff. Runoff from highway culverts, poor irrigation or loggingpractices can lead to significant and rapid erosion of the soft sands. Clear-cutting and <b>stripping</b> or <b>burning</b> of fragile ground cover in sandy terrain significantly inhibits regeneration of the ground cover that protects the sand from erosion. Erosion may threaten agricultural fields and infrastructures such as roads, railroads, pipelines and power lines. Sedimentation or silting up of streams by sand eroded from the surrounding terrain reduces the depth and velocity of normal stream flow and adversely affects stream ecology. Gullies resulting from this erosion tend to collect a variety of trash. As the Providence Formation and Claiborne Group are both important local and regional aquifers in the southwestern Coastal Plain of Georgia, trash may leak chemicals into these aquifers and have a detrimental effect on domestic, agricultural, and public water supplies.

40|$|Experimental setup. We {{constructed}} {{our model}} system by placing strips of nitrocellulose (VWR, Nitrocellulose Membrane BA 83, 0. 2 μm pore size) on a suspended wire mesh and igniting them {{from one end}} (the material of this mesh did not, via conduction, influence rates of propagation for structured and unstructured flames; see SI Note 1). By imaging the propagation of flames along these strips, we examined structured and unstructured propagation behaviors (and transitions between them). The particular brand of nitrocellulose that we employed was electrostatically charged and, thus, stuck {{to the surface of}} wire mesh. To ensure adequate airflow to the bottom of <b>burning</b> <b>strips,</b> we separated the wire mesh from a glass surface by a 2. 5 -cm gap (Fig. S 1 A). To prevent stray currents of air from interfering with spread behaviors, we placed the paper/mesh setup in an enclosed fume hood with no airflow (Fig. S 1 B). The meshes employed in this study consisted of two sizes (McMaster-Carr) : a small mesh, which contained diamond-shaped holes with areas of 0. 051 cm 2 and an areal density of 5 holes/cm 2; and a large mesh, which contained diamond-shaped holes with areas of 0. 13 cm 2 and an areal density of 2 holes/cm 2. We used the large mesh for all experiments except those indicated (e. g. Table S 1). We carried out all experiments in ambient laboratory condition...|$|R
