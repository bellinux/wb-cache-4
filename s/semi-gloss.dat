50|$|Photo {{paper is}} {{typically}} divided into glossy, semi-matte, <b>semi-gloss,</b> satin or silk, and matte finishes. Paper thickness varies widely. Lighter weights {{are not much}} different from the general-purpose office papers described above, and can be used for all types of printing, though these are the least expensive and lowest-quality photo papers.|$|E
50|$|The year 2003 saw Veeraraghavan use {{interesting}} photographic {{techniques to}} produce a large format print on <b>semi-gloss</b> coated paper, titled Osmosis. Manipulating the tonalities of black-and-white inkjet printing and through the interplay of details, he produced a sensuous jigsaw puzzle - densely entangled figures of copulating nudes came together to conjure up a 'paradise' of winged butterflies.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2011, the {{earliest}} known photographs by William Eastman Palmer are stereoviews dating from the 1860s or 1870s.

50|$|In 1982-83, Gober created Slides of a Changing Painting, {{consisting}} of 89 images of paintings {{made on a}} small piece of plywood in his storefront studio in the East Village; he made a slide of each motif, then scraped off the paint and began again. One of his most well known series of more than 50 increasingly eccentric sinks - made of plaster, wood, wire lath, and coated in layers of <b>semi-gloss</b> enamel - which he produced in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Baker-Miller Pink is {{a tone of}} pink {{that was}} {{originally}} created by mixing one gallon of pure white indoor latex paint with one pint of red trim <b>semi-gloss</b> outdoor paint. [...] It is named for the two US Navy officers who first experimented with its use in 1979 at the Naval Correctional Facility in Seattle, Washington {{at the behest of}} researcher Alexander Schauss. The color is also known as Schauss pink, after Alexander Schauss' extensive research into the effects of the color on emotions and hormones, as well as P-618 and Drunk-Tank Pink.|$|E
50|$|Black Pearl pepper is a {{cultivar}} of Capsicum annuum. It {{is characterized}} by distinctive black leaves and fruit. It was developed by Arboretum Floral and Nursery Plants Research Unit scientists Rob Griesbach and John Stommel of the Agricultural Research Service’s Vegetable Laboratory. This pepper plant is notably similar to another strain, named the Black Hungarian, another designer pepper plant. Though edible, it is considered an ornamental plant and even won an award for its beauty from All-Americas Selections in 2006. The Black Pearl has characteristic <b>semi-gloss</b> black to deep-purple leaves with peppers that are black and turn crimson when fully ripened.|$|E
5000|$|Celestron was {{the first}} large scale {{commercial}} manufacturer of the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, introducing its [...] "C8" [...] 8" [...] diameter 2032 mm focal length, ƒ10 telescope in 1970. The primary innovation Celestron/Tom Johnson came up with {{was a way to}} produce Schmidt corrector plates using a vacuum to pull the glass blanks into a pre-shaped curve mold called a [...] "master block" [...] during the polishing process. [...] This allowed for the inexpensive mass production of corrector plates of uniform shape. The telescope line had a trademark matte orange tube (changed to glossy black in 1980, and back to <b>semi-gloss</b> orange in 2006), and double-fork equatorial mount, and became a popular large aperture, compact design.|$|E
5000|$|Varnish is a transparent, hard, {{protective}} finish or {{film that}} is primarily used in wood finishing {{but also for}} other materials. Varnish is traditionally {{a combination of a}} drying oil, a resin, and a thinner or solvent. Varnish finishes are usually glossy but may be designed to produce satin or <b>semi-gloss</b> sheens by the addition of [...] "flatting" [...] agents. Varnish has little or no color, is transparent, and has no added pigment, as opposed to paints or wood stains, which contain pigment and generally range from opaque to translucent. Varnishes are also applied over wood stains as a final step to achieve a film for gloss and protection. Some products are marketed as a combined stain and varnish.|$|E
5000|$|The Super Redhawk {{was only}} {{available}} in stainless steel {{with a number}} of finishes. [...] The standard finish is brushed steel, with a <b>semi-gloss</b> look. Polished, high-gloss versions have also been offered, though this option is not currently available. Stainless steel one-inch scope rings are included, using the standard Ruger lockup common to all Ruger integral bases. These rings easily allow removing the scope from the handgun, without significantly altering zero, or eye-relief, once the scope is re-installed. The Super Redhawk uses different front and rear rings, with the rear ring being shorter than the front ring due to differences in frame height. [...] Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifles also use a higher ring in the rear than in the front.|$|E
5000|$|However, many F90 and F90x {{bodies had}} {{problems}} with the rubberized back, where the rubberized coating would start peeling or turn into a sticky mess. The rubber around the grip and other parts were not affected. This {{did not affect the}} functionality of the back but was a nuisance to users.The rubberised coating can however be removed (Once the door has been unclipped and safely removed from the camera body) by rubbing gently with a microfibre towel or similar soaked in plenty of Isopropyl Alcohol. This procedure will remove the rubberised top coating without affecting the surface finish of the underlying plastic or the clear film viewing window. The white printed [...] "Vari Program" [...] icons will remain unaffected also. The end result is a hard <b>semi-gloss</b> finish the same as the camera's top plate.|$|E
5000|$|... (1974): These models had the locking-pin tabs {{eliminated}} on {{the front}} end of the grip assembly, and the corresponding locking-pin hole ("push-pin" [...] hole) and bushing at the base of the receiver had a [...] "U"-shaped piece of metal inserted to prevent the attachment of a full-auto [...] "SEF" [...] trigger group. This makes the [...] "flapper" [...] magazine-release paddle between the trigger guard and magazine well inoperative, making the redundant release button on the right-hand side of the receiver the only way to eject the magazine. It also had the cocking-lever endcap altered to prohibit the mounting of most models of the HK G3 bayonet and had the snap rings on the barrel removed so that it couldn't fire rifle grenades. These were painted black with a <b>semi-gloss</b> finish and were date stamped [...] "1/74".|$|E
5000|$|American {{independent}} label Minimal Wave {{announced on}} July 20, {{the release of}} In Trance 95's album [...] "Cities Of Steel And Neon" [...] which came out on October 6 of 2011 as the label's twenty-ninth release. Cities Of Steel And Neon [...] features material recorded between 1988-1989: the unreleased 4-track recordings, the highly lauded first single Desire To Desire / Brazilia, and a rare version of 21st Century European Temptation. The LP is pressed on 180 gram black vinyl and housed in a matte sleeve with <b>semi-gloss</b> inner sleeve depicting 1989 video stills of the duo. The sleeve is designed by Peter Miles using an image supplied by the well known New York artist Matthew Bakkom. On December 1 of 2011, Minimal Wave released the digital version of the album with two bonus tracks from 1988, [...] "Gunshot" [...] and [...] "Oslo", that were also previously unreleased.|$|E
5000|$|DAF sprayed a {{red lead}} primer on {{the cars and}} then {{finished}} them with a <b>semi-gloss</b> coating in the standard colour of the Dutch Army: [...] "army green", {{that was at the}} time conceived as a rather dark and dull bronze. The orange triangle Dutch national insignia were absent on the M 39s. Instead during the fighting as a makeshift solution on occasion the Dutch flag was used, sometimes as such, in at least one case painted as a large red-white-blue tricolour {{on the back of the}} vehicle. Black military vehicle registration numbers, from III-2201 to III-2212, were applied on a rectangular orange background. No large white identification numbers were used, as did the other Dutch armoured car types. As was usual for Dutch army matériel during most of the twentieth century, no camouflage pattern was applied. The inside was sprayed with an aluminium colour, with the exception of the inside of doors and hatches.|$|E
5000|$|A {{version of}} 2012 model year Jeep Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon {{inspired}} by Activision's Call of Duty video games was available. Equipment included Rubicon wheels finished in <b>semi-gloss</b> black, black, or bright silver body color, [...] "Call of Duty: MW3 Special Edition" [...] graphics {{on the front}} fenders and spare tire cover, modified sculpted hood also from AEV (no heat vent); an AEV winch-ready (less the winch plate) front bumper and AEV rear bumper, rock rails, taillamp guards and a fuel-filler door from Mopar accessories; 32-inch off-road tires, live axles with locking differentials {{in the front and}} rear, a two-speed transfer case, model-specific black seats with accent stitching and [...] "Call of Duty" [...] logos, unique gauge cluster graphics, dashboard serialized plaque, dashboard grab handle with logo, accent stitching on arm rest, console lid, and steering wheel, as well as Mopar slush floor mats and a rear cargo mat (Unlimited only) with logos.|$|E
50|$|While {{experimenting with}} acrylic colors {{for the first}} time, artist Mele Flórez Avellán started testing the paints on a {{masonite}} board. With a base of <b>semi-gloss</b> house paint, she started to apply color to her subject. To her discontent, the brush-applied strokes didn’t stick on the support the way she expected. It was not an opaque covering but semi-transparent. Since Mele already {{took the time to}} design her painting, she decided to look around her work area to see what could be used to make this a successful painting. Being a crafty person throughout her whole life, her work area was filled with all sorts of gadgets. She took a stencil sponge, dipped it in paint and lightly touched the support with the sponge. She liked what she saw. The addition of white, silver and gold paints gave the painting more light. The line extensions were then darkened to create a strong contrast.|$|E
50|$|Area-51 R1 (Discontinued) - This {{model is}} based on the intel x58 {{platform}} (LGA 1366 Socket). This model shared identical hardware with the Area 51 ALX. Processors included Core i7 only (first generation Nehalem). In order of model number: 920, 930, 940, 950, 960, 975 (quad core), 980X (six core), 990X (six core). The X58 platform also uses Intel Xeon Processors but none were used in the Area 51. The Area 51 used triple channel Memory and had Graphics Card options from AMD's HD 5000/6000 series line as well as Nvidia GeForce 400 Series and Nvidia GeForce 500 Series line. Power Supply options included a 1000 watt Power Supply Unit and an 1100 watt Power Supply Unit. Power Supply and Motherboard supports both SLI and CrossfireX. -Note: The Area 51 was offered from the beginning alongside the Aurora R1, R2, R3 and the Aurora ALX (R1). It offered Thermal-Controlled Active-Venting, tool-less Hard Drive Bays, internal Theater lighting and an array of external LEDs. Area-51 was offered in either <b>semi-gloss</b> black or lunar shadow (silver) finishes, with a non-motorised front push-panel. Command Center software and AlienFx features are offered via a discrete master i/o daughterboard.|$|E
5000|$|MidAmeriCon also {{presented}} another Worldcon first, a [...] "themed" [...] base {{used for the}} Hugo Award: [...] "The Dragon and the Rocket". Instead of being made out of finished wood in square or angled stacked shapes, as in the past, all bases were cast from flexible molds using a marbled effect achieved by combining contrasting tinted porcelain powder layers with resin and a hardener. When cured, a low-luster clear outer finish was then applied. Each example featured a sculpted, just-hatched dragon (representing the fantasy genre) wrapped half-way around each round 4.5" [...] tall base. The traditional 13" [...] tall, four-finned Hugo rocket (representing science fiction) was John Millard's newer 1973 design; a dozen examples had been machined from billet aluminum stock and then finished with an overall <b>semi-gloss</b> clear outer coat. The flat top of each base had a 4-inch diameter, quarter-inch thick, sand-blasted aluminum [...] "transition" [...] disk that each rocket sat upon. The rocket and disc where then friction tightened to the base through its center using a long threaded bolt and nut; each base's round, flat bottom was then covered with adhesive-backed black felt to hide the recessed attachment point. A curved black-and-silver engraved Hugo information plate was affixed by two screws to the base's side facing away from the wrapped dragon. The overall base design was by convention chairman Ken Keller, with the final finished design and casting master sculpted by three-time Hugo Award-winning fan artist Tim Kirk (who {{went on to win}} his fourth Hugo in the same category that year).|$|E
