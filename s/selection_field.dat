One is the modelling of the densities with continuous variables. The material densities can now also attain values between zero and one. Gradient based algorithms that handle large amounts of continuous variables and multiple constraints are available. But the material properties have to be modelled in a continuous setting. This is done through interpolation. One of the most implemented interpolation methodologies is the SIMP method (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation [...] ).

40|$|We {{present a}} method for obtaining conjugate, {{conjoined}} shapes and tilings {{in the context of}} the design of structures using topology optimization. Optimal material distribution is achieved in topology optimization by setting up a <b>selection</b> <b>field</b> in the design domain to determine the presence/absence of material there. We generalize this approach in this paper by presenting a paradigm in which the material left out by the <b>selection</b> <b>field</b> is also utilised. We obtain conjugate shapes when the region chosen and the region left-out are solutions for two problems, each with a different functionality. On the other hand, if the left-out region is connected to the selected region in some pre-determined fashion for achieving a single functionality, then we get conjoined shapes. The utilization of the left-out material, gives the notion of material economy in both cases. Thus, material wastage is avoided in the practical realization of these designs using many manufacturing techniques. This is in contrast to the wastage of left-out material during manufacture of traditional topology-optimized designs. We illustrate such shapes in the case of stiff structures and compliant mechanisms. When such designs are suitably made on domains of the unit cell of a tiling, this leads to the formation of new tilings which are functionally useful. Such shapes are not only useful for their functionality and economy of material and manufacturing, but also for their aesthetic value...|$|E

Although these seeds produce uniform {{plant material}} {{most of the}} time, zygotic or polyploid citrus seedlings may arise. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand how zygotic or tetraploid rootstock could affect a citrus rootstock <b>selection</b> <b>field</b> trial. A trifoliate orange <b>selection</b> <b>field</b> trial, which was planted in 1974 and grafted with clementine, was re-investigated with respect to the presence of rootstocks that were not true-to-type. Among the 288 trees investigated, flow cytometry identified 2. 4 % of rootstocks as tetraploid and SSR markers indicated that 6. 6 % were zygotic. Yield data showed that the presence of tetraploid rootstock dramatically decreased (by about 45 %) clementine fruit production. However, zygosity did not always affect fruit production and a range of effects were observed, from a slight increase in production to a 24 % decrease. Exclusion of non-true-to-type genotypes from the production analysis indicated that the best candidate for rootstock was a clone previously ranked in the middle of the 32 rootstocks under evaluation. However, the presence of zygotic rootstock did not appear to cause any significant differences in fruit quality during the first 5 years of the investigation, which suggests that non-true-to-type plants cannot be identified by fruit quality parameters. This study indicates that tetraploid and zygotic rootstocks have a strong impact on citrus fruit production in orchards, and removal of off-type seedlings is required prior to planting in any agronomic trial.

In both experiments in the first two years, the seedlings were grown on their own roots in plastic containers (cylinders) placed in the high plastic tunnels. At {{the end of the second}} year (December), shoot tips from the seedlings were collected and grafted onto dwarfing rootstock M. 9 (winter grafting). By the end of March, the grafts were planted in plastic containers and placed in the same high plastic tunnel.
