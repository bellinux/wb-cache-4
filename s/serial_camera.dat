In this paper, designing of CMOS camera (OV 9650) driver on S 3 C 6410 developing board is considered using embedded Linux environment and design of remote monitoring system. <b>Serial</b> <b>camera</b> control bus (SCCB) is a distinguishing feature of OV series CMOS chips. This paper emphasise on <b>Serial</b> <b>camera</b> control bus (SCCB) on ARM 11 embedded platform. S 3 C 6410 provides a camera interface, and the camera driver is designed based on it using embedded Linux platform. The system has the functions of video signal acquisition, compression, transmission over the internet for remote video monitoring. The advantage of using the Linux is that the kernel size is small. The outputs and the result show that the driver works well for video viewing and response is proper in remote operating mode. In our experiment the video quality is good. The driver can also be ported on to any other embedded boards...|$|E
30|$|The VD (or VSYNC) and HD (or HSYNC) pins {{indicate}} {{the end of}} frame and end of row, respectively. Pixel data bytes are available for sampling at the DOUT(0 [*]:[*] 7) bus at the positive edge of the DCLK signal. The EXTCLK is the clock input for the image sensor. The frequency of DCLK is half or quarter of the frequency of EXTCLK depending on {{the configuration of the}} image sensor. The initialization and configuration of the image sensor is done by the 2 -wire (SCL and SDA) I 2 C protocol. In the context of image sensor, it is often called as <b>Serial</b> <b>Camera</b> Control Bus (SCCB) interface [32]. The frame size, colour, sleep mode, and wake up mode can be controlled by sending I 2 C commands to the image sensor. The RESET is an active low reset signal for the image sensor. Some image sensors have a pin (PWDN) to control the active-sleep mode. Some HD image sensors may contain additional control pins (as shown as dotted line in Figure 2), which are used in special modes; however, these extra pins may be tied to VDD or GND or left unconnected in normal operation.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{three-dimensional}} nuclear {{medical imaging}} plays a continuously increasing role in radionuclide dosimetry, allowing {{the development of}} patient - specific treatment planning systems.

However, the quantification of the activity in different organs from planar data is hampered by inaccurate attenuation and scatter correction as well as due to background and organ overlay (Glatting 2006). Alternatively, dosimetry based on quantitative three-dimensional data is more accurate and allows a more individualized approach, provided that all effects that degrade the quantitative content of the images have been corrected for. In addition inhomogeneous organ accumulation of the radionuclide can be detected and possibly taken into account (De Jong 2004).

40|$|Technetium 99 m-hexakis- 2 -methoxy- 2 -methylpropyl-isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) is a {{promising}} new myocardial perfusion imaging agent producing excellent rest images. Imaging, however, {{will need to}} be performed with exercise or dipyridamole to detect ischemia and to differentiate salvaged but still ischemic myocardium from scar. Accordingly, 12 dogs were given mild-to-moderate left circumflex coronary stenoses (group 2), and 10 dogs were given severe stenoses (group 3). In five control dogs (group 1), there was no stenosis. After an intravenous infusion of dipyridamole (0. 08 mg/kg/min for 4 minutes), Tc-MIBI was injected into the right atrium. Over the next 4 -hour study period, myocardial Tc-MIBI activities were continuously monitored in both the left anterior descending (LAD) (normal) and left circumflex (LCx) (ischemic) coronary artery (ischemic) zones using miniature cadmium telluride radiation detectors and <b>serial</b> gamma <b>camera</b> images were acquired when neces-sary.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{study the}} {{potential}} usefulness of technetium- 99 m hexakis- 2 -methoxy- 2 -methyl-propyl-isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) as a cardiac perfusion imaging agent, the left circumflex coronary arteries of 12 dogs were partially occluded. Eight additional control dogs had no coronary artery stenosis. Myocardial Tc-MIBI {{activities in the}} left circumflex and left anterior descending zones were contin-uously monitored by miniature implantable radiation detectors for 4 hr after administration of the isotope. The dogs were then killed. <b>Serial</b> gamma <b>camera</b> images were also acquired during the study. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, pressure distal to the stenosis, and cardiac output did not change significantly during the experiment. Microsphere-determined regional myocardial blood flow was significantly reduced in the left circumflex distribution in the 12 dogs with coronary artery stenoses. In the 12 dogs with left circumflex coronary artery stenoses, the 4 hr fractional Tc-MIBI clearances from the normal and ischemic zones were minimal and equivalent (0. 15 + 0. 05 SD vs 0. 15 ± 0. 07). In the eight control dogs, 4 hr fractional Tc-MIBI clearances from the left anterior descending and left circumflex artery zones were minimal and equivalent (0. 11 ± 0. 06 vs 0. 10 + 0. 07).

50|$|The {{security}} mechanism {{on the original}} camera consisted of a challenge and response. The challenge was the <b>camera's</b> <b>serial</b> number, and the response was the 4-byte result of a simple hash function -- the serial number converted from ASCII to binary-coded decimal, negated bitwise, and multiplied by 4. The weakness is that the hash function was stored in the firmware, {{so it could be}} completely understood and replicated. The PV2 used a better challenge and response mechanism. It is better not because it uses a longer key (128 byte challenge, 128 byte response), but because the hash function is not stored algorithmically in firmware. Theoretically, the response could not be mathematically related to the challenge and the only correlation between the two could be a record saved in the manufacturer's database (which authorized processing systems would have to access to read pictures from the camera). In practice, though, only a few challenge/response pairs have been seen in the wild.|$|R
