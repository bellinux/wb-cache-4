5000|$|Prior to the judgment, a {{large number}} of local {{authorities}} had entered into such <b>swap</b> <b>transactions.</b> Accordingly, the decision of the House of Lords declaring such practices to be unlawful set off a torrent of collateral litigation unwinding such swaps. [...] Although this clearly caused difficulties for the banks and local authorities engaged in such <b>swap</b> <b>transactions,</b> it has been noted that the [...] "swap litigation" [...] was instrumental in developing the modern law of restitution under English law.|$|E

5000|$|Up {{until the}} early 1990s, a number of local {{authorities}} had been engaged in interest rate <b>swap</b> <b>transactions</b> as part of managing their debt portfolios. Under the Local Authorities Act 1972, the local authorities had power to borrow in order to amortise their costs of capital projects {{over a longer period}} of time. In connection with that borrowing, certain local authorities sought to enter into <b>swap</b> <b>transactions</b> to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. There were some doubts as to the ability of local authorities to enter into such transactions, but the local authorities sought the opinion of Anthony Scrivener QC, a leading commercial silk, who had advised that if a [...] "rate swap is undertaken as part of the proper management of the council's fund then ... the swap will be intra vires" [...] within the powers of the council.|$|E

"Schmidt {{also noted}} another {{interesting}} {{aspect of the}} foreign- exchange market: The dominant players were the private banks, which had huge pools of capital and access to information about currency values. Since much of the market involved moving {{large sums of money}} (typically in the tens of millions of dollars) for very short periods of time (often less than a day), banks were perfectly positioned to participate. Among <b>swap</b> <b>transactions,</b> which represented a major chunk of the foreign exchange market, 86 per cent of the transactions were actually between banks." ...|$|E
