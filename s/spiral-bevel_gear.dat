40|$|Improvements in <b>spiral-bevel</b> <b>gear</b> design were {{investigated}} {{to support the}} Army/NASA Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission program. Program objectives were to reduce weight by 25 percent, reduce noise by 10 dB, and increase life to 5000 hr mean-time-between-removal. To help meet these goals, advanced-design spiral-bevel gears were tested in an OH- 58 D helicopter transmission using the NASA 500 -hp Helicopter Transmission Test Stand. Three different gear designs tested included: (1) the current design of the OH- 58 D transmission except gear material X- 53 instead of AISI 9310; (2) a higher-strength design {{the same as the}} current but with a full fillet radius to reduce gear tooth bending stress (and thus, weight); and (3) a lower-noise design the same as the high-strength but with modified tooth geometry to reduce transmission error and noise. Noise, vibration, and tooth strain tests were performed and significant gear stress and noise reductions were achieved...|$|E
40|$|A {{helicopter}} transmission {{that was}} being considered for the Army's Utility Tactical Transport Attack System (UTTAS) was tested in the NASA Lewis 2240 -kW (3000 -hp) test facility to obtain the transmission's operational data. The results will form a vibration and efficiency data base for evaluation similar-class helicopter transmissions. The transmission's mechanical efficiency {{was determined to be}} 98. 7 percent at its rated power level of 2080 kW (2792 hp). At power levels up to 113 percent of rated the transmission displayed 56 percent higher vibration acceleration levels on the right input than on the left input. Both vibration signature analysis and final visual inspection indicated that the right input <b>spiral-bevel</b> <b>gear</b> had poor contact patterns. The highest vibration meter level was 52 g's rms at the accessory gear, which had free-wheeling gearsets. At 113 percent power and 100 percent rated speed the vibration meter levels generally ranged from 3 to 25 g's rms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the source term {{treatment in the}} numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations for an interior grid generation problem in generalized curvilinear coordinates. The geometry considered {{is that of a}} planar cross-section of a generic <b>spiral-bevel</b> <b>gear</b> tooth typical of a pinion in the OH- 58 helicopter transmission. The source terms used are appropriate for an interior grid domain where all the boundaries are prescribed via a combination of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. New constraints based on the Green's Theorem are derived which uniquely determine the coefficients in the source terms. These constraints are designed for boundary clustered grids where gradients in physical quantities need to be resolved adequately. However, it is seen that the present formulation works satisfactorily for mild clustering also. Thus, a fully automated elliptic grid generation technique is made possible where {{there is no need for}} a parametric study of these parameters since the new relations fix these free parameters uniquely...|$|E
40|$|New {{methods for}} {{generating}} spur, helical, and <b>spiral-bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are proposed. These methods provide the gears with conjugate gear tooth surfaces, localized bearing contact, and reduced sensitivity to gear misalignment. Computer {{programs have been}} developed for simulating gear meshing and bearing contact...|$|R
50|$|API Category GL-4 designates {{the type}} of service {{characteristic}} of <b>spiral-bevel</b> and hypoid <b>gears</b> in automotive axles operated under moderate speeds and loads. These oils {{may be used in}} selected manual transmission and transaxle applications.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of tooth profile {{changes in the}} transverse plane of circular-cut, <b>spiral-bevel</b> crown <b>gears</b> is presented. The analysis assumes a straight-line profile in the midtransverse plane. The profile variation along the centerline is determined by using expressions for the variation of the spiral angle along the tooth centerline, together with the profile description at the midtransverse plane. It is shown that the tooth surface is a hyperboloid and that significant variations in the pressure angle are possible...|$|R
40|$|Studies to {{evaluate}} low-noise Formate spiral-bevel gears were performed. Experimental tests {{were performed on}} the OH- 58 D helicopter main-rotor transmission in the NASA Glenn 500 -hp Helicopter Transmission Test Stand. Low-noise Formate spiral-bevel gears were compared to the baseline OH- 58 D <b>spiral-bevel</b> <b>gear</b> design, a high-strength design, and previously tested low-noise designs (including an original low-noise design and an improved-bearing-contact low-noise design). Noise, vibration, and tooth strain tests were performed. The Formate design showed a decrease in noise and vibration compared to the baseline OH- 58 D design, and {{was similar to that}} of the previously tested improved-bearing contact low-noise design. The pinion tooth stresses for the Formate design significantly decreased in comparison to the baseline OH- 58 D design. Also {{similar to that of the}} improved bearing-contact low-noise design, the maximum stresses of the Formate design shifted toward the heel, compared to the center of the face width for the baseline, high-strength, and previously tested low-noise designs...|$|E
40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} are {{important}} components on all current rotorcraft drive systems. These components {{are required to}} operate at high speeds, high loads, and for an extremely large number of load cycles. In this application, spiral bevel gears are used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Because of the high expense of manufacturing these gears, methods that can achieve {{the same level of}} performance at reduced cost are highly desirable to aerospace gear manufacturers. Gears manufactured for aerospace applications use high-quality materials and are manufactured to tight tolerances. Special manufacturing machine tools and computer numerically controlled coordinate measurement systems have enabled rotorcraft drive system manufacturers to produce extremely high-quality gears during their normal production. Because of low production rates for rotorcraft, these gears are manufactured in small batches, and thus are unable to benefit from the economics of high production numbers as in other industries. In this investigation, two different manufacturing methods, face-milled and face-hobbed, were used to fabricate spiral bevel gears. For face-milled spiral bevel gears, grinding of the contacting surfaces is the final manufacturing step. At least two different specialty machines are needed to generate the teeth for face-milled spiral bevel gears. For face-hobbed gears, hard cutting is the final manufacturing process. The same machine is used to rough cut and finish cut the gears. This study compared the operational behavior of face-milled spiral bevel gears with that of face-hobbed spiral bevel gears. Test hardware was manufactured to fit within NASA Glenn Research Center's Spiral Bevel Test Facility and to aerospace quality standards. Tests were conducted for stress, vibration, and noise. A comparison of the results attained indicated that the face-hobbed gears had a lower alternating stress level with a more even distribution of loading across the teeth, and slightly reduced levels of vibration and noise. Results of this study show that the face-hobbed method is a viable and lower-cost alternative for producing aerospace-quality <b>spiral-bevel</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|R
40|$|Robust gear designs {{consider}} {{not only}} crack initiation, but crack propagation trajectories for a fail-safe design. In actual gear operation, the magnitude {{as well as}} the position of the force changes as the gear rotates through the mesh. A study to determine the effect of moving gear tooth load on crack propagation predictions was performed. Two-dimensional analysis of an involute spur gear and three-dimensional analysis of a <b>spiral-bevel</b> pinion <b>gear</b> using the finite element method and boundary element method were studied and compared to experiments. A modified theory for predicting gear crack propagation paths based on the criteria of Erdogan and Sih was investigated. Crack simulation based on calculated stress intensity factors and mixed mode crack angle prediction techniques using a simple static analysis in which the tooth load was located at the highest point of single tooth contact was validated. For three-dimensional analysis, however, the analysis was valid only as long as the crack did not approach the contact region on the tooth...|$|R
