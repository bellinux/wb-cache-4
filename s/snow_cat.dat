Several feet of snow hampered rescue efforts, and a <b>snow</b> <b>cat</b> vehicle had to be diverted from the A6 to cut a path for emergency vehicles though the track had been cleared by people using spades by the time it arrived.|$|E

Ships during that time moored alongside seasonal pack ice where military longshoremen offloaded cargo onto large snow sleds. Equipment operators then used <b>snow</b> <b>cats</b> and tractors to tow the freight over ice to McMurdo, a difficult and potentially dangerous operation.

The Stanford University GPS laboratory has pioneered research in fields ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles, robotic open-pit mining trucks, and autonomous farm tractors. This same technology can also find use in grooming the slopes of a ski area! With safety paramount, snow grooming is always performed after closing time of a ski resort, i. e. evenings and nights. Robotic <b>snow</b> <b>cats</b> have great promise for reducing current operating costs of snow grooming, partly due to cost of operators working extremely odd hours of the day. With a state-of-the-art navigation system, one may operate even in full whiteout conditions...|$|R
50|$|On 14 June 1962 an {{expedition}} led by then First Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Giró Tapper left Esperanza {{looking for a}} passage that would link the village with San Martín.

After reaching San Martín, they traveled back to Esperanza, where they arrived on 25 August. During the trip the party overcame numerous obstacles and withstood temperatures below -43 C and katabatic winds of 220 km/h. This feat is considered even now as the most important ever made in the area.|$|R

Kutchan's sister city is St. Moritz in a relationship established in 1964. Niseko Moiwa, adjacent to Annupuri, can be skied to from Annupuri but is not currently connected by the lift system. Niseko Weiss has not operated its lifts for decades, but people can still ski in this area, being taken uphill by <b>snow</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Echo Mountain was {{formerly}} owned by Jerry Petitt and his family. After buying {{the property in}} 2002 Petitt revived the ski area. The hill was originally designed and marketed as a terrain park for younger skiers and snowboarders.In the Summer of 2012, Echo Mountain Park was bought by Nora Pykkonen. Pykkonen was operating Front Range Ski Club, an alpine ski racing facility, out of Echo. Both parties seemed excited about how Echo will change, [...] "I {{think this will be}} a very interesting opportunity for them and hopefully in a few years we will hear about an Olympic skier that came out of Echo." [...] said Petitt.The auction sale was operated by Sheldon Good & Co. In January 2016, Echo Mountain filed for bankruptcy after falling behind on loan payments. In the fall of 2016, the mountain was sold to a new owner in a deal that included all the land, facilities, equipment, <b>snow</b> <b>cats</b> and the chairlift.|$|R
5000|$|The {{philosophy}} of the lawine torrèn's mastermind is that choreography cannot be constricted; moreover, {{it is all about}} the feeling of how movement is perceived, every movement. It was due to our sense for kinaesthesia and our ability for being empathetic that we fully understood our teddy bears - today, we admire the elegance of a crane. The increased upright - the genuine axis of the wish for elevation in dance - forms the basis for [...] "artful elevation". Conducted by humans, cars, diggers, cranes, aeroplanes, <b>snow</b> <b>cats,</b> ships, whichever vehicles, become the electric amplifier of a dance that erupts like rock 'n' roll from the stifling air of the theatre, its space self-referential and formatted too tightly. Drama is understood as an evolutionary creature; art works on the basis of memetic processes: copy, variation and selection form the algorithm of the system called art, which unremittingly saves beauty anew, without signification and orientation. Lawine torrèn sees itself as an attention-industrial formation that functions as a catalyst in and of global economy, steering processes instead of destructing them.|$|R

25|$|Snow leopards are {{carnivores}} {{and actively}} hunt their prey. Like many cats, {{they are also}} opportunistic feeders, eating whatever meat they can find, including carrion and domestic livestock. They can kill animals two to four times their own weight, such as the bharal, Himalayan tahr, markhor, argali, horse, and camel, but will readily take much smaller prey, such as hares and birds. They are capable of killing most animals in their range with the probable exception of the adult male yak. Unusually among <b>cats,</b> <b>snow</b> leopards also eat {{a significant amount of}} vegetation, including grass and twigs. Snow leopards will also hunt in pairs successfully, especially mating pairs.|$|R
