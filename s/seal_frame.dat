In the current study we have investigated the application of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for assessing the quality of metal thermocompression bonds, both by evaluating its capabilities of localizing areas of poor bonding, and by finding defects in the integrity of the bond seal. Wafer laminates containing a test vehicle of <b>sealing</b> <b>frames</b> with pre-defined defects in the bond metal layer were sealed by Au–Au and Al–Al thermocompression bonding. Employing SAM, an area of five chips of poor bonding was identified non-destructively on the Al–Al laminate. Line defects of width 3. 6 µm and point defects of diameter 22. 4 µm have also been identified by SAM. The dicing yield for <b>sealing</b> <b>frames</b> was above 96 % for all frames of widths 100 – 400 µm and for both bond metal systems.

40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSCs) have a typical {{sandwich}} structure, with the active layers between two conductive glass sheets. Their co-planarity {{could be an}} issue in the mass production of large area devices. The micrometric gap should be uniform all over the device, in order to maintain a good electrolyte layer. The frames of sealant, which isolate the adjacent cells in a module, usually work also as spacers. Nevertheless, the uniformity of the gap is not commonly tested in a systematic way. Here large area empty blanks and full DSCs were studied by means of optical interferometry, i. e., monochromatic surface scan and wavelength scan. The collected fringe patterns allowed retrieval of the microchamber’s absolute profile. In some cases, evident U-shaped bending was found, with edge-to-center variation up to Dh/h 80 %. Interestingly, despite the large absorption and the weak index contrast in the full DSCs, a good fringes’ visibility was achieved, by adopting near-infrared (IR) laser source and filtering off external reflections. Moreover, the IR n and k indexes of porous titania dyed and filled with electrolyte were retrieved. In summary, the results show that the bending effect must always be tackled for large area, by using the right <b>sealing</b> <b>frames</b> and thermal treatments. Further improved IR interferometry can be successfully implemented for in-line testing of DSCs structure and uniformity...|$|R

40|$|The ITER Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive (ECH&CD) Upper Launcher, whose {{preliminary}} design was approved in 2009, {{is on its}} way towards the final design. The design work is being done by a consortium of several European research institutes in tight collaboration with F 4 E. The main focus is the finalization of the design of all components for the First Confinement System (FCS), which forms the vacuum and Tritium barrier. The FCS comprises structural components as well as the external waveguide components in the port cell. Structural components of the FCS include the flange <b>seal,</b> backend <b>frame</b> and closure plate. The external waveguide components include the isolation valve, CVD diamond windows, miter bends and straight waveguides. Because finalizing of the design of these components is directly influenced by the layout of many in-vessel components, the design work includes also further development of the entire launcher. This paper summarizes the most recent status of the design work on the structural components of the launcher FCS, which are the support flange, the socket, the closure plate and feed-throughs for waveguides and cooling pipes.

These processes are applicable to a very broad range of module types, including those made with wafer-based and thin-film solar cells. No off-the-shelf automation was available for these processes prior to this program. Spire conducted a survey of PV module manufacturers to identify current industry practices and to determine the requirements for the automated systems being developed in this program. Spire also completed detailed mechanical and electrical designs and developed software for two prototype automation systems: a module buffer storage system, designated the SPI-BUFFER 350, and an integrated module testing system, designated the SPI-MODULE QA 350. Researchers fabricated, tested, and evaluated both systems with module components from several module manufacturers. A new size simulator, th e SPI-SUN SIMULATOR 350 i, was designed with a test area that can handle most production modules without consuming excessive floor space.

40|$|Energy {{saving and}} Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in {{buildings}} are strongly affected by air leakages. Several studies {{reveal that the}} energy loss owing to leaky windows can account for up to 40 % of the total building energy demand. Furthermore, at the design stage, the possible infiltration of outdoor air through windows is not taken into account when determining the nominal outdoor airflow rate of the ventilation system. This practice may result in an oversizing of the ventilation system and consequent energy waste. Thus, the air-tightness class of a wall assembly should be assessed for each window component considering the type of material, {{the presence of the}} seal, the type of closure, the sealing and the maintenance condition.

Therefore, LLNL in collaboration with Cal Poly has designed and built a Mini High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) to recreate conditions observed during a fire and to test different materials in an effective, inexpensive, regulated and reliable method. The existing prototype was unable to achieve the ideal testing conditions of 1000 °F air at the low flow rates of 1. 25 - 12 ACFM; therefore, this project looks to optimize previous efforts on building a portable and reliable MHTTU to collect more information and perform different tests in various materials utilized {{in the construction of}} ceramic HEPA filters. Based on previous teams’ inputs, our team performed a heat transfer analysis to determine critical heat loss points and to optimize the design of the MHTTU.

40|$|International audienceGrey (Halichoerus grypus) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are {{sympatric}} seal species, {{but they}} display distinct strategies of habitat use and connectivity between haulout sites. The distribution patterns and variations in relative abundance of both species were investigated along the French {{coast of the}} English Channel, at the southern limit of their range where seal numbers are increasing. Regular censuses conducted at all main haulout sites in mainland France showed significant seasonal variations at most sites, with more harbour seals counted during summer (breeding and moulting seasons), and more grey seals during summer only in the eastern English Channel. Trends in maximum haulout numbers at haulout sites showed a significant increase {{over the last five}} years, ranging from 9. 7 to 30. 9 % per year for harbour seals, and from 5. 8 % (in the western English Channel) to 49. 2 % (in the eastern English Channel) per year for grey seals. These rates of increase in grey seal numbers are not linked to local pup production and most probably result from seal movements from the southwest British Isles and the North Sea, respectively. Aerial surveys conducted across the English Channel showed that most seal observations at sea were concentrated in the north-eastern English Channel. Telemetry showed that the 28 harbour seals tracked remained highly coastal, within a radius of 100 km from their haulout sites, and did not move to other known colonies. Grey seals moved much greater distances, reaching up to 1200 km from their capture site. More than half of the 45 grey seals tracked crossed the English Channel, especially during the breeding season, moving to known colonies in the southwest British Isles and the North Sea.
