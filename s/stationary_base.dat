60|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} consideration is transport. Nobody who has not seen for himself can realise what a great matter this is. I well recall my amazement, when watching a camel convoy more than {{a mile and a half}} long, escorted by half a battalion of infantry. I was informed that it contained only two days' supplies for one brigade. People talk lightly of moving columns hither and thither, as if they were mobile groups of men, who had only to march about the country and fight the enemy wherever found, and very few understand that an army is a ponderous mass which drags painfully after it a long chain of advanced depots, stages, rest camps, and communications, by which it is securely fastened to a <b>stationary</b> <b>base.</b> In these valleys, where wheeled traffic is impossible, the difficulties and cost of moving supplies are enormous; and as none, or very few, are to be obtained within the country, the consideration is paramount. Mule transport is for many reasons superior to camel transport. The mule moves faster and can traverse more difficult ground. He is also more hardy and keeps in better condition. When Sir Bindon Blood began his advance against the Mohmands he equipped his 2nd Brigade entirely with mules. It was thus far more mobile, and was available for any rapid movement that might become necessary. To mix the two--camels and mules--appears to combine the disadvantages of both, and destroy the superiority of either.|$|E
60|$|Lord Valleys, motoring, {{somewhat}} pathetically {{illustrated the}} invasion of institutions by their destroyer, Science. A supporter of the turf, and not long since Master of Foxhounds, most of whose soul (outside politics) was in horses, he had been, as it were, compelled by common sense, not only to tolerate, but to take up and even press forward the cause of their supplanters. His instinct of self-preservation was secretly at work, hurrying him to his own destruction; forcing him to persuade himself that science and her successive victories over brute nature could be wooed into {{the service of a}} prestige which rested on a crystallized and <b>stationary</b> <b>base.</b> All this keeping pace with the times, this immersion in the results of modern discoveries, this speeding-up of existence so that it was all surface and little root--the increasing volatility, cosmopolitanism, and even commercialism of his life, on which he rather prided himself as a man of the world--was, with a secrecy too deep for his perception, cutting at the aloofness logically demanded of one in his position. Stubborn, and not spiritually subtle, though by no means dull in practical matters, he was resolutely letting the waters bear him on, holding the tiller firmly, without perceiving {{that he was in the}} vortex of a whirlpool. Indeed, his common sense continually impelled him, against the sort of reactionaryism of which his son Miltoun had so much, to that easier reactionaryism, which, living on its spiritual capital, makes what material capital it can out of its enemy, Progress.|$|E

It is assumed {{that there are two}} substitutable products that are sold by different retailers and the demand for each product is random. Game theoretic nature of this problem is the result of substitution between products. Since retailers compete for the substitutable demand, ordering decision of each retailer depends on the ordering decision of the other retailer. Under the discounted payoff criterion, this problem is formulated as a two-person nonzero-sum stochastic game. In the case of linear ordering cost, it is shown that there exists a Nash equilibrium characterized by a pair of <b>stationary</b> <b>base</b> stock strategies for the infinite horizon problem.

40|$|The {{profile of}} a river that conveys {{sediment}} without net deposition and net erosion {{is referred to as}} ‘graded’ with respect to vertical aggradation of the river segment. Three experimental series, designed in terms of the autostratigraphic view of alluvial grade, were conducted to clarify the diagnostic spatial behaviour of graded alluvial–deltaic rivers: an ‘R series’, which utilized a moving boundary setting with a <b>stationary</b> <b>base</b> level; an ‘F series’ in a fixed boundary setting with a <b>stationary</b> <b>base</b> level to produce ‘forced grade’; and an ‘M series’ in a moving boundary setting with constant base-level fall to produce ‘autogenic grade. ’ The results of the three experimental series, combined with geometrical modelling of the effects of basin water depth and other experimental data, suggest the following: (i) in a graded alluvial–deltaic system, lateral shifting and avulsing of active distributary channels are suppressed regardless of whether the downstream boundary of the deltaic system is fixed; (ii) in a delta with a downstream-fixed boundary, the graded streams are stabilized within a valley that is incised in the axial part of the delta plain, whereby the alluvial plain outside the valley is abandoned and terraced; (iii) in moving boundary settings, the graded river simply extends basinward as a linearly elongated channel and lobe system without cutting a valley; and (iv) a modern forced-graded alluvial river is most likely to be found in a valley incised into a fan delta in front of very deep water, and the stratigraphic signal of fossil autogenic-graded rivers will be found in deltaic successions that accumulated in the outer to marginal areas of deltaic continental shelves during sea-level falls.

40|$|A {{nationwide}} interoperable {{public safety}} broadband network is being planned by the United States government. The network {{will be based}} on long term evolution (LTE) standards and use recently designated spectrum in the 700 MHz band. The public safety network has different objectives and traffic patterns than commercial wireless networks. In particular, the public safety network puts more emphasis on coverage, reliability and latency in the worst case scenario. Moreover, the routine public safety traffic is relatively light, whereas when a major incident occurs, the traffic demand at the incident scene can be significantly heavier than that in a commercial network. Hence it is prohibitively costly to build the public safety network using conventional cellular network architecture consisting of an infrastructure of <b>stationary</b> <b>base</b> transceiver stations. A novel architecture is proposed in this paper for the public safety broadband network.

40|$|Analytic {{alignment}} {{is a type}} of self-alignment for a Strapdown {{inertial navigation}} system (SINS) that is based solely on two non-collinear vectors, which are the gravity and rotational velocity vectors of the Earth at a <b>stationary</b> <b>base</b> on the ground. The attitude of the SINS with respect to the Earth can be obtained directly using the TRIAD algorithm given two vector measurements. For a traditional analytic coarse alignment, all six outputs from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) are used to compute the attitude. In this study, a novel analytic alignment method called selective alignment is presented. This method uses only three outputs of the IMU and a few properties from the remaining outputs such as the sign and the approximate value to calculate the attitude. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity of this method, and the precision of yaw is improved using the selective alignment method compared to the traditional analytic coarse alignment method in the vehicle experiment. The selective alignment principle provides an accurate relationship between the outputs and the attitude of the SINS relative to the Earth for a <b>stationary</b> <b>base,</b> and it is an extension of the TRIAD algorithm. The selective alignment approach has potential uses in applications such as self-alignment, fault detection, and self-calibration...|$|E

Correct interpretation of retention and enantiodiscrimination processes substantially facilitates the development and optimization of new enantioselective methods using cyclofructan-based chiral stationary phases. At first, the interaction mechanisms of three commercially available cyclofructan-based stationary phases were studied in normal-phase mode of liquid chromatography. Namely, systems using chiral <b>stationary</b> phases <b>based</b> on dimethylphenyl carbamate cyclofructan 7, R-naphtylethyl carbamate cyclofructan 6 and isopropyl carbamate cyclofructan 6 were studied.

The mentioned model revealed that the main interactions contributing to retention in cyclofructan-based systems are hydrogen bond acidity and dipolarity/polarizibility, while dispersion interactions cause decrease of retention. The impact of oligosaccharide skeleton of the cyclofructan selector on the enantioselectivity was elucidated by the comparison with seemingly analogous cyclodextrin-based chiral stationary phases.
