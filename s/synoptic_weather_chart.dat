50|$|Early in 1874 Edwin {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the newly instituted weather-reporting and storm-signalling section of the Marine department. Edwin, who had studied meteorology in the Royal Navy, was undoubtedly strongly influenced by the tradition of practical weather science of which Admiral Robert FitzRoy and the American, Matthew Fontaine Maury, were the most distinguished contemporary exponents. Spurred by the need for timely weather information that would enhance maritime safety, FitzRoy had begun daily forecasts from his Board of Trade office in London in 1860. By this date the forecasting of general weather patterns had become practicable. The use of reliable barometers enabled the accurate measurement of variations in air pressure - the fundamental principle {{in the assessment of}} weather changes. These measurements were taken simultaneously at widely separated stations, and by means of the electric telegraph were rapidly transmitted to a central office. There FitzRoy's <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> allowed the observations to be collated in a coherent visual form from which forecasts could be made.|$|E
40|$|Recently, it {{frequently}} occurs that extratropical cyclones over Japanese {{islands and}} its surrounding area develop unusually in Spring and Autumn. It causes natural disaster and gives the damage to human activity with heavy precipitation and strong winds. For the reason of climatology, it is because North-South movement of jet streams which affect the formation of extratropical cyclones get intense by the expansion of subtropical high and advection of cold air in these seasons. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this study is to clarify the causation of these cyclones on the basis of fluctuation of the general circulation of atmosphere. In this paper, unusually developing cyclones are defined as the central pressure deepened to less than 980 hPa, using <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency（JMA）. These cyclones are classified into three types, depending on the positions of the formation and cyclone tracks. In order to research the characteristics of the developing process respectively, upper troposphere pressure field, zonal wind field, and relative vorticity on the scale of East Asia were analyzed, using global reanalysis daily average dataset based on NCEP／NCAR. The results are summarized as follows, 1 ）According to the statistical analysis, unusually developing cyclones are more frequent recently. Especially, March is the highest in the probability where an extratropical cyclone develops unusually. 2 ）Nihon-Kai low type（N-type）has the smallest level of the deepening of a depression in three types. This type showed that a positive relative vorticity in upper troposphere（ 200 hPa）contributes to the development of cyclones. 3 ）On the other hand, low passing along the south coast of Japan type（S-type）are formed by baroclinically unstable wave of the subtropical jet stream. In this type, subtropical jet stream and polar-front jet stream converge by the ridge（around 105 °E）in the west of Japanese islands. Consequently, vortices related cyclogenesis in the lower troposphere propagated to upper troposphere with developing cyclones. 4 ）Additionally, double-cyclone type（NS-type）develops by the coupling of the Nihon-Kai low and the low passing along south coast of Japan over Japanese islands. It has the largest level of the development and the most appearance days. As for this type, subtropical jet stream flowing at the high latitude side（around 35 °N） intensified by subtropical high. Further, polar-front jet stream meanders to the vicinity of Japan（around 30 °N） influenced by the trough at 500 hPa geopotential height field, and converge with subtropical jet stream. As a result, the lower tropospheric vortices with the low passing along south coast of Japan couple it with the upper tropospheric vortices with the Nihon-Kai low, and such a structure had an impact on developing cyclones unusually...|$|E

Using an X-band vertically pointing radar data at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway and <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts,</b> the radar echo characteristics are investigated for one year between April 1994 and March 1995. Radar echoes have distinct seasonal variations with respect to height. Taking account of synoptic conditions, each series of radar echoes is classified into four patterns and {{it is found that}} they have strong seasonal variations. The low pressure system echo patterns appear throughout the year; their appearance frequencies exceed 50 of all radar echo appearances and increase in early summer and early winter. The appearance frequencies of low pressure systems over the Norwegian Sea have also characteristic strong seasonal variations. These low pressure activities appear to be related to precipitation behavior at Ny-Alesund and vapor transportation to the high Arctic from lower latitudes...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{telegraph}} it was possible to simultaneously collect data, such as surface temperature and sea-level pressure, to draw <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> With Charles Todd's appointment as Postmaster General to the Colony, he trained not only his telegraph operators, but also his postmasters as weather observers. These observers provided valuable data points that, in combination with telegraphed observations from the other colonies (including New Zealand), showed the development and progress of weather activity across {{a large part of the}} Southern Hemisphere. Todd's best known feat was his construction management of the Overland Telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This line of communication was critical to his capacity to create continent-wide synoptic charts as the telegraphic observations from the Outback enabled the connection of data points on the east coast of Australia with similar data points on the west and southern coasts. These continent-scale isobaric lines allowed Todd and his staff to draw synoptic charts that in the early 1880s had a greater breadth than any (known) synoptic charts drawn elsewhere in the world.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} characteristics of seasonal changes of air temperature in Svalbard. The daily-mean air temperature varied little from May to August. In this season, the daily-mean temperature exceeded zero degrees. Considerable heat {{was used for}} melting of ice. In addition, {{the air in the}} lower troposphere should mix easily due to the absence of an inversion. In Svalbard, the lowest variability of summer temperature in the Arctic can be observed. In contrast to summer, the highest variability of air temperature in the Arctic occurs in winter in Svalbard. A warming of air temperature occurs in winter in many years. This warm spell is called a "warm core". An automatic weather station at Ny-Alesund observed the warming of air temperature in January 1992. <b>Synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> show that advection of warm air from south occurred over Svalbard. The duration and intensity of the warm core are considered to be important factors for the high variability in winter temperature.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a case of}} {{extremely}} high sea levels, which were recorded in the Bakar Bay on 31 January/ 1 February 1986, has been analyzed. The comparison of residual sea levels with <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> and time series of both atmospheric pressure and wind over the Adriatic Sea has shown that cyclones induced two disturbances which were constructively superimposed and therefore caused extremely high sea levels. After a front passed by, the wind suddenly decreased in strength causing free oscillations (seiches) which persisted for approximately ten days. It {{has been shown that}} the influence of atmospheric pressure on the sea can well be represented by the inverted barometer effect. In order to simulate the wind effect, one-dimension hydrodynamical numerical model has been developed. It was found that the model gives good results when land-based wind data are transformed into offshore data according to empirical relation published by S. A. Hsu in 1986. Moreover, it turned out that very good agreement between the observed and predicted levels can be obtained by using the value of 5 × 10 - 4 m s- 1 for bottom friction coefficient, which equals the lower limit of values cited in the literature for the Adriatic area...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Micropulse lidar (MPL) is a {{ground-based}} optical {{remote sensing system}} designed to determine the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere. An MPL has operated at Barrow, Alaska since November 2002. From these data, we seek to determine the altitude of aerosol layers in the free troposphere from lidar backscatter profiles. Layer heights are then fed into the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model) model, a back-trajectory model developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to compute isentropic back-trajectories. The model is run interactively using the READY interface and can calculate trajectories from multiple heights within a layer. Case analyses are done correlating dates and trajectory coordinates, <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> and events reported from satellites and other remote sensing instruments to determine aerosol sources (e. g. forest fire, volcano eruption or dust storm). All the aerosol events detected by the MPL were categorized into five common atmospheric flow patterns identified from the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) / NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis charts.

The optical depth (OD), base and top altitude, the color index and the depolarization of clouds are determined from lidar backscatter profiles at 532 nm and 355 nm. Temperature and humidity {{is provided by}} radiosondes. Cirrus and contrails are distinguished {{with the help of}} sky images that are taken along with the lidar measurements. Measurements with this type of instrumentations have been performed in Lindenberg/German (52. 2 °N, 14. 1 °E) from May to October 2003. During the exceptionally warm and dry summer of that year a high occurrence of thin and subvisual cirrus clouds have been detected. During about 50 % of all "clear sky conditions" (e. g. no clouds with optical depth > 1 are present) thin clouds prevail in the upper troposphere, half of which are subvisual. Episodes with high occurrence of persisting contrails are investigated in detail. During most / all of theses episodes thin cirrus prevail near the tropopause [...] Most often contrails occur within the persisting cirrus. Isolated contrails seem to be the exception. According to the available radiosonde humidity measurements the atmosphere is saturated but not strongly supersaturated with respect to ice in this region.

40|$|Images {{from the}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) {{satellite}} {{have been used}} to investigate the meteorological and climate induced variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in the North Sea. The meteorology has been characterized by the 11 weather types deduced from a refined system of Lamb’s classification of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> Climatological effects have been related to the North Atlantic Oscillation index. The surface SPM concentration maps from MODIS have been ensemble averaged according to these weather types or climatological conditions. The data show that each type has a distinct distribution of surface SPM concentration in the North Sea. The differences are explained by different hydrodynamic and wave conditions. The occurrence of storms will impact the shallow regions by increasing the resuspension of bottom material. Prevailing winds will, on the other hand, change the residual transport of SPM in the North Sea. The more protected Southern Bight exhibits relatively stronger influences of advection, whereas in the central North Sea and the German Bight resuspension is more pronounced. This patterns result in an alternation of relatively high SPM concentration in the Southern Bight and {{in the rest of the}} southern North Sea during certain weather conditions. Limitations in satellite images have been assigned to stratification effects due to the occurrence of highly concentrated mud suspensions during certain weather types. The approach provides a tool to improve our understanding of coastal and shelf sea processes, especially with respect to variations of SPM concentration distribution according to weather, climate and climate change...|$|R
50|$|The ancient mariners of the South Seas who {{roamed the}} {{tropical}} Pacific {{before the arrival}} of the Europeans, knew of and feared the hurricanes of the South Pacific. They were keen and accurate observers of nature with traditional myths and legends, reflecting their knowledge of these systems. On his voyages around the Pacific, it is thought that Captain James Cook, did not collect any information about cyclones in the Pacific. The European whalers, traders and missionaries that followed Cook soon realised that the South Pacific, was not free of hurricanes and were the first to publish accounts about the systems. During 1853, Thomas Dobson subsequently became the first person to collect information about these systems, in order to attempt to understand and explain the characteristics of 24 tropical cyclones. However, these descriptions were vague and were of little value, because he only had a small amount of data and no <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> Over the next 40 years various reports, journals and log books on the storms were published, before E Knipping consolidated these reports and extended Dobson's list out to 120 tropical cyclones during 1893. During the 1920s Stephen Sargent Visher did some research into tropical cyclones in the Pacific and visited several island nations; including Fiji, Japan and the Philippines to obtain information on potential systems. He also consulted various journals and reports as well as Dobson's and Knipping's work, before he authored a number of papers on tropical cyclones in the Pacific. These papers contained information about 259 tropical storms in the South Pacific between 160°E and 140°W, two of which occurred during 1789 and 1819, while the rest occurred between 1830 and 1923. Visher also tried to estimate how many systems were occurring on an annual basis in each area, but over compensated for his incomplete records {{and came up with a}} figure of 12 severe tropical cyclones per year.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that outbreaks of bluetongue (BT) and African horse sickness (AHS) might occur via long-distance wind dispersion (LDWD) of their insect vector (Culicoides spp.) was proposed by R. F. Sellers {{in a series}} of papers published between 1977 and 1991. These investigated the role of LDWD by means of visual examination of the wind direction of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> Based on the hypothesis that simple wind direction analysis, which does not allow for wind speed, might have led to spurious conclusions, we reanalyzed six of the outbreak scenarios described in Sellers’ papers. For this reanalysis, we used a custom-built Big Data application (“TAPPAS”) which couples a user-friendly web-interface with an established atmospheric dispersal model (“HYSPLIT”), thus enabling more sophisticated modeling than was possible when Sellers undertook his analyzes. For the two AHS outbreaks, there was strong support from our reanalysis of the role of LDWD for that in Spain (1966), and to a lesser degree, for the outbreak in Cyprus (1960). However, for the BT outbreaks, the reassessments were more complex, and for one of these (western Turkey, 1977) we could discount LDWD as the means of direct introduction of the virus. By contrast, while the outbreak in Cyprus (1977) showed LDWD was a possible means of introduction, there is an apparent inconsistency in that the outbreaks were localized while the dispersion events covered much of the island. For Portugal (1956), LDWD from Morocco on the dates suggested by Sellers is very unlikely to have been the pathway for introduction, and for the detection of serotype 2 in Florida (1982), LDWD from Cuba would require an assumption of a lengthy survival time of the midges in the air column. Except for western Turkey, the BT reanalyses show the limitation of LDWD modeling when used by itself, and indicates the need to integrate susceptible host population distribution (and other covariate) data into the modeling process. A further refinement, which will become increasingly important to assess LDWD, will be the use of virus and vector genome sequence data collected from potential source and the incursion sites...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that daily pollutant transport patterns in East Asia are visible from satellite images when inspected with corresponding <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> analyses. Transport pathways of air pollutants in East Asia are investigated using satellite observations, surface <b>weather</b> <b>charts,</b> and chemical-transport model simulations. It is found that during cool season (fall to spring), pollutant transports in East Asia are largely determined by <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns {{associated with high}} pressure system over southern China, which is extended from the Siberia High, and low pressure system over Manchuria, which is initiated by Altai-Sayan cyclogenesis. Based on the relative location and strength of these weather systems, three types of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns that may contribute to pollutants transport in East Asia, especially in China and Korea, are identified: i. e., (1) a strengthening of the Siberian High and its southeastward propagation; (2) a high-pressure system over southern China followed by a frontal passage associated with a northern low-pressure system; and (3) a stagnant high-pressure system over southern China. For all three patterns, the high-pressure system in southern China {{is essential for the}} development of regional air pollution, while frontal activities associated with low-pressure system provide a forcing mechanism to transport those pollutants eastward or southeastward. Observed and simulated surface PM distributions show good agreement in both aerosol optical depth and NO 2 column density further implying that anthropogenic emissions also contribute to regional events of high surface PM concentrations. It is argued that the quasi-periodic migration of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> systems in East Asia works as an efficient pump of pollutants; i. e., regional air pollutions developed under high-pressure systems are transported downstream by low-pressure systems...|$|R

The seasonal contribution of each <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> type to the aerosol concentration was deduced from the aerosol annual cycles while the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence was estimated by means of the diurnal cycles. Since aerosols are scavenged by precipitation, the diurnal cycle of the CO concentration was also used to identify polluted air masses.

Main {{characteristics of the}} seasonal and yearly variations both in the antarctic troposphere and the stratosphere are investigated by means of these limited data. Four vertical time sections (from the surface to 30 mb) of Feb. May. Aug. Oct. -Nov., representing each season respectively, are made based on these data, and some notable features of seasonal circulation patterns in 1961 over the Syowa Base are briefly described. In addition, in supplementing this single station data analysis, IAAC 2 ̆ 7 s <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> in microfilm are used to locate relative pressure systems, {{and at the same}} time, for rough estimation of circulation intensity, meridional temperature gradients between the Syowa Base and Marion Island in the middle latitude, together with difference in their annual variations, are utilized. Characteristics of the seasonal circulations in 1961 are summarized as follows : Summer : In the troposphere, weak anticyclonic systems predominate over the east continent and weak circulations of E-ly with slightly N and S components are seen. However, in the location and movement of these systems, W-ly wind circulation is also seen. Cyclonic activities are such that most of lows move on toward the east within the low pressure belt off the base, and, except at the surface, N or NE-ly winds by these systems are very weak in the upper layer, so there was little influence to the air over the base. For the layer from the lower to middle stratosphere, weak W-ly wind generally prevails but variation of the wind direction is also seen upon appearance of anabatic and katabatic fields. In the upper stratosphere, weak E-ly wind with N component can be seen. Autumn : For the layer from the middle troposphere to the lower stratosphere, S or SW-ly strong jets come to be observed due to the sharp southward extension of the middle latitude ridge which brings about a temperature rise in the air over the base. At the same time, in the lower layer near the surface, a shallow cold film of the polar anticyclone is formed and weak surface inversion develops up to about 500 m; subsequently weak anticyclonic circulation at the surface is maintained. On the other hand, cyclonic activities are intensified from the middle autumn and replacement of the air masses becomes more active. In case a moderate cyclone approaches, a strong NE-ly wind circulation is observed throughout the troposphere. In the upper stratosphere, with advancement of cooling process, a strong W-ly jet predominates following the formation of the polar vortex. Winter : Near the surface, weak SE-ly circulation predominates due to the control of the polar cold anticyclone with moderate surface inversion. In the polar night period, weak circulation of nearly E-ly wind prevails generally for the most part of the troposphere, but even in this period, the base region is attacked by an intensive cyclone of winter. Cyclone activities with strong NE-ly wind are further intensified especially in early and late winter. In some cases this NE-ly wind may persist for several days afterward, with a gradual decrease in its speed only, due to stagnation and filling of the low in the north of the base. There is also found a much more intensified influence of sharp ridge extension southward from the middle latitude anticyclone than autumn, and stronger SW-ly with circulation with a temperature rise is observed. Such an alternative appearance of the NE-ly and SW-ly wind circulation verifies that the antarctic atmosphere is markedly baroclinic in winter time. In the stratosphere, as the polar night cold vortex {{is in the midst of}} maximum development, strong W-ly jet more than 100 knots prevails continuously. Spring : Rapid spring-time stratospheric warming which begins with the uppermost layer is found for the period from late October to early November, followed by weakening of the circulation. The NE-ly wind by various-scaled cyclonic turbulence of short period nature is seen in the troposphere. On the other hand, strong SW-ly wind caused by the pressure pattern similar to those in autumn and winter also appears in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. Active replacement of the air masses takes place throughout the whole atmosphere, which is in process of a rapid transition into summer season...|$|R

In particular, this study demonstrates that CP 2 is a promising tool for the purpose of weather typing with a two-fold utility: CP 2 can perform data projection (neighbourhood width > = 1) and provide a flexible means for visualising the broad distribution of the daily weather patterns in the dataset; and the procedure can also conduct cluster analysis (neighbourhood width = 0) and produce results equ ivalent to those from CP 1. It was found that performing data clustering or data projection may affect the inference associated with type frequencies. While focusing on methodology, the analysis has also shown that the frequency of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> types fluctuates on the seasonal, interannual, and decadal scales. From the 1970 s to 1995 there was a decline in the occurrence of a few weather types associated with an east-coast trough extending over New South Wales from the north, and a slight increase in the activity of some anticyclonic types. Significant correlations were also identified between SOI and frequencies of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> types on the annual and seasonal timescales. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{data from}} four sites were {{stratified}} {{and found to}} naturally fit into a few unique groups. These were compared with <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns using the Booz-Allen classification system. Strong relationships became evident between a particular synoptic type and wind events for each site. Statistics indicate certain patterns which result in strong winds and some that result in weak winds. For each site there is a preferred wind direction associated with the strongest speed. Important relationships were also found comparing 850 -mb and surface wind. Additionally, comparisons between pressure gradient and wind speed for a given gradient direction show some significant relationships. It can be stated that the overall results show what by using existing data for any site, the winds can be characterized and correlated with <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns. As a result, reliable wind forecasts {{can be made for}} utility companies for the purpose of power generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{scheme and}} meteorological {{applications of the}} GEMPAK data analysis and display software system developed by NASA are described. The program was devised to permit objective, versatile, and practical analysis of satellite meteorological data using a minicomputer and a display system with graphics capability. A data area can be selected within the data file for the globe, and data-sparse regions can be avoided. Distances between observations and the nearest observation points are calculated {{in order to avoid}} errors when determining <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. The Barnes (1973) successive correction method is employed to restore the amplitude of small yet resolvable wavelengths suppressed in an initial filtering pass. The rms deviation is then calculated in relation to available measured data. Examples are provided of treatment of VISSR data from the GOES satellite and a study of the impact of incorrect cloud height data on <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> field analysis...|$|R
