5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E

40|$|Mainstream women’s and men’s {{lifestyle}} {{magazines are}} widely read and contain {{large amounts of}} sexual content, giving them great potential to influence <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes in emerging adulthood. However, previous media effects research has failed to examine magazine reading or involvement, to consider a variety of <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes, and to investigate pathways through which influence on outcomes may occur. This dissertation addresses these gaps by exploring associations between magazine reading and involvement {{and a variety of}} <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes using the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and multiple research methods. Study 1 used structural equation modeling to assess TPB mediators of the connections between magazine use and <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> intentions among first-year college students (N= 457, 61. 9 % female). Models showed a variety of positive associations between magazine reading and <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes, particularly for men who had never engaged in intercourse. Associations between magazine involvement and outcomes were mixed. Study 2 assessed connections between magazine use and <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes longitudinally. A subsample of Study 1 participants (N= 175, 65. 1 % female) provided additional data 4 months later, and we assessed how magazine use at Wave 1 related to TPB constructs at Wave 2. Cross-lagged models showed women’s earlier magazine reading was frequently related to their later <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes. Finally, Study 3 examined experimental effects of exposure to <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> content from women’s magazines on <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes among college women (N= 95). This study demonstrated the ability of brief exposure to magazine content to improve <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> attitudes and intentions. These effects were often stronger for women who had never engaged in intercourse. These studies for the first time address the potential impact of magazine reading on <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> outcomes using the framework of TPB, showing that magazine reading may contribute to positive outcomes in the arenas of condom use, <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> discussion, and HIV/STI testing. Mainstream magazines’ popularity with young people makes them a powerful vehicle through which to share sexual health information and promote <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> behavior.

25|$|The most {{effective}} way of preventing STIs is by not having sex.

Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections. Most STIs are treatable or curable.

25|$|Anal sex can expose its {{participants}} to two principal dangers: infections {{due to the}} high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility. Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as barebacking, carries a higher risk of passing on sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs) because the anal sphincter is a delicate, easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens. The high concentration of white blood cells around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the colon's function to absorb fluid, are what place those who engage in anal sex at high risk of STIs. Use of condoms, ample lubrication {{to reduce the risk of}} tearing, and <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> practices in general, reduce the risk of STI transmission. However, a condom can break or otherwise come off during anal sex, and this is more likely to happen with anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> {{is used by}} {{individuals}} to refer to protection against both pregnancy and HIV/AIDS or other STI transmissions, the term was born {{in response to the}} HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is believed that the term of <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> was used in the professional literature in 1984, in the content of a paper on the psychological effect that HIV/AIDS may have on homosexual men. The term was related with the need to develop educational programs for the group considered at risk, homosexual men. A year later, the same term appeared in an article in The New York Times. This article emphasized that most specialists advised their AIDS patients to practice <b>safe</b> <b>sex.</b> The concept included limiting the number of sexual partners, using prophylactics, avoiding bodily fluid exchange, and resisting the use of drugs that reduced inhibitions for high-risk sexual behavior. Moreover, in 1985, the first <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> guidelines were established by the 'Coalition for Sexual Responsibilities'. According to these guidelines, <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> was practiced by using condoms also when engaging in anal or oral sex.|$|R

25|$|Like {{any sexual}} contact, extramarital sex opens the {{possibility}} of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives, STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a public health issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriersto openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited. The World Health Organisation (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of HIV/AIDS, because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if they thought they have been infected.|$|E
25|$|In 1996–97, {{following}} {{the success of}} prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan. These projects showed the feasibility of such programmes, which included condom use to control the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers, and have been officially promoted since 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, the World AIDS Foundation supported a five-site trial of a behavioral intervention in commercial sex workers who worked in entertainment establishments. The intervention included condom promotion, establishment of clinics for sexually transmitted diseases to provide check-ups, and outreach for health education and counseling. HIV-related knowledge improved substantially, {{and the rate of}} bacterial sexually transmitted diseases fell. The rate of condom use at last intercourse increased from around 55% to 68%, and fewer commercial sex workers agreed to sex without a condom when requested by a client who offered more money.
