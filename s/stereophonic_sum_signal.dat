30|$|In this section, {{the focus}} is on testing whether resynthesis of the various spot signals from a downmix <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> is a viable scenario. This is {{important}} in cases when spot signals do not contain common content, which is often the case in studio recordings. As in the previous section, we are again interested to test the amount of crosstalk that is introduced, and whether there are implications regarding the quality of the resynthesized signals. It is expected that it will be more difficult to resynthesize good-quality spot <b>signals</b> from the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> compared to the reference signal that was used in the previous section since the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> will contain frequency components which were not at all present in some spot signals. Also, crosstalk will be more audible in separate track recordings.|$|R
30|$|The {{instrument}} that is referred {{first in the}} above list is the {{instrument that}} we wanted to resynthesize from the <b>sum</b> <b>signal.</b> In the ABX test, each listener was presented with the original two instrument recordings that were used to obtain the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> as signals A and B (in random order), as well as the resynthesized signal (Signal X), and was asked to associate X with A or B depending on which instrument prevails in the recording. In the DCR tests, each listener was asked to grade the resynthesized signal compared to the original recording {{that we wanted to}} obtain (regardless to whether the listener recognized that this was indeed successful in the ABX test).

40|$|In this contribution, {{we propose}} the {{application}} of a novel concept for a flexible hierarchical stereo extension of existing monaural speech and audio codecs. The concept is based on inter-channel linear prediction of the left and right channels from a <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> and allows for a very flexible extension of existing speech and audio codecs. In contrast to theoretical examinations in earlier publications, a stereo codec is built in this contribution by combining the new stereo framing with the core transmission of the standardized Adaptive Multi Rate- WideBand codec (AMR-WB) in a hierarchical manner. The proposed modification introduces just marginal additional system delay compared to mono AMR-WB. It will be shown by simulations that compared to an individual transmission of left and right channel, {{the application of}} the inter-channel linear prediction concept achieves an identical quality at a significantly lower data rate for an important class of stereo signals. This is due to a concentration of most of the signal energy in the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> and the filter coefficients while the prediction error is of lesser impor-tance for the quality. This will be shown by gradually decreasing the transmission data rate for the prediction error to the point of a purely parametric solution where only the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> and the filter coefficients are transmitted. ...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{example of}} both {{backward}} and forward compatibility {{is the introduction}} FM radio in stereo. FM radio was initially mono, with only one audio channel represented by one signal. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, {{a large number of}} listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> to left and right channels if both <b>sum</b> and difference <b>signals</b> are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.|$|R
40|$|A low-noise head {{amplifier}} {{has been developed}} for the extra low energy antiproton ring beam trajectory, orbit, and intensity measurement system at CERN. This system is based on 24 double-electrode electrostatic beam position monitors installed around the ring. A {{head amplifier}} is placed close to each beam position monitor to amplify the electrode signals and generate a difference and a <b>sum</b> <b>signal.</b> These signals are sent to the digital acquisition system, about 50 m away from the ring, where they are digitized and further processed. The beam position can be measured by dividing the difference <b>signal</b> by the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> while the <b>sum</b> <b>signal</b> gives information relative to the beam intensity. The head amplifier consists of two discrete charge preamplifiers with {{junction field effect transistor}} (JFET) inputs, a sum and a difference stage, and two cable drivers.

40|$|AC bridge {{techniques}} {{commonly used}} for precision impedance measurements have been adapted {{to develop an}} eddy current sensor for rail defect detection. By using two detection coils instead of just one as in a conventional sensor, we can balance out the large baseline signals corresponding to a normal rail. We have significantly enhanced the detection sensitivity of the eddy current method by detecting and demodulating the differential signal of the two coils induced by rail defects, using a digital lock-in amplifier algorithm. We have also explored compensating for the lift-off effect of the eddy current sensor due to vibrations by using the <b>summing</b> <b>signal</b> of the detection coils to measure the lift-off distance. The dominant component of the <b>summing</b> <b>signal</b> is a constant resulting from direct coupling from the excitation coil, which can be experimentally determined. The remainder of the <b>summing</b> <b>signal,</b> which decreases as the lift-off distance increases, is induced by the secondary eddy current. This dependence on the lift-off distance is used to calibrate the differential signal, allowing for a more accurate characterization of the defects. Simulated experiments on a sample rail have been performed using a computer controlled X-Y moving table with the X-axis mimicking the train’s motion and the Y-axis mimicking the train’s vibrational bumping. Experimental results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} new detection method. Key words: AC bridges; demodulation; digital lock-in amplifier; Eddy current rail inspection...|$|R

Working with a <b>summed</b> <b>signal</b> from all the BPPM electrodes provides {{a good way to}} measure accurately the beam phase.
