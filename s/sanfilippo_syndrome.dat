25|$|MPS III, <b>Sanfilippo</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{is marked}} by severe {{neurological}} symptoms. These include progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, some deafness and loss of vision, and an inability to sleep {{for more than a}} few hours at a time. This disorder tends to have three main stages. During the first stage, early mental and motor skill development may be somewhat delayed. Affected children show a marked decline in learning between ages 2 and 6, followed by eventual loss of language skills and loss of some or all hearing. Some children may never learn to speak. In the syndrome's second stage, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, profound dementia, and irregular sleep may make children difficult to manage, particularly those who retain normal physical strength. In the syndrome's last stage, children become increasingly unsteady on their feet and most are unable to walk by age 10.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sanfilippo</b> A <b>syndrome,</b> {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} type IIIA, {{is caused}} by a deficiency of heparan sulphamidase activity, and usually presents in childhood with neurodegeneration leading to death in teenage years. Visceral symptoms are limited to coarsening and diarrhea. We now describe an adult patient who presented with cardiomyopathy. At age 45 years she had hypertension, and the next year she developed a progressively worsening cardiomyopathy with prominent apical hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation. At age 53, she had severe concentric hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy in both ventricles. There was no coarsening of features. Neurologic function, skeleton, cornea, liver, and spleen were normal. Percutaneous endomyocardial biopsy showed ballooned cardiomyocytes with storage vacuoles, containing acid mucopolysaccharides. Leucocytes, uterus, and brain biopsy did not show this storage material. There was a slight increase in total urine mucopolysaccharides, with an increased proportion of heparan sulfates. Heparan sulphamidase activity was deficient in leukocytes and heparan sulphamidase protein and activity were reduced in cultured fibroblasts. No mutations were identified after sequencing of the heparan sulphamidase gene at the cDNA and the genomic level.

40|$|Several animal {{models have}} been {{developed}} for the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by lysosomal hydrolase deficiencies that disrupt the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Among the MPS, the MPS-III (<b>Sanfilippo)</b> <b>syndromes</b> lacked an animal counterpart until recently. In this investigation of caprine MPS-IIID, the clinical, biochemical, morphological, and immunohistochemical studies revealed severe and mild phenotypes like those observed in human MPS III syndromes. Both forms of caprine MPS HID result from a nonsense mutation and consequent deficiency of lysosomal N-acetylglucosamine 6 -sulfatase (G 6 S) activity and are associated with tissue storage and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate (HS). Using special stains, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, secondary lysosomes filled with GAG were identified in most tissues from affected goats. Primary neuronal accumulation of HS and the secondary storage of gangliosides were observed in the central nervous system (CNS) of these animals. In addition, morphological changes in the CNS such as neuritic expansions and other neuronal alterations that may have functional significance were also seen. The spectrum of lesions was greater in the severe form of caprine MPS HID and included mild cartilaginous, bony, and corneal lesions. The more pronounced neurological deficits in the severe form were partly related to a greater extent of CNS dysmyelination. These findings demonstrate that caprine MPS HID is a suitable animal model for the investigation of therapeutic strategies for MPS III syndromes. Margaret Z. Jones, Joseph Alroy, Philip J.

Patients are characterised by severe central nervous systems degeneration together with mild somatic involvement; this disproportionate correlation is unique amongst the mucopolysaccharidoses. Features include severe behavioural disturbances, such as hyperactivity and aggressiveness, coarse hair and mild hepatosplenomegaly. Death is usually in the mid- to late-teenage years. Enzyme replacement therapy by intravenous administration of recombinant human NS (rhNS) has been proposed as a potential therapy for MPS IIIA.

The disorder {{is caused by}} a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme sulphamidase which is a requisite for the degradation of heparan sulphate. To facilitate the development of enzyme-replacement strategies for MPS IIIA patients, we have constructed a high-level expression system for recombinant human sulphamidase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. An expression construct containing a methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene allowed amplification of expression levels from less than 1 mg of sulphamidase per litre of culture medium to approx. 15 mg/l. Unlike many cell lines made by gene amplification in DHFR-deficient CHO cells, and utilizing the normal DHFR gene, these cell lines appeared to be stable in the absence of selective pressure. Recombinant human sulphamidase was purified from unamplified and amplified cell lines. The native enzyme was found to be a dimer of 115 kDa.

First clinical signs were usually noted between 1 and 6 years (mean 3. 5 years), and consisted of delayed psychomotor development and behavioral problems. Other symptoms included sleeping and hearing problems, recurrent infections, diarrhoea and epilepsy. Two sisters had attenuated disease and did not have symptoms until the third decade. Mean age of death was 34 years (range 25 - 48). Molecular analysis revealed mutations in both alleles for all patients except one.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (<b>Sanfilippo</b> A <b>syndrome),</b> a fatal childhood-onset {{neurodegenerative}} disease with mild facial, visceral and skeletal abnormalities, {{is caused by}} an inherited deficiency of the enzyme N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH; sulfamidase). More than 100 mutations in the SGSH gene {{have been found to}} reduce or eliminate its enzymatic activity. However, the molecular understanding of the effect of these mutations has been confined by a lack of structural data for this enzyme. Here, the crystal structure of glycosylated SGSH is presented at 2 Å resolution. Despite the low sequence identity between this unique N-sulfatase and the group of O-sulfatases, they share a similar overall fold and active-site architecture, including a catalytic formylglycine, a divalent metal-binding site and a sulfate-binding site. However, a highly conserved lysine in O-sulfatases is replaced in SGSH by an arginine (Arg 282) that is positioned to bind the N-linked sulfate substrate. The structure also provides insight into the diverse effects of pathogenic mutations on SGSH function in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA and convincing evidence for the molecular consequences of many missense mutations. Further, the molecular characterization of SGSH mutations will lay the groundwork for the development of structure-based drug design for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. © 2014 International Union of Crystallography.
