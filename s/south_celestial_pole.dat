5|$|Located at the {{northern}} edge of the constellation and just southwest of Achernar is Alpha Hydri, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times as wide as our sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and Beta Centauri is bisected by the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star to the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times {{the diameter of}} our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{north and}} <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> {{are the two}} {{imaginary}} points in the sky where the Earth's axis of rotation, indefinitely extended, intersects the celestial sphere. The north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> appear permanently directly overhead to an observer at the Earth's North Pole and South Pole, respectively. As the Earth spins on its axis, the two <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> remain fixed in the sky, and all other points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly per sidereal day).|$|R

50|$|The <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> {{are also}} the <b>poles</b> of the <b>celestial</b> {{equatorial}} coordinate system, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and &minus;90 degrees (for the north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> respectively).|$|R
25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to find the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and the nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude 5.5 is barely {{visible to the naked eye}} even under ideal conditions. That will change from the 80th to the 90th centuries, however, when the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> travels through the False Cross.|$|E
25|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the altitude of the north or <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> are circumpolar. Stars on the celestial equator are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Sigma Octantis, the {{southern}} pole star, is a magnitude5.4 star just over 1degree {{away from the}} true <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole.</b> Its relative faintness means {{that it is not}} practical for navigation. Conveniently for navigators, there are other, much easier methods for locating {{the southern}} celestial pole.|$|E
5000|$|As on Earth, {{the effect}} of {{precession}} causes the north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> to move in a very large circle, but on Mars the cycle is 175,000 Earth years ...|$|R
50|$|For {{satellites}} {{orbiting the}} earth it is normal {{to use the}} Equatorial coordinate system. The projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere is called the celestial equator. Similarly, the projections of the Earth's north and south geographic poles become the north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|Astronomy {{provides}} {{a method for}} finding direction at night. All the stars appear to lie on the imaginary Celestial sphere. Because of {{the rotation of the}} Earth, the Celestial Sphere appears to rotate around an axis passing through the North and South poles of the Earth. This axis intersects the Celestial Sphere at the North and <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> which appear to the observer to lie directly above due North and South respectively on the horizon.|$|R
25|$|For example, the {{constellation}} Crux, the Southern Cross, currently points toward the <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole,</b> if one draws {{a line from}} Gamma Crucis to Alpha Crucis. Another method includes an asterism made up of Sigma, Chi, Tau, and Upsilon Octantis, which form a distinctive trapezoid shape.|$|E
25|$|As one travels {{south of}} the Equator, the {{opposite}} happens. The <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> appears increasingly high in the sky, and all the stars lying within an increasingly large circle centered on that pole become circumpolar about it. This continues until one reaches the Earth's South Pole where, once again, all visible stars are circumpolar.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{constellation}} is circumpolar to the <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole,</b> {{it can be}} seen throughout the entire Southern Hemisphere at any given time of the year. The Right Ascension and months of best visibility given are for the three brightest stars, (Nu, Beta, and Delta) which are at their highest point in the sky during October and early November.|$|E
50|$|These {{concepts}} {{are important for}} understanding celestial coordinate systems - frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth's equator, axis, and the Earth's orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the celestial equator, the north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> and the ecliptic, respectively. As the celestial sphere is considered infinite in radius, all observers see the <b>celestial</b> equator, <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> and ecliptic {{at the same place}} against the background stars.|$|R
25|$|This house {{system was}} {{described}} by the English astrologer Charles E. O. Carter (1887-1968) in his Essays on the Foundations of Astrology. The house division starts at the right ascension of the ascendant and to it is added 30º of right ascension for each successive cusp. Those cusps are then restated in terms of celestial longitude by projecting them along great circles containing the North and <b>South</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles.</b> The 1st house cusp coincides with the ascendant's longitude, but the 10th house cusp is not identical with the Midheaven.|$|R

25|$|This {{situation}} also is {{seen on a}} star map. The {{orientation of}} the south pole is moving toward the Southern Cross constellation. For the last 2,000 years or so, the Southern Cross has pointed to the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, {{as it was in}} the time of the ancient Greeks.|$|E
25|$|Lacaille {{labelled}} eleven {{stars with}} Bayer designations Alpha through to Lambda (excluding Kappa). Gould later added Kappa, Mu, Nu, Xi and Pi Mensae. Stars as dim as {{these were not}} generally given designations; however, Gould felt their closeness to the <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole</b> warranted naming. Overall, there are 22 stars within the constellation's borders brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude 6.5.|$|E
25|$|Another {{early modern}} {{description}} clearly describing Crux {{as a separate}} constellation is attributed to Andreas Corsali, an Italian navigator who from 1515 to 1517 sailed to China and the East Indies in an expedition sponsored by King Manuel I. In 1516, Corsali {{wrote a letter to}} the monarch describing his observations of the southern sky, which included a rather crude map of the stars around the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> including the Southern Cross and the two Magellanic Clouds seen in an external orientation, as on a globe.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{equatorial}} {{coordinate system}} using spherical coordinates. The fundamental plane is formed by projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator (blue). The primary direction is established by projecting Earth's orbit onto the celestial sphere, forming the ecliptic (red), {{and setting up}} the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator, forming the vernal equinox. Right ascension is measured eastward along the celestial equator from the equinox, and declination is measured positive northward from the celestial equator. (Two such coordinate pairs are shown here.) Projections of the Earth's north and south geographic poles form the north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Polophylax (Greek: {{guardian}} of the <b>celestial</b> <b>south</b> <b>pole)</b> was a southern constellation that lay where Tucana and Grus now are.|$|R
50|$|Around 200 BCE, {{the star}} Beta Hydri was the nearest bright star to the <b>Celestial</b> <b>south</b> <b>pole.</b> Around 2800 BCE, Achernar was only 8 {{degrees from the}} south pole.|$|R
25|$|Mensa {{is a small}} {{constellation}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere {{near the}} <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> one of twelve constellations drawn up in the 18thcentury by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for table, though it originally depicted Table Mountain and was known as Mons Mensae. One of the 88 modern constellations, it covers a keystone-shaped wedge of sky stretching from approximately 4h to 7.5h of right ascension, and 71 to 85.5 degrees of declination. Other than the south polar constellation of Octans, {{it is the most}} southerly of constellations. As a result, it is essentially unobservable from the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} list {{began to develop}} with Greco-Roman astronomer Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria (c. 100 – c. 170), whose list of 48 constellations was accepted as standard in Europe for 1,800 years. As constellations {{were considered to be}} composed only of the stars that constituted the figure, it was always possible to use any leftover stars to create and squeeze in a new grouping among the established constellations. Furthermore, exploration by Europeans {{to other parts of the}} globe exposed them to stars unknown to ancient Mediterraneans. Two astronomers particularly known for expanding on Ptolemy's catalog were Johann Bayer (1572–1625) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762). Bayer listed a dozen figures that had been suggested since Ptolemy's day; Lacaille created new groups, mostly for the area near the <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole.</b> Many of their proposed constellations have been accepted, with the rest remaining as asterisms. In 1930, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) divided the sky into 88 official constellations surrounding recognized asterisms, with precise geometric boundaries that encompass all of the stars within them. Any grouping – whether it has an area of the sky identified by it or not – is an asterism.|$|E
500|$|Of {{apparent}} magnitude 5.11, the yellow bright giant Kappa Trianguli Australis of spectral type G5IIa lies around [...] {{distant from the}} Solar System. Eta Trianguli Australis (or Eta1 Trianguli Australis) is a Be star of spectral type B7IVe which is [...] from Earth, with an {{apparent magnitude}} of 5.89. Lacaille named a close-by star as Eta as well, which was inconsistently followed by Francis Baily, who used the name for the brighter or both stars in two different publications. Despite their faintness, Benjamin Gould upheld their Bayer designation as they were closer than 25 degrees to the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> The second Eta is now designated as HD 150550. It is a variable star of average magnitude 6.53 and spectral type A1III.|$|E
5000|$|Three Chinese {{documents}} {{indicate that}} the guest star was located [...] "perhaps a few inches" [...] South-East of Tianguan. Song Shi and Song Huiyao stipulate that it [...] "was standing guard" [...] for the asterism, corresponding to the star ζ Tauri. The [...] "South-East" [...] orientation has a simple astronomical meaning, the celestial sphere having, like the Earth's globe, both north and <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> the [...] "South-East" [...] direction thus corresponding to a [...] "bottom-left" [...] location {{in relation to the}} reference object (in this case, the star ζ Tauri) when it appears at the South. However, this [...] "South-East" [...] direction has long left modern astronomers perplexed {{in the context of this}} event: the logical remnant of the supernova corresponding to the guest star is the Crab Nebula, but it is not situated to the southeast of ζ Tauri, rather in the opposite direction, to the northwest.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{known as}} the Axial system, or Equatorial system, it divides the {{celestial}} equator in twelve 30° sectors (starting at the local meridian) and projects them on to the ecliptic along the great circles containing the North and <b>South</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>poles.</b> The intersections of the ecliptic with those great circles provide the house cusps. The 10th house cusp thus equals the Midheaven, but the East Point (also known as Equatorial Ascendant) is now the first house's cusp. Each house is exactly 2 sidereal hours long. This system was proposed by the Australian astrologer David Cope {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century and has become the most popular system with the Uranian school of astrology. [...] The Ascendant (intersection between the ecliptic and the horizon) preserves its importance in chart interpretation through sign and aspects, but not as a house determinant, which is why this house system can be used in any latitude.|$|R

2500|$|Carina {{is located}} in the {{southern}} sky near the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> making it circumpolar for most of the southern hemisphere. Due to precession of Earth's axis, by the year 4700 the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> will be located in Carina. [...] Three bright stars in Carina will come within 1 degree of the southern celestial pole and take turns as the southern pole star: Omega Carinae (mag 3.29) in 5600, Upsilon Carinae (mag 2.97) in 6700, and Iota Carinae (mag 2.21) in 7900.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{of the sky}} {{near the}} <b>South</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole</b> below the {{declination}} of about –65° was observed by {{people living in the}} Southern Hemisphere but was only partially catalogued by the ancient Babylonians, Egyptian, Greeks, Chinese, and Persian astronomers of the north. Knowledge that northern and southern star patterns differed go back into Antiquity, being mostly gained from later Classical writers about Phoenician sailors : like the African circumnavigation expedition commissioned by Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II in c. 600 BC or those of Hanno the Navigator in c. 500BC. However, much of the history of these origins were lost with the Destruction of the Library of Alexandria.|$|E
2500|$|As Earth rotates {{daily on}} its axis, the stars appear {{to move in}} {{circular}} paths {{around one of the}} celestial poles (the north celestial pole for observers in the Northern Hemisphere, or the <b>south</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> for observers in the Southern Hemisphere). Stars far from a celestial pole appear to rotate in large circles; stars located very close to a celestial pole rotate in small circles and hence hardly seem to engage in any diurnal motion at all. Depending on the observer's latitude on Earth, some stars [...] the circumpolar ones [...] are close enough to the celestial pole to remain continuously above the horizon, while other stars dip below the horizon for some portion of their daily circular path (and others remain permanently below the horizon).|$|E
