50|$|The coroner's inquest of March 1915 {{found that}} while {{repairing}} mineshaft brickwork from a special cradle at Snydale Colliery, Arthur Higgins, and Henry Radford (a <b>shaftman,</b> and joiner, aged-62) were crushed. As they were using a cradle, the mine manager; Arthur Simpkin stated that the over-winding gear could not be used, the use of temporary safety location marks on the winding indicator was confirmed by the mining company director; Mr Hargreaves, and that despite the emergency-stop signaling by banksman; David Precious (of Snydale), momentary forgetfulness of the winding engineman; Noah Guest, who momentarily believed he was winding from much lower-level of the shaft at his usual position at Haigh Moor seam, resulted in the cradle crashing in to the headgear, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, the coroner agreed with the jury that an act criminal negligence had not been committed by Noah Guest, who was of good character, and had never before made a mistake. Fifteen minutes after his arrival at Clayton Hospital, Wakefield, Henry Radford who was badly crushed, with many broken bones, was pronounced dead by the house surgeon Ida Guillaume (1876-1929). Arthur Higgins' right arm was so badly injured {{it had to be}} amputated, and he also lost two fingers from his left hand.|$|E
50|$|Before {{recovery}} {{could begin}} the shaft {{had to be}} timbered and the brattice completed. During rescue attempts safety concerns had been minimised, but now {{the welfare of the}} recovery workers took priority. By the Saturday the works were complete and the sinkers and <b>shaftmen</b> withdrawn. First down were Humble and Hall (a manager from a nearby collier) followed by Chapman and Brown then other men.|$|R
5000|$|Both main shafts {{were damaged}} by the explosion. The downcast (Busty) shaft {{suffered}} damage {{all the way to}} the surface, and then the casing between the pit top and the heapstead was blown down. The upcast (lamp) pit also suffered damage, but fortunately the fan was uninjured and continued to run. Before the district inspector could arrive the <b>shaftmen</b> had already started to clear away the debris from the downshaft. A temporary hospital was established at the pithead. Medical and rescue stores were brought in and by 2a.m. the cages could be lowered down the pit. The men mentioned above were brought up, but there were no further survivors. Recovery and exploration work went on [...] "unceasingly" [...] until 6 days after the explosion all but two of the bodies had been recovered and brought up. The search for these two (the ones found in 1933) was abandoned due to increasing danger to the recovery parties.|$|R
50|$|The {{disaster}} at Wharncliffe Woodmoor colliery claimed fifty-eight {{lives and}} devastated the local community. It {{was the last}} of what we might regard as a major colliery disaster in South Yorkshire. It remains the worst South Yorkshire mining disaster in modern times. The disaster was caused by an explosion of gas from the Lidgett Seam on the morning of 6 August 1936. The Lidgett Seam which was just over two feet thick and was reached by drifts from the Haigh Moor Seam which was 34 yards above. The Haigh Moor Seam was 280 yards from the surface.The explosion occurred during {{the latter part of the}} night shift, at about 3.20am (this was confirmed by a <b>shaftman</b> on the surface who noticed a sudden reversal of air at that time), when men were involved in repair work and making preparations for the day shift. S.O.S messages were sent out immediately to neighbouring collieries and six rescue teams arrived. These were from Woolley, Barnsley Main, Barnsley Rescue Station, North Gawber, Monckton Main and the rescue team from Wharncliffe Woodmoor. Rescue workers, which hurriedly rushed to the scene were hindered by falls of roof, Wharncliffe Woodmoor No.1 rescue team being the first to descend the mine. They brought news that they had dug through four walls, but that progress had been slow owing to the amount of debris which had to be cleared, and also to further slight falls. A member of the rescue team said that they encountered gas and five canaries which had been taken down the pit had died. Local doctors Dr H. B Pare, Dr. J. Henderson and Dr. H. Henderson (Royston) and Dr. Quigley (Cudworth) arrived on the scene and rendered assistance. The Old Green Road School, Carlton was used as a temporary morgue with nurses standing by. The Vicar of Carlton Rev. N. King, Rev. E.F Owen Vicar of Staincross and Canon W.C Hudson of the Holy Rood Catholic Church, Barnsley offered the crowd spiritual comfort by conducting prayers in the pit yard. The Mayor of Barnsley, Alderman Jones, was visiting Prague at the International Miners Conference with other council and mining officials at the time of the explosion, they had been cabled earlier that morning and informed by about 4:30pm that afternoon.|$|E

It often co-occurs with certain chronic diseases that impact mortality. Our objective {{was to determine whether}} RP has any independent association with survival. Methods: From 1987 – 1989, a total of 830 participants of the Charleston Heart Study cohort completed an in-person RP screening questionnaire. Two definitions of RP were used: a broad definition that included both blanching (pallor) and cyanotic color changes and a narrow definition that included only blanching. All-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality were compared between subjects with and without RP using race-specific survival models that adjusted for age, sex, baseline CVD, and 10 -year risk of coronary heart disease. Results: Using the narrow RP definition, we identified a significant interaction between older age and the presence of RP on all-cause mortality. In the broad RP definition model, the presence of RP was not associated with CVD mortality among blacks; however, among whites, the presence of RP was associated with a 1. 6 -fold increase in the hazard associated with CVD-related death (hazard ratio: 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 10 – 2. 20, P= 0. 013). Conclusion: RP was independently associated with mortality among older adults in our cohort. Among whites, RP was associated with increased CVD-related death. It is possible that RP may be a sign of undiagnosed vascular disease. Keywords: Raynaud disease, cohort studies, cardiovascular diseases, survival analysi...|$|E
