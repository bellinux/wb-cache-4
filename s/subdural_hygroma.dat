50|$|A <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> is a {{collection}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), without blood, located under the dural membrane. Most subdural hygromas are believed to be derived from chronic subdural hematomas. They are commonly seen in elderly patients after minor trauma but can also be seen in children after an infection. One of the common causes of <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> is a sudden decrease in pressure as a result of placing a ventricular shunt. This can lead to leakage of CSF into the subdural space especially in cases with moderate to severe brain atrophy. In these cases the symptoms such as mild fever, headache, drowsiness and confusion can be seen, which are relieved by draining this subdural fluid.|$|E
50|$|In the {{majority}} of cases, if {{there has not been}} any acute trauma or severe neurologic symptoms, a small <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> on the head CT scan will be an incidental finding. If there is an associated localized mass effect that may explain the clinical symptoms, or concern for a potential chronic SDH that could rebleed, then an MRI, with or without neurologic consultation, may be useful.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas</b> {{are small}} and {{clinically}} insignificant. Larger hygromas may cause secondary localized mass effects on the adjacent brain parenchyma, enough to cause a neurologic deficit or other symptoms. Acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas</b> can be a potential neurosurgical emergency, requiring decompression. Acute hygromas are typically a result of head trauma—they are a relatively common posttraumatic lesion—but can also develop following neurosurgical procedures, and have also been associated {{with a variety of}} conditions, including dehydration in the elderly, lymphoma and connective tissue diseases.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} case of 22 -year-old man with nontraumatic intracystic {{hemorrhage}} into a middle cranial fossa arachnoid cyst associated with a contiguous subacute subdural hematoma. Arachnoid cysts are benign intra-arachnoidal fluid collections frequently detected incidentally during neuroimaging. Rare complications of arachnoid cysts such as intracystic hemorrhage or subdural hematomas and <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas</b> typically occur after head trauma. Our {{review of the literature}} identified fewer than 30 cases of arachnoid cysts with complicating intracystic hemorrhage and ipsilateral subdural hematomas...|$|R
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs) on CT reports for scans of the head to be misinterpreted as subdural hygromas, and vice versa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be done to differentiate a chronic SDH from a <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma,</b> when clinically warranted. Elderly patients with marked cerebral atrophy, and secondary widened subarachnoid CSF spaces, can also cause confusion on CT. To distinguish chronic subdural hygromas from simple brain atrophy and CSF space expansion, a gadolinium-enhanced MRI can be performed. Visualization of cortical veins traversing the collection favors a widened subarachnoid space as seen in brain atrophy, whereas subdural hygromas will displace the cortex and cortical veins.|$|E
5000|$|Skull {{fractures}} can {{tear the}} meninges, the membranes {{that cover the}} brain, leading to leaks of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A tear between the dura and the arachnoid membranes, called a CSF fistula, can cause CSF to leak out of the subarachnoid space into the subdural space; {{this is called a}} <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma.</b> CSF can also leak from the nose and the ear. These tears can also allow bacteria into the cavity, potentially causing infections such as meningitis. Pneumocephalus occurs when air enters the intracranial cavity and becomes trapped in the subarachnoid space. Infections within the intracranial cavity are a dangerous complication of TBI. They may occur outside of the dura mater, below the dura, below the arachnoid (meningitis), or within the brain itself (abscess). Most of these injuries develop within a few weeks of the initial trauma and result from skull fractures or penetrating injuries. Standard treatment involves antibiotics and sometimes surgery to remove the infected tissue.|$|E
40|$|Subdural empyema of {{the brain}} is an {{uncommon}} disorder that occurs more frequently in children than in adult. Authors report a very rare of subdural empyema following the <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> after mild head injury. The exact mechanism of infection is not known. However, {{we have to consider}} subdural infection as one of differential diagnosis in elderly patient with <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> when new abnormal density lesion is developed in the subdural space.

He developed {{bilateral and}} symptomatic <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas</b> that were drained in response to clinical deterioration, but proved ineffective. An initial MRI of the lumbar region suggested a lumbosacral CSF leak, but he {{failed to respond to}} local blood patching. Subsequent CT myelography revealed a thoracic dural leak and a second directed blood patch proved effective. The aetiology, pitfalls and management of SIH are summarized...|$|R
5000|$|Any {{injury that}} results in trauma to the skull or brain can be {{classified}} as a head injury. The terms traumatic brain injury and head injury are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. This broad classification includes neuronal injuries, hemorrhages, vascular injuries, cranial nerve injuries, and <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas,</b> among many others. [...] These classifications can be further categorized as open (penetrating) or closed head injuries. This depends on if the skull was broken or not. [...] Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causes—including accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidents—that can cause head injuries. Many of these are minor, but some can be severe enough to require hospitalization.|$|R
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas,</b> engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|R

40|$|An 80 -year-old man was {{admitted}} because of head trauma following a fall down a staircase. Initial CT-imaging {{of the brain}} showed only global atrophy, but repeated CT-imaging 4 days later revealed a <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma.</b> Because of {{the discrepancy between the}} radiological deterioration and the unchanged neurological condition, we refrained from neurosurgical evacuation.

The pathophysiology is not well known. Differentiating <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation in the subdural space) from external hydrocephalus (excessive CSF accumulation in the subarachnoid space) is important in view of the therapeutic consequences.

40|$|Symptoms of overdrainage, a {{frequent}} complication following shunting procedures especially {{in patients with}} normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), are presumed {{to be caused by}} siphoning: gravity-enhanced ¯ow of cerebro spinal ¯uid (CSF) through shunts in upright position. A critical reappraisal of siphoning and over-drainage (OD) is presented considering the occurrence of <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas</b> (SDH) encountered in a group of patients shunted for NPH. The patients participated in the multicentre Dutch NPH study: 101 NPH patients were randomised for treatment with shunts with low or medium-high working pressure. Treatment with shunts with low working pressure resulted in an increased incidence of SDH (iSDH). Current physiological concepts of overdrainage are discussed and criticised. A new theory is presented on the basis of general physiological considerations. The theoretical model pro-posed yields a revised explanation for the origin of extremely low ventricular pressure in the upright position found with overdrainage. The ecacy of siphoning-preventing shunts and subtemporal de-compression is explored {{in the light of the}} proposed theory...|$|R
40|$|Arachnoid cysts are {{reported}} to be occasionally associated with <b>subdural</b> hematoma or <b>hygroma.</b> Spontaneous disappearances of arachnoid cysts have been reported previously and in was emphasized that rupture of cyst membrane and <b>subdural</b> hematoma or <b>hygroma</b> must be essential for them to disappear. We report herein a case of hemorrhagic arachnoid cyst of the posterior fossa. The hemorrhagic cyst was not accompanied by <b>subdural</b> hematoma or <b>hygroma</b> and gradually reduced in size. A 21 -year-old man sustained a cerebral contusion and epidural hematoma of the frontal reglon from a head injury. Computerized tomography scannlng obtained 12 hours after the inJury revealed a hemorrhagic retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging performed on day 21 revealed that the hemorrhagic arachnoid cyst had high intensity on a T 1 -weighted image and relatively low intensity on a T 2 - weighted image without <b>subdural</b> hematoma or <b>hygroma.</b> Follow-up CT scans revealed that the hemorrhagic arachnoid cyst had reduced in size. The patient made an almost complete recovery and was discharged with no observable neurologlcal deficits three months after admission. Hemorrhage was not presentin the first few hours after head injury but developed Subsequently, confined strictly to the cystic cavity. This case report provides evidence that disappearance or reduction of arachnoid cysts can occur {{without the need for}} subdural hematoma or effusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{suspicion}} {{of child abuse}} is a massive incrimination, the consequences are far-ranging for every involved participant. A special kind of child abuse is the shaken-baby-syndrome. It includes serious injury and is difficult to prove. Solid arguments are necessary to confirm the suspicion. Usually there will be typical clinical evidence (rupture of briding veins, bonefractures, subdural haematomas). If not, {{it is necessary to}} examine the further clinical evidence. Cerebral fluid collections are not typical clinical evidence of shaken-baby-syndrome. This paper is intended to clarify if cerebral fluid collections develop spontaneously or are triggered by traumata. Furthermore the question, if typical clinical evidence or symptoms can be identified and used to differentiate spontaneous from traumatic, should be answered. Methods Retrospektive all autopsied cases with the {{suspicion of}} shaken-baby-syndrome of the Institut für Rechtsmedizin were examined. Via pubmed, a literature research with the search theme “subdural hygroma” and restricted by age (0 to 23 months) and only humans, was done. Results Between 1982 and 2005 twenty cases with suspicion of shaken-baby-syndrome were autopsied. Four of them with <b>subdural</b> <b>hygromas.</b> Additional clinical evidence was the rupture of bridging veins and retinal hemorrhage. The mean survival time was 25 days. 1392 cases corresponding to search items were found in the literature. 242 infants showed cerebral fluid collections in combination with a causal trauma. Thereof 180 with non-accidental head injuries: (shaken-baby-syndrome, shaken-whiplash-syndrome, violence to the head). In contrast 458 cases with a spontaneous cerebral fluid collection and Macrocranie; some of them with additional symptoms of rising intracranial pressure, a smaller part of them only had macrocranie. Discussion Cerebral fluid collection appears spontaneously or is triggered traumaticly. Spontaneous CSF occurs with macrocranie and possibly with symptoms of rising intracranial pressure. CSF themselves are not described as a trigger for massive brain damage or breathing arrest. CSF is not evidentiary for or against shaken-baby-syndrome. <b>Subdural</b> <b>hygromas</b> were never found in cases of traffic accidents. It is necessary to set CSF in a qualified relation to the whole situation and anamnesis, when child abuse is suspected. When it is indicated liquor analyses should be accomplished...|$|R
40|$|Background. Contralateral <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> {{caused by}} decompressive {{craniectomy}} tends to combine with external cerebral herniation, causing neurological deficits. Material and Methods. Nine patients who underwent one-stage, simultaneous cranioplasty and contralateral subdural-peritoneal shunting {{were included in}} this study. Clinical outcome was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale as well as Glasgow Coma Scale, muscle power scoring system, and complications. Results. Postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated completely resolved <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> and reversed midline shifts, indicating excellent outcome. Among these 9 patients, 4 patients (44 %) had improved GOS following the proposed surgery. Four out of 4 patients with lethargy became alert and orientated following surgical intervention. Muscle strength improved significantly 5 months after surgery in 7 out of 7 patients with weakness. Two out of 9 patients presented with drowsiness due to hydrocephalus at an average time of 65 days after surgery. Double gradient shunting is useful to eliminate the respective hydrocephalus and contralateral <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma.</b> Conclusion. The described surgical technique is effective in treating symptomatic contralateral <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> following decompressive craniectomy and is associated with an excellent structural and functional outcome. However, subdural-peritoneal shunting plus cranioplasty thoroughly resolves the <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> collection, which might deteriorate the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, leading to hydrocephalus...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> is {{collection}} of the cerebrospinal-like fluid in the subdural space. It is usually asymptomatic. Sometimes gradual increase is noted which acts tensionally and causes pressure on the brain structures. It this case surgical treatment is necessary which is usually straightforward. Results: In the paper {{a case of a}} patient is presented where after craniocerebral injury bilateral symptomatic <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> developed. He was first treated with insertion of bilateral subdural drainage and then with repeated subdural taps. After both therapeutic measures the hygroma always recurred with worsening of the clinical condition. For permanent resolution of the hygroma an insertion of the subduro-peritoneal drainage was needed. After this operation the patient fully recovered. Two months after the operation he is without problems and the hygroma did not recur. Conclusions: This case report proves that in recurrent <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> insertion of the subduro-peritoneal drainage is a good treatment option. Unilateral drainage could be beneficial even in bilateral hygroma. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Opening of the lamina terminalis {{is often}} used in surgery of the optico-chiasmatic region. Consequently, {{alteration}} of cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) dynamics can occur after this manoeuvre, thus potentially translating into clinical complications. Herein, we describe 2 cases in which clinically relevant hypothalamic dysfunctions developed after few days opening of the lamina terminalis both patients showed mild to moderate preoperative hydrocephalus which improved postoperatively. CASES DESCRIPTION: In a patient with ruptured aneurysm of the basilar bifurcation, opening of the lamina terminalis was performed prior to acute-stage clipping. On postoperative day 7 th, the patient developed significant <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma,</b> mild disturbances of consciousness and increase of ADH concentration. These clinical features resolved only following <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> drainage and ventricular-peritoneal shunting. One previously operated patient in whom the lamina terminalis had been opened to remove a sizeable parasellar tumour showed a similar post-operative course. In this patient, sole <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> drainage was not an effective treatment, and the patient died subsequently for complications related to long-standing, though mild, hypothalamic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience may suggest that hypothalamic dysfunctions should be reminded as a possible, although rare, complication following {{the opening of the}} lamina terminalis. This clinical condition, if not properly managed, may contribute to trigger severe life-threatening complication...|$|E

Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is warranted when {{the cause of a}} person's cerebral palsy has not been established. An MRI is preferred over CT due to diagnostic yield and safety. When abnormal, the neuroimaging study can suggest the timing of the initial damage. The CT or MRI is also capable of revealing treatable conditions, such as hydrocephalus, porencephaly, arteriovenous malformation, <b>subdural</b> hematomas and <b>hygromas,</b> and a vermian tumour (which a few studies suggest are present 5–22% of the time).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pharmacoresistant {{epilepsy}} can {{be treated}} by either resection of the epileptic focus or functional isolation of the epileptic focus through  complete disconnection of the pathways of propagation of the epileptic activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term seizure outcome and complications of temporal lobe disconnection (TLD) without resection for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). METHODS: Data of 45 patients operated on for intractable MTLE using a functional disconnection procedure have been studied. Indication of TLD surgery was retained after a standard preoperative evaluation of refractory epilepsy and using the same criteria as for standard temporal resection. RESULTS: Mean follow-up duration was 3. 7 years. At the last follow-up, 30 patients (67 %) were completely seizure-free (Engel-Ia/International League Against Epilepsy class 1) and 39 patients (87 %) remained significantly improved (Engel-I or -II) by surgery. Actuarial outcome displays a 77. 7 % probability of being seizure-free and an 85. 4 % probability of being significantly improved at 5 years. No patient died after surgery and no <b>subdural</b> haematoma or <b>hygroma</b> occurred. Permanent morbidity included hemiparesis, hemianopia and oculomotor paresis found in three, five and one patient, respectively, after TLD. CONCLUSIONS: TLD is acceptable alternative surgical technique for patients with intractable MTLE. The results of TLD {{are in the range}} of morbidity and long-term seizure outcome rates after standard surgical resection. We observed a slightly higher rate of complications after TLD in comparison with usual rates of morbidity of resection procedures. TLD may be used as an alternative to resection and could reduce operating time and the risks of subdural collections. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|There {{continues}} to be a considerable interest in decompressive craniectomy in the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Though technically straightforward, the procedure is not without significant complications. In this study we assessed the incidence and risk factors for the development of <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> and hydrocephalus after decompressive craniectomy. A total of 195 patients who had had a decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI between 2004 and 2010 at the two major trauma centers in Western Australia were considered. Of the 166 patients who survived after the acute hospital stay, 93 (56 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 48, 63 %) developed subdural hygroma; 45 patients (48 %) had unilateral and 48 patients (52 %) had bilateral subdural hygromas. Of the 159 patients who survived more than 6 months after surgery, 72 (45 %; 95 % CI 38, 53 %) developed radiological evidence of ventriculomegaly, and 26 of these 72 patients (36 %; 95 % CI 26, 48 %) developed clinical evidence of hydrocephalus and required a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Maximum intracranial pressure prior to decompression (p= 0. 005), <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> (p= 0. 012), and a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale score (p= 0. 009), were significant risk factors for hydrocephalus after decompressive craniectomy. Hydrocephalus requiring a VP shunt was associated with a higher risk of unfavorable neurological outcomes at 18 months (odds ratio 7. 46; 95 %CI 1. 17, 47. 4; p= 0. 033), after adjusting for other factors. Our results showed a clear association between injury severity, <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma,</b> and hydrocephalus, suggesting that damage to the cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways contributes to the primary brain injury rather than the margin of the craniectomy as the factor responsible for these complications...|$|E

Non-traumatic subdural effusion of {{cerebrospinal fluid}} {{is a rare}} complication requiring surgical treatment. Case Report: A 15 -year-old boy {{was admitted to the}} hospital because of symptoms related to acute intracranial hypertension (headache and vomiting). The cerebral CT-scan revealed a <b>subdural</b> <b>hygroma</b> adjoining a voluminous Sylvian arachnoid cyst. Two arachnoid cysts were incidentally discovered 11 years before this dramatic complication. Moreover, the patient had suffered a cerebral concussion 2 years earlier, but interestingly did not develop cystic hemorrhage or rupture, contrary to numerous cases previously described in the literature. The location of the cysts and their regular follow-up did not allow foreseeing a cystic rupture. Hygroma evacuation was first performed after which a subdural peritoneal. shunting, using a programmable opening pressure valve, was implanted. Spontaneous rupture into the subdural space represents an unusual complication of arachnoid cysts. Clinical aspects, radiographic findings, pathogenesis and surgical management are described.
