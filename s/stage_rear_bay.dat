50|$|The police wing, on the east, {{is mostly}} identical. A rear wing houses the jail. It has eleven bays at street level, {{and the main}} {{entrance}} is {{in the center of}} the west facade. Its <b>rear</b> <b>bays</b> have trabeated openings with bronze grilles.|$|R
50|$|On {{the rear}} facade {{are the two}} <b>rear</b> <b>bays</b> of the {{classroom}} addition, a bricked-in window on another gabled projection and seven segmented-arch windows (one also bricked in) in the choir alcove. There is also a shed-roofed projection between the south wall and west addition, and two more second story trabeated windows.|$|R

40|$|P. monodon juveniles prefer {{natural food}} than {{artificial}} feed in their initial <b>stage</b> of <b>rearing.</b> However, the percentage preference towards artificial feed increases {{as the days}} of culture/average body weight increases. Consumption of artificial feed was high during evening meal (1700 h) and low during night meal (2200 h). The index of intestine fullness was high (8. 4 ± 0. 7) during initial <b>stage</b> of <b>rearing,</b> {{compared to that of}} final <b>stage</b> of <b>rearing</b> (4. 9 ± 0. 4), probably due to low nutritional value of intake material and low water depth at initial stage. At all <b>stage</b> of <b>rearing</b> omnivorous feeding habit was established and no evidence of diet periodicity in feeding activity was observed...|$|R

50|$|On {{the side}} elevations, stone columns form round arches around {{all but the}} easternmost bay. Within their slight {{recesses}} are narrow four-paned stained glass. The <b>rear</b> <b>bay</b> is set off by columns like those on the corners and has no arch, but is otherwise similarly treated. At the roofline a denticulated cornice is below the overhanging eave. A small vestibule connects the church to its rectory on the north.|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to assess the impact of}} artificial feeding on sensory attributes of steamed fish at fingerling <b>stage</b> <b>reared</b> in monoculture while at grow-out <b>stage</b> <b>reared</b> both in mono and polyculture. The fingerlings of Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala fed on 40 % protein feed showed non-significant effect on sensory attributes compared with control. Similar results were obtained in grow-out monoculture when fed on 35 % protein. In polyculture the C. mrigala showed significantly (P< 0. 05) higher scores for color, oiliness and overall acceptability compared to control and other two species. All three species showed significant differences for flavor, and tenderness in polyculture compared to monoculture. The control fish in polyculture were slightly more yellowish resulting in increased hue angle values. It is concluded that the artificial feed can be used to enhance the growth performance at fingerling stage without interfering the overall sensory quality of fish...|$|R
50|$|The {{seat and}} exposed control column were located {{just ahead of}} the wing leading edge. A simple skid acted as undercarriage. At the rear, a fabric-covered tailplane, with swept leading edges and {{carrying}} rectangular elevators, was mounted on the upper fuselage beam over the whole of the aft fuselage bay. The rearmost vertical member of the girder carried a near-rectangular rudder, which projected above the fuselage led by a slender fin. Lateral stability was enhanced by the fabric covering of the <b>rear</b> <b>bay</b> of the fuselage.|$|R

50|$|The Grand Theatre {{building}} is a landmark for the city Shanghai. With a total investment of 1.2 billion RMB, an area of 2.1 hectares and a total construction area of 70,000 sq. meters, SGT is home to three theatres inside: the Lyric Theatre with 1,800 seats, the drama theatre that can seat 600 and the studio theatre of 300 seats. All sound and lighting devices were sourced from world famous suppliers.

50|$|The Atlas Theatre is {{the venue}} for evening entertainment, open 365 nights of the year. There has been {{considerable}} investment in this facility, which now boasts a retractable <b>stage,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>stage</b> projection, two large stage screens, live band visibility and sound and lighting comparable to any major West End theatre. In 2011, The Atlas Theatre was extended with work taking {{place during the}} day and overnight, so not to interrupt the evening's show. The theatre now has downstairs and balcony seating for over 1,000 guests and bars on both levels, with the downstairs bar approximately 100 feet in length. The Potters Theatre Company perform here nightly, except when a star act is on the bill, including names such as Peter Andre, Joe Longthorne, Brian Conley, Chas and Dave, The Overtones, Collabro and Jane McDonald amongst others. The Atlas Theatre is also often used for conferences and events.|$|R
2500|$|On June 1, the Roland-2 system {{claimed a}} Sea Harrier over the airport. The aircraft, nº XZ456, {{belonging}} to the 801 Naval Air Squadron from , was in a recce mission 7km south of Stanley, apparently {{out of the reach}} of the missile, but tracked by its radar. The Argentine officer in charge of the unit, Lt. Carlos Leónidas Regalini, fired the Roland despite the target being 7,000 meters away. The pilot, Flt. Lt. Ian Mortimer, climbed up, confident that he had successfully outmaneuvered the missile. A couple of [...] seconds later, the <b>rear</b> <b>bay</b> of his jet was torn apart by the explosion of the proximity fuze, leaving only the cockpit undamaged.
