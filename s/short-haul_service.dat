Amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (lacking Wyoming and South Dakota). Amtrak services fall into three groups: <b>short-haul</b> <b>service</b> on the Northeast Corridor, state-supported short haul service outside the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance service known within Amtrak as the National Network. Amtrak receives federal funding {{for the vast majority of}} its operations including the central spine of the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington DC as well as for its National long distance routes. In addition to the federally funded routes, Amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the Northeast Corridor, some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it. In addition to its inter-city services, Amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including MARC in Maryland, Shore Line East in Connecticut, and Metrolink in California.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In 1971, {{the joint}} Department of Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administrations, Civil Aviation Research and Development Policy Study (CARD) Report, {{identified}} {{the problems of}} providing air service to low density, short haul markets, as the third most pressing difficulty facing the United States' aviation industry. In {{the words of the}} report, "Low-Density Short Haul: While lower in priority than noise and congestion, solutions to the problems of low-density, <b>short-haul</b> <b>service</b> will be important to the future of civil aviation and to its ability to contribute to the goals of the Nation. This service of civil aviation can be a positive force in future regional development. In order to obtain a better definition of the problems and potential of low-density, <b>short-haul</b> <b>service,</b> a program should be established to determine accurately market sensitivities to changes in service, fare, frequency, and equipment. A government-sponsored market demonstration is required for this purpose. Concurrent and integrated with this demonstration, the Government should fund studies for the conceptual design and analysis of economical vehicles for the low-density, short-haul market. " (Emphasis Added, p. 2 - 6) In response to this policy statement, NASA has undertaken a number of technical and systems studies as outlined by Mr. George Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology (Programs) in his 1972 testimony before the U. S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology of the Committee on Science and Astronautics. " 1 In FY 73, NASA programs relating specifically to low-density, short-haul will fall into three main categories: a. Continuing an effort begun in FY 72 which is identifying technology problems associated with providing economical air service to sparsely settled regions. b. Continuing an effort begun in FY 72 which will investigate and develop very-low-frequency navigation techniques for en route and terminal area navigation for civil aviation, especially low-density, <b>short-haul</b> <b>service.</b> c. Increasing knowledge of economic and operational factors which bear upon technology and aircraft requirements. Studies will be undertaken to fit existing and hypothetical aircraft into realistic low-density, short-haul arenas and to identify where and why economic short-comings appear. Those that can be improved by technology will be identified. In addition, programs will be undertaken to investigate: ride-quality improvement as it influences aircraft design and passenger acceptance, crosswind landing characteristics, and operational techniques.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{applications of}} active controls are examined {{for improving the}} characteristics of transport type aircraft used in <b>short-haul</b> <b>service</b> (1, 000 -kilometer range capability). The types of aircraft to meet future needs (quiet operation, congestion alleviation, fuel conservation, operating economy, and traveler acceptance) are identified as helicopters for shorter stage lengths and fixed wing aircraft of reduced field-length capability for longer stage lengths. Likely uses for active controls for these aircraft are examined regarding payoffs which can be expected and problems and constraints which must be dealt with. Uses showing significant benefits include augmented stability and control, gust-load alleviation, and ride smoothing. Gust-load alleviation is particularly effective for low-wing-loading aircraft employing conventional lift. Ride-smoothing systems are indicated to be the furthest advanced and ready for production commitment for those applications {{where they can be}} shown to have payoff...|$|E

An examination is conducted of advanced technology to identify those technologies that, if developed, would provide the largest improvements for future generations of these aircraft. Attention is given to commuter aircraft operating cost, aerodynamics, structures and materials, propulsion, aircraft systems, and technology integration. It is found that advanced technology can improve future commuter aircraft and that the largest of these improvements will come from the synergistic combination of technological advances in all of the aircraft disciplines. The most important goals are related to improved fuel efficiency and increased aircraft productivity...|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} for estimating {{the size of}} the market for a city-pair route at an airport from both the demand and supply sides of air transportation. The average airport access cost, average passenger delay cost, and average airline operating cost all either increase or decrease with an increase in the market size of a city-pair route at an airport, so the optimum market size can be determined from trade-offs among these costs. A nonlinear mathematical programming problem is formulated to determine the optimal number of passengers, the local service area of a city-pair market and to perform sensitivity analyses. The results show that long-haul services ought to be concentrated in one large airport, while <b>short-haul</b> <b>services</b> might be dispersed among many small airports. Improvements in the technology of the airport access mode or increases in the average income of the cities served can expand the market size and service area, but at a declining expansion rate. In metropolitan areas with high population density, airlines can operate more efficiently and distribute air services among more airports. City-pair markets with stable passenger demand, or markets served by airlines with efficient scheduling technology are shown to exhibit high cost efficiencies. ...|$|R
