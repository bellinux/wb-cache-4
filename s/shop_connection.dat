25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, the Blue Line was {{actually}} connected to the Red Line by a direct rail connection (though the color designations of the subway lines had yet to be assigned at that time). Railcars from the Blue Line could emerge from a ramp portal surfacing between Joy Street and Russell Street, just beyond Bowdoin station. The railcars would run on former streetcar track down Cambridge Street and then most of the distance to the western end of the Longfellow Bridge, connecting to the Red Line just east of its Cambridge Subway portal, near what is now Kendall/MIT station. Because the tracks were unpowered, individual cars had to be towed along the street at night. This connection was never used in passenger service, but was used to transport Blue Line cars to the Eliot Street Yard maintenance shops then located near Harvard Square station. When the Blue Line eventually got its own maintenance <b>shops,</b> the <b>connection</b> was removed and the ramp portal was permanently covered in 1952.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{ritual in}} the {{physical}} world and cyberspace both in practice and metaphor. Traditionally, a tribe executes its culture inheriting in various kinds of rituals in which maturity ritual is especially important because of its functionality to empower the next generation by means of examining the necessary survival skills. However, there is neither obvious form nor proper content defined as maturity ritual for young people in more and more societies nowadays, because the essence of rapid changing in technology and cyberspace, in which more and more young people get occupied, tend to forget and ignore the physical experience. Instead of regarding rituals as vanishing, I’d rather consider rituals as performing necessary transformation to suit the novel definition in cyberspace. More and more teenagers perform a metaphor of ritual via accessing Internet, but in the mean while, we have no idea about what kind of content performing empowerment to them. As online games prevail in Internet cafe (coffee <b>shop</b> providing Internet <b>connection</b> popular in asia), the possibility to transform oneself into an avatar in the cyberspace attracts thousands of people to stay late in Internet cafe. The meaning and motivation of this event reveal the ongoing shift in maturity ritual for instance. To illustrate the ongoing phenomena of ritual transition from physical world to cyberspace, several cases are reviewed and possible interpretations of virtual world are discussed...|$|R

These structures not only have the appearance of historical buildings but also function as modern utilitarian buildings. This paper aims to study such buildings in order to discover the cultural and commercial values of Chinese retail complexes which have been designed in these traditional vernacular styles using the buildings of Fashion Island in Yancheng City as a case study. Firstly, by exploring the background of Fashion Island, the cultural connotations of this area are described which include the origin of Chinese city culture, Hui style architecture, aesthetics and style, and ancestor worship. Furthermore, through the concept of experience consumption, {{the way in which}} the commercial building reflects its commercial value is explored. Finally, according to questionnaire responses of both local residents and visitors, it is found that the buildings in Fashion Island inherit the traditional style of Yancheng City and reflect the culture and association of Fashion Island area with the city. Compared with normal commercial buildings, the function and connotation of the buildings that imitate traditional building style is richer, demonstrated by the integration of travel, recreation and <b>shopping,</b> and the <b>connection</b> between the buildings and their goods and services. According to field survey research and questionnaire, the cultural and commercial value of such commercial buildings in Fashion Island was determined.

50|$|Tex fills a disheartened Fitzpatrick {{in on the}} events, but {{insists on}} {{following}} up on the details he has uncovered. Fitzpatrick tells him that he worked with Malloy in Roswell, and that after becoming close friends, Malloy confided in {{him that he had}} been deciphering the alien hieroglyphics and had discovered that a second spacecraft had crashed somewhere on Earth. He then reveals that he received one of Malloy's boxes and there are probably about 6 in circulation. Tex meets with Regan to tell her about her father, and she agrees to give him her box despite reservations that Tex will open it and sell off the information for himself. After stealing Horton's personal effects from the morgue where his body is being held, Tex is able to get into Autotech's evidence room to recover Emily's box. Tex travels to the Cosmic <b>Connection</b> <b>shop</b> and speaks to Archie Ellis, an eccentric comic book nerd and ufologist who recently interviewed Malloy. Archie tells him that the famous author Elijah Witt set up the interview between them, during which Malloy made several cryptic references to something called 'The Pandora Device'. He also reveals that during their research into the alien crafts at Roswell, the scientists accidentally released something into the facility that proceeded to kill off practically everyone in the complex before the military moved in and quarantined the entire base. Archie tells Tex that Malloy sent him one of the boxes but it was stolen, and that the alien power cell in a picture from one of the other boxes is still stored in the Roswell complex.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{relation}} between travelers and destinations’ residents is meaningful in many rural tourism experiences, nevertheless {{the discussion about}} tourism development presents limited research on {{the role played by}} local young people and new generations. The present paper wishes to enrich the discussion with Albergo Diffuso (AD) case studies. Design/Methodology/Approach Albergo Diffuso is a specific form of accommodation horizontally organized: the reception is located in a central building and flats and houses are widespread in the surrounding villages and nearby hamlets. The paper presents the AD case studies of Sauris, Sutrio and Comeglians, in the northeast alpine area of Italy, where this form of accommodation was originally conceived {{as a part of a}} larger community development and territorial recovery strategies. A qualitative analysis is performed with GABEK to AD stakeholders, local community members and tourists interviews. Results are presented in net graph maps, elaborated by GABEK software. Findings Tourists are attracted by local communities, as much as residents are affected by travelers’ presence. Positive and negative outcomes deeply influence the experience of both guests and hosts. Young people play a key role in local communities and in tourism development. They are more familiar with technologies, speak foreign languages and are generally more open to novelties and meeting new people. Tourists, eager to know communities, tend to interact more with younger residents: ask for information and exchange knowledge. From the point of view of young local residents, the presence of services and facilities (schools, pharmacies, <b>shops,</b> banks, internet <b>connection)</b> and human relations are determinant in the choice to live in rural areas or move away. Originality/Value Many guest-host relations occur between tourists and single tourism operators; they rarely involve the whole community. The specific AD case study enriches the academic discussion with a qualitative analysis in community involvement in tourism. It presents the topic of involvement of young generations in both community and tourism development projects. It introduces GABEK as an innovative method for handling with complex issues that need holistic approaches. Research limitations/implications Limitations are linked to the number of interviews and the selected AD case study, where geographical, historical and cultural specificities can reduce the transferability and generalization of the results. Practical implications The research underlines the importance of young people in supporting community involvement in tourism and tourism activities in general, as much as their key role in the future of local communities in destinations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} ethical binom promise-expectation {{specific}} to the relationship firm-consumer,being built upon certain previous researches which discovered: significant changes in consumers’ values and life styles influencing the process of collectingin- formation about products; efforts carried out by com- panies {{in order to understand}} the present consumer’ requirements, to prioritize their requirements, co-operate with them to suggest priorities and enhance satisfaction; the growing manifestation of certain ethical attitudes of both companies and consumers. Not only did we ask ourselves why these ethical attitudes don’ t transform more rapidly or always in ethical behaviours in both cases but also what is actually happening at the level of the relationship between the two behaviours in the permanent pilot station which is the shop. As there is no field or activity which can be independent from ethics, the more it is available in case of marketing, the marketing function being excessively aimed at by the ethical criticism. Managerial ethics is strongly connected with social responsability, not identical, the latter becoming a corporate marketing strategy adopted by management who may no longer choose ethical indifference. As the sole existance of a code of ethical behaviour does not yet solve the problem, measures taken to clarify both monitoring and implementation procedures are growing, as well as the development level of the code and the way of supporting and adhering to this standard. Which is valid also in case of <b>shops,</b> as a <b>connection</b> point between thecitizen and the local community which is confrontingwith the challenge represented by the growing pressure with ethical connotations of customers’ expectations. It is important to mention that for some time the International Association for the Distributive Trade, AIDA Brussels oferrs the Trophy „The Victory of Ethics”. It is the industry and commerce responsability to properly communicate and ensure the comfort ofconsumers, building their trust. Consumers, to make decisions regarding their actions, go through perceptual and learning processes, and trying to harmonize their own desires with the moral behaviour which favours the well-being of the society gives them certain internal tensions. Despite the increase in ethical preocupations however ethical attitudes and preocupations of consumers are not always manifested in their actual behaviour. Our paper puts forward an understanding of the progress made in terms of effectiv ethical commitement at the organizational level and consumer level, trying to provide direction to further research of the common experience synthesized by the ethical binom promise-expectation, that will generate new knowledge. ethical promises & expectations, ethical behaviour, effective ethical engagement managerial ethics, corporate social responsibility, moral corporate performance, ethical marketing. ...|$|R
40|$|As the new {{millennium}} dawns, a battle is shaping up in cyber- space that may redefine {{the manner in which}} many people obtain copies of their favorite music. In one corner stands the record and music industry, seeking to protect their current distribution channels and to control the dissemination of their intellectual property over the Internet. In the other corner, a group consisting of Inter- net mavens, some musical artists, including acts ranging from in- dependent bands to well-established headliners, and the ever present cyberpirates, stand ready to exploit the Internet as a means to quickly and cheaply distribute and download songs. The development of compressed music files is the catalyst for this struggle over the use of the Internet to distribute songs. Our society increasingly accepts and values the Internet {{as an integral part of}} everyday life. For example, the nation’s use of the Internet has grown significantly in the past year alone. Forty-six percent of the estimated 74 million American Internet users began their use within the past twelve months. As a consequence, more people than ever are turning to the Internet to shop, gather news, socialize, and play. Currently, the two most popular uses for the Internet are email and on-line <b>shopping.</b> In <b>connection</b> with the increased general use of the Internet, musical artists and consumers have turned to the Net as a means to distribute songs. The Internet provides artists with another avenue to disseminate their works while also enabling consumers to sample various recordings with ease. The availability of data compression formats such as MP 3 enable web surfers to both upload and download music files with an efficiency that was previously un- heard of. The ability of consumers to gain ready access to music files via the Internet may ultimately transform the manner in which the entire music industry operates. Unfortunately, although many of the files available on-line are copies authorized by the artists, there are also a large number of pirated files that users post without the artists’ permission. This article addresses the current controversy over the distribution of unauthorized digital music files over the Internet. The recent introduction of the Rio, essentially a Walkman for MP 3 digital music files, and the record industry’s efforts to prevent the sale of the Rio raise the issue of whether today’s federal copyright framework is sufficient to protect copyright owners, in this case the music industry, from piracy on the Net. Part I of this article provides background information on the current use of the Internet to distribute music files and a brief analysis of how the distribution of unauthorized music files violates a copyright owner’s fundamental rights under the Copyright Act of 1976. Part II provides the technical background necessary to understand the technology at issue, namely the MP 3 format and the Rio MP 3 player, and introduces the litigation between a record industry group and Diamond Multimedia, the manufacturer of the Rio, over Diamond’s right to market and distribute the Rio. Part III presents an analysis of the current copyright law as it pertains to the distribution of digital music over the Net. This section of the article includes an analysis of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 which formed the basis for the record industry’s recent action against Diamond Multi- media, and a critique of the decision in that case. Part III additionally examines the recently enacted Digital Millennium Copyright Act to determine whether the Act contains adequate protections for copyright owners’ rights in cyberspace. Part IV contains proposals for measures that Congress, the record industry, and musical artists might consider in order to further the protection of musical copyrights on the information superhighway. This article concludes that while technological innovations such as the Rio and MP 3 technology may have rendered the amendments to the copy- right statute contained in the Audio Home Recording Act obsolete, the new Digital Millennium Copyright Act represents significant progress in furthering the protection of copyrights on the Internet and provides a framework of information regulation...|$|R
