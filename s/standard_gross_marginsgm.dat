40|$|Within {{the branch}} of horticultural production, {{vegetable}} forcing can play a very {{significant role in the}} future employment of the rural labour force, due to its less seasonal employment and high workforce demand. Taking the ecological endowments of Hungary into consideration the farms of the South Great Plains may play a decisive role in this. During our research we examined eight model hydro-cultured vegetable forcing farms that are competitive due to their income-generating capacity and are suitable for further development. We concluded that pepper forcing farms of 1 ha generated â‚¬ 138, 980 SGM, tomato forcing farms â‚¬ 129, 486 SGM and cucumber forcing farms â‚¬ 121, 641 SGM. By dividing the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> Margin by â‚¬ 1, 200 we found that the farms examined belonged to the 111. 65 ESU size category in the case of peppers, 107. 91 ESU in the case of tomatoes and 101. 37 ESU in the case of cucumbers, so they can be regarded as rather large farms according to the standards accepted within the EU. Within the category of variable costs, an increase in the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> Margin (SGM) of viable farms of the right size (in the economic sense of the word) is possible by decreasing heating costs. In the model farms examined the heating costs of greenhouses heated by thermal water was 60 % less than those using forcing equipment fuelled by coal.

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to determine - {{on the grounds of}} the facts of an average dairy family farm – the necessary economic size to provide subsistence for a four member family, which solely has income from this activity. Our study used three different calculation models. The models featured considerable differences. In the first one the primary aim of the producer is to survive, therefore the achieved gross income in farming includes neither amortization costs, nor the arising costs of repair and maintenance. On the contrary, the primary aim of the second model is to keep up the technology and the stock, which could fulfil the requirements of simple reproduction. The third model assumes a technological development corresponding with 10 % of the invested asset value besides consolidation, thus ensuring the potential of reproduction on an increasing scale. The above mentioned calculations cover the period of several years. The studied years show differences in terms of the buying up price of milk, aid for milk production and the price of used inputs. Our study compared farm sizes with the viable plant size defined according to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> Margin. As for the SGM a farm is already viable with 10 dairy cows and their progenies. However, our calculations show that a 10 cowed farm is not able to provide sufficient income for a four member family, if their aim is not only survival, but also simple or enlarged reproduction. The calculations reveal that among the fast changing market conditions of the dairy sector minimal farm size cannot be determined solely on the basis of profit figures in a given year, as in many cases it might lead to the exhaustion of reserves. dairy industry, family farm businesses, economic size, sustainability, <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> Margin., Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

The objective of the Community typology is to achieve a uniform classification of holdings in the European Union. The classification is based on the type of farming and the economic size, which are determined on the basis of <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> margin. The Community typology for agricultural holding and the statistics where it is applied, the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community farm structure survey are based to the EU legislation. Joining to the EU in 1995 has meant that the stipulations concerning the typology and its applications entered into force also in Finland. The first half of this publication presents a thorough description of the Community typology as well as its main applications. This part also includes the description of the method of classifying the holdings in parallel statistics in Finland. In the empirical part of the publication the Finnish farms are classified according the Community typology rules. The physical characteristics of the holdings are based on the Rural Business Register. The <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> margins for each characteristic are calculated for four geografical regions in a way agreed with Eurostat and DG VI. The outcome is the breakdown of Finnish farms by type farming and by economic size based on the Community typology. The first concrete applications of the new typology system in Finland are the determination of the sample needed for the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community Farm Structure Survey. In {{the last part of the}} publication the first sample for FADN in Finland is determined. The Community typology has many benefits in the future in Finland.

This argument is bolstered by treating Specific Language Impairments (SLI) and WMS as a developmental double dissociation which identifies a syntax module. Neuroconstructivists have argued that the cognitive deficits of a developmental disorder cannot be adequately distinguished using the <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> behavioural tests of neuropsychology and that the linguistic abilities of the WMS subject can be equally well explained by a constructivist strategy of neural learning in the individual, with linguisitic functions implemented in an associationist architecture. The neuroconstructivist interpretation of WMS undermines the hypothesis of a double dissociation between SLI and WMS, leaving unresolved the question of nativism about syntax. The apparent linguistic virtuosity of WMS subjects is an artefact of enhanced phonological processing, a fact which is easier to demonstrate via the associationist computational model embraced by neuroconstructivism.

The analyzed material con-sisted of results achieved during a three-year field experiment located at the Experimental Station in Bałcyny near Ostróda. Technologies with the highest and lowest average yields were selected for comparisons. The compared technologies differed from each other in the rate of nitrogen fertilization and fungicides. The more intensive winter triticale technology in field trial, the greater the financial values of winter triticale yield as well as direct costs and direct surplus. The direct costs analysis references to the positive verification of the research hypothesis.
