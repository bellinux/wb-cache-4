5|$|Being {{a pilgrimage}} town, the {{majority}} of the population is involved in tourism related industry consisting of trade and services. Service sector increased from 70% in 1971 to 98.78% in 2001, while the agricultural sector reduced from 23% in 1971 to 0.13% in 2001. Rameswaram is an industrially backward town – there has been no demarcation for industrial land due to the pilgrim sanctity and ecological fragile geography. Being an island town, the traditional occupation was fishing, but due to poor returns, the people in fishing community have gradually shifted to other professions. Banks such as <b>State</b> <b>Bank</b> of India, Indian Bank and RDCC Bank have their branches in Rameswaram.|$|E

50|$|The {{granting}} of charters {{led to the}} creation of many national banks and a national banking system which grew at a fast pace. The number of national banks rose from 66 immediately after the Act to 7473 in 1913. Initially, this rise in national banking came at the expense of state banking—the number of <b>state</b> <b>banks</b> dwindled from 1466 in 1863 to 247 in 1868. Though <b>state</b> <b>banks</b> were no longer allowed to issue notes, local bankers took advantage of less strict capital requirements ($10,000 for <b>state</b> <b>banks</b> vs. $50,000-200,000 for national banks) and opened new branches en masse. These new <b>state</b> <b>banks</b> then served as competition for national banks, growing to 15,526 in number by 1913.|$|R

This meant that the institutions could not carry out any orders {{without the consent of}} the RSFSR government. The Ministry of Finance continued functioning until the RSFSR government issued a decree completing its takeover of the Soviet financial system. It was succeeded by the Ministry of Economics and Finance of the Russian Federation (1991) and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (1992). The last Soviet Minister of Finance was Vladimir Yefimovich Orlov, and Vladimir Rayevsky was acting Minister during the period of transition.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, investable funds became {{increasingly}} concentrated {{in a single}} institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to rent-seeking. Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets {{was a result of}} crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the <b>state</b> <b>bank</b> allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E
5|$|As the 20th century dawned, {{builders}} and architects concentrated their {{efforts in the}} northern half of the district, primarily on commercial structures as the downtown area was no longer popular as a place for new residences. Monument Square, created in 1891 when a statue of Columbia was erected atop the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in the triangular area formed by the intersection of Broadway, River and Second streets, became a new focal point of development. There the McCarthy Building on Monument Square, and the similar National <b>State</b> <b>Bank</b> and Ilium buildings on Broadway, all built in 1904, show the decorative influence of the era's revival styles. Proctor's Theater, ten years later on Fourth Street, continued the tradition.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States {{the term}} [...] "state {{chartered}} bank" [...] or [...] "state chartered savings bank" [...] {{is used in}} contradistinction to [...] "national bank" [...] or [...] "federal savings bank", which are technically chartered across all US <b>states.</b> A national <b>bank</b> must have [...] "National" [...] or [...] "N.A."
