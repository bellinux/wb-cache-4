5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, Bayesian model-based <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> were {{completed}} for four of New Zealand’s main orange roughy stocks, {{one of which}} had been closed to fishing since 2000. The <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> used data collected by research surveys carried out by research organizations and the fishing industry. A key factor was the use new acoustic technology, developed by the fishing industry, in recent surveys. The multi-frequency acoustic optical system (AOS) enables scientists to differentiate the types of fish acoustically ‘seen’ during the survey and work on slopes that previously made effective surveying impossible in some areas. The AOS also has the potential to allow scientists to see in real-time video, what is being measured by the survey.

50|$|After a <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> is completed, the {{findings}} are provided to regional fishery management councils. The council identifies stocks that {{are in danger of}} overfishing or currently overfished, and then develops fishery management plans and regulations. Fishery management plans (FMP) must protect fishery resources while maintaining opportunities for domestic recreational and commercial fishing at sustainable levels of effort and yield. If a stock already has a FMP, the <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> is used to modify the FMP in response to current conditions. The public are also encouraged to participate in the management process and public hearings are held to allow for comment before the new management policies are enforced.|$|E

40|$|Elements of the precautionary {{approach}} to fishery management are commonly {{implemented in the}} form of harvest control rules, with limit, threshold and target reference points for stock size and fishing mortality. However, a review of two large advisory and management systems indicates that many <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> are not sufficiently informative to support such control rules. After a nearly a decade of applying such control rules, a large portion of management units in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) convention and marine fisheries under United States jurisdiction still have uncertain status, because many management units lack a complete suite of fishing mortality and biomass estimates and associated reference points. For those fishery resources with analytical <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> and reference point estimates, fishing mortality has generally been reduced to within prescribed limits. The number of stocks in the ICES area with excessive fishing mortality (i. e., greater than the limit reference point) decreased since 1997, but the number of stocks in need of rebuilding increased as a result of excessive fishing or revised reference points. The number of U. S. stocks with excessive fishing decreased and the number of stocks needing rebuilding decreased as a result of stock recovery, revised reference points, or redefined management units. The number of U. S. stocks with uncertain or undefined status substantially decreased. The large portion of stocks with uncertain status in both systems illustrates that such precautionary control rules are applied only to data-rich <b>stock</b> <b>assessments,</b> and are not being applied to management of fishery resources with the most uncertain <b>stock</b> <b>assessments...</b>|$|R
40|$|ICCAT’s {{most recent}} <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> of blue marlin and white marlin {{indicate}} both species are overfished {{and continue to}} suffer over-fishing; unfortunately, effective management of these species is hindered by {{the high degree of}} uncertainty in the <b>stock</b> <b>assessments.</b> One of the major sources of uncertainty in these assessments has been the lack of precise life-history data. Without information such as growth rates, mortality, and the age composition of the catch, we are forced to use simple production models with biological parameters estimated from other, similar species. Validated age and growth models would provide these missing data and help improve the precision and accuracy of <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> for these species. In this paper, we present some details of current research intended to develop such models for blue marlin and white marlin. Fin spines are being collected for both species, along with data on lower jaw-fork length, weight, and sex, from individuals caught by artisanal and commercial fleets {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic as well as in the Caribbean. Ages will be validated using relative marginal increment analysis. RÉSUMÉ Les évaluations de stock de makaire bleu et de makaire blanc les plus récentes réalisées pa...|$|R
40|$|Detailed <b>stock</b> <b>assessments,</b> {{including}} {{the estimation of}} the absolute biomass of the ‘stocks’ exploited by fisheries, are often viewed as {{the gold standard for}} indicators of their status. However, such <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> are not available for the overwhelming majority of exploited stocks and fisheries globally. This requires the development, testing and dissemination of other, less data-demanding indicators for use throughout the world, for example, for comparing the status of fisheries between different maritime countries or large marine ecosystems. Stock status plots, initially developed by staff of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to assess global fisheries, are reviewed here, and their most recent incarnation, which accounts for stock rebuilding, is found to provide a robust overview of fisheries and of the major trends besetting them...|$|R
