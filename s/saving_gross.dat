Vector Error Correction Method and co-integration techniques are used for analyzing the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP), <b>gross</b> domestic <b>savings</b> (GDS) and <b>gross</b> domestic investment (GDI) in this study.

We compare the average absolute values of indictors for {{the decade of the}} 1980 s, 1990 s and the 2000 s.

Using a two tailed- test we find that China does better than India for most of these indicators. For instance, China has a higher growth rate of per capita income, XGS and GFCF as also a higher share of XGS, GFCF etc in GDP than does India. We also find that China usually has a lower CV, namely a more stable performance. But over the three decades the CV falls in India so it is approaching that in China, namely the two economies are becoming more similar. ...|$|R

While {{in the first period}} the economy was hit by the recession and the average annual rate of growth of GDP reached only 0, 9 %, in the second period the growth accelerated to 3, 2 %. The economic growth measured by the indicators of real income (namely of real gross domestic income) was faster. This was caused by positive contribution of the terms of trade. On the supply side the main contributing factors were labour and total factor productivity. On the demand side the growth was pulled by domestic demand which grew even faster than GDP. The contribution of foreign trade becomes positive in the year 2004 and mainly in 2005. Macroeconomic stability of the Czech economy improved substantially in the fields of inflation, monetary development and foreign trade. Imbalances persist in general government budget and on the current account of the balance of payment. The process of real convergence accelerated in the years 2000 - 2004 and was based on the growth of labour and total factor productivity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to empirically investigate the long run and short run dynamic impact of interest rate and output on <b>gross</b> domestic <b>savings</b> and <b>gross</b> capital formation in Nigeria. Literatures, both theoretical and empirical, suggest that the rate of interest and output are the key factors influencing savings and investments. A review of factors influencing interest rates and output in Nigeria is necessitated by the recent economic downturns in Nigeria that has resulted in tight monetary policy which some commentators regard as inimical to growth. Employing Ordinary Least Squares, Co-integration, Error Correction Mechanism and Granger Causality econometric techniques on a data spanning 1981 to 2014 of the Nigerian economy sourced from the World Development Index, it was found that changes in output explains the long run and short run dynamic behaviour of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>savings</b> and <b>gross</b> capital formation which were used as proxies for savings and investment respectively. Whereas, a bi-causality was established between output and investment, causality flowed from output to savings in Nigeria. The research also found that interest rate is not a significant determinant of savings and investment in Nigeria in both long run and short run. It is therefore recommended that to enhance investment in a period of economic downturn in Nigeria, aggregate demand should be boosted to enhance output through vigorous pursuit of fiscal policy while implementing contractionary monetary policy to address inflationary pressures created by the increase in demand.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the global financial crisis (GFC) and recent structural changes in the patterns of hoarding international reserves (IR). We confirm that the determinants of IR hoarding evolve with developments in the global economy. During the pre-GFC period of 1999 - 2006, <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> is associated with higher IR in developing and emerging markets. The negative impact of outward direct investment on IR accumulation is consistent with the recent trend of diverting international assets from the international reserve account into tangible foreign assets; the Joneses' effect lends support to the regional rivalry in hoarding IR as a motivation; and commodity price volatility induces precautionary buffer hoarding. During the 2007 2009 GFC period, previously significant variables become insignificant or display the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions driven by financial instability. Nevertheless, the propensity to import and <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> continue to display strong and even larger positive effects on IR holding. The results from the 2010 2012 post-GFC period are dominated by factors that had been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the negative effect of swap agreements and the positive effect of <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> on IR holdings are in line with our expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and IR in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy tends to complement IR accumulation. Developed countries display different demand behaviors for IRs.

We confirm that the determining factors of international reserves are evolving with developments in the global economy. From 1999 – 2006, the pre-GFC period, <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> is associated with higher international reserves in developing and emerging markets. An outward direct-investment effect is consistent with the view of diverting international assets from the international reserve account, the “Joneses’ effect” lends support to the rivalry hoarding motivation, and commodity price volatility induces hoarding against uncertainty. During the 2007 – 2009 GFC, those variables became insignificant or displayed the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions that prevent a normal economic relationship to hold. Nevertheless, the propensity to continue to trade displays a strong positive effect. The 2010 – 2012 post-crisis results are dominated by factors that have been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the effects of swap agreements and <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> are in line with expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and international reserves in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy is found to complement international reserve accumulation. Developed countries display very different demand behaviors for international reserves. Higher <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> has been associated with lower international reserve holding because developed countries are more likely to deploy their savings in the global capital market. The presence of sovereign wealth funds is associated with a lower level of international reserve holding in industrial countries.
