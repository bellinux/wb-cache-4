25|$|In early 18th century Colonial America, {{engravers}} began {{experimenting with}} copper plates {{as an alternative}} medium to wood. Applied {{to the production of}} paper currency, copper-plate engraving allowed for greater detail and production during printing. It was the transition to <b>steel</b> <b>engraving</b> that enabled banknote design and printing to rapidly advance in the United States during the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Hosking {{served on}} the Council of the Institute of British Architects 1842-3 while {{contributing}} to the standard work of the period: The Theory, Practice and Architecture of Bridges of Stone, Iron, Timber, and Wire; with examples {{on the principle of}} suspension, 1843. In its day, this multi-volume work was the most comprehensive book of bridge construction. Many of the bridges depicted no longer exist, such as the long, covered bridge over the Patapsco River in Maryland. Others do, including some of the London bridges. Today the book is a major and unique source of information. More than fifty of the <b>steel</b> <b>engraving</b> plates are fold-out, a number of them quite large, some unfolding to more than two feet in length.|$|E

[...] The buildings are shown in a <b>steel</b> <b>engraving</b> dated approximately 1856, which also suggests that the crescent was closed at one end with railings which also continued around the gardens.|$|E

2500|$|Confederate stamps were {{generally}} issued imperforate to be manually cut. [...] Moreover, while U.

More innovations in technology and organization would develop during wartime. The north-south conflict exploding into war also ripped the nation's communication system in two. The postal system once meant to unify the country through the dissemination of information was used instead used to solidify the break.|$|E

2500|$|How {{to define}} the [...] "classic" [...] period thus {{necessarily}} is subjective. [...] This article will treat the classic period as running from 1856 to 1874. [...] Before 1874, most of the stamps were locally designed and produced, often with crude or [...] "primitive" [...] workmanship and [...] imperforate or poorly perforated, characteristics that make the stamps charming and popular with philatelists. In May 1874, Mexico issued a group of stamps designed and printed by the American Bank Note Company in New York, which were professionally designed and printed using <b>steel</b> <b>engraving,</b> and issued with perforations. [...] These stamps were closely similar in appearance to the contemporary stamps of other countries also manufactured by bank note companies in the United States. [...] Subsequent issues of Mexico, although usually manufactured domestically, were in a similar [...] "modern" [...] style.|$|E
2500|$|Other terms {{often used}} for printed {{engravings}} are copper engraving, copper-plate engraving or line engraving. <b>Steel</b> <b>engraving</b> is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, letterheads and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes {{and other forms of}} security printing. Especially in the past, [...] "engraving" [...] was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or mezzotint. [...] "Hand engraving" [...] is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also [...] "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.|$|E

60|$|About {{four o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} another of those marine monsters, not very familiar in those waters, hove in sight, following the fateful Idalia--a graceful steam yacht, painted a light buff, clean-cut as a <b>steel</b> <b>engraving.</b> The beautiful vessel hovered off shore, see-sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel. A swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore, and a stocky-built man leaped to the sands.|$|E
60|$|When I retraced my route on the {{map that}} evening I was little wiser. Hawkin's Old Farm {{appeared}} to be the survey title of the place, and the old County Gazetteer, generally so ample, did not allude to it. The big house of those parts was Hodnington Hall, Georgian with early Victorian embellishments, as an atrocious <b>steel</b> <b>engraving</b> attested. I carried my difficulty to a neighbour--a deep-rooted tree of that soil--and he gave me a name of a family which conveyed no meaning.|$|E
60|$|That bleak {{little house}} is clearly defined {{in my mind}} at this moment. The low lean-to kitchen, the rag-carpeted sitting room with its two chromos of Wide Awake and Fast Asleep--its <b>steel</b> <b>engraving</b> of General Grant, and its tiny melodeon in the corner--all these come back to me. There are very few books or {{magazines}} in the scene, but there are piles of newspapers, for my father was an omnivorous reader of all things political. It was not a hovel, it was a pioneer cabin persisting into a settled community, that was all.|$|E

60|$|When Frank and {{his brother}} John, two years younger, came to the age to begin life for themselves, they both showed such decided artistic genius that it was thought best to start them in that direction, and to have them taught engraving; an art then held in high esteem. Frank chose wood, and John <b>steel</b> <b>engraving.</b> Both did good work, but their hearts were not in it, and, as soon as {{opportunity}} offered, they abandoned engraving.

And there are a few incidents in his early career which have not gotten into the subscription biographical Encyclopaedias. In several of these volumes, to be sure, we may see steel engravings of him, true likenesses all. His was the type of face which is the glory of the steel engraving,--square and solid, as a corner-stone should be. The very clothes he wore were made for the <b>steel</b> <b>engraving,</b> stiff and wiry in texture, with sharp angles at the shoulders, and sombre in hue, as befit such grave creations.|$|E

50|$|The {{heyday of}} <b>steel</b> <b>engraved</b> book {{illustration}} was between 1825-1845, and a {{rapid expansion of}} this field took place in London around 1820.
