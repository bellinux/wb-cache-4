We used databases from the Slovenia Forest Service. In growing stock (GS) of <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> large (dbh= 30 - 49 cm) and very large (d= 50 cm and more) diameter trees account for 84. 9 % at the national level. The highest share of very large diameter <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees (45 %) is in Dinaric <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> forests and <b>silver</b> fir-beech forests(B), the lowest in <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> forests with fern and <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> forests on non-carbonate ground (C). The dbh structure of GS, number of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees recorded from two subsequent measurements from permanent sampling plots,rising mean dbh of harvested <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees all indicate general agingand regression of silver, which is typical of stratum B but not in all other strata.

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the characteristics}} of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba Mill.) occurrence and distribution in Slovenia using databases of the Slovenian Forest Service (SFS). <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> is the third most widely distributed tree species in Slovenia, occurring in approximately 40 % of total forest area, but abundantly in less than 10 %. Its share in total growing stock varies between separate forest management regions. It is more abundant in the Dinaric {{and part of the}} Pre-alpine phytogeographic regions. The highest share in total growing stock reaches at altitudes between 800 m and 1000 m above sea level, forests with <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> cover the most extensive surface in the altitude belt from 1000 to 1200 m. <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> occurs abundantly in 11 syntaxes. Between them, silver fir-beech forests (Abieti-Fagetum dinaricum TREG. 57, syn. : Omphalodo-Fagetum (TREG. 57 corr. PUNC. 80) MAR et al. 93) strongly prevail, followed by fir forests with fern (Dryopterido-Abietetum KOŠ. 65, syn. : Galio rotundifolii-Abietetum BARTSCH. 40). <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> diameter distribution considerably varies between separate forest management regions. The regions with the highest share of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Postojna, Kočevje) dominate also in having large diameter <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees, whereas in other regions (e. g. Nazarje, Kranj, Maribor) small diameter <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees are prevalent. Ddevelopmental stage structure shows that in forest stands with <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> there is a higher share of timber phase, stands in regeneration, youth stands and selective forests. Considering regeneration we can conclude, that more intensive decreasing trend in <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> share is expected in the Ddinaric phytogeographic region than in northern parts of Slovenia. Successful regeneration due to lower red deer population and balanced stem diameter structure with higher proportion of small diameter trees promise easier conservation of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> in northern parts...|$|R

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> are of high importance for selection forest management, {{and for the}} current aims laid out in Serbia’s forest management focused on increasing the share of <b>silver</b> <b>firs</b> in Serbia’s growing stock. With the objective of increasing {{the understanding of the}} growth {{characteristics of}} <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> the growth of two <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees felled during forest site production research on Mt. Goč, located in Central Serbia, have been analyzed. Both trees showed significant differences in their growth dynamics over long periods as results of micro-site and micro-stand effects (primarily ambient light regime). The common growth characteristic of the two trees, a 450 -year-old tree as the main study object (labeled Tree A) and a 270 -year-old Tree B is a long stagnation stage. For Tree A the latent phase, with small interruptions, lasted 410 years; one phase lasted 330 years in continuity, which is the longest period of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> stagnation recorded in Europe. Tree B showed a long-lasting stagnation stage that lasted 170 years. The long stagnation stage of Tree A, characterized by an average diameter increment of 1. 4 mm/year (average growth ring width of 0. 7 mm) and an average height increment of 0. 08 m/year, shows the extraordinary <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> capacity for physiological survival in complete shade. This study adds to the existing knowledge of the shade tolerance of the <b>silver</b> <b>fir.</b> Therefore, the <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> belongs to the group of extremely shade-tolerant tree species.

40|$|The {{tree species}} {{composition}} of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> and beech forests {{has changed in}} space and time due to a number of direct and indirect natural and anthropogenic causal factors. Forming silvicultural guidelines, therefore, requires a sufficient understanding of the ecological, historical, economic and general environmental factors that influence silver fir-beech forests. In this paper, we present a synthesis of four research projects carried out in Dinaric silver fir-beech forests in the last decade: 1) regeneration ecology in small and medium canopy gaps; 2) stand response to intermediate wind disturbance in the old-growth silver fir-beech Perućica forest; 3) long-term changes in tree species composition of old-growth forests in South East Europe; and 4) interdependence between regeneration and silvicultural systems. The aim of the paper is to show the role of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> in the development of silver fir-beech forest, and to highlight the processes that lead to its coexistence or exclusion. Research on the ecology of regeneration suggests that <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> regenerates better on special microsites (e. g. coolersites with more soil moisture, CWD, high rock coverage, lower pH of the soil, poor light conditions). In medium sized gaps beech is dominant, while <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> establishes itself later under the young beech canopy. Our research did not confirm the hypothesis of better regeneration success of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> in larger canopy gaps in managed forests. Repeated inventories from forest reserves in Slovenia and South-Eastern Europe show that <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> declined in the last fifty years due to a variety of causes, primarily from air pollution and ungulate browsing. In Slovenia in particular, a drastic reduction of the share of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> occurred rapidly. Comparisons with South-Eastern Europe suggest that a wide range of regeneration strategies of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> in Slovenia failed because of high densities of ungulates...|$|R

The crown production efficiency of Norway spruce is lower in comparison to the <b>silver</b> <b>fir.</b> For the equal basal area increment Norway spruce needs approximately 30 % (upper layer trees) to 60 % (lower layer trees) larger crown surface area than the <b>silver</b> <b>fir...</b>|$|R
40|$|Stand {{structures}} and spatial patterns were studied in three plots in the beechand <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> forest on the Karst Plateau in Slovenia. We mapped all stems > 10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) on 2 ha plots. The {{structure of the}} forest stands on three research plots varied in stand density and in the spatial distribution of stems, analysed using different methods for the characterisation of spatial distribution of trees. The mean relative differences for measuring tree density were substantially greater for trees 50 cm dbh class were less than 30 %. Based on theoretical models of spatial distribution, a tendency of clustering or clumping of trees {{was evident in the}} stand dominated by <b>silver</b> <b>fir.</b> In two beech and <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> stands, stems were aggregated in large patches of up to 0. 5 ha in size. The spatial distribution of <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> spruce and beech varied significantly (P< 0, 01) from a random distribution. Stems of these species aggregated in small and medium patches up to 0. 25 ha. Dominant trees were regularly and randomly distributed in the three stands, indicating that after the period of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> decline the structure of stands did not deteriorate...|$|R
