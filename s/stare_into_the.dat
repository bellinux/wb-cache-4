2500|$|The Japanese {{public was}} outraged on hearing the verdict. [...] The {{following}} {{ran in the}} Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shinbun, a paper that publicly protested the event in print. [...] "No matter how ignorant you may think the Japanese are, to claim that they could <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> face of danger and fail to recognize {{the gravity of the}} situation is absurd. [...] The idea that these people were too stupid to know how to save themselves or even get help from others is a grave fallacy." [...] Donations poured in {{from all over the country}} to support the families of the victims who lost their lives. [...] Entire newspapers covered nothing but stories about the incident for days on end, supported by mournful editorials and articles calling for the removal of the officials in question. [...] Even well-known legal scholars openly accused Captain Drake. [...] Fringe politicians across the land held open meetings in which they publicly condemned Britain's violence and record of violating human rights while they rallied for the return of political power to the Japanese people.|$|E

50|$|When she <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sun, {{she starts}} crying. The {{pigmentation}} in her irises makes her weak against bright lights.|$|R
6000|$|... (They {{go out on}} {{the porch}} and stand just outside the door [...] waiting for Eileen to notice them; but the girl in bed [...] {{continues}} to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods, oblivious to their presence.) ...|$|E
60|$|Vigorous puffs, and a {{resolute}} <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grate, declared {{he had no}} ear {{for this}} appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton's tones, and entered.|$|E

[A March morning, {{verging on}} seven o'clock, throws its cheerless [...] <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> private drawing-room of MARIE LOUISE, animating [...] the gilt {{furniture}} {{to only a}} feeble shine. Two chamberlains of [...] the palace are there in waiting. They look from the windows and [...] yawn.] ...|$|E
60|$|Holmes sat {{for some}} little time {{twisting}} this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{during which}} Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{crackling}} fire.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1973 film American Graffiti, Richard Dreyfuss' {{character}} sings {{along to}} the song while he <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> window of an appliance store.|$|R
60|$|Her {{last words}} {{came out of the}} darkness, which wrapped itself solidly about the boat. Yet they {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blackness in the direction in which the boat had disappeared, listening to the steady click of the oars in the rowlocks until it faded away and ceased.|$|E
6000|$|Vanderbank {{appeared}} for {{a minute}} to leave this appeal unheeded; he continued to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden while he smoked and swung the long leg he had thrown over {{the arm of the}} chair. When he at last spoke, however, it was with some emphasis--perhaps even with some vulgarity. [...] "Oh rot!" ...|$|E
60|$|Eliphalet {{had seen}} Mr. Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered. Terror, abject terror, seized him now, {{so that his}} knees smote together. As well <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sun as into the Colonel's face. In one stride he {{had a hand in}} the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other {{pointing}} down the path.|$|E
60|$|In silence they <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods {{while her}} fingers {{smoothed}} his knuckles. Her eyes were faint with tears, in the magic jade light.|$|R
60|$|Alec, fallen <b>into</b> deep thought, <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fire. Presently {{he took a}} long breath, {{rose from}} his chair, and drew himself to his full height.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> King <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> young Provost's face, {{and in the}} {{twilight}} of the room {{began to see that}} his face was quite white and his lip shaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] she begged. [...] "What we {{all need}} so much is encouragement, inspiration. Our {{greatest}} danger is lethargy. There are millions who <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness, who long for a single word of hope. Their eyes are almost tired. Come and speak to us to-morrow as you spoke {{to the men and}} women of Chicago." ...|$|E
60|$|When Janet reached Faber Street she halted on {{the corner}} of Stanley to <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> window of the glorified drugstore. But she gave no heed to the stationery, the cameras and candy {{displayed}} there, being in the emotional state that reduces to unreality objects of the commonplace, everyday world. Presently, however, she became aware of a man standing beside her.|$|E
60|$|How long he sat there, {{he remembered}} not; what he thought, he {{recalled}} not. But the wildest and most extravagant plans and resolves availed him {{nothing in the}} face of this forever desecrated home, and this shameful culmination of his ambitious life on the mountain. Once he thought of flight; but the reflection that he would still abandon his brother to shame, perhaps a self-contented shame, checked him hopelessly. Could he avert the future? He MUST; but how? Yet he could only sit and <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness in dumb abstraction.|$|E
60|$|Katharine stirred her spoon {{round and}} round, <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swirl of the tea, and {{remained}} silent. Mr. Clacton, meanwhile, framed a question which, after a moment's hesitation, he put to Katharine.|$|R
60|$|Lonely {{and miserable}} {{she sat down}} by <b>the</b> fire and <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> red embers. Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put her head on her hands, and sobbed passionately.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hoopdriver <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Immensity of the Future. He was rigid with emotion. It {{was like}} abusing the Lions in Trafalgar Square. But the heathkeeper felt his honour was at stake.|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes, when I {{sit in the}} chimney-corner of {{a winter}} evening, smoking my pipe with my old messmate Tom Lokins, I <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fire, and think of the days gone by, till I forget where I am, and go on {{thinking}} so hard that the flames seem to turn into melting fires, and {{the bars of the}} grate into dead fish, and the smoke into sails and rigging, and I go to work cutting up the blubber and stirring the oil-pots, or pulling the bow-oar and driving the harpoon at such a rate that I can't help giving a shout, which causes Tom to start and cry:-- ...|$|E
60|$|She lost no time {{in getting}} away from the grounds, being guided by a dim starlight and a glow in the east that was a promise of morning. With rapid steps she {{made her way to the}} station, {{reaching}} it over the rough country road just as the train pulled in. She had been possessed with the idea that someone was stealthily following her and under the light of the depot lamps her first act was to swing around and <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness from which she had emerged. She almost expected to see Miss Stearne appear, but it was only a little man with a fat nose and a shabby suit of clothes, who had probably come from the village to catch the same train she wanted. He paid no attention to the girl but entered the same car she did and quietly took his seat in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|And {{this was}} true. He {{was still under}} the fresh sortilege of their common life, the {{surprise}} of novelty, the flattered vanity of his possession of this woman; for a man must feel that, unless he has ceased to be masculine. Her eyes moved in his direction, rested on him, then returned to their <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deeper gloom {{at the foot of}} the straight tree-trunks, whose spreading crowns were slowly withdrawing their shade. The warm air stirred slightly about her motionless head. She would not look at him, from some obscure fear of betraying herself. She felt in her innermost depths an irresistible desire to give herself up to him more completely, by some act of absolute sacrifice. This was something of which he did not seem to have an idea. He was a strange being without needs. She felt his eyes fixed upon her; and as he kept silent, she said uneasily--for she didn't know what his silences might mean: ...|$|E
60|$|So {{were the}} others, and they <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{darkness}} under the apple trees in perplexity. The dog was coming closer, {{and to get}} away by running appeared {{to be out of}} the question.|$|R
50|$|The Man feels {{lonely and}} broken, still {{overwhelmed}} by his former blindness concerning the world. He {{could be a}} hero, but he was blind. Not knowing what to do, he <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> computer screen.|$|R
60|$|No {{person was}} to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin {{flattened}} their noses against <b>the</b> window, and <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk.|$|R
60|$|Then, all day long, {{there is}} a retinue of mouldy gigs and chaise-carts in the street; and herds of shabby vampires, Jew and Christian, {{over-run}} the house, sounding the plate-glass minors with their knuckles, striking discordant octaves on the Grand Piano, drawing wet forefingers over the pictures, breathing on the blades of the best dinner-knives, punching the squabs of chairs and sofas with their dirty fists, touzling the feather beds, opening and shutting all the drawers, balancing the silver spoons and forks, looking into the very threads of the drapery and linen, and disparaging everything. There is not a secret place in the whole house. Fluffy and snuffy strangers <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen-range as curiously as into the attic clothes-press. Stout men with napless hats on, look {{out of the bedroom}} windows, and cut jokes with friends in the street. Quiet, calculating spirits withdraw into the dressing-rooms with catalogues, and make marginal notes thereon, with stumps of pencils. Two brokers invade the very fire-escape, and take a panoramic survey of the neighbourhood {{from the top of the}} house. The swarm and buzz, and going up and down, endure for days. The Capital Modern Household Furniture, &c., is on view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gold-mining!" [...] {{he broke}} in; [...] "ah! yes, I once went gold-mining at Pilgrims' Rest in the Transvaal, {{and it was}} after that {{that we had the}} {{business}} about Jim-Jim and the lions. Do you know Pilgrim's Rest? Well, it is, or was, one of the queerest little places you ever saw. The town itself was pitched in a stony valley, with mountains all about it, {{and in the middle of}} such scenery as one does not often get the chance of seeing. Many and many is the time that I have thrown down my pick and shovel in disgust, clambered out of my claim, and walked a couple of miles or so to the top of some hill. Then I would lie down in the grass and look out over the glorious stretch of country--the smiling valleys, the great mountains touched with gold--real gold of the sunset, and clothed in sweeping robes of bush, and <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> depths of the perfect sky above; yes, and thank Heaven I had got away from the cursing and the coarse jokes of the miners, and the voices of those Basutu Kaffirs as they toiled in the sun, the memory of which is with me yet.|$|E
6000|$|Lawford {{thought on}} a little further. 'You know how one sees oneself in a passion--why, how a child looks--the whole face darkened and drawn and possessed? That was the change. That's how it seems {{to come back to}} me. And something, somebody, dodging behind the eyes. Yes; more that than even any {{excessive}} change of feature, except, of course, that I also seemed--Shall I ever forget that first cold, stifling <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> looking-glass! I certainly was much darker, even my hair. But I've told you all this before,' he added wearily, 'and the scores and scores of times I've thought it. I used to sit up there in the big spare bedroom my wife put me up in, simply gloating. My flesh seemed nothing more than an hallucination: there I was, haunting my body, an old grinning tenement, and all that I thought I wanted, and couldn't do without, all I valued and prided myself on--stacked up in the drizzling street below. Why, Herbert, our bodies are only glass or cloud. They melt, don't they, like wax in the sun once we're out. But those first few days don't make very pleasant thinking. Friday night was the first, when I sat there like a twitching waxwork, soberly debating between Bedlam here and Bedlam hereafter. I even sometimes wonder whether its very repetition has not dulled the memory or distorted it. My wife,' he added ingenuously, 'seems to think there are signs of a slight improvement--a going back, I mean. But I'm not sure whether she meant it.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{thrust the}} little man aside as he spoke, and {{mounting}} on the steps, which were half let down, pulled down the blind by force, and <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chaise like an ogre into his larder.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} opened {{eyes that}} transfixed Venters. They were fathomless blue. Consciousness {{of death was}} there, a blended terror and pain, but no consciousness of sight. She did not see Venters. She <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> unknown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let him go," [...] he said, not {{raising his}} voice. <b>The</b> man <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little chauffeur's eyes and {{released}} his {{hold of the}} revolver. Wampus looked at it, grunted, {{and put it in}} his pocket.|$|R
