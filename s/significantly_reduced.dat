40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Motherwort total alkaloids on prostatitis model of mice. Methods:Different groups of mice for Motherwort total alkaloids are given high,medium,low suspension. Observe the number of white blood cells, lecithin corpuscle density groups in prostatic fluid and the morphological changes of prostate,testis, epididymis. Results:Compared with the model group, the Motherwort total alkaloidss high, medium dose group can <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the number of white blood cells of prostate in mice model of prostatitis and increase lecithin corpuscle number (P< 0. 01); the Motherwort total alkaloidss high dose group <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the pathological changes of prostatitis (P< 0. 01); the Motherwort total alkaloidss medium dose group <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the pathological changes of prostatitis (P< 0. 05). the Motherwort total alkaloidss high dose group <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the pathological changes of testis (P< 0. 05) and it can <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> the pathological changes of the epididymis (P< 0. 01).

5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service for only a few years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E

While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E

The present day Tioga Road, now part of California State Route 120, was dedicated in 1961.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the salt}} {{extraction}} activities gradually went into decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt {{produced in the}} Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> outputs from pearl hunting. However, commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common.|$|E

5|$|In 504 the Gepids' {{power was}} <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> by the Ostrogoths, who cut short their {{expansion}} into the Danubian plains. The Gepids restricted {{themselves to the}} eastern part of the Pannonian Basin; this was to form the core of Thurisind's dominions, just as it had under the previous Gepid kings. By the early 6th century, the Gepid nobility converted to Arian Christianity, while most of the Gepids remained pagans.|$|E

5|$|On 28 October 1940, Italy invaded Greece, {{initiating}} the Greco-Italian War {{as part of}} the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's expansionist ambitions. The Greek army quickly defeated the Italians and pushed them back to Albania. Less than two weeks later, the Italian fleet was badly damaged in the British Raid on Taranto, which <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> the threat the Italian Regia Marina posed to the Greek fleet. From the start of the conflict, Kilkis was used as a floating battery based in Salamis. Spare guns from Kilkis and Lemnos were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced.</b> During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E

Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs.
