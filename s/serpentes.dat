5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including <b>Serpentes,</b> Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet.|$|E
25|$|All modern snakes {{are grouped}} within the {{suborder}} <b>Serpentes</b> in Linnean taxonomy, {{part of the}} order Squamata, though their precise placement within squamates remains controversial.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of snakes is {{relatively}} poor because snake skeletons are typically small and fragile making fossilization uncommon. Fossils readily identifiable as snakes (though often retaining hind limbs) first {{appear in the}} fossil record during the Cretaceous period. The earliest known true snake fossils (members of the crown group <b>Serpentes)</b> come from the marine simoliophiids, the oldest {{of which is the}} Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian age) Haasiophis terrasanctus, dated to between 112 and 94 million years old.|$|E
25|$|Venom evolved {{just once}} among all Toxicofera {{approximately}} 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the huge venom diversity seen today. The original toxicoferan venom {{was a very}} simple set of proteins that were assembled {{in a pair of}} glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins evolved independently in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including <b>Serpentes,</b> Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages have since lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet. The evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} zoonotic reservoirs are cattle, sheep and goats. In addition, in recent years, cryptosporidiosis has plagued many commercial leopard gecko breeders. [...] Several {{species of the}} Cryptosporidium family (C. <b>serpentes</b> and others) are involved, and outside of geckos {{it has been found}} in monitor lizards, iguanas and tortoises, as well as several snake species.|$|E
2500|$|The two infraorders of <b>Serpentes</b> are: Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia. This {{separation}} {{is based on}} morphological characteristics and mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity. Alethinophidia is sometimes split into Henophidia and Caenophidia, with the latter consisting of [...] "colubroid" [...] snakes (colubrids, vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and atractaspids) and acrochordids, while the other alethinophidian families comprise Henophidia. While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi.|$|E
2500|$|Snakes are elongated, legless, {{carnivorous}} reptiles of the suborder <b>Serpentes.</b> Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates {{covered in}} overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, {{enabling them to}} swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one {{in front of the}} other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty five times indepenently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards. [...] Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).|$|E

50|$|All recent {{molecular}} {{studies suggest}} that several groups form a venom clade, which encompasses a majority (nearly 60%) of squamate species. Named Toxicofera, it combines the groups <b>Serpentes</b> (snakes), Iguania (agamids, chameleons, iguanids, etc.), and Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, Gila monster, glass lizards, etc.).|$|E
50|$|The Colubroidea are a {{superfamily}} in the suborder <b>Serpentes</b> (snakes). It contains over 85% of all {{the extant}} species of snakes. Their largest component is the family Colubridae, but it also includes at least six other families. It {{has been found to}} be monophyletic.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{commentators}} in Europe often grouped [...] "crawling things" [...] (reptiles or reptilia in Latin) together, {{and thus}} creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin salamandrae), dragons (Latin dracones or <b>serpentes),</b> and basilisks (Latin basilisci), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon of 1557.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to these}} recent studies {{investigating}} venom glands in squamates, lizards {{that were previously}} thought of as being nonvenomous are now being classified by some scientists as venomous because they possess a venom gland.

5000|$|Along {{with other}} varanid lizards, {{such as the}} Komodo dragon and the lace monitor, megalania belongs to the {{proposed}} clade Toxicofera, which contains all known reptile clades possessing toxin-secreting oral glands, {{as well as their}} close, non-venomous relatives, including Iguania, Anguimorpha, and <b>Serpentes.</b> Being a member of Anguimorpha, megalania may have been venomous and if so, would be the largest venomous vertebrate known.|$|E
