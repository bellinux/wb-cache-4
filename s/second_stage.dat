5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} {{attitude control system}}. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the <b>second</b> <b>stage,</b> Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the <b>second</b> <b>stage,</b> which eliminated him from the race.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Avuis Adrian R. Huber {{believed}} that Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, Adriano Baffi, and Fabio Baldato {{had a great}} {{chance to win a}} stage in the race. Notable sprinter Mario Cipollini did not participate in the race as he was still recovering from injuries sustained in the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> at the Vuelta a España.|$|E
5|$|Borgarello won his <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> {{with his}} {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> of the race two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race and finish the final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>second</b> <b>stage,</b> the organisers {{had made}} the option to {{postpone}} the start by two hours, in case the mistral wind was making cycling difficult. This was not necessary, so the riders started at midnight as planned.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the <b>second</b> <b>stage,</b> pig iron is converted to wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|Three stages may be distinguished: {{an initial}} stage {{in which the}} {{individual}} with PD has already developed some disability requiring pharmacological treatment, a <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.|$|E
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{clubs in}} the Copa Libertadores receive US$250,000 for {{advancing}} into the <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> and US$300,000 per home match in the group phase. That amount is derived from television rights and stadium advertising. The payment per home match increases to US$550,000 in the round of 16. The prize money then increases as each quarterfinalist receives US$650,000, US$700,000 is given to each semifinalist, US$1,000,000 is awarded the runner-up, and the winner earns US$2,300,000.|$|E
5|$|Attributed or {{imaginary}} arms {{appeared in}} {{literature in the}} middle of the 12th century, particularly in Arthurian legends. During the generation following Chrétien de Troyes, about 40 of Arthur's knights had attributed coats of arms (Pastoreau 1997a, 259). A <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> of development occurred during the 14th and 15th centuries when Arthurian arms expanded to include as many as 200 attributed coats of arms.|$|E
