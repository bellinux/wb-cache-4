40|$|Issue: The {{processed}} {{wood waste}} discharged from a size-reduction machine varies widely in sizes. Depending on {{the method of}} size-reduction (e. g., hog, <b>shredder,</b> <b>chipper),</b> the general geometric form of the processed wood may range from a coarse fragment or shred of wood to a sharp-edged chip. Most manufacturing feedstock specifications call for a certain size range of shreds and chips; thus, processors must remove the unacceptable sizes from the fiber to satisfy these size requirements. Fragments or chips that are larger than the allowable size ranges {{are referred to as}} overs. Fragments or chips that are smaller than the allowable size ranges are referred to as fines. The wood fiber that meets the specified size range is referred to as accepts. A manufacturing feedstock specification limits the amount of overs and fines that can accompany the accepts in a given shipment of wood fiber, usually by establishing an allowable weight percentage. Although careful adjustments to the size-reduction equipment can maximize the production of accepts from the wood waste, the production of overs and fines is an inevitable side effect of any size-reduction process. (Some size-reduction equipment has a tendency to produce more overs and fines than others). Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using vibrating or gyratory screens to separate overs and fines from acceptable processed wood fiber...|$|E
5000|$|In the runup to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, press stories {{appeared}} in the United Kingdom and United States of a plastic <b>shredder</b> or wood <b>chipper</b> into which Saddam and Qusay Hussein fed opponents of their Baathist rule. These stories attracted worldwide attention and boosted support for military action, in stories with titles such as [...] "See men shredded, then say you don't back war". A year later, it was determined {{there was no evidence}} to support the existence of such a machine.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 March 2003, James Mahon made first {{mention of}} the claims that some Iraqis were killed in plastic {{shredders}} or wooden chippers, when he addressed the House of Commons after returning from research in northern Iraq. Six days later, Clwyd wrote an article in The Times entitled [...] "See men shredded, then say you dont back war," [...] saying that an unnamed Iraqi had said that Saddam and Qusay Hussein fed opponents of their Baathist rule into a plastic <b>shredder</b> or wood <b>chipper,</b> and then used their shredded bodies as fish food. Later she would add that it {{was believed to be}} housed in Abu Ghraib prison, and spoke with an unidentified person who claimed the American-sourced shredders were dismantled [...] "just before the military got there". As the first journalist to state the unsubstantiated claim, the rolling effect of the gruesome verbal picture garnered wider media and international political support, including from Australian Prime Minister John Howard, for an invasion of Iraq. The Suns political editor Trevor Kavanagh wrote in February 2004 {{that as a result of}} Clwyds article [...] "Public opinion swung behind Tony Blair, as voters learned how Saddam fed dissidents feet first into industrial shredders." [...] As she had been vocal and prominent in her concern for the situation in Iraq before the war, Tony Blair made her a Special Envoy on Human Rights in Iraq in the run-up to the war.|$|R
