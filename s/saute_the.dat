40|$|AbstractBackgroundHand grip {{strength}} is often considered may predict cognitive functioning {{and has been}} established as associates of cognitive performance with individual differences in some particular cross-sectional studies. However, {{little is known about}} hand {{grip strength}} and cognitive performance in the elderly individuals, and it is not known whether changes in hand grip strength may be associated with preservation/decline in cognitive functioning. ObjectivesWe have studied the impact of hand grip strength on cognition function in healthy kitchen workers. MethodsParticipants (n= 90, age range: 25 – 40 years) randomly assigned in to two groups according to their nature of work: Group I-Control group (n= 47) - workers recruited for simple work such as dusting, cleaning dining tables and floor. Group II-Study group (n= 43) - workers recruited for firm work such as cooking large quantity of food, kneading dough, rolling chapattis, cut and <b>sauté</b> <b>the</b> vegetables and dish washing. For the analyses, we used at dominant and non- dominant hand; hand grip strength (HGS), reaction time task, sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both the groups. ResultWe observed that visual reaction time (VRT) and auditory reaction time (ART) were significantly improved in dominant hand of study group, when compare to control group; however it was comparable in non-dominant hand among both the groups. In addition to; among all control and study group female workers there was significant positive correlation between VRT & ART and significant negative correlation between at dominant hand HGS & VRT as well as between at dominant hand HGS & ART. We also observed that dominant hand HGS {{was a significant predictor of}} VRT and ART and however there was no any significant variation in body mass index (BMI), sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both groups. ConclusionWe found that muscle strength (as measured by hand grip strength) was associated with improved reaction time. Hence by using a simple muscle strength test; is one way of obtaining useful information for the development of nerve-muscle coordination. Increased handgrip strength would be associated with preservation of cognitive function...|$|E
50|$|Sofrito is a meat (lamb, beef, chicken) sautéed with potatoes, garlic, turmeric, and {{cardamom}} and simmered {{in a small}} {{volume of}} water or stock with lemon juice, or simmered with all these ingredients without prior <b>sautéing.</b> <b>The</b> second method {{can also be used}} in cooking veal, calves' brains or fish.It is mostly common to eat it with chicken although other types of meat are sometimes also used.|$|R
50|$|Sautéed {{mushrooms}} is {{a common}} dish prepared by <b>the</b> <b>sautéing</b> of sliced or whole edible mushrooms. Butter is typically used when <b>sautéing</b> <b>the</b> dish, and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used. Clarified butter can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter. The dish is typically cooked for over a high heat until the mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added. Overcooking may create an inferior dish by the causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled.|$|R
50|$|In the Sephardi Jewish cuisine of {{the eastern}} Mediterranean and the Maghreb, the term sofrito {{emphasizes}} a method of cooking rather than a specific combination of aromatics.

50|$|Only enough fat to lightly {{coat the}} bottom of the pan is needed for sautéing; too much fat will cause the food to fry rather than just to slide, and may {{interfere}} with the development of fond. The food is spread across the hot fat in the pan, and left to brown, turning or tossing frequently for even cooking. <b>The</b> <b>sauté</b> technique involves gripping the handle of <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> pan firmly, and using a sharp elbow motion to rapidly jerk the pan back toward the cook, repeating as necessary to ensure the ingredients have been thoroughly jumped. Tossing or stirring the items in the pan by shaking the pan too often, however, can cause the pan to cool faster and make <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> take longer.|$|R
2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with {{feet flat on the floor}} or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> method, <b>the</b> dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|R
40|$|Classical ballet is a {{performance}} art where unintentional and uncontrolled movement degrades the aesthetic. Vertical torso movement can induce body tilt. Postural sway {{was measured in}} pre-professional ballet dancers when performing simple vertical movements. 47 pre-professional dancers (5 males and 42 females, mean age in years = 19. 2, SD= ± 1. 3) on a full time undergraduate dance program were asked to stand in first position and perform a demi-plié, a relevé and a sauté. These movements were performed in a continuous cycle undertaken 15 consecutive times. The first 5 cycles were undertaken as practice. The second set of 5 cycles were recorded with the arms held in Bras bas, with the final 5 having the arms held in fifth position (rounded arms placed above the head). Accelerometers were attached to the lumber spine (L 4) and thoracic spine (T 1 -T 2). The tilt during the demi-plié prior to <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> and relevé increased significantly for both arm positions. The male participants preparative angle change was {{much larger than the}} female participants (p = 0. 07). No significant angle change was observed between the Bras bas and arms in fifth position for <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> but <b>the</b> change is significant for the relevé (p = 0. 007). Exaggerated forward tilt is undesirable both aesthetically and biomechanically. Small accelerometer sensors on the spine can allow self-monitoring practice of these basic classical ballet movements...|$|R

50|$|Ingredients for sautéing {{are usually}} {{cut into pieces}} or thinly sliced to {{facilitate}} fast cooking. The primary mode of heat transfer during sautéing is conduction between the pan and the food being cooked. Food that is sautéed is browned while preserving its texture, moisture, and flavor. If meat, chicken, or fish is sautéed, <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> is often finished by deglazing the pan's residue to make a sauce.|$|R
50|$|When {{the sauce}} {{is used to}} {{accompany}} sautéed meat or poultry, it is made directly in <b>the</b> <b>sauté</b> pan in which these items were cooked.

50|$|In a <b>sauté,</b> all <b>the</b> {{ingredients}} are heated at once, and cooked quickly. To facilitate this, the {{ingredients are}} rapidly moved {{around in the}} pan, either {{by the use of}} a utensil, or by repeatedly jerking the pan itself. A sauté pan must be large enough to hold all of the food in one layer, so steam can escape, which keeps the ingredients from stewing and promotes the development of fond. Most pans sold specifically as sauté pans have a wide flat base and low sides, to maximize the surface area available for heating. The low sides allow quick evaporation and escape of steam. While skillets typically have flared or rounded sides, sauté pans typically have straight, vertical sides. This keeps the ingredients from escaping as the pan is jerked or stirred.|$|R

Decorative garnishes are then applied. The canapés are usually served on a canapé salver and eaten from small canapé plates. The technical composition of a canapé consists of a base (e.g., the bread or pancake), a spread, a main item, and a garnish.

40|$|Biomedical {{laser light}} {{dosimetry}} relies on spatial light distribution measurements {{in combination with}} the appropriate laser-tissue interaction model that may be used to determine the tissue Optical Coefficients and the fluorophore concentration from its fluorescence spectra. Therefore. modelling of light transport in tissue. for optimization of laser dosimetry, requires the development of simple theoretical models and the experimental implementation in tissue-simulating phantoms, with known optical and fluorescence properties. Low cost phantoms were used, based on agar dissolved ill water as the transparent matrix, The latter is loaded with various amounts of Intralipid and fluorophores as light scatterer and absorbers, respectively. The optical properties of these phantoms were measured at two different visible wavelengths. By comparing the fluorescence emission spectra of the turbid samples containing <b>the</b> <b>saute</b> fluorophore in different concentrations, we can calculate the concentration. In addition. the evaluation of the scattering and absorption co-efficients allow us to predict the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside and outside of the phantom. It seems that the Monte Carlo simulation is an effective and relatively simple mathematical approach for tissue optical properties evaluation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} vegetables subjected to minimal processing (in MAP, and intended for cooking or {{for use in}} salads), dehydrated condiments and ready-to-eat vegetables such as soups and purees, was assessed by reference {{to their ability to}} scavenge lipoperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity. In the case, the MAP vegetables the measurements were repeated during eight days of storage in a domestic refrigerator and after cooking (boiling, microwaving, pressure cooking, griddling, frying and baking). MAP vegetables had a good or very good antioxidant capacity, and showed no significant loss of antioxidant activity or scavenging capacity compared with fresh vegetables. The cooking treatments that keep the antioxidant activity of MAP vegetables are microwaving, <b>sautéing</b> and baking. <b>The</b> most aggressive method of cooking were steaming, boiling and frying. The dehydrated condiments (tablets) showed higher antioxidant activity than the ready-to-eat soup. The enrichment of stews and casseroles, with dehydrated vegetable tablets, and the consumption of soup or vegetable purees represent an increased antioxidant intake in our diet. Also ‘‘ready-to-eat” vegetable soups show antioxidant activity after they have been submitted to heat treatment to increase their shelf-life.

40|$|The {{effect of}} jazz shoes on dance {{performance}} Despite dancers performing up to 200 jumps per class, {{the effect of}} dance shoes on jump performance has not previously been explored. Sautés are a two-legged dance jump used {{as a foundation for}} more complex jumps. The aims of this thesis were to explore the impact attenuation properties of jazz shoes and their effect on sauté height, landing and takeoff technique, and impact attenuation. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to examine the impact attenuation effect of conventional shoes compared to barefoot during weight-bearing activities (Chapter 2). Few studies investigated the effect of shoes on jump landings, with no studies investigating dance shoes. Mechanical impact testing of four different jazz shoe designs was performed to determine their impact attenuation properties. The newest jazz sneaker design was the most impact attenuating jazz shoe despite another design having a thicker sole. 3 D motion analysis of dancers performing a series of eight <b>sautés</b> in <b>the</b> different shoes with and without music was undertaken. Jump height was reduced in the high-heeled shoes compared to all other shoe conditions with a subsequent increase in stance time to synchronise with the music (Chapter 3). Knee flexion was greater in high-heeled shoes, and ankle flexion was greater in all jazz shoes than barefoot. Conversely, midfoot and MPJ motion was reduced by all jazz shoe designs (Chapter 4). Knee joint stiffness was reduced in high heeled shoes and both sneaker designs compared to barefoot (Chapter 5). The jazz shoes reduced midfoot joint velocity thus restricting midfoot joint power, with the opposite effect at the ankle during both landing and propulsive phases (Chapter 6). The jazz shoes tested in this thesis altered lower limb motion, with larger kinematic and kinetic changes displayed in the Chorus shoes resulting in a subsequent decrease in jump height. Future research should assess dance shoe design in terms of both function and aesthetic performance. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|We present {{ab initio}} {{calculated}} electric-field gradient tensors at Cd sites {{in a set}} of simple. yet diverse noncubic metals. By combining these predictions with carefully selected published experimental data, the nuclear quadrupole moment of the 245 keV 5 / 2 (+) level of Cd- 111 is determined to be 0. 76 (2) b. Knowing this quadrupole moment is important for time-differential perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy: decades of experimentally obtained nuclear quadrupole coupling constants for solids can now be more reliably converted into electronic structure information. For nuclear physics systematics, this is a rare opportunity to have reliable quadrupole moment information for a short-lived, level, that is not accessible to regular experimental methods. Much effort is spent on the determination of a meaningful error bar, which is an-aspect that gained only recently more attention in the context of density-functional theory predictions. This required assessing the numerical uncertainty in density functional theory predictions for electric-field gradient-tensors in solids. In contrast to quantum chemistry methods, these density functional theory predictions cannot detect systematic errors. By comparing our quadrupole moment value with an independent value Obtained from quantum chemistry calculations and experiment, we show that systematic errors are small for the systems studied here. Yet; there are indications that-density functional theory underestimates by a few percent the electric-field gradient, and therefore overestimates the quadrupole Moment by <b>the</b> <b>saute</b> amount.

His father’s family is descended from Florian Hitz, the first Swiss ambassador to the United States, and the elder Hitz was a civic leader and devoted visionary at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. Both his parents were formally educated in Europe, and Hitz spent considerable time as a youth at the family home in France. His parents divorced when Hitz was three years old, and his mother remarried Robert Shaw, a Grammy Award-winning symphonic and choral conductor.
