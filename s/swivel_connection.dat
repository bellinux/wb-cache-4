40|$|Multifilament {{longline}} with <b>swivel</b> <b>connection</b> between gangions and mainline {{were compared}} with traditionally rigged gear on a vessel equipped with a mechanized longline system. The swivel-lines were adapted to the mechanized system without difficulties. The effect of the swivels was clearly positive, both regarding catch rate (+ 15 %) and easier handling of the gear...|$|E
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{are widely used}} in chemical process, oil and gas industry. One of the main ap-plications are disconnect able mooring systems (<b>SWIVEL</b> <b>connections)</b> for offshore Floating Production Storage and Offloading units (FPSO). Due to the increasing demand for energy ever larger cast or forged parts are required in the offshore industry. It is a well known fact that in larger duplex stainless steel forgings precipitation of detrimental phases can take place, such as Sigma phase or nitrides. Impact strength at low temperature and corrosion resistance will be influenced by these precipitations. Therefo-re mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of ring rolled products with large wall thicknesses are the main objective of this report. Hence, mechanical properties including impact strength were determined {{as a function of}} specimen test location depth in a part that failed during acceptance testing. Additionally two test rings with identical wall thickness and different forging ratios were investigated in the same manner. Corrosion resistance tests were performed according to ASTM G 48 and in some cases Critical Pitting Temperature (CPT) was established. The microstructure was examined via Optical Microscopy as well as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). A Focused Ion Beam (FIB) device was used to micromachine TEM foils at evident sites in SEM specimens.

50|$|The product <b>swivel</b> is the <b>connection</b> {{between the}} {{geostatic}} and the rotating {{parts of the}} buoy. The swivel enables an offloading tanker to rotate {{with respect to the}} mooring buoy. Product swivels range in size {{depending on the size of}} attached piping and risers. Product swivels can provide one or several independent paths for fluids, gases, electrical signals or power. Swivels are equipped with a multiple seal arrangement to minimise the possibility of leakage of product into the environment.|$|R
50|$|A <b>swivel</b> is a <b>connection</b> {{that allows}} the {{connected}} object, such as a gun or chair, to rotate horizontally or vertically. A common design for a swivel is a cylindrical rod that can turn freely within a support structure. The rod is usually prevented from slipping out by a nut, washer or thickening of the rod. The device can {{be attached to the}} ends of the rod or the center. Another common design is a sphere that is able to rotate within a support structure. The device is attached to the sphere. A third design is a hollow cylindrical rod that has a rod that is slightly smaller than its inside diameter inside of it. They are prevented from coming apart by flanges. The device may be attached to either end.|$|R
