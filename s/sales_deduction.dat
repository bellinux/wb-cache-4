5000|$|For {{vehicles}} {{valued at}} less than $500, the deduction amount comes from the donor's own estimate of the car's value, even if the charity receives less money from its <b>sale.</b> <b>Deductions</b> greater than $500 are limited to the proceeds of selling the vehicle, usually at auction. The U.S Internal Revenue Service advises that starting in 2005: ...|$|R
5000|$|The credit {{provider}} {{must give}} to the consumer a notice indicating the settlement amount before the sale, the amount realised by the sale, and the net proceeds of the <b>sale</b> (after <b>deduction</b> of default charges {{and the costs of}} the sale).|$|R
50|$|Despite {{voting against}} {{a bill that}} would have raised the minimum wage, {{extended}} <b>sales</b> tax <b>deductions,</b> and cut estate taxes, Cantwell supports an increase in the federal minimum wage. She explained her vote against the bill by noting that the bill would have represented a $5 per hour wage drop for over 120,000 tip workers in Washington and overridden existing state minimum wage laws and was an attempt by the Republican party to pass its estate tax cut bill, which continuously failed to pass on its own in the senate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state budget}} {{is a major}} {{government}} instrument in carrying out the country's economic goals. Expenditures represented about three-quarters of GNP in the mid-1980s—the allocation of which reflected the priorities assigned to different economic sectors. Taxes were abolished in 1974 as [...] "remnants of an antiquated society." [...] This action, however, was not expected to have any significant effect on state revenue because the overwhelming proportion of government funds—an average of 98.1% during 1961-70—was from turnover (<b>sales)</b> taxes, <b>deductions</b> from profits paid by state enterprises, and various user fees on machinery and equipment, irrigation facilities, television sets, and water.|$|R
50|$|On July 27, 2007 Africa Sports {{announced}} that they have sacked Moriero, appointing his assistant Salvatore Nobile as new boss. On August 7, Moriero signed for Serie C1's Lanciano, guiding the club under massive financial issues that successively led to bankrupt, an auction-regulated <b>sale</b> and point <b>deductions</b> throughout the season. He successively guided F.C. Crotone to win the Lega Pro Prima Divisione playoffs and achieve promotion to Serie B in the 2008-09 season.|$|R
40|$|The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 {{included}} the largest business {{tax cut in}} U. S. history, embodied in the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. This paper describes in detail {{the provisions of the}} new treatment of depreciable property,and analyzes in a fairly nontechnical way its economic impact. Particular attention is paid to a novel part of ACRS that creates a "safe harbor" {{for a wide range of}} saleâ€”leaseback arrangements, effectively permitting the <b>sale</b> of depreciation <b>deductions</b> by investors without taxable income. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 {{he led the}} {{successful}} effort to restore the <b>sales</b> tax <b>deduction,</b> which had been eliminated in 1986. Brady {{has been a leader}} on free trade within Congress, serving as President George W. Bush's point man on {{the successful}} passage of the Central America Free Trade Agreement and the recent agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. However, he is best known as the author of a federal [...] "sunset law" [...] that would require every federal program not specifically written into the Constitution to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination. He has introduced this bill at the beginning of every Congress. It was approved overwhelmingly by the House as an amendment in 2004 but did not progress further. In 2006 it passed the Government Reform Committee but did not reach a floor vote.|$|R
50|$|Pallat, a painter, asks {{to breakfast}} some known patrons of art. He then, {{with the aid}} of Dactyl, a poet, and Friendly, a comedian, sells by auction as {{original}} works some copies of paintings executed by his acquaintance. The proceeds of the <b>sale,</b> after the <b>deduction</b> {{of the cost of the}} breakfast and the true value of the paintings, are to be devoted to a fund for the relief of lunatics. The characters include Sir Bubble Buyall, Formal (a connoisseur), Lady Squeeze, Bow and Scrape (two hookers-in).|$|R
50|$|If a donor is {{contributing}} property {{that would have}} yielded a long-term capital gain in a <b>sale,</b> then the <b>deduction</b> for the contribution is limited to 30% of donor's adjusted gross income {{in the year of}} donation if the donee is a public charitiy, and limited to 20% if the donee is a private foundation. Contributions over the respective AGI thresholds may be carried forward for five years, and may be deducted in subsequent years pursuant to the same restrictions. This restriction helps certain investors avoid giving themselves into such a low bracket that the tax value of the donation is impaired.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Harley and Darren Morenstein {{attempted}} to lock out co-creator Sterling Toth claiming that Toth wasn't fulfilling {{his role as}} cameraman and chief technician, {{to the detriment of}} the company. Toth responded to these allegations by taking up the issue in the Québec Superior Court, where he obtained a judgement ordering the Morensteins and Nexttime Productions Ltd. to provide him with a monthly account of <b>sales,</b> salaries and <b>deductions,</b> and obtain signed authorizations for any cash withdrawals from Nexttime intended for them or members of their family. Subsequent legal proceedings were settled out of court, though neither party has alluded to the exact details of the settlement. Toth was no longer part of the company following the lawsuit.|$|R
