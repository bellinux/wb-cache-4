By showing the {{difference between}} the two measures, it is demonstrated that the non-parametric calculated TFPG cannot be interpreted wholly as a cost saving technical change since the preconditions required in the calculation of TFPG are not met.

40|$|Abstract. Over {{recent years}} the field of phylogenetics has {{witnessed}} <b>significant</b> algorithmic and <b>technical</b> <b>progress.</b> A new class of efficient phylogeny programs allows for computation of large evolutionary trees comprising 500 – 1. 000 organisms {{within a couple of}} hours on a single CPU under elaborate optimization criteria. However, it is difficult to extract the valuable information contained in those large trees without appropriate visualization tools. As potential solution we propose the application of treemaps to visualize large phylogenies (evolutionary trees) and improve knowledge-retrieval. In addition, we propose a hybrid tree/treemap representation which provides a detailed view of subtrees via treemaps while maintaining a contextual view of the entire topology at the same time. Moreover, we demonstrate how it can be deployed to visualize an evolutionary tree comprising 2. 415 mammals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze both {{theoretically}} and empirically those factors which underlay the - empirically observable - inter-industry differences in <b>technical</b> <b>progress.</b> At the theoretical level economists agree more and more that <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> can be explained at the industry level by the following three factors: (1) the technological opportunities, (2) the appropriability conditions, meaning the ability to capture and protect the results of technical innovations and (3) the market demand conditions. The basic theoretical model was tested with the help of two sets of Swiss data. One set was made available by Swiss Federal Office of Statistics and consists of quantitative information on R&D expenditures, R&D personnel, total employment and sales figures for 124 (4 -digit SIC) industries for the year 1986. The second set was derived from a survey I carried out in the summer of 1988. 940 industry experts were approached; 358 of them, or 38 %, covering 127 industries, completed the questionnaire. The items on the questionnaire were related to the two supply-side determinants of <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> - items (1) and (2) above. For the empirical specification of the theoretical model, <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> (as the dependent variable) was measured by three indicators: an output indicator, representing the introduction rate of innovations since 1970; two input indicators, "share of R&D expenditures in sales" and "share of R&D personnel in total employment". All data were aggregated at the industry-level (4 -digit SIC). Three equations were estimated individually, using the OLS, GLS and Tobit methods. The most important results of the empirical analysis can be summarized as follows: - The ability to appropriate the results of innovations exerts a positive impact on <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> in all three models. In this context, the non-patent related means of appropriability "secrecy", "lead time", "moving downward on the learning curve" and "superior sales and service efforts" prove to be more important for the innovation process than the means "patents to protect against imitation" and "patents to secure royalty income". - Of all external sources of technological opportunities, domestic and foreign university research makes the largest quantitative and statistically most <b>significant</b> contribution to <b>technical</b> <b>progress.</b> -Science (i. e. education in 14 science fields) is on the whole relevant for <b>technical</b> <b>progress.</b> But its contribution to <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> would increase, if at the R&D level its application could be better targeted. - Of the six fields of basic science, only in mathematics and in theoretical computer science is education relevant for <b>technical</b> <b>progress.</b> - The relevance of education and training in the applied sciences for <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> is high and significant in the fields of medical science and electronics. - The impact of sales as an indicator for market demand is negative.

Twenty-nine clinical studies and four reviews of clinical applications of HD-sEMG were considered. The clinical studies concerned muscle fatigue, motor neuron diseases (MND), neuropathies, myopathies (mainly in patients with channelopathies), spontaneous muscle activity and MU firing rates. In principle, HD-sEMG allows pathological changes at the MU level to be detected, especially changes in neurogenic disorders and channelopathies.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate at pilot scale the use of solid honeycomb catalysts to promote the oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas from coal combustion. The project is being funded by the U. S. DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41185. EPRI, Great River Energy (GRE), and City Public Service (CPS) of San Antonio are project co-funders. URS Group is the prime contractor. The mercury catalytic oxidation process under development uses catalyst materials applied to honeycomb substrates to promote the oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas from coal-fired power plants that have wet lime or limestone flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems. Oxidized mercury is removed in the wet FGD absorbers and co-precipitates in a stable form with the byproducts from the FGD system.

40|$|Silicon-based {{ceramics}} {{are attractive}} materials {{for use in}} gas turbine engine hot sections due to their high temperature mechanical and physical properties as well as lower density than metals. The advantages of utilizing ceramic hot section components include weight reduction, and improved efficiency as well as enhanced power output and lower emissions {{as a result of}} reducing or eliminating cooling. Potential gas turbine ceramic components for industrial, commercial and/or military high temperature turbine applications include combustor liners, vanes, rotors, and shrouds. These components require materials that can withstand high temperatures and pressures for long duration under steam-rich environments. For Navy applications, ceramic hot section components have the potential to increase the operation range. The amount of weight reduced by utilizing a lighter gas turbine can be used to increase fuel storage capacity while a more efficient gas turbine consumes less fuel. Both improvements enable a longer operation range for Navy ships and aircraft. Ceramic hot section components will also be beneficial to the Navy's Growth Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and VAATE (Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines) initiatives in terms of reduced weight, cooling air savings, and capability/cost index (CCI). For DOE applications, ceramic hot section components provide an avenue to achieve low emissions while improving efficiency. Combustors made of ceramic material can withstand higher wall temperatures and require less cooling air. Ability of the ceramics to withstand high temperatures enables novel combustor designs that have reduced NO{sub x}, smoke and CO levels. In the turbine section, ceramic vanes and blades do not require sophisticated cooling schemes currently used for metal components. The saved cooling air could be used to further improve efficiency and power output. The objectives of this contract were to develop technologies critical for ceramic hot section components for gas turbine engines. <b>Significant</b> <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> has been made towards maturation of the EBC and CMC technologies for incorporation into gas turbine engine hot-section. Promising EBC candidates for longer life and/or higher temperature applications relative to current state of the art BSAS-based EBCs have been identified. These next generation coating systems have been scaled-up from coupons to components and are currently being field tested in Solar Centaur 50 S engine. CMC combustor liners were designed, fabricated and tested in a FT 8 sector rig to demonstrate the benefits of a high temperature material system. Pretest predictions made through the use of perfectly stirred reactor models showed a 2 - 3 x benefit in CO emissions for CMC versus metallic liners. The sector-rig test validated the pretest predictions with > 2 x benefit in CO at the same NOx levels at various load conditions. The CMC liners also survived several trip shut downs thereby validating the CMC design methodology. <b>Significant</b> <b>technical</b> <b>progress</b> has been made towards incorporation of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) and environmental barrier coatings (EBC) technologies into gas turbine engine hot-section. The second phase of the program focused on the demonstration of a reverse flow annular CMC combustor. This has included overcoming the challenges of design and fabrication of CMCs into 'complex' shapes; developing processing to apply EBCs to 'engine hardware'; testing of an advanced combustor enabled by CMCs in a PW 206 rig; and the validation of performance benefits against a metal baseline. The rig test validated many of the pretest predictions with a 40 - 50 % reduction in pattern factor compared to the baseline and reductions in NOx levels at maximum power conditions. The next steps are to develop an understanding of the life limiting mechanisms in EBC and CMC materials, developing a design system for EBC coated CMCs and durability testing in an engine environment...|$|E
