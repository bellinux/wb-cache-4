25|$|The frontoviks had to live, {{fight and}} die in small {{circular}} foxholes dug into the earth with enough room {{for one or two}} men with slit trenches being to connect what the Germans called “Russian holes”. The soldiers were usually not issued blankets or <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> even in the winter. Instead, the frontovik slept in their coats and shelter-capes usually on pine, evergreen needles, fir boughs, piled leaves or straw. In the winter, the temperature could drop as low as -60°F (-50°C), making General Moroz (General Frost) as much an enemy as the Germans. Spring started in April and with it came rains and snowmelt, making the battlefields into a muddy quagmire. Summers were dusty and hot while with the fall came the rasputitsa (time without roads) as heavy autumn rains once again turned the battlefields into muddy quagmires that made the spring rains look tame by comparison.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, McWilliams began {{a series}} of concerts at the school that gave {{students}} the opportunity to hear work by such contemporary musicians and performances as Korean composer Nam June Paik and his collaborator, cellist Charlotte Moorman; Japanese composer Takehisa Kosugi; German Happenings artist Wolf Vostell; the musician/composer team of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela, and minimalist composer Terry Riley. The events were sometimes controversial. Paik and Moorman's concert was almost stopped when Moorman began a striptease as part of Paik's Pop Sonata. Riley's first-ever all-night concert, conceived by McWilliams and performed with Young and Zazeela on November 17–18, 1967, raised fears of litigation among school administrators. McWilliams's idea was that people could bring their families and <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> and spend the night at the gallery, but because the school had never been open overnight before, administrators required him to personally carry liability insurance for the event.|$|E

Caribou skin {{is ideal}} for cold, dry weather as each hair has a {{honeycomb}} core that traps air, which is an excellent insulator. Sealskins and caribou skins were always kept separate and not combined in the same garment except for occasional decorative strips. Yup’ik dance fans decorated with caribou throat hair, caribou leg-skins were made into high boots, <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> for travel made by joining two caribou skins and fur-side-out fancy parkas. Historically, caribou were hunted {{in the fall and}} skins were brought home for skin clothing. Caribou hunts were discouraged by the Russian and American traders as they felt it took the trappers away from their trap lines. Prior to European contact, caribou were important not only for their meat but for the skins which were an important item used in clothing. The Russians encouraged the Eskimos to adopt Western-style dress in order to release more furs for trading. In the spring, some people hunted caribou along the inland river ways.|$|E
