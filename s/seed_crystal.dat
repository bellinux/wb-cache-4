25|$|Although {{a number}} of {{artificial}} garnets were successfully grown, only two became important as diamond simulants. The first was yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG; Y3Al5O12) in the late 1960s. It was (and still is) produced by the Czochralski, or crystal-pulling, process, which involves growth from the melt. An iridium crucible surrounded by an inert atmosphere is used, wherein yttrium oxide and aluminium oxide are melted and mixed together at a carefully controlled temperature near 1980nbsp&°C. A small <b>seed</b> <b>crystal</b> {{is attached to a}} rod, which is lowered over the crucible until the crystal contacts the surface of the melted mixture. The <b>seed</b> <b>crystal</b> acts as a site of nucleation; the temperature is kept steady at a point where the surface of the mixture is just below the melting point. The rod is slowly and continuously rotated and retracted, and the pulled mixture crystallizes as it exits the crucible, forming a single crystal {{in the form of a}} cylindrical boule. The crystal's purity is extremely high, and it typically measures 5nbsp&cm (2nbsp&inches) in diameter and 20nbsp&cm (8nbsp&inches) in length, and weighs 9,000 carats (1.75nbsp&kg).|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a <b>seed</b> <b>crystal,</b> an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
2500|$|When {{initially}} {{outlining the}} process, Verneuil specified {{a number of}} conditions crucial for good results. These include: a flame temperature that is not higher than necessary for fusion; always keeping the melted product in the same part of the oxyhydrogen flame; and reducing the point of contact between the melted product and support to as small an area as possible. The average commercially produced boule using the process is [...] in diameter and [...] long, weighing about [...] The process can also be performed with a custom-oriented <b>seed</b> <b>crystal</b> to achieve a specific desired crystallographic orientation.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the crystal}} touches the ground it mutates into a [...] "colonizer" [...] which cannot be {{destroyed}} by shooting it. These colonizers constantly emit seeker drones, {{acting as a}} defensive station protecting new <b>seed</b> <b>crystals</b> that are dropped. If five <b>seed</b> <b>crystals</b> manage to land and form colonizers, the planet explodes. The <b>seed</b> <b>crystals</b> also drop a surface skimmer which begins to collect the tricasmium nuggets found on the surface. The skimmer can be destroyed to save the supply of nuggets, which can be picked up and dropped on the colonizers to destroy them.|$|R

50|$|One common {{technique}} is to induce {{a very small}} fraction of the melt to solidify at a much higher temperature than the rest; this will generate <b>seed</b> <b>crystals</b> that act as a template {{when the rest of the}} material falls to its (lower) melting temperature and begins to solidify. Since a huge number of minuscule <b>seed</b> <b>crystals</b> are present, a nearly equal number of crystallites result, and the size of any one grain is limited.|$|R
2500|$|The {{melting point}} of {{crystallized}} honey is between , depending on its composition. Below this temperature, honey {{can be either}} in a metastable state, meaning {{that it will not}} crystallize until a <b>seed</b> <b>crystal</b> is added, or, more often, it is in a [...] "labile" [...] state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously. The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as brassica honey, [...] crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or tupelo honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others produce many small crystals.|$|E
2500|$|In 1902, the French chemist Auguste Verneuil {{developed}} {{a process for}} producing synthetic sapphire crystals. In the Verneuil process, named after him, fine alumina powder is added to an oxyhydrogen flame, and this is directed downward against a mantle. The alumina in the flame is slowly deposited, creating a teardrop shaped [...] "boule" [...] of sapphire material. Chemical dopants can be added to create artificial versions of the ruby, and all the other natural colors of sapphire, and in addition, other colors never seen in geological samples. Artificial sapphire material is identical to natural sapphire, except it can be made without the flaws that are found in natural stones. The disadvantage of Verneuil process is that the grown crystals have high internal strains. Many methods of manufacturing sapphire today are variations of the Czochralski process, which was invented in 1916 by Polish chemist Jan Czochralski. In this process, a tiny sapphire <b>seed</b> <b>crystal</b> is dipped into a crucible made of the precious metal iridium or molybdenum, containing molten alumina, and then slowly withdrawn upward at a rate of 1 to 100mm per hour. The alumina crystallizes on the end, creating long carrot-shaped boules of large size up to 200kg in mass.|$|E
2500|$|This {{starting}} material is finely powdered, {{and placed in}} a container within a Verneuil furnace, with an opening at the bottom through which the powder can escape when the container is vibrated. While the powder is being released, oxygen is supplied into the furnace, and travels with the powder down a narrow tube. This tube is located within a larger tube, into which hydrogen is supplied. At the point where the narrow tube opens into the larger one, combustion occurs, with a flame of at least [...] at its core. As the powder passes through the flame, it melts into small droplets, which fall onto an earthen support rod placed below. The droplets gradually form a sinter cone on the rod, the tip of which is close enough to the core to remain liquid. It is at that tip that the <b>seed</b> <b>crystal</b> eventually forms. As more droplets fall onto the tip, a single crystal, called a boule, starts to form, and the support is slowly moved downward, allowing the base of the boule to crystallise, while its cap always remains liquid. The boule is formed {{in the shape of a}} tapered cylinder, with a diameter broadening away from the base and eventually remaining more or less constant. With a constant supply of powder and withdrawal of the support, very long cylindrical boules can be obtained. Once removed from the furnace and allowed to cool, the boule is split along its vertical axis to relieve internal pressure, otherwise the crystal will be prone to fracture when the stalk is broken due to a vertical parting plane.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{reports the}} growth of MgZnO nanowall {{structures}} on GaAs substrates through the incorporation of Mg by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition {{at a growth temperature}} of 500 C. Through Mg incorporation, a 5 nm-thick MgGa 2 O 4 layer was initially self-formed on GaAs substrates, which acted as a buffer layer with reduced lattice mismatch for nanowall growth. However, due to the large difference in lattice parameters, the MgZnO <b>seed</b> <b>crystals</b> grew on the MgGa 2 O 4 layer with a pyramidal shape showing a Volmer-Weber growth mode. Moreover, by the random motion of the adatoms on these MgZnO <b>seed</b> <b>crystals,</b> nanowalls with high crystalline quality were grown along the grain boundaries in the MgZnO <b>seed</b> <b>crystals.</b> On the basis of themicrostructural characterization of the synthesized nanowall structures, the growth evolution of the MgZnO nanowall structures on GaAs substrates was first proposed. 1...|$|R
