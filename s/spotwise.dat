40|$|Evaluating {{the problem}} of <b>spotwise</b> {{appearing}} cereal growth depressions 23 fields of 10 organic managed farms were investigated. Potential causes were soil nutrients and other chemical and physical soil properties as well as high abundance of the plant parasitic nematodes Heterodera avenae and Pratylenchus-, Tylenchorhynchus and Trichodorus species. In two on-farm field experiments different catch crops and a black fallow treatment caused a decrease of Pratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus species. However, the yields of the following spring wheat were low, possibly due to H. avenae infestation. Fertilization with compost and potassium had no effect but the H. avenae resistant variety Isotta produced much higher yields. The conclusion drawn was that farmers with <b>spotwise</b> appearing growth depressions should watch them closely for nematode infestation to take regulation measures as early as possible...|$|E
40|$|Laser-induced and laser-enhanced plating will {{be widely}} {{applied in the}} {{electronics}} industry due to its high speed and highly spatial resolution. A thin gold deposit on InP substrate was obtained in an aqueous solution of aurichlorohydric acid by using a He-Ne laser beam. This <b>spotwise</b> deposit xith a diameter 0. 5 mm was studied by RBS and SEM. The circle deposit with thickness 0. 05 m was identified to be gold and the gold atoms have diffused into <he substrate. A photoelectrochemical mechanism bringing about this process is discussed. The laser irradiation {{gives rise to the}} potential difference between the laser irradiation zone and nonilluminated zone, which accelerates the anodic dissolving reaction, coupled with the reduction of metal ion from the plating solution...|$|E
