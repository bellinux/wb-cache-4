40|$|Abstract-A new material, Si-B, is {{proposed}} as a solid dif-fusion source for fabrication of poly & contacted p+-n shallow junctions. The junction {{depth of the}} Si-B <b>source</b> <b>diode</b> has been measured and {{compared with that of}} a BF:-implanted poly-Si <b>source</b> <b>diode.</b> It was found that the Si-B <b>source</b> <b>diode</b> had a much shallower junction and was less sensitive to thermal budget than the BF: <b>source</b> <b>diode.</b> This was attributed to the smaller surface concentration and diffusivity of boron in the silicon in Si-B source diodes. Regarding electrical characteristics of diodes with a junction depth over 500 A, a forward ideality factor of better than 1. 01 over 8 decades and a reverse-current density lower than 0. 5 nA/cm 2 at- 5 V were obtained. As the junction depth shrank to 300 d, the ideality factor and reverse current density of diodes increased slightly to 1. 05 and 1. 16 nA/cm 2, respectively. These results demonstrated that a uniform ultra-shallow p+-n junction can be obtained by using a thin Si-B layer as a diffusion source. I...|$|E
40|$|Under dynamic {{operation}} the grounded <b>source</b> <b>diode</b> of the SOS transistor {{creates a}} reverse bias on the floating substrate. Numerical simulations agree {{well with the}} directly measured increase of this bias {{as a function of}} doping and frequency. The reverse self-bias increases the threshold voltage on heavily doped samples. This leads to a reduction of the weak inversion leakage current and gives rise to the minimum of the current-vs-frequency curve observed on SOS circuits. An anomalously strong temperature dependence of the frequency of a ring oscillator operated at low voltage is attributed to the effect of dynamic self-biasing...|$|E
