50|$|The Mediterranean <b>scaldfish</b> (Arnoglossus laterna) is {{a species}} of bottom feeder benthic fish {{belonging}} to the family Bothidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scaldfishes</b> {{comprise}} a genus, Arnoglossus, of lefteye flounders. They {{are found in}} the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea. They are entirely absent from most of the Americas; the only exceptions are A. coeruleosticta and A. multirastris found off Chile. The genus include both species found in shallow and deeper water. The largest species reaches 28 cm.|$|R
50|$|Like {{other species}} of the order Pleuronectiformes, <b>scaldfish</b> is a {{flatfish}} with a body length of 12 to 20 cm. It has pale yellow, large, ruffled scales.|$|E
50|$|The Thor's <b>scaldfish</b> (Arnoglossus thori) is {{a species}} of bottom feeder benthic fish {{belonging}} to the family Bothidae (lefteye flounder). Widespread in the Eastern Atlantic from Ireland to Sierra Leone and Cape Verde; also known from the western Mediterranean and Black Sea. Marine, subtropical, demersal fish, up to 18 cm long.|$|E
40|$|Changes in spatial {{distribution}} in several fish {{species have been}} related to recent increase in global temperature. In the North Sea, both a poleward shift and a shift to deeper water have been observed. Here, we study the underlying mechanism of these shifts in a comparative study {{of the changes in}} distribution of two boreal flatfish species (plaice Pleuronectes platessa and dab Limanda limanda) and three Lusitanian flatfish species (sole Solea solea, solenette Buglossidium luteum, and <b>scaldfish</b> Arnoglossus laterna) as recorded in annual bottom trawl surveys carried out in the North Sea in late summer since 1985. The distribution is analysed in relation to the bottom temperature {{at the time of the}} survey as well as to the seasonal maximum bottom temperature earlier in the year. It is shown that the boreal species plaice and dab moved to deeper water and maintained the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced in earlier periods, while the Lusitanian species sole, solenette, and <b>scaldfish</b> experienced an increase in the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced while maintaining their depth distribution. This overall response varied between length classes, reflecting a preference for higher temperature of the smaller length classes. The results lend support to the hypothesis that the fish displayed a direct response to the maximum temperature that occurred during the growth season before the time of sampling...|$|E
40|$|The {{first study}} {{of age and}} growth of four-spotted <b>scaldfish,</b> more {{commonly}} known as megrim (Lepidorhombus boscii, Risso), an important (by catch) species of the Portuguese trawl fishery from the Atlantic coast is presented. The analysis was based on data obtained from a total of 609 specimens sampled between 1985 and 1986. Otoliths were used for age determination. The Von Bertalanf~, growth parameters were estimated using the non-linear fitting method: Lt (females) = 440 [1 -e -°- 14 (t+ 1. 32) ] and Lt= 375 [1 -e -°~ 4 (t+ 1. 93) ] for males. L~ and to values are significantly different. The megrim grows allometrically (slope of length-weight regressions > 3). Females live longer and gain weight {{at a faster rate}} than males. Differences in growth between sexes become more apparent from the second year onwards...|$|E
40|$|Climate change, {{specifically}} temperature, {{affects the}} distribution and densities of species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, {{we looked at the}} effect of temperature during winter and spawning period on latitudinal range shifts and changes in abundance of two non-commercial North Sea fish species, solenette (Buglossidium luteum) and <b>scaldfish</b> (Arnoglossus laterna). Both species have increased in abundance and moved to the north since the late 1980 s, coinciding with a series of mild winters. In 1996, following a very cold winter, the abundance of both species temporarily decreased as they retracted to the south. The shift in temperature affected adult habitat conditions, allowing them to immigrate into new areas where they subsequently reproduced successfully. We can conclude this because recruitment improved following the increase in abundance. The recruitment relates significantly to the higher adult stock and higher temperatures. The predictions of higher average temperatures and milder winters in the North Sea make it likely that these species will increase further in abundance and move northward. The observed increase in abundance of these small flatfish species will affect the North Sea food web and therefore commercial species, e. g. plaice, by predation on juveniles and competition for benthic food resource...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that increasing mesh number in the circumference of a diamond-mesh trawl codend can reduce size selection for round fish, whereas selection for flat fish species is unaffected. This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available {{with regard to the}} effect of increasing mesh number in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of round fish and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals aimed at improving trawl fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a round fish species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean <b>scaldfish</b> (Arnoglossus laterna) and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in mesh number around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50 % retention length (L 50) for red mullet by 2. 5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends...|$|E
40|$|In the European Union, the {{collection}} of discard data is enforced through the Data Collection Regulation or Framework (DCF) of the European Commission (EC). To comply with this ruling, approximately ten trips of discard-intensive beam-trawlers are being monitored annually since 1999 (Helmond and Overzee, 2010). In 2009, revisions to the DCF (2008 / 949 /EG), required member states to increase sampling intensity to i) improve the precision of their estimates and ii) the number of sampled métiers. To meet this requirement within an affordable budget, the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, part of Wageningen University and Research) set up a collaborative project between the Dutch fishing industry and the research institute to recruit a ‘reference fleet’ of vessel owners {{willing to participate in}} a selfsampling programme. In the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. In total, 155 trips were sampled in 2011, of which 27 trips (17 %) were considered invalid due to missing or incomplete information. During the 128 valid self-sampling trips 248 hauls were sampled. While the majority of observations were done on board beamtrawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm targeting flatfish, data was collected from eight other metiers as well. These included beam trawls with other mesh sizes or target species assemblages, otter trawls and seines. This led, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling compared to the previous observer-based sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available now. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensivelysampled métiers. Large-mesh beam- and otter trawls (100 - 119 mm) on average landed more than they discarded. In the other métiers, combined fish and benthos discards exceeded the volume of landings. The majority of discards comprised of benthic (invertebrate) species such as common starfish (Asteria rubens); sand star (Astropecten irregularis); swimming crab (Liocarcinus holsatus); and serpent star (Ophiura ophiura). Most frequently discarded fish species of no commercial value included: dragonet (Callionymus lyra); grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus); <b>scaldfish</b> (Arnoglossus laterna); solenette (Buglossidium luteum); and lesser weaver (Echiichthys vipera). Among commercially-valuable fish, common dab (Limanda limanda) and European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) were the most frequently discarded species...|$|E

This programme complemented the existing observer programme. In the observer programme, vessels were selected quarterly from a pool of available vessels, whereas in the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. Missing and/or wrong information precluded the inclusion of 17 % and 13 % of all self-sampled trips in 2009 and 2010. In total, 9 and 10 observer, and 63 and 132 valid self-sampling trips were completed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. For these remaining valid self-sampled trips, procedures were developed to test whether data quality was comparable with i) other self samples from the reference fleet and ii) comparable observercollected data (i. e. temporally and spatially overlapping trips). In addressing i), there were no unusual patterns in the length frequencies of self-sampled discards of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in 2009 and 2010. In addressing ii), no significant differences in the discard rates of plaice between the two programmes were found. There was no evidence that sampling may have been biased at the vessel level, justifying the decision to present all discard estimates independent of the programme type. While in both programmes the majority of observations were done onboard beam-trawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm, in the self-sampling programme data from four additional beam- and otter-trawl métiers with two 70 - 99 and 100 - 119 mesh size ranges and other target species assemblages (i. e mixed crustaceans and/or demersal fish) were collected. This lead, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensively-sampled métiers. In all but two métiers, combined fish and benthos discards exceeded the volume of landings. In contrast, large-mesh beam- and otter trawls (100 - 119 mm) landed on average more than they discarded. The majority of discards was comprised by benthic (invertebrate) species such as common starfish (Asteria rubens); sand star (Astropecten irregularis); swimming crab (Liocarcinus holsatus); and serpent star (Ophiura ophiura).
