25|$|Horn's 1993 series When Dickinson <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{comprises}} eight square aluminium {{poles of}} different lengths leaning casually against the gallery wall, each bearing {{a line from}} Emily Dickinson's poem A Wind that rose; following in the conceptual tradition started by Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner, Horn's homage to Dickinson investigates the possibilities of language as sculptural form. Other works in her series White Dickinson include sentences from the published letters of Dickinson.|$|E
2500|$|The Committee's {{report was}} {{presented}} to Parliament by Prime Minister Thatcher on 18 January 1983. Whilst criticising {{of some of the}} actions of the government, the report cleared the government of any blame for the invasion. The report concluded that the Committee [...] "would not be justified in attaching any criticism or blame to the present Government for the Argentine juntas decision to commit its act of unprovoked aggression". It argued that the invasion [...] "could not be foreseen" [...] but that some British Government policies [...] "may have served to cast doubt on British commitment to the Islands and their defence". Thatcher is reported to have been anxious over the findings of the report and was triumphant at what she considered as vindication of her view that criticism of her government's actions were unwarranted. Simon Jenkins reported that when the report arrived [...] "she sat down, <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and asked her secretary to read the last paragraph, the exoneration. She needed no caveats, just that sentence." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is {{connected}} with the Greek Lamia, who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title [...] "child killer" [...] and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body {{from the waist up}} and a serpentine body from the waist down. One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess Hecate. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them. Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men’s blood. Her gift was the [...] "mark of a Sibyl", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was [...] "cursed" [...] to never be able to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, Zeus gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.|$|E

60|$|Joan wheeled away in horror, <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{covering}} <b>her</b> ears, running blindly. Then {{upon her}} muffled hearing burst the boom of a gun.|$|R
60|$|<b>Shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in a rail-way {{carriage}} to {{open them}} when she pleased was child's play. This man was blind though his eyes were wide open.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> for a moment, {{as though}} {{in an effort to}} collect herself.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{she turned}} her head away and <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, and so Rollo withdrew.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs Gamp {{looked at}} her with amazement, incredulity, and indignation; when Mrs Prig, <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> still closer, and folding her arms still tighter, uttered these memorable and {{tremendous}} words: ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Milliken {{folded her}} hands and <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> her invariable habit when called upon to recite.|$|E

60|$|He stooped {{down over}} her, and {{fastened}} his lips upon her forehead. She pressed herself closer against his shoulder, and <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> as she gave {{herself up to}} the rapture of his embrace, told herself that now all should be well with them.|$|R
60|$|Whatever Fan said, she {{accompanied}} with a smile. Indeed a {{smile was}} the necessary {{result of the}} opening of her little mouth for whatever purpose--not an affected smile, but a merry one--which always had the effect, her face being plump, of half <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "The same as last night, only a {{great deal}} worse," [...] said Susanna, <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and turning <b>her</b> head aside. [...] "It's all up with me this time, Mrs. Ned. I'm dying, not of drink, but of the want of it. Is that fiend of a woman gone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor yet," [...] said Mrs. Pratchett, <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and making}} {{as if she}} had just took a pill of unusual circumference,--which gave a {{remarkable}} force to her denial,--"nor yet any servant in this house.

6000|$|... "The spell," [...] ses Mrs. Prince, {{holding up}} <b>her</b> ’ands and <b>shutting</b> <b>’er</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] "was put upon you by a man.

6000|$|The {{good little}} girl had evidently been schooled to repress her dread and repugnance at my unlucky appearance, and was painfully polite, only <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{when she came}} to shake hands with me; but after Rosella condescended to adopt me, we became {{excellent}} friends. Indeed the following conversation was overheard by Emily, and set down: ...|$|R
6000|$|Albinia {{teased her}} {{so far as}} to cover her with warmed shawls, and force on her a stimulant. She <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> but {{presently}} opened them to say, 'Please go.' ...|$|E

She stammers.) Eileen--you look so--so funny.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Merton, also <b>shutting</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> struck feebly {{with the}} knife. The others, having {{likewise}} shut their eyes, waited {{a few seconds}} {{in a state of}} indescribable horror, and then opened them to find that the Spartan lady had missed her mark, and planted her weapon in the ground! So feeble, however, had been the stroke that it had barely penetrated an inch of the soil.|$|R
