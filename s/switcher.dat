5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called <b>Switcher</b> by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with <b>Switcher.</b> Also, <b>Switcher</b> did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the DRR was {{becoming}} overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney {{determined that a}} third train was needed. Instead of having another locomotive built from scratch to pull the train, Disney believed that costs could be saved by purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam locomotive, and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable locomotive was found in Louisiana; it had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had previously {{been used as a}} <b>switcher</b> at a sugar cane mill in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to burn diesel oil for fuel to generate steam. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 3 locomotive and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 locomotive when it went into service were five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the Excursion Train, which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 1957, {{four years}} after North Shore Branch {{passenger}} trains ended, the very last SIRT special—a train from Washington carrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to the Staten Island Ferry from a state meeting in Washington, D.C. with President Eisenhower—crossed the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge. There was a royal train and a press train and they traveled over the Reading Railroad and the B to get to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. Since British royalty was being transported, the movement was done in secrecy with high security. The trains reached the Camp by traveling via the Port Reading Branch of the Reading Railroad. In order to travel to Staten Island, which required traveling over the Arthur Kill swing bridge, the two trains had to be reconfigured. Done at the Camp, the two diesel locomotives in the front were dropped from the two consists, allowing the trains to pass over the bridge, which had a limited load capacity. Awaiting {{the return of the}} equipment from Staten Island, the two diesel trains were sent to Cranford Junction. On the morning of October 21, the press train, consisting of 10 cars, left the Camp in New Jersey and traveled to the SIRT via the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The royal train, which was constructed by Pullman Standard, followed an hour later. These two trains terminated at the Stapleton freight yard, which was cleaned up for the occasion. Each of the trains were hauled back to Cranford Junction by a SIRT <b>switcher</b> after the Queen's motorcade left the yard. The trains, that afternoon, then went south to Baltimore.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} {{switching}} of trading strategies {{and its effect}} on the market volatility in a continuous double auction market. We describe the behavior when some uninformed agents, who we call <b>switchers,</b> {{decide whether or not to}} pay for information before they trade. By paying for the information they behave as informed traders. First we verify that our model is able to reproduce some of the stylized facts in real financial markets. Next we consider the relationship between switching and the market volatility under different structures of investors. We find that there exists a positive relationship between the market volatility and the percentage of <b>switchers.</b> We therefore conclude that the <b>switchers</b> are a destabilizing factor in the market. However, for a given fixed percentage of <b>switchers,</b> the proportion of <b>switchers</b> that decide to buy information at a given moment of time is negatively related to the current market volatility. In other words, if more agents pay for information to know the fundamental value at some time, the market volatility will be lower. This is because the market price is closer to the fundamental value due to information diffusion between <b>switchers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to identify customer retention strategies for legal software and discusses their effectiveness for three consumer groups (stayers, dissatisfied <b>switchers,</b> and satisfied <b>switchers).</b> Although previous studies propose several antipirating strategies, {{they do not}} discuss how to enhance customer intentions to use legal software, which is crucial for software companies. The authors provide four generic retention strategies developed from both antipiracy and customer loyalty literature. The results indicate lower-pricing, legal, communication, and product strategies all enhance customer purchase intentions toward legal software. The lower-pricing strategy is more useful for stayers and dissatisfied <b>switchers,</b> and the communication strategy is most useful for dissatisfied <b>switchers.</b> Both the legal and product strategies have similar impacts on purchase intentions across the three segments. From a firm perspective, a product strategy is most worthwhile and useful across all segments...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{attempt to}} explain the {{relationships}} among relational bonds, customer value, and customer loyalty in three different consumer groups (stayers, dissatisfied <b>switchers,</b> and satisfied <b>switchers)</b> in the retail banking industry. Data were obtained from a sample of 613 Taiwanese bank customers. The findings are threefold. First, for stayers, three types of bonds (financial, social, and structural) improve customer utilitarian and hedonic values, thus leading to enhancement of customer loyalty. Second, for dissatisfied <b>switchers,</b> only the structural bond has {{a significant impact on}} customer's utilitarian value, which significantly improves customer loyalty. Third, for satisfied <b>switchers,</b> the social bond significantly affects the hedonic value, whereas the structural bond significantly affects the utilitarian value. Furthermore, both utilitarian and hedonic values have significant effects on customer loyalty. The authors discuss the managerial implications and directions for further research.
