5|$|In January 1977, Victor diSuvero and {{his firm}} Sapphire-Yogo Mines became the next owner {{to tackle the}} Yogo dike. DiSuvero was a {{native-born}} Italian {{who grew up in}} Tientsin, China, and had been successful with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>business.</b> Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completing}} his studies, Ravalomanana returned to Manjakandriana District, {{where he and}} his family began making and selling homemade yogurts, a common artisanal product in the highlands region. On his bicycle, he collected milk from farmers in neighboring towns, gradually increasing his production and clientele. He opened his first yogurt and cheese production center in 1977 in Sambaina on land he named Rova-Tiko ("Tiko Palace"), where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later. His wife handled the administrative and accounting <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> from Ankadivato, where the storage facility for finished products was located.

5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E

5|$|By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was {{a leading}} {{international}} music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun {{to appear in the}} relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £100,000 during the war without the permission of the exchange control authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, {{to the point that the}} company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.|$|E

25|$|AIAL enjoys diverse revenue streams, and {{operates}} a 'dual-till' approach, whereby its finances are split into aeronautical and non-aeronautical balance sheets.

Non-aeronautical revenue comes from its significant property portfolio, car park, and retail income. Income from the non-aeronautical <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> accounts for just over half of its revenue. The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high landing charges. However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below {{the average of the}} 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand.

In the offseason, Parcells hired his old Giants defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, in January 1996 as assistant head coach and receivers position coach.
