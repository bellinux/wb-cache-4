5|$|Bird {{migration}} routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and <b>satellite</b> <b>tracking.</b> The rate of bird migration over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying bird migration.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, for species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and <b>satellite</b> <b>tracking.</b> Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.|$|E

30|$|A QNA {{produced}} an average inferred snow depth (12.4 cm), from two <b>satellite</b> <b>tracks,</b> that underestimates the in situ measurements (17.6 cm[*]±[*] 1.5 cm).

5|$|Hurricane Rick's {{ultimate}} origin was {{a tropical}} wave that left Africa on October 15.

5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. <b>Satellite</b> <b>tracking</b> of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>tracking</b> {{revealed}} that {{those found in}} Pelagos Sanctuary migrate southward to off Tunisia, Malta, Pantelleria, and Sicily, and also possibly winter off coastal southern Italy, Sardinia, within the Strait of Messina, Aeolian Islands, and off Catalonia, Cabrera Archipelago, Libya, Kerkennah Islands, Tuscan Archipelago, Ischia and adjacent gulfs (e.g. Naples and Pozzuoli), winter feeding ground of Lampedusa, and whales may recolonize out of the Ligurian Sea to other areas such as in Ionian and in Adriatic Sea. Biology of the species along southern and southeastern parts of the basin such as off Libya, Algeria, and northern Egypt, is unclear due to lacks of scientific approaches although whales have been confirmed off the furthermost of the basin such as along in shore waters of Levantine Sea including Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus. Documented records within Turkish waters have been in very small numbers; one sighting off Antalya in 1994 and 5 documented strandings as of 2016.|$|E

30|$|Snow water {{equivalent}} (SWE) {{measurements are}} necessary {{for the management of}} water supply and flood control systems in seasonal snow-covered regions. SWE measurements quantify the amount of water stored in snowpack; it can be estimated by the product of snow depth and density. In this paper, snow depth and density are estimated by a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The inputs to this algorithm are global positioning system (GPS) signals and a simple GPS interferometric reflectometry model (GPS-IR) that incorporates a slightly tilted surface (GPS-IRT). The elevation angles of interest at the GPS receiving antenna are between 5 ° and 30 °. A 1 -day experiment with a snow-covered prairie grass field using GPS satellites PRN 15 and PRN 18 shows potential for inferring snow water equivalent using GPS-IRT. For this case study, the average inferred snow depth (12.4 cm) from the two <b>satellite</b> <b>tracks</b> underestimates the in situ measurements (17.6 cm[*]±[*] 1.5 cm). However, the average inferred snow density (0.085 g∙cm- 3) from the two <b>satellite</b> <b>tracks</b> is within the in situ measurement range (0.08 g∙cm- 3 [*]±[*] 0.02 g∙cm- 3). Consequently, the average inferred SWE (1.05 g∙cm- 2) from the two <b>satellite</b> <b>tracks</b> is within the in situ calculation range (1.40 g∙cm- 2 [*]±[*] 0.36 g∙cm- 2). These results are also compared with the GPS-IR model.|$|R
