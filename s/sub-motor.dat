In the system, the driving power was supplied by two motors in which one had large ability in power generation {{compared with that of}} another one. Algebraic simulation was executed to determine the shear ratio of the power by each motor with a simple model which referred information on the torque property curve of each motor. In the simulation, it was supposed that mechanical power was produced only by two motors but reciprocal engine in the system, in which the engine contributed to supply electric power to the motors. Nominal capabilities of motors used in this study were 10, 20, 30 kw, respectively. Two motors were selected among them in which total motor power was to be 30, 40, or 50 kw for the system in each condition. An effective parameter (Emt) was defined as the threshold of applied torque by <b>sub-motor</b> to determine the minimum condition where auxiliary power was supplied by the <b>sub-motor</b> beyond the condition. In the two motors system, the revolution speed of the <b>sub-motor</b> was controlled to be constant at 150 rad/s by the CVT with metal V-belt to maintain high efficiency of the <b>sub-motor.</b> Calculation results of current system were compared with that of traditional system driven by single motor. The difference of energy consumption was also calculated according to the difference of driven modes. In some conditions, energy consumption often decreased when double-motor system was applied. However, simply designed double motor system was not always effective to reduce the energy consumption to drive the vehicle. When the CVT was applied to double motor system, energy consumption was decreased compared with those by simply double and single motor system both for the acceleration up to low and high speed. Lowest energy consumption was observed on the double motor system controlled with CVT, when the 30 Nm of the (Emt) was set on the <b>sub-motor.</b> Improvement of 6 % in fuel consumption should be obtained in case of the “ 10 mode ” in which vehicles were often driven under low speed mode...|$|E
30|$|One motor-primitive {{generation}} {{approach is}} based on a graph [5 – 8]. Graph-based motor primitives have flexibility in dynamic environments because they consider the state of the environment while executing the motor primitives. A method that generates UAV motor primitives using demonstration-based learning [9] is suggested. The process of generating motor primitives is divided into three stages: Operation collection stage, time adjustment stage, and motor-primitive generation stage. The motor primitives, based on measured yaw, pitches and rolls, are divided into <b>sub-motor</b> primitives considering pinpoints, where pinpoints are predefined spots where the UAV should arrive.|$|E

In this case, drug limitations due to gestation and lactation have made even more difficult the therapeutic management. CASE REPORT: Female patient, 26 years old with CRPS for 5 years. She presented twinge pain and shock on left fingers and forearm, followed by weakness, edema, hair loss, cyanosis and temperature decrease. Pain intensity was from 9 to 10 by the verbal analog scale. Worsening factors were: cold, movements, touch and night period. Additional tests included normal cervical MRI and electroneuromyography. The treatment was multidisciplinary with unsatisfactory results. She was followed during gestation and lactation, with adaptation of drugs, physical therapy, psychotherapy and anesthetic blocks. Currently, pain is controlled. CONCLUSION: Complex regional pain syndrome I treatment, which is very complicated, becomes even more difficult during gestation and lactation to offer analgesia with less risk for mother and fetus...|$|E
40|$|A novel spherical two-degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) hybrid {{stepping}} motor is proposed in this paper, {{which has a}} simple and compact mechanical structure and is easy to manufacture, assemble, control and apply. The motor is composed of two <b>sub-motors,</b> {{each of which is}} a hybrid stepping type with an arc-shaped stator and a specially designed bearing structure. The rotational axes of these two <b>sub-motors</b> cross at the sphere center, and this structure enables the 2 -DOF motor to move in any direction. Due to the mutual influence of permanent magnet (PM) leakage flux between the two <b>sub-motors,</b> the 3 -D magnetic field distribution inside the motor becomes more complex, and thus the 2 -D equivalent magnetic field analysis method is proposed, with two types of 2 -D equivalent motor models established. The accurate one can take into account of the PM leakage flux influence yet is only suitable for solving motor’s static and steady state problem, whilst the simplified one can solve all the problems and is applicable for the more typical situation where the PM leakage flux influence can be almost neglected via optimal structure design. A prototype of the proposed spherical 2 -DOF motor with outside diameter of 50 mm is newly manufactured and experimented to validate the feasibility of motor’s operational principle, and the accuracy of both 2 -D equivalent motor models is verified by the 3 -D finite element analysis (3 -D FEA) calculation results. Based on the 2 -D equivalent motor models, the 2 -D FEA is employed for the performance analysis, such as no-load back electromotive force (EMF), tooth-layer permeance harmonics, detent torque, pull-out torque, unbalanced force, etc., which is characterized by time- saving, high accuracy and good versatility...|$|R
40|$|C L A S S I C muscular {{dystrophy}} is uninfluenced by any known treatment, but in various metabolic myopathies complete recovery is possible when the underlying disorder is corrected. The {{present study was}} concerned with the effect of systemic corticosteroid therapy in producing myopathy; it also concerned the relative rates of recovery of corticosteroid-induced myopathy and the myopathies associated with Cushing's disease and thyrotoxicosis. Further data have been produced {{on the effect of}} anabolic agents in corticosteroid myopathy. The quantitative measure of myopathy was electromyographic with a mean potential duration of the deltoid muscle (MPD), which is lowered in myopathies whatever the aetiology, as the parameter. TECHNICAL DATA AND METHOD The technique of examination was identical to that of a previous study (Coomes, 1965 a, b). Twenty or more <b>sub-motor</b> unit potentials produced on minimal effort were recorded via a concentric needle electrode inserted into the deltoid muscle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an indirect rotor-field oriented control (IRFOC) algorithm for symmetrical six-phase double-winding induction machines with four three-phase sub-winding sets. The presented algorithm introduces {{the ability to}} control the power flow between different sub-winding sets. Multiple three-phase induction machines are utilised for critical applications such as more-electric aircrafts, due to their high reliability and fault tolerant capabilities. In this paper, the proposed control scheme is utilising the auxiliary currents of each six-phase <b>sub-motor</b> to achieve full control of the sub-winding sets current amplitudes and consequently the power flow direction for each sub-winding set. A six-phase induction machine with double winding is utilised to validate the proposed control scheme. Four isolated voltage source inverters (VSIs) are used to supply each winding set of the machine. The double-winding six-phase induction machine controlled by the proposed IRFOC algorithm is simulated using Matlab/Simulink. Presented simulation results validate the ability of the algorithm to appropriately control the power flow of each sub-winding set...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between somatosensory stimulation and the {{autonomic nervous system}} has been established with effects on heart rate (HR) and sympathetic tone. However, {{the involvement of the}} cortical autonomic network (CAN) during muscle sensory afferent stimulation has not been identified. The main objective of the research in this dissertation was to determine the representation of somatosensory afferents in the CAN and their physiologic impact on cardiovascular control. Somatosensory afferent activation was elicited by electrical stimulation of type I and II afferents (<b>sub-motor</b> threshold) and type III and IV afferents (motor threshold), and CAN patterns were assessed using blood-oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Study 1 (Chapter 2) established CAN regions associated with <b>sub-motor</b> stimulation including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), and posterior insula, along with a trend towards increased heart rate variability (HRV). Motor threshold stimulation was associated with activation in the posterior insula. Having established the CAN regions affected by sensory afferent input, diffusion tensor imaging was used (Chapter 3) to establish structural connections between the cortical regions associated with functional cardiovascular control. We identified two discrete patterns of white matter connectivity between the anterior insula-sACC and posterior insula-posterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that a structural network may underlie functional roles in autonomic regulation and sensory processing. As somatosensory stimulation had modest impact on cardiovascular control under baseline conditions, Study 3 (Chapter 4) aimed to establish the effects of somatosensory stimulation during baroreceptor unloading (lower-body negative pressure, LBNP) on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and cortical activity. Sensory stimulation during LBNP led to an attenuated increase in MSNA burst frequency, as well as absent activity in the right insula and dorsal ACC, supporting the sympatho-excitatory role of these regions. No effect of somatosensory stimulation during chemoreflex-mediated sympatho-excitation was observed on MSNA, while right insular and dorsal ACC activities were maintained. Overall, the results of these studies provide evidence of somatosensory representation within the CAN regions that are anatomically linked, and highlight a role for type I and II sensory afferents in modulating autonomic outflow in a manner that depends upon baroreceptor loading...|$|E
40|$|Essential tremor (ET) is {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorder that includes postural tremor and action tremor. This study investigates whether sensory electrical stimulation (SES) is effective on the action tremor in patients with ET. One task in the clinical testing of action tremor, "Archimedes spiral drawing", was performed in 18 patients for three sessions, which were named as pre-stimulation (PRE), stimulation on (ON), and 5 min after stimulation (POST). SES (<b>sub-motor</b> threshold) was applied on the muscles of the elbow and wrist only at ON session. Three-dimensional (3 D) angular velocities were measured on three segments (index finger, hand, and forearm) from which movements of metacarpophalangeal (MP) and wrist joints were derived. Average tremor intensity in each session was represented by root mean square of the vector sum of 3 D angular velocities. Tremor intensities in ON session were smaller than in PRE session in one segment (finger) and two joints (MP and wrist) (p< 0. 05). Tremor intensities in POST session were even smaller than in ON session in all segments and one joint (wrist) (p< 0. 05). The results indicate that SES suppresses action tremor and the effect continues and even improves 5 min after the termination of stimulation. The findings of this study may contribute to the improvement of {{the quality of life in}} patients with ET. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{electrical}} stimulation (PES) {{is a common}} clinical technique known to induce changes in corticomotor excitability; PES applied to induce a tetanic motor contraction increases, and PES at <b>sub-motor</b> threshold (sensory) intensities decreases, corticomotor excitability. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying these opposite changes in corticomotor excitability remains elusive. Modulation of primary sensory cortex (S 1) excitability could underlie altered corticomotor excitability with PES. Here we examined whether changes in primary sensory (S 1) and motor (M 1) cortex excitability follow the same timecourse when PES is applied using identical stimulus parameters. Corticomotor excitability was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and sensory cortex excitability using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) before and after 30 min of PES to right abductor pollicis brevis (APB). Two PES paradigms were tested in separate sessions; PES sufficient to induce a tetanic motor contraction (30 – 50 Hz; strong motor intensity) and PES at sub motor-threshold intensity (100 Hz). PES applied to induce strong activation of APB increased {{the size of the}} N 20 -P 25 component, thought to reflect sensory processing at cortical level, and increased corticomotor excitability. PES at sensory intensity decreased the size of the P 25 -N 33 component and reduced corticomotor excitability. A positive correlation was observed between the changes in amplitude of the cortical SEP components and corticomotor excitability following sensory and motor PES. Sensory PES also increased the sub-cortical P 14 -N 20 SEP component. These findings provide evidence that PES results in co-modulation of S 1 and M 1 excitability, possibly due to cortico-cortical projections between S 1 and M 1. This mechanism may underpin changes in corticomotor excitability in response to afferent input generated by PES. Siobhan M. Schabrun, Michael C. Ridding, Mary P. Galea, Paul W. Hodges and Lucinda S.

40|$|Exteroceptive {{suppression}} of temporalis muscle activity was studied {{in patients with}} chronic headache and in healthy controls. Among different methods of recording, averaging 10 full-wave rectified EMG responses produces results with acceptable variability and discomfort. The late temporalis exteroceptive suppression period (ES 2) is reduced on average in patients with chronic tension-type headache; this finding has been reproduced by several independent laboratories. Mean duration of temporalis ES 2 is also diminished, but to a lesser degree, in daily drug abuse headache and, as shown by others, in episodic tension-type headache. It is normal in migraine between attacks, cluster headache and various types of symptomatic headaches. Temporalis ES 2 may be decreased in untreated patients with major depression. In healthy volunteers, temporalis ES 2 duration is reduced by a short-lasting painful stimulus to peripheral limbs after a delay of 50 to 60 ms, and by a <b>sub-motor</b> threshold electromagnetic stimulation to the contralateral cerebral cortex after a delay of 20 to 30 ms. In contrast, long-lasting trains of peripheral painful stimuli have no effect. Various pharmacological agents are able to modify temporalis ES 2. Its duration is increased by 5 -HT antagonists, but decreased by 5 -HT uptake blockers. Pharmacological effects may differ between controls and patients. Considering these results and available data on the anatomo-functional organization of masticatory reflexes, we postulate that temporalis ES 2 is a marker of the excitability of interneuronal nets in the ponto-medullary reticular formation. In chronic tension-type headache, excitability of these interneurons is decreased because of inadequate control by the serotonergic raphe magnus nucleus and the periaqueductal gray matter. Dysfunctioning of the latter structures might be caused by abnormal limbic inputs to the brain stem. Some steps of this pathophysiological hypothesis can be verified by modern neurophysiological techniques. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or repetitive electrical {{peripheral nerve}} stimulation (rENS) can induce changes in the excitability of the human motor cortex (M 1) that is often short-lasting and variable, and occurs only after prolonged periods of stimulation. In 10 healthy volunteers, we used a new repetitive paired associative stimulation (rPAS) protocol to facilitate and prolong the effects of rENS and rTMS on cortical excitability. <b>Sub-motor</b> threshold 5 Hz rENS of the right median nerve was synchronized with submotor threshold 5 Hz rTMS of the left M 1 at a constant interval for 2 min. The interstimulus interval (ISI) between the peripheral stimulus and the transcranial stimulation was set at 10 ms (5 Hz rPAS 10 ms) or 25 ms (5 Hz rPAS 25 ms). TMS was given over the hot spot of the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. Before and after rPAS, we measured the amplitude of the unconditioned motor evoked potential (MEP), intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF), short- and long-latency afferent inhibition (SAI and LAI) in the conditioned M 1. The 5 Hz rPAS 25 ms protocol but not the 5 Hz rPAS 10 ms protocol caused a somatotopically specific increase in mean MEP amplitudes in the relaxed APB muscle. The 5 Hz rPAS 25 ms protocol also led {{to a loss of}} SAI, but there was no correlation between individual changes in SAI and corticospinal excitability. These after-effects were still present 6 h after 5 Hz rPAS 25 ms. There was no consistent effect on ICI, ICF and LAI. The 5 Hz rENS and 5 Hz rTMS protocols failed to induce any change in corticospinal excitability when given alone. These findings show that 2 min of 5 Hz rPAS 25 ms produce a long-lasting and somatotopically specific increase in corticospinal excitability, presumably by sensorimotor disinhibition...|$|E
