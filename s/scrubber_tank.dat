50|$|The Argentine Antarctic Institute, the Netherlands Geosciences Foundation and the Alfred Wegener Institute {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to provide a biological purification plant ceded by the Netherlands. It consists of a <b>scrubber</b> <b>tank,</b> a treatment and sludge drying plant, as well as facilities and equipment for process control and monitoring, {{and a set of}} basic spare parts and fuel reserves.|$|E
40|$|The {{command module}} {{reaction}} control system is emptied of all remaining propellant using {{ground support equipment}} designed to provide an acid/base neutralization of the propellant in both the liquid and gaseous phases so {{that it may be}} disposed of safely. During the deactivation operation of the oxidizer from the Apollo 16 command module on 7 May 1972, the <b>scrubber</b> <b>tank</b> of the decontamination unit exploded, destroying the ground support equipment unit and damaging the building that housed the operation. Only minor injuries were received by the personnel in the area and the command module was not damaged. Test results show that the failure was caused by an insufficient quantity of neutralizer for the quantity of oxidizer. This insufficiency lead to exothermic nitration-type reactions which produced large quantities of gas at a very high rate and failed the decontamination tank...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} describes and assesses planned {{modifications to}} be made to the Building 3092 Central Off-Gas Scrubber Facility of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The modifications are made in responsible to the requirements of 40 CFR 264 Subpart J, relating to environmental protection requirements for buried tank systems. The modifications include the provision of a new <b>scrubber</b> recirculation <b>tank</b> in a new, below ground, lines concrete vault, replacing and existing recirculation sump that does not provide double containment. A new buried, double contained pipeline is provided to permit discharge of spent scrubber recirculation fluid to the Central Waste Collection Header. The new vault, tank, and discharge line are provided with leak detection and provisions to remove accumulated liquid. New scrubber recirculation pumps, piping, and accessories are also provided. This assessment concludes that the planned modifications comply with applicable requirements of 40 CFR 264 Subpart J, as set forth in Appendix F to the Federal Facility Agreement, Docket No. 89 - 04 -FF, covering the Oak Ridge Reservation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{research}} for this thesis were fourfold, all of which focused at reducing employee exposure to diesel particulate in underground coal mines. The four aims were to: a) Develop a method to test disposable diesel exhaust filters and if possible improve their performance b) Investigate the relationship between maintenance and diesel particulate generation c) Highlight the benefits of newer design engines in emission reduction d) Review {{the research}} of the Tower Colliery Research group as their findings have been {{the basis for the}} development of control technologies for diesel particulate in NSW underground coal mines. Methods used to achieve these aims involved: a) The construction of a test rig to measure the efficiency and backpressure of new and used disposable filters b) The testing of the in service fleet at four of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal mines using an R&P Series 5100 diesel analysis system mounted in a trailer c) Comparison of a newer design engine with three current vehicles under mining conditions d) A detailed statistical review of all available data from the Tower Colliery Research group. Key outcomes from research conducted for this thesis are: a) The filtration efficiency and backpressure of disposable diesel exhaust filters used by BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal have been improved. These improvements, together with changes to work practices, generate potential cost savings of $ 395, 000 per annum while affording increased protection to equipment operators. b) Seven engines with unacceptable raw exhaust elemental carbon emissions were identified in a fleet of 66 tested. Some faults identified as causing these elevated emission levels were- blocked exhaust flame traps (<b>scrubber</b> <b>tanks),</b> incorrectly set tappets and worn injectors. c) Testing of a prototype 4 WD fire protected vehicle powered by an "over the road" engine as against three current vehicles, highlighted reductions in atmospheric elemental carbon concentrations of 67 90 %. Significant reductions in raw exhaust elemental carbon levels were also observed. d) A statistical review of data produced by the Tower Colliery Diesel Research group identified elevated exposures within mine transportation roadways. This outcome is significant as much research within the mining industry has focused on other areas in the belief that high air quantities in transportation roadways would limit exposures. This {{does not appear to be}} the case. The project has had a number of positive outcomes, all of which have assisted in the reduction of equipment operators to excessive levels of diesel particulate...|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, it was {{not known}} at the time (1988) that calcium and {{alkalinity}} needed {{to be added to}} an enclosed reef tank, in order to replace that which is utilized by the growing calcifying organisms. Even five years after that, the Pittsburgh Zoo was just starting to test a [...] "mesocosm" [...] <b>scrubber</b> reef <b>tank</b> to see if calcium levels would drop: [...] "It was hypothesized that Ca2+ and the substitutive elements Sr2+ and Mg2+ might have reduced concentrations in a coral reef microcosm due to continuous reuse of the same seawater {{as a consequence of the}} recycling process inherent in the coral reef mesocosm." ... "The scleractinians (Montastrea, Madracis, Porites, Diploria, and Acropora) and calcareous alga (Halimeda and others) present in the coral reef mesocosm are the most likely organisms responsible for the significant reduction in concentration of the Ca2+ and Sr2+ cations." ... "Ca is not normally a biolimiting element, and strontium is never a biolimiting element; HCO3 alkalinity can be. It appears that, because of a minor limitation in the design parameters of the mesocosm, these elements and compounds may have become limiting factors. ... It is surprising that the organisms could deplete the thousands of gallons of seawater (three to six thousand) of these elements even within two or more years." [...] After other researchers added calcium and/or connected their tanks to the ocean (which also supplies calcium and alkalinity), corals began growing again. Nevertheless, [...] "problem" [...] nutrients (ammonia, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, CO2, metals) were always kept at very low numbers.|$|R
40|$|The utility {{industry}} today {{finds itself}} confronted with two opposing crises: A cleaner environment versus increased energy requirement. Federal {{and local governments}} are pressuring industry to substantially reduce its stack emission to the environment. The concentration of the gaseous pollutants also influences local climatic conditions and lead to global warming. Flue gases emitted due to combustions of heavy oils and coal, boiler and power plants contain toxic gaseous pollutants like Oxides of sulfur (Sox), Oxides of Nitrogen (No), carbon monoxide (CO), Hydrogen Sulfide (H S) etc., A treatment before being discharged into the atmosphere is vitalx 2 for safe environment. ATurbulent Bed Contactor (TBC) is an excellent air pollution control device, which is used as wet scrubber for the simultaneous removal of pollutant gases. TBC possess significant advantages {{such as the ability}} to operate at large gas and liquid throughputs without plugging and the possibility of obtaining high heat and mass transfer rates. Because of its tremendous turbulence and mixing characteristics self-cleaning is possible without much scale formation and it offers high scrubbing efficiency. The process consists of a <b>scrubber,</b> a hold <b>tank</b> and a liquid solid separator. The process involve sodium based absorption of sulfur dioxide followed by reaction outside the scrubber with lime and /or limestone to produce a solid calcium sulfite /sulfate waste in excess and regenerated sodium scrubber feed solutions. Pollutants gases removal in excess of 95 % can be easily achieved and lime utilization higher than 95 % attained. The system operating conditions can be controlled to produce a solid waste containing low levels of dissolved solids and good handling characteristics...|$|R
