50|$|Also {{known as}} the Chemmy, Irish, scramble, {{beginner}} shuffle, smooshing, et al or washing the cards, this involves simply <b>spreading</b> the <b>cards</b> out face down, and sliding them around and over each other with one's hands. Then the cards are moved into one pile so that they begin to intertwine and are then arranged back into a stack. This method is useful for beginners and small children or if one is inept at shuffling cards. However, the beginner shuffle requires a large surface for <b>spreading</b> out the <b>cards</b> and takes longer than the other methods.|$|R
50|$|Glue traps are non-poisonous sticky glue <b>spread</b> over <b>card</b> {{boards and}} the like and kept in places rats frequent, which gets them stuck to it when they pass over it. The rat will {{subsequently}} die from dehydration and asphyxiation. A bait may also {{be placed on the}} cardboard to attract the rats.|$|R

60|$|There is {{a rather}} {{peculiar}} story told of this school in its early days. It had been established about two months, when the schoolmaster happened to be walking {{in the direction of}} the school quite late in the evening and to his amazement he saw that the little room was brilliantly lighted. Now, as he and his scholar had left it in the afternoon, and he had locked the door, he could not understand the state of affairs. Hurrying to the house, he looked in at the window, and saw that the room was nearly filled with well-dressed men, who were standing and sitting around a table on which were <b>spread</b> <b>cards</b> and money. He saw that they were a company of gamblers; but how they came there, and why they came, he could not imagine. Of course, he could not drive them out; but, after watching them for a little while, he boldly opened the door and went in among them.|$|R
5000|$|After two recounts, Morrill County Clerk, Kathy Brandt {{offered the}} {{candidates}} {{the choice to}} [...] "either cut a card or have their names pulled out of a hat", cards were selected and the election board shuffled the deck seven times before <b>spreading</b> the <b>cards</b> {{on the table for}} a simultaneous draw. Brandt said [...] "Cardenas and Petersen both drew at the same time. Milo, drew a nine of hearts and Petersen drew a six of spades." ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{boarding}} {{boxes are}} <b>spread</b> in different <b>card</b> types, boarding decks {{usually have a}} wide variety of card types, unlike cannon and victory decks with few (two or three) card types. Thus, dedicated cannon decks can be caught helplessly in a boarding.|$|R

50|$|Four new Planechase game packs were {{released}} on June 1, 2012. Each {{comes with a}} 60-card preconstructed deck, 8 all-new plane cards, two phenomenon cards, a planar die, and multi-player rules. Unlike the original Planechase release, these decks contain 21 new <b>cards</b> <b>spread</b> among them. Each of the new decks highlights a returning mechanic from Magic's history.|$|R
60|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{moved by the}} desire to hide the trembling of his hands and the gathering tears in his eyes when he began idly to scatter the pack upon the table, <b>spreading</b> out the <b>cards,</b> fingering them one by one, setting his teeth the while lest that latent cry of misery should force its way across his lips.|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{either the}} spectator keeps the {{imaginary}} deck while the magician removes the real deck from his pocket, or the spectator hands the imaginary deck to the magician, which suddenly becomes real in the magician's hands. Michael Close also utilizes a handling {{in which the}} invisible deck is tossed back into a paper bag, whereupon it becomes real and visible. The magician then asks the spectator to name the card he/she selected, removes the deck, face-up, from its box and <b>spreads</b> the <b>cards</b> to show one face-down card. The spectator removes the card to find {{it is the one}} he/she named moments earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Flannel {{has been}} made since the 17th century, {{gradually}} replacing the older Welsh plains, {{some of which were}} finished as [...] "cottons" [...] or friezes, which was the local textile product. In the 19th century, flannel was made particularly in towns such as Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Hay on Wye, and Llanidloes. [...] The expansion of its production is closely associated with the <b>spread</b> of <b>carding</b> mills, which prepared the wool for spinning, this being the first aspect of the production of woollen cloth to be mechanised (apart from fulling). The marketing of these Welsh woollen clothes was largely controlled by the Drapers Company of Shrewsbury.|$|R
60|$|Ricardo {{shook his}} head in silence and looked expectant. With him Schomberg {{exchanged}} at least twenty words every day. He was infinitely more communicative than his patron. At times he looked very much like an ordinary human being of his class; and he seemed to be in an amiable mood at that moment. Suddenly <b>spreading</b> some ten <b>cards</b> face downward {{in the form of a}} fan, he thrust them towards Schomberg.|$|R
50|$|Each {{input line}} <b>card</b> <b>spreads</b> its packets evenly to the N buffers, {{something}} it can clearly do without contention. Each buffer writes these packets {{into a single}} buffer-local memory at a combined rate of R. Simultaneously, each buffer sends packets {{at the head of}} each virtual output queue to each output line card, again at rate R/N to each card. The output line card can clearly forward these packets out the line with no contention.|$|R

50|$|Most CompactFlash flash-memory devices limit wear on blocks {{by varying}} the {{physical}} location {{to which a}} block is written. This process is called wear leveling. When using CompactFlash in ATA mode {{to take the place}} of the hard disk drive, wear leveling becomes critical because low-numbered blocks contain tables whose contents change frequently. Current CompactFlash <b>cards</b> <b>spread</b> the wear-leveling across the entire drive. The more advanced CompactFlash cards will move data that rarely changes to ensure all blocks wear evenly.|$|R
50|$|But {{his friends}} didn’t realize Kaps’ new act {{had a lot}} of surprises in store. On the day of his performance, he wasn’t going to let the public sense his anxiety. He entered the stage {{carrying}} a walking cane. They expected him to go into his continuous production of canes routine. Then, to the audience surprise, he produced a full size rabbit from the tip of the cane. From there, he did a series of silk manipulations. He did some unique one handed color changes, followed by the canary in microphone. He intermixed some card manipulations in between. One stunt was to <b>spread</b> the <b>cards</b> over his arm. Then he flipped the cards over with the same hand and caught the cards before they fell to the floor. He seemed to take great joy as the cards flowed through.|$|R
50|$|One {{inefficiency}} {{that the}} market does have is that since the ticket is the main unit of in-game currency, the bid/ask <b>spread</b> on <b>cards</b> is effectively fixed at one ticket. This makes buying and selling of cards quickly somewhat inefficient; other effects are that cards which cost less than a ticket must be offered in bulk (or else as standard barters). There are {{at any given time}} a large number of online 'bots', which are vendors who offer prices for buying and selling digital objects down to the hundredth of a ticket (maintaining a balance on account of fractional tickets for users where needed). Furthermore, in August 2009 the limit of cards allowed per trade was raised from 32 to 75, allowing much more flexibility. This limit was raised further in 2013 to allow for a maximum of 400 cards per trade.|$|R
5000|$|To fold is {{to discard}} one's hand and forfeit {{interest}} in the current pot. No further bets are required by the folding player, but the player cannot win. Folding may be indicated verbally or by discarding one's hand face down into the pile of other discards called the muck, or into the pot (uncommon). For this reason it is also called mucking. In stud poker played in the United States, it is customary to signal folding by turning all of one's cards face down. Once a person indicates a fold or states I fold, that person cannot re-enter the hand. In casinos in the United Kingdom, a player folds by giving their hand as is to the [...] "house" [...] dealer, who <b>spreads</b> the <b>cards</b> face up for the other players to see before mucking them.|$|R
6000|$|The {{last time}} I saw him was in Switzerland, {{a few months}} ago. He {{appeared}} indifferent {{to the subject of}} golf, but talked much about whist. We met by chance at Grindelwald, and agreed to climb the Faulhorn together next morning. Half-way up we rested, and I strolled on a little way by myself to gain a view. Returning, I found him with a [...] "Cavendish" [...] in his hand and a pack of <b>cards</b> <b>spread</b> out before him on the grass, solving a problem.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the player}} does not drop, he {{must take a}} card from the top or one under from the discard pile or from the stock. The player may then lay face up any spreads, or add to any spreads on the table. If after this the player has no more cards, he says, [...] "tonk" [...] and wins. Each player pays him a double stake. Some play that a player must <b>spread</b> with six <b>cards</b> to tonk, {{otherwise}} the player goes out with zero effectively ending the game but only winning a single stake.|$|R
50|$|Shuffling is {{the process}} of {{bringing}} the cards of a pack into a random order. There are a large number of techniques with various advantages and disadvantages. Riffle shuffling is a method in which the deck is divided into two roughly equal-sized halves that are bent and then released, so that the cards interlace. Repeating this process several times randomizes the deck well, but the method is harder to learn than some others and may damage the cards. The overhand shuffle and the Hindu shuffle are two techniques that work by taking batches of cards {{from the top of the}} deck and reassembling them in the opposite order. They are easier to learn but must be repeated more often. A method suitable for small children consists in <b>spreading</b> the <b>cards</b> on a large surface and moving them around before picking up the deck again. This is also the most common method for shuffling tiles such as dominoes.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of card {{shuffling}} where a pack of <b>cards,</b> <b>spread</b> as points on a rectangular table, are repeatedly gathered locally at random spots and then spread towards a random direction. A shuffling or permutation of the cards is then obtained by arranging the cards by their increasing x-coordinate values. When there are m {{cards on the table}} we show that this random ordering gets mixed in time O(m). Explicit constants are evaluated in the diffusion limit when the position of m cards evolves as a 2 m-dimensional non-reversible reflected jump diffusion in time. The analysis involves planar Brownian motion and a new coupling method that is of independent interest. Comment: 31 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{contestant}} {{begins the}} game with a pack of 20 cards - 10 of which have the numbers 0-9, 10 of which have the four basic mathematic operations (+, -, ×, ÷). Additional packs of cards can be bought for 1, 2, or 3 garnets, with the effectiveness of each pack based on their price. Players must construct a deck of 20 cards using those they began with and those they purchased. Upon their turn, the cards are given to the dealer, who shuffles them up to three times at the player's request, <b>spreading</b> out the <b>cards</b> after each shuffle so the player can see the order of the cards. (The purchased cards have a differently-colored back, indicating where they are in the deck.) ...|$|R
2500|$|As <b>cards</b> <b>spread</b> from Italy to Germanic countries, the Latin suits were {{replaced}} with the suits of Leaves (or Shields), Hearts (or Roses), Bells, and Acorns, and a combination of Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in the French suits of trèfles (clovers), carreaux (tiles), cœurs (hearts), and piques (pikes) around 1480.

40|$|Thousands of U. S. {{households}} {{filed for}} bankruptcy just before the bankruptcy law changed in 2005. That rush-to-file was more pronounced, we find, in states with more generous bankruptcy exemptions and lower credit scores. We take that finding {{as evidence that the}} new law effectively reduces exemptions, which in turn should reduce the ?demand? for bankruptcy and the resulting losses to suppliers of consumer credit. We expect the savings to suppliers will be shared with borrowers by way of lower credit card rates, although credit <b>card</b> <b>spreads</b> have not yet fallen. If cheaper credit is the upside of the new law, the downside is reduced bankruptcy ?insurance? against bad luck. The overall impact of the new law on the average household depends on how one weighs those two sides. Bankruptcy; Consumer credit...|$|R

5000|$|German {{playing cards}} are {{a style of}} playing cards used {{in some parts of}} Central Europe. Playing cards (Spielkarten) entered German-speaking lands around the late 1370s. After much experimentation, the cards settled into new suits of Acorns (Eichel), Leaves (Grün or Blatt), Hearts (Herz) and Bells (Schelle) around 1450. Closely related Swiss playing cards are used in German-speaking Switzerland. The French suit symbols were derived from the German ones around 1480. German-suited <b>cards</b> <b>spread</b> {{throughout}} Central Europe into areas that were once under German or Austrian control (Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Transylvania, Banat, Vojvodina, South Tyrol, Transcarpathia, and parts of Poland). They were also produced and used as far east as Russia until the early 20th century. German-suited decks are not well known all over these countries including parts of Germany itself as they have been undergoing strong competition from French playing cards since the late 17th-century. Traditional card games in which the German suits are used include Skat, Schafkopf, Doppelkopf and Watten.|$|R
5000|$|In the Microsoft {{family of}} {{operating}} systems, Windows XP {{was the first}} to properly make use of virtual IRQs provided by the local APIC, with some partial support present in Windows 2000. In Windows 2000, the <b>spreading</b> of PCI <b>card</b> interrupts to virtual IRQ happens only if the machine also has an I/O APIC. Microsoft blamed their Windows 2000 implementation on information they had received from Intel supposedly promising that all future systems would contain an I/O APIC as well, something that in retrospect did not happen. (A Microsoft document from that era even claimed that [...] "without an I/O APIC in the system, the local APICs are useless. In such a situation, Windows 2000 has to revert to using the 8259 PIC.") The sudden widespread use of the local APIC with Windows XP did expose a number of bugs in various BIOS implementations. In particular, Microsoft was forced to retain the PCI IRQ stacking behavior for any machine with a CardBus controller (and without an I/O APIC).|$|R
