25|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} between Luke and Acts, amounting {{at times to}} outright contradiction. For example, the gospel seems to place the Ascension on Easter Sunday, immediately after the Resurrection, while Acts 1 puts it forty days later. There are similar conflicts over the theology. While not seriously questioning the single authorship of Luke–Acts, these differences do <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> caution in seeking too much consistency in books written in essence as popular literature.|$|E
25|$|Colic may {{be managed}} {{medically}} or surgically. Severe clinical signs often <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> surgery, {{especially if they}} can not be controlled with analgesics. Immediate surgical intervention may be required, but surgery can be counter-indicated in some cases of colic, so diagnostic tests are used to help discover the cause of the colic and guide the practitioner in determining the need for surgery (See Diagnosis). The majority of colics (approximately 90%) can be successfully managed medically.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{signs of}} colic are usually referable to pain, {{although}} the horse may appear depressed rather than painful {{in cases of}} necrosis (tissue death) of the gastrointestinal tract, inflammation of the intestines, endotoxemia, or significant dehydration. Pain levels are often {{used to determine the}} need for surgery (See Surgical intervention). Horses are more likely to require surgery if they display severe clinical signs that can not be controlled by the administration of analgesics and sedatives, or have persistent signs that require multiple administrations of such drugs. Heart rate is often used as a measure of the animal's pain level and a heart rate >60 bpm is more likely to require surgery. However, this measure can be deceiving {{in the early stages of}} a severe colic, when the horse may still retain a relatively low rate. Additionally, pain tolerance of the individual must be taken into account, since very stoic animals with severe cases of colic may not show adequate levels of pain to <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> surgery. High heart rates (>60 bpm), prolonged capillary refill time (CRT), and congested mucous membranes suggest cardiovascular compromise and the need for more intense management. Decreased or absent gut sounds often <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> surgical intervention if prolonged.|$|E
25|$|Darwin's fox is {{considered}} critically endangered {{because of their}} small known population of 250 mature individuals {{as well as their}} restricted distribution. On the Chilean mainland, the population is limited to Nahuelbuta National Park and the surrounding Valdivian rainforest. Similarly on Chiloé Island, their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwestern most part of the island. Though the Nahuelbuta National Park is protected, 90% of the species live on Chiloé Island. A major problem the species faces, therefore, is their dwindling, limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests. Because of deforestation, the Darwin's fox habitat is shrinking, allowing for their competitor's (chilla fox) preferred habitat of open space, to increase; the Darwin's fox, subsequently, is being outcompeted. Another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs. To conserve these animals, researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the forests that link the Nahuelbuta National Park to the coast of Chile and in turn Chiloé Island and its forests, to be protected. They also suggest that other forests around Chile be examined to determine whether Darwin's foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future, should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise. And finally, the researchers advise {{for the creation of a}} captive breeding program, in Chile, because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild.|$|E

2500|$|The {{responsibility}} for {{water supply and}} sanitation in rural areas has in most countries been decentralised to the municipalities: they determine the water and sanitation needs and plan the infrastructure, in line with the national water laws. Various central governments have created a national social fund (supported by donors) from which the municipalities can draw money to finance rural {{water supply and sanitation}} infrastructure. Although the municipalities usually own the infrastructure, they rarely provide the service. This it is rather delegated to community-led organisations or local private companies.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to providing examples from the WDMET data for indirect injury due to propagating shear and stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck expresses an openness {{to the idea of}} pressure transients propagating via blood vessels can cause indirect injuries. [...] "For example, pressure transients arising from an abdominal gunshot wound might propagate through the vena cavae and jugular venous system into the cranial cavity and cause a precipitous rise in intracranial pressure there, with attendant transient neurological dysfunction." [...] (p.154) However, no examples of this injury mechanism are presented from the WDMET data. However, the authors <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> additional studies writing, [...] "Clinical and experimental data need to be gathered before such indirect injuries can be confirmed." [...] Distant injuries of this nature were later confirmed in the experimental data of Swedish and Chinese researchers, in the clinical findings of Krajsa [...] and in autopsy findings from Iraq.|$|E
60|$|I may remark, however, {{that they}} seem to <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> some {{modification}} of the current conception; since they make it tolerably clear that the process is a much less uniform one than is supposed. The usual idea is that a vast rotating nebulous spheroid arises before there are produced any of the planet-forming rings. But both of these photographs apparently imply that, in some cases at any rate, the portions of nebulous matter composing the rings take shape before they reach the central mass. It looks as though these partially-formed annuli must be prevented by their acquired motions from approaching even very near to the still-irregular body they surround.|$|E
