5000|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> Stirling <b>engine</b> is a heat <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> by a {{temperature}} gradient {{generated by the}} sun. It was patented by Roelf J. Meijer in 1987.His invention relates a heat engine, such as a Stirling cycle engine, with a solar dish collector {{in order to produce}} electricity. This apparatus consists of a large dish aimed at the sun to reflect the rays into the focus point, which is located {{at the center of the}} dish. Solar energy is then collected in the form of heat to fuel a Stirling cycle engine, [...] which operates by letting heat flow from a hot source to a cold sink in order to do work. The work output of the Stirling cycle is then used to drive a generator and create electric power. Moreover, in Meijer’s solar-powered engine, it is important that the dish always be pointed directly at the sun so that no shadows would be present in the solar dish collector, hence optimizing heat collection. This is where he ran into some issues because, in order for the apparatus to have a complete range of motion, lubrication and rotational systems would be necessary and may compromise structural stability.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of liquid metal heat-pipes {{for use in}} <b>solar</b> <b>powered</b> Stirling <b>engines</b> {{has led to an}} in-depth analysis of heat-pipe wick properties. To model the flow of liquid sodium through the wick its two-phase permeability measurement is of interest. The permeability will be measured by constructing a test cell made up of a wick sample sintered to a manifold. Measuring the volumetric flow rate through the wick will allow for a determination of the wick's permeability as a function of pressure. Currently, simple estimates of permeability as a function of vapor fraction of a porous media are being used as a model to calculate the two-phase permeability. The above mentioned experiment will be used to test the existing formulas validity. The plan is to make use of a known procedure for testing permeability and apply those techniques to a felt-metal wick. The results will be used to verify and/or modify the two-phase permeability estimates. With the increasing desire to replace directly illuminated engines with the much more efficient heat-pipe apparatus it is inherently clear that the usefulness of known wick properties will make wick permeability design a simpler process...|$|R
