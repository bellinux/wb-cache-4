500|$|Kneale {{also sought}} to make [...] "a comment on {{television}} {{and the idea of}} the passive audience", depicting a world where the media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low-quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction, where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans, mediaspeak and predominantly visual media. He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and if you had a verbally reduced society, you would get the kind of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{was written by}} a team of 13 writers from London aged between 17 and 22 who responded to a writing {{competition}} and attended a summer school in August 2009 as part of the BBC's new talent initiative, where they created the entire series. The summer school took place over four weeks, with the first two weeks in Theatre Royal Stratford East and the last two at the BBC centre at Elstree Studios. The writers did not know they would be writing a spin-off to EastEnders until they arrived. The writers, including Florence Vincent, Alex Oates, Kashman Harris and Emer Kenny, also wrote the ten episodes of series 2. They are from various parts of London, which Sathe said was [...] "brilliant" [...] as they represent different parts of life in London, and they have grown up with the Internet as a native medium. Santer stated that the writers created a new Walford, calling it a [...] "fresh perspective on a British classic." [...] The writers were given a day to travel around East London to listen to people talking to get ideas. Sathe commented: [...] "We created some brilliant scenes from the eavesdropping stuff." [...] After the summer school, the writers were commissioned to write the 12 episodes of series 1. Some of the scripts were allowed by be changed by the actors if they thought lines were not authentic, {{such as the use of}} London street slang. Sathe considered the use of slang to be a highlight of the series, calling it her proudest moment. Storylining and character creation for series 2 started in January 2010. The third series used mostly different writers to the first two. Each potential writer had to send in a monologue for a character they would like to <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> and the production team chose their favourites. The writers were then asked to write a scene between their character and one of the established EastEnders characters. Following this, the writers were interviewed and the most promising fifteen were selected. Kenny returned as a writer for series 3 and was joined by several of the young EastEnders cast members: Arinze Kene (Connor Stanley), Himesh Patel (Tamwar Masood) and Charlie G Hawkins (Darren Miller).|$|E
2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
