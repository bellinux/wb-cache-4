5000|$|In the Song dynasty, several {{weapons were}} {{referred}} to as ji, but they were developed from spears, not from ancient ji. One variety was called the qinglong ji (...) , and had a spear tip with a crescent blade on one side. Another type was the fangtian ji (...) , which had a spear tip with crescent blades on both sides. They had multiple means of attack: the <b>side</b> <b>blade</b> or blades, the spear tip, plus often a rear counterweight {{that could be used}} to strike the opponent. The way the side blades were fixed to the shaft differs, but usually there were empty spaces between the pole and the <b>side</b> <b>blade.</b> The wielder could strike with the shaft, with the option of then pulling the weapon back to hook with a side blade; or, he could slap his opponent with the flat side of the blade to knock him off his horse.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} the loss sources in an advanced GE transonic compressor design with high reaction and high stage loading. This advanced compressor has been investigated both experimentally and analytically in the past. The measured compressor efficiency is significantly lower than the efficiency calculated with various existing tools based on RANS and URANS. The general understanding is that some important flow physics in this modern compressor design are not represented in the current tools. To pinpoint the source of the efficiency miss, an advanced test with detailed flow traverse was performed for the front one and a half stage at the NASA Glenn Research Center. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is employed to determine whether a higher-fidelity simulation can pick up any additional flow physics that can explain past efficiency miss with RANS and URANS. The results from the Large Eddy Simulation were compared with the NASA test results and the GE interpretation of the test data. LES calculates lower total pressure and higher total temperature on the pressure side of the stator, resulting in large loss generation on the pressure side of the stator. On the other hand, existing tools based on the RANS and URANS do not calculate this high total temperature and low total pressure on the pressure side of the stator. The calculated loss through the stator from LES seems to match the measured data and the GE data interpretation. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow field from LES indicates that the accumulation of high loss near the pressure side of the stator is due to the interaction of the rotor wake with the stator blade. The strong rotor wake interacts quite differently with the pressure side of the stator than with the suction side of the stator blade. The concave curvature on the pressure side of the stator blade increases the mixing of the rotor wake with the pressure side boundary layer significantly. On the other hand, the convex curvature on the suction side of the stator blade decreases the mixing and the suction <b>side</b> <b>blade</b> boundary layer remains thin. The jet velocity in the rotor wake in the stator frame seems to magnify the curvature effect in addition to inviscid redistribution of wake fluid toward the pressure side of the blade...|$|E
40|$|Axial {{flow pump}} runners known as {{inducers}} {{are subject to}} complex internal flows and fluid-induced lateral and rotordynamic forces. The internal flows in inducers are three dimensional and are characterized by complicated secondary flows. The current research investigates the boundary layer flows on the blades, hub and housing of unshrouded and shrouded axial flow inducers using flow visualization techniques. Rotordynamic and lateral force data on unshrouded inducers were also obtained under varying conditions of flow and whirl. Studies on the internal flows showed that the blade boundary layer flow had strong radial components at off-design conditions. The flow remains attached to the blade surface of unshrouded inducers at all flow coefficients tested. The origin of the upstream swirling backflow {{was found to be}} at the discharge plane of the inducer. In addition, flow reversal was observed at the suction <b>side</b> <b>blade</b> tip near the leading edge in a shrouded inducer. Re-entry of the hub boundary layer flow (a downstream backflow) into the blade passage area was observed at flow coefficients below design. For unshrouded inducers the radially outward flow near the blade tip mixed with the tip clearance leakage flow to form the upstream backflow. These observations provide {{a better understanding of the}} internal flows and the occurrence of upstream backflows in inducers. The rotordynamic forces acting on an inducer due to an imposed whirl motion was also investigated. It was found that the rotordynamic force data at various whirl frequency ratios does not allow a normal quadratic fit; consequently the conventional inertial, stiffness and damping coefficients cannot be obtained and a definite whirl ratio describing the instability region does not result. Rotordynamic forces were found to be significantly dependent on the flow coefficient. At flow coefficients below design, these forces are characterized by multiple zero crossings at various whirl frequencies and large destabilizing peaks. Theoretical estimates of the tangential rotordynamic force on a non-whirling inducer using actuator disk theory were significantly different, both in magnitude and direction, from the experimentally measured forces. The effect of upstream and downstream flow distortions on the rotordynamic and lateral forces on an inducer were studied. It was found that at flow coefficients below design, large lateral forces occurred in the presence of a downstream asymmetry. The reverse flows occurring downstream which consist of high energy fluid are the possible cause of these large forces. The imposition of a uniform downstream condition reduced these forces to near zero values. Results of inlet distortion experiments show that a strong inlet shear causes a significant increase in the lateral force. However, weak inlet shear flows and the flow asymmetry due to a 180 ° upstream bend did not cause a significant lateral force. It was found that flow distortions upstream or downstream did not cause any significant effect on the rotordynamic forces. Cavitation was found to have important consequences for fluid-induced rotordynamic forces. These forces become destabilizing for both forward and reverse whirl. The magnitudes of the destabilizing forces were found to increase with decreasing cavitation numbers...|$|E
