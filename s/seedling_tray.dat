40|$|Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) {{seedlings}} diseases {{caused by}} soilborne pathogens are characterised by root rot, stem rot and damping-off of the seedlings {{that can occur}} {{at any time during}} growth. Fusarium solani, Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani are known to be the important destructive pathogens of lettuce, causing severe yield losses in South Africa. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of three selected fungicides to control these pathogens on lettuce seedlings. In this study the fungicides metalaxyl (Apron®), fludioxonil (Celest®) and mefenoxam (Subdue®) were applied at two concentrations as single and double doses on lettuce seedlings to determine their efficacy to control the pathogens Fusarium solani, Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani after significant reduction of mycelia growth was observed in vitro. Cultures of P. ultimum (UPGH 024), R. solani (UPGH 122) and F. solani (UPGH 122) were obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, University of Pretoria and cultivated on PDA for 2 days at 25 ºC. Pasteurised soil was artificially inoculated with these pathogens. For the first experiment lettuce seeds were planted in polystyrene <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> at a depth of 1. 0 cm. There were four replications of 50 seeds per treatment. In Experiment 2 pots (12 cm x 7 cm) were filled with pasteurised growing medium and 3 -week old seedlings were transplanted. There were three replications of six pots containing three plants each. Seedling trays and pots were drenched with fungicides and placed in a randomised block design in a controlled environment room at 20 - 26 °C with a 12 h-light/dark regime. The <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> and pots were rotated daily in the room. Seedling trays and pots were watered daily to maintain field capacity. The seedlings were able to grow larger in the pots than in <b>seedling</b> <b>trays.</b> It was confirmed that the treatment with fludioxonil (Celest®) at double and single dose inhibited the growth of the three fungi F. solani, P. ultimum and R. solani on lettuce seedlings without causing phytotoxicity. All three fungicides significantly reduced the diseases caused by the three pathogens. These findings are consistent with previous reports that fludioxonil, metalaxyl and mefenoxam can control oomycete fungi. There are few registered fungicides for the control of Fusarium solani, Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani on lettuce, therefore further work will aim to confirm these results in the field.

40|$|Automatic transplanters {{have been}} very {{important}} in greenhouses since the popularization of seedling nurseries. End-effector development is a key technology for transplanting plug seedlings. Most existing end-effectors have problems with holding root plugs or releasing plugs. An efficient end-effector driven by a linear pneumatic cylinder was designed in this study, which could hold root plugs firmly and release plugs easily. This end-effector with four needles could clamp the plug simultaneously while the needles penetrate into the substrate. The depth and verticality of the needles could be adjusted conveniently for different <b>seedling</b> <b>trays.</b> The effectiveness of this end-effector was tested by a combinational trial examining three seedling nursery factors (the moisture content of the substrate, substrate bulk density and the volume proportion of substrate ingredients). Results showed that the total transplanting success rate for the end-effector was 100 %, and the root plug harm rate was below 17 %. A force measure system with tension and pressure transducers was installed on the designed end-effector. The adhesive force FL between the root plug and the cell of <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> and the extrusion force FK on the root plug were measured and analyzed. The results showed that all three variable factors and their interactions had significant effects on the extrusion force. Each factor {{had a significant effect}} on adhesive force.

30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|E

40|$|Cowpea is a worldwide-distributed crop, and is {{important}} to the livelihood of poor people in developing countries. Cowpea is also susceptible {{to a wide range of}} pests and pathogens, which can cause damage to the crop at all stages. Seedling diseases caused by pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani Fusarium solani and Pythium spp. affect cowpea and result in low yields especially in rural areas where there are few or no control measures against these pathogens. This research aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a biological control agent and fungicides against fungal seedling diseases of cowpea. The bacterium, Bacillus cereus 1, and the fungicides, Apron®, Subdue® and Celest® were screened for the control of cowpea seedling diseases, after obtaining promising in vitro results on their effectivity against Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium ultimum and Fusarium solani. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> with 128 cells, each filled with pasteurised growing medium (Braaks lawn dressing). Seedling trays were placed randomly on greenhouse tables with four replication per treatment, each replication consisting of 56 plants. Cowpea seeds (Cultivar-Pietersburg blue) were obtained from the Dry Bean Seeds Producers Organisation. The pasteurised growing medium was artificially inoculated with the three fungi. Two plugs of actively growing fungal mycelium of the three pathogens were inoculated in each cell of the polystyrene <b>seedling</b> <b>trays.</b> Trays were drenched with Bacillus cereus 1 at 106 cells/ml (3 ml per tray cell) at planting and fungicides were applied on the 14 th and 28 th days at the recommended rate. The experiment was conducted at temperatures ranging from 22 - 25 oC. Plants were harvested on the 35 th day after planting and percentage germination, diseased height of the plants and dry mass of roots and shoots were determined. Results indicated that the biological control agent (B. cereus 1) was able to significantly reduce the damage done by the pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium ultimum and Fusarium solani in all trials. It was also confirmed that the application of the biological control agent during planting could reduce disease incidence. The biological control agent increased seed emergence rate and shoot length. All three fungicides significantly reduced the disease incidence caused by all pathogens. All fungicides treatments applied increased emergence rate and shoot length. Seedling diseases should be given too much attention, as they cause severe losses to many crops. There is a need for future research on the effectivity of B. cereus 1 as relatively little work has been published on its antagonistic behaviour against seedling diseases. There are also few registered fungicides available for the control of these seedling diseases on cowpea, therefore research on these and other potential products is required as seedling diseases play a major role in reducing yield of many crops.

30|$|Through the {{observation}} of the test process, {{it is found that}} the reason for the breakage of the seedling ejection in the bowl is that the contact area between the push rod mechanism and the bowl <b>seedling</b> <b>tray</b> is too small. The uneven force the seedling plate bears in the process of transporting the pushing disk leads to a certain degree of inclination on the conveyor belt, which affects the positioning accuracy of the seedling during the process of ejection. It can be considered to increase the effective contact area between the push rod and the seedling plate and to improve the stability of the pushing process to reduce the breakage rate of pushing seedlings. The reason of the failure seedling dropping is that the contact area between the grafted claw and the bowl seedling is too small, which leads to large clamping pressure, resulting in the collapse of the pot and dropping failure. Therefore, the seedling claw should be designed according to the characteristics of the substrate. The clamping force is matched with the mechanical characteristics of the seedling, which can increase the success rate of seedling feeding and impugn and rove the conveying efficiency.|$|E

Dessa forma, o experimento foi conduzido em Ponta Grossa (PR), e teve como objetivo avaliar efeitos do tipo de bandejas e de cultivares na produção de plântulas e no rendimento da chicória. Foram realizados dois cultivos, sendo o primeiro com semeadura em 20 / 07 / 04 e 11 / 09 / 04 para o segundo cultivo. As plântulas foram produzidas sob ambiente protegido, com o delineamento {{experimental}} de blocos casualizados com quatro repetições, sendo os tratamentos arranjados conforme fatorial 2 x 3, sendo duas cultivares, a chicória Crespa e a Lisa (ISLA) e três tipos de bandejas de poliestireno expandido, com 128 células (40 cm³), 200 células (16 cm³) e 288 células (12 cm³). O substrato usado foi o Plantmax®. As plântulas foram avaliadas aos 36 e 34 dias, nas seguintes características, no primeiro e segundo cultivo: altura da parte aérea, massa fresca e seca da parte aérea, comprimento da raiz, massa fresca e seca da raiz. Os experimentos de campo foram conduzidos nos dois cultivos com o delineamento experimental de blocos casualizados com quatro repetições, constando seis tratamentos: 1) cultivar Crespa com plântula proveniente da bandeja de 128 células; 2) cultivar Crespa com plântula proveniente da bandeja de 200 células; 3) cultivar Crespa com plântula proveniente da bandeja de 288 células; 4) cultivar Lisa com plântula proveniente da bandeja de 128 células; 5) cultivar Lisa com plântula proveniente da bandeja de 200 células; 6) cultivar Lisa com plântula proveniente da bandeja de 288 células. O transplante foi realizado aos 36 e 34 dias da semeadura no primeiro e segundo cultivo, respectivamente, em parcelas com três fileiras de plantas arranjadas no espaçamento 0, 30 x 0, 30 m. Na colheita da chicória, realizada aos 50 dias do transplante para o primeiro cultivo e aos 49 dias para o segundo, as características de diâmetro da cabeça, altura da parte aérea, número de folhas, massa fresca e seca da cabeça foram avaliadas. Dos resultados obtidos nos dois cultivos pode-se concluir que, entre os tipos de bandejas, a de 128 células propiciou maior rapidez no desenvolvimento, tanto da parte aérea como da raiz, conferindo em menor tempo plântulas com melhor qualidade. As plântulas produzidas em bandejas propiciaram no campo estande de 100 % após o transplante e alta uniformidade no desenvolvimento das plantas. Plântulas provenientes da bandeja de 128 células demonstraram não só melhor qualidade no estádio inicial, mas as características positivas refletiram no desempenho da planta e no seu rendimento, obtendo-se cabeças de chicória com maior massa fresca.

The seedlings were transplanted at 36 and 34 days in the first and second crop, respectively, in plots with eight plants in each row arranged in 0, 30 x 0, 30 m. Harvesting was realized after 50 days of the transplanting date on the first crop and at 49 days on the second crop, it was avaluated the head diameter, height of aerial part, leaves number, fresh and dried weight of aerial part and roots. Considering the results obtained from two crops it was concluded that among trays types, the 128 cells was faster on upper part and root development, obtaining a seedling earlier and with quality. <b>Seedlings</b> from <b>trays</b> showed on field experiments stand of 100 % and high uniformity on plant development. <b>Seedlings</b> from <b>tray</b> of 128 cells had the highest quality on the seedlings stage and its quality reflected on plant performance and the yield, obtaining a endive head with higher fresh weight. The both cultivars Crespa and Lisa showed similar behaviour on both experiment at the seedling stage and on the crop development...|$|R
40|$|This {{study with}} {{beetroot}} seedlings, cultivar Top Tall Early Wonder, {{was carried out}} at the State University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UEMS/Aquidauana), from October to November 2008. Three environments of cultivation were used: greenhouse; nursery with monofilament screen of 50 % of shading; and nursery with aluminized thermal reflective screen of 50 % of shading. In these environments, three polystyrene trays of 72, 128 and 200 cells, filled with four substrates, were tested: soil; Plantmax®; coconut fiber and vermiculite. There were no replication environments and then each one was considered an experiment alone. For each environment, it was adopted a completely randomized design in factorial scheme 3 x 4 (three trays x four substrates), with four replications, performing individual analysis of variance and joint analysis of experiments for environment comparisons. The monofilament screen is the best environment for <b>seedlings</b> produced in <b>tray</b> of 72 cells, and the greenhouse was the best environment for <b>seedlings</b> produced in <b>trays</b> of 128 cells. The best seedlings were formed in the tray of 72 cells. Vermiculite was the best substrate...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} is very {{closely related to}} the application of fertilizer to induce plants grow. The application of bio-fertilizers is expected to reduce the negative impact of chemical fertilizers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of multi-functional Azospirillum N 2 fixation, P solubility and IAA production on the growth of Ciherang rice in pot experiment in greenhouse BB Biogen. The experiment treatment were 3 types of inoculation (non-inoculation, inoculation using wildtype Aj Bandung 6. 4. 1. 2 and the mutant isolate of AJM 3. 7. 1. 14), and 4 levels of fertilizer application (non-fertilization, a quarter dose, a half dose, and the real dose of fertilization on rice in lowland). The Azospirillum isolates were used wildtype isolate Aj Bandung 6. 4. 1. 2 and mutant isolate AJM 3. 7. 1. 14 that was isolated and mutated using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in BB Biogen. Seeds of Ciherang rice were inoculated using Azospirillum at cell density 10 6 cell/ml in different <b>seedling</b> <b>tray.</b> After 14 days, the seedlings were transferred to planting pots which consist of 3 plants per pot. Parameters observed were plant height, number of tillers, number of panicles per hill, wet and dry weight of panicles per hill, weight of 100 seeds, N and P content of the stover. The results showed that both wild- Azospirillum and mutant inoculum had no effect on the vegetative growth of Ciherang, but showed significant effect on the number of panicle per hill, grain weight per hill and dry weight of seeds per panicle. The use of Azospirillum and N fertilizer combination affected the growth and rice yields, also reduced chemical fertilizer application. </span...|$|E

40|$|AbstractChrysanthemum is an {{important}} cut flower grown widely in Cameron Highland, Malaysia. The chrysanthemum growers encountered soil-born diseases, nematodes and accumulation of salinity when production {{in the same area}} was practiced continuously. Soilless culture was a cultivation technique independent from soil condition. The purpose of this research was to determine the growth of chrysanthemum grown in two soilless systems included tray system and trough system. The <b>tray</b> system used <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> (50 holes, 140 cm 3 /hole) as container, and the trays were arranged over the raise base covered with polyethylene sheet. Cuttings of chrysanthemum ‘New Yellow’ were grown in the tray and arranged at density 81 plants/m 2. Each plant was irrigated by drip emitter 6 times/day with nutrient solution containing N 200, P 60, K 300 Mg 50, S 75, Fe 12, Mn 2, B 0. 3, Cu 0. 1, Zn 0. 1 mg/L. The trough system was made from polyethylene sheet with a thickness of 0. 04 mm laid over polyethylene sheet. The height of the trough was 15 cm and the width was 1 m. Chrysanthemum cuttings were grown in trough containing of coconut peat thickness 10 cm height and plants were fertigated with nutrient solution by drip tape once a day for three weeks, after that the plants were fertigated three times a week. The growth and flowering of chrysanthemum in the two systems were observed. The growth and quality of flowers produced in the tray and the trough system were similar. No significant differences in flower characteristics were observed between the two systems except for flower color. Chrysanthemum produced in both soilless systems received the same price for grade A as soil grown chrysanthemum. This indicated that chrysanthemum production in soilless system can be adopted to eliminate soil related diseases in the highlands...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} soil textures, sandy (97. 5 % sand, 1. 6 % silt, 0. 9 % clay), loamy sand (77 % sand, 11 % silt, 12 % clay) and a {{sandy clay loam}} (69 % sand, 7 % silt, 24 % clay), on root rot of wheat caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn Anastomosis Group (AG) 8 was studied under glasshouse conditions. The reduction in root and shoot biomass following inoculation with AG- 8 was greater in sand than in loamy sand or sandy clay loam. Dry root weight of wheat in the sand, loamy sand and sandy clay loam soils infested with AG- 8 was 91 %, 55 % and 28 % less than in control uninfested soils. There was greater moisture retention in the loamy sand and sandy clay loam soils {{as compared to the}} sand in the upper 10 - 20 cm. Root penetration resistance was greater in loamy sand and sandy clay loam than in sand. Root growth in the uninfested soil column was faster in the sand than in the loamy sand and sandy clay loam soils, the roots in the sandy soil being thinner than in the other two soils. Radial spread of the pathogen in these soils in <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> was twice as fast in the sand in comparison to the loamy sand which in turn was more than twice that in the sandy clay loam soil. There was no evidence that differences among soils in pathogenicity or soil spread of the pathogen was related to their nutrient status.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a semi-automatic two-row seedling transplanter for vegetablegrowers to transplant nursery seedlings. This machineis driven by a 6 ps / 2000 rpm gasoline engine with atransmission box which consist of 2 forward and 1 reverse shifts. The row spacing is fixed as 40 cm andthe planting distance is adjustable as 52 、 46 or 40 cm. Seven <b>seedling</b> <b>trays</b> could be carried each time. Themechanism of automatic leveling scraper is attachedto control planting depth automatically. When beingoperated in the field, the transplanter follows theridge edges with front wheels as an automatic guilder. The operator therefore, may concentrate on droppingseedlings into the cups of roulette. Seedlings aretransferred to the bill type dibblers and planted intothe soil. One operator with one roulette for two- rowtransplantation is the distinction of this machine. This special feature makes the machine lower laborrequirement. The field experimental results of cabbageseedling transplanting showed the performance of thistransplanter as follows ：the miss-planted ratio is 2. 4 %, over inclined 0. 4 %,damaged seedling 0 %, plantingdepth 99. 6 % and true planting space 100 % when 0. 33 m/sec forward speed. The field capacity of the machineis about 0. 11 ha/hr,which is 11 times of that by labortransplanting. Comparing with the cost of labor trans- planting, 62. 9 % of labor expense may be saved if thistransplanter is employed. 研究設計並試製一台手扶式半自動雙行蔬菜移植機，可提供給農友移 植蔬菜穴盤苗之用。該機配置 6 ps/ 2000 rpm汽油引擎，具前進二速、後退 一速選擇；種植行距固定為 40 cm，株距則有 52 、 46 及 40 cm 三段調整；貯 苗架可同時放置 7 盤穴盤苗，並藉畦面整平兼畦高自動追蹤之裝置可全自 動控制種植深度。作業時二前輪依循畦形導引自行前進，操作者僅須將菜 苗投入盛苗轉盤之待植苗杯內，即可由移植機的鴨嘴杯種植器定植於畦面 上並覆土。該機最大特色是僅單人即可作業，且一個盛苗轉盤供一畦兩行 種植，較傳統每種植一行需一個人工與一個供苗轉盤的作業方式，更為進 步與省工。田間測試結果顯示：當行進速度 0. 33 m/sec、株距 46 cm 進行甘 藍穴盤苗移植作業時，缺株率 2. 4 %、倒伏率 0. 4 %、傷苗率 0 %，種植深度與 實際株距範圍之合格率分別為 99. 6 %和 100 %，且作業能力為 0. 11 ha/hr，較 人工移植快達 11 倍，並節省 62. 9 ％的工作成本...|$|R
