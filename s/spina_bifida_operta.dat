40|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is {{a serious}} birth defect that in-volves an {{incomplete}} closure of the spine, spinal cord, brain, and/or protective covering of the fe-tal spine. Even though the causes of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> are still uncertain, diabetes, obesity, severe hyperthermia in early pregnancies, and poor nu-trition {{are believed to be}} causes of neural tube defects (NTDs). Because <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> may go undetected by α-fetoprotein screening and am-niocentesis, sonography becomes a valuable tool in its identification. <b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> can also affect the fetal brain, so sonography is important in de-tecting any abnormal fetal head signs associated with Arnold-Chiari (type II) malformation. Sur-gical planning is another important part of sonography’s role when detecting NTDs.

We constructed a 5 : 1 comparison group of patients with end stage renal disease without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> matched by age at first end stage renal disease service, gender and race/ethnicity. We assessed the risk of mortality and of renal transplantation while on dialysis using multivariate cause specific proportional hazards survival analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{provide new}} {{estimates}} {{of medical care}} utilization and expenditures over the lifespan for persons living with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> in the United States. Updated estimates are essential for calculations of lifetime costs and for economic evaluations of prevention and management strategies for <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2001 – 2003 MarketScan database on paid medical and pre-scription drug claims of persons covered by employer-sponsored health insurance in the United States. Med-ical care utilization and expenditures during 2003 were analyzed for persons with a diagnosis of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> recorded during 2001 – 2003 who had 12 months of coverage in a fee-for-service health plan. To calculate expenditures during infancy, a separate analysis was performed for those born during 2002 with claims and expenditures data during the first 12 months of life. We compared medical expenditures for persons with and without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> by age groups. RESULTS: Average incremental medical expenditures comparing patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and those without were $ 41, 460 per year at age 0, $ 14, 070 at ages 1 – 17, $ 13, 339 at ages 18 – 44, and $ 10, 134 at ages 45 – 64. Children ages 1 – 17 years with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> had average medical expenditures 13 times greater than children without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Adults with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> had average med-ical expenditures three to six times greater than adults without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> in this privately insured popula-tion.

The entry criteria were that individuals should have (i) intact global function, (ii) average verbal intelligence (or above), and (iii) should not have clinical depression. There were three sub-groups: patients with hydrocephalus and <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> patients with hydrocephalus without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> and patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> without hydrocephalus. Methods: Patients were neuropsychologically assessed {{as part of their}} normal clinical assessment during their annual medical review. Each individual completed a screening battery assessing global functioning, verbal intelligence, and mood. In addition they completed additional tests including measures of emotional intelligence, memory, attention, and executive function. Results were analysed to compare the performance of the patient sub-groups and to compare them to a healthy control group. Results: Patients with hydrocephalus (with or without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida)</b> were significantly impaired on the vast majority of all test scores as compared to patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and healthy controls.

40|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is {{the most}} common, congenital, {{neurological}} disorder. Children with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> live {{with a range of}} impairments depending on the severity and the location of the spinal defect. Medical treatment of the disorder is very complex and can involve decision-making processes around sensitive issues such as the termination of pregnancy, selection criteria for treatment, and euthanasia. There is however, insufficient scientific knowledge concerning the consequences of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> available as a basis for these complicated decision processes. This is specifically true for the psychosocial consequences of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Therefore, we studied the impact of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> on parents’ mental health and on their social adjustment within the parent-child relationship, the partner relationship, and the family climate. We conducted systemic reviews of the existing literature and interviewed the parents of 78 patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> who were born at or referred to the Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Associations are {{reported}} between myo-inositol, glucose, zinc and {{the occurrence of}} <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> To gain more insight into the pathogenesis of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> the concentrations of myo-inositol, glucose and zinc were determined in amniotic fluids from pregnancies with a <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> or unaffected control fetus. METHODS: Amniotic fluids of 27 pregnancies complicated by <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and 49 controls were collected at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University Medical Center Nijmegen in the Netherlands. Myo-inositol, glucose and zinc concentrations were determined. By indication, the samples were taken at different gestational ages. Therefore, the data were evaluated using multiple linear regression analysis to adjust for gestational age. RESULTS: Amniocentesis was performed at a more advanced gestational age in the <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> group than in controls. In the <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> group, amniotic fluid myo-inositol, glucose and zinc concentrations gradually declined throughout pregnancy. At a gestational age of 15 weeks, the estimated mean amniotic fluid glucose and zinc concentrations in the <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> group were, respectively, significantly lower (p< or = 0. 5) and higher (p< or = 0. 5) compared with the control group. At the same gestational age, the estimated mean myo-inositol concentrations were comparable in both groups. At a gestational age of 38 weeks, the estimated mean myo-inositol, glucose and zinc concentrations {{were not significantly different}} in the <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study may suggest that a derangement in zinc and glucose transfer or metabolism is associated with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Since compounds in amniotic fluid are only a very crude marker of the actual fetal condition, studies that focus on the metabolism of these compounds on tissue or even cellular level should be performed to clarify their role in the pathogenesis and future prevention of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is a {{developmental}} birth defect involving the neural tube.

Due to improvements in medical care, the life expectancy of children with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> has improved considerably and nowadays most children reach the adult age. However, {{little is known about the}} problems regarding the medical condition and the quality of life of adolescents and young adults with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and about their needs for medical care. The aim of the study was describe the functional limitations, social participation and subjective quality of life of Dutch young adults with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> in order to make recommendations concerning the care and support for this group of young adults. Participants were persons with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> aperta or <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> occulta and were between 16 and 25 years of age. A total of 179 (response 51 %) participated in this study. Results Many <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> patients suffer from secondary impairments such as incontinence, constipation, foot deformities, scoliosis and loss of mobility. The groups most likely to suffer from these impairments are young adults with hydrocephalus or a high level of lesion. Persons without hydrocephalus have a cognitive status similar to that of healthy peers. The cognitive status of the group of young adults with hydrocephalus is lower than that of the general population. Roughly half of the young adults with hydrocephalus suffer from specific or global cognitive impairments. Persons without hydrocephalus have an educational outcome similar to that of healthy peers. The educational outcome of the group of young adults with hydrocephalus is lower than that of the general population. Only half of the young adults with hydrocephalus attend regular secondary school. Intelligence level was the main predictor of educational outcome, but hydrocephalus and wheelchair dependence were additional significant predictors. Many young adults with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> experience participation restrictions for the domains of educational career, vocational status and residential status.
