5|$|The <b>snoring</b> rail (Aramidopsis plateni) {{also known}} as the Celebes rail or Platen's rail is a large flightless rail, {{the only member of the}} genus Aramidopsis. It is an Indonesian endemic found in dense {{vegetation}} in wet areas of Sulawesi and nearby Buton. The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a rufous patch on the hindneck. The sexes are similar, but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris. The typical call is the <b>snoring</b> ee-orrrr sound that gives the bird its English name.|$|E

40|$|Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) {{diagnosis}} is still done with an overnight multi-channel polysomnography. Several efforts {{are being made}} to study profoundly the <b>snore</b> mechanism and discover how it can {{provide an opportunity to}} diagnose the disease. This work introduces the concept of regular <b>snores,</b> defined as the ones produced in consecutive respiratory cycles, since they are produced in a regular way, without interruptions. We applied 2 thresholds (THadaptive and THmedian) to the time interval between successive <b>snores</b> of 34 subjects in order to select regular <b>snores</b> from the whole all-night <b>snore</b> sequence. Afterwards, we studied the effectiveness that parameters, such as time interval between successive <b>snores</b> and the mean intensity of <b>snores,</b> have on distinguishing between different levels of SAHS severity (AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) < 5 h- 1, AHI< 10 h- 1, AHI< 15 h- 1, AHI< 30 h- 1). Results showed that THadaptive outperformed THmedian on selecting regular <b>snores.</b> Moreover, the outcome achieved with non-regular <b>snores</b> intensity features suggests that these carry key information on SAHS severity.

This {{is useful to}} study the <b>snore</b> sounds of individuals when these sounds occur in a normal in-home sleeping environment, where two people are sleeping together and both produce sounds. Based on methods for blind source separation, we give a <b>snore</b> separator that solves the blind delayed source separation problem and provide a performance index to monitor its convergence. The separated <b>snores</b> can be analyzed to detect symptoms of sleep apnea prior to polysomnography or as a monitoring device after polysomnography has been performed.

40|$|Acoustical {{properties}} of <b>snores</b> {{have been widely}} studied as a potentially cost-effective and reliable alternative to diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with a common recognition that the diagnostic accuracy depends heavily on the <b>snore</b> signal quality and intelligibility. This paper proposes a novel preprocessing system that performs two critical tasks concurrently in a translation-invariant wavelet transform domain. These tasks include enhancement of <b>snore</b> signals via a level-correlation-dependent (LCD) threshold, and identification of <b>snore</b> presence through a <b>snore</b> activity (SA) detector. Various experiments were conducted to warrant the robustness of the system in terms of theoretical statistics quality, signal-to-noise ratio, mean opinion score, and clinical usefulness in detecting OSA. Results indicate that the proposed LCD threshold and SA detector are highly comparable to the existing denoising methodologies using level-dependent threshold and segmentation approaches using short-time energy and zero-crossing rate, yielding the best results in all the experiments. Given the strong initial performance of the proposed preprocessing system for <b>snore</b> signals, continued exploration in this direction could potentially lead to additional improvement in signal integrity, thereby increasing the diagnostic accuracy for OSA...|$|R

5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's <b>snoring</b> problem, a device which converts <b>snoring</b> to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} <b>snoring</b> rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E

40|$|One of humans’ {{auditory}} abilities is {{differentiation between}} sounds with slightly different frequencies. Recently, the auditory image model (AIM) {{was developed to}} numerically explain this auditory phenomenon. Acoustic analyses of <b>snore</b> sounds have been performed recently by using non-contact microphones. Snore/non-snore classification techniques have been required at the front-end of <b>snore</b> analyses. The performances of sound classification methods can be evaluated based on human hearing, which {{is considered to be}} the gold standard. In this paper, we propose a novel method of automatically extracting <b>snore</b> sounds from sleep sounds by using an AIM-based snore/non-snore classification system. We report that the proposed automatic classification method could achieve a sensitivity of 97. 2 % and specificity of 96. 3 % when analyzing <b>snore</b> and non-snore sounds from 40 subjects.

5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by <b>snoring,</b> brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSnoring is {{extremely}} {{common in the}} general population and when irregular may indicate the presence of obstructive sleep apnea. We analyze the overnight sequence of wave packets — the <b>snore</b> sound — recorded during full polysomnography in patients referred to the Sleep Laboratory due to suspected obstructive sleep apnea. We hypothesize that irregular <b>snore,</b> with duration in the range between 10 and 100 s, correlates with respiratory obstructive events. We find that the number of irregular <b>snores</b> — easily accessible, and quantified by what we call the <b>snore</b> time interval index (STII) — is in good agreement with the well-known apnea–hypopnea index, which expresses the severity of obstructive sleep apnea and is extracted only from polysomnography. In addition, the Hurst analysis of the <b>snore</b> sound itself, which calculates the fluctuations in the signal as a function of time interval, is used to build a classifier that is able to distinguish between patients with no or mild apnea and patients with moderate or severe apnea...|$|R

5|$|The <b>snoring</b> rail {{was first}} {{classified}} as Rallus plateni by German ornithologist August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius in 1860, but {{was moved to}} its current monotypic genus Aramidopsis by English zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1893. Following Taylor (1998), it {{was considered to be}} more similar to the Inaccessible Island and white-throated rails than to members of the Rallus genus, but a 2012 mitochondrial gene study suggests that it should actually be placed in Gallirallus, with Lewin's rail and the slaty-breasted rail as its closest relatives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers a {{classified}} ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, <b>snoring</b> in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's <b>snoring</b> (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

In this thesis, an audio-integrated <b>snore</b> active noise control system is developed to provide an effective and non-obtrusive means of reducing the loud <b>snore</b> while providing a peaceful and soothing environment for the bed partner. Computer simulations followed by real-time experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the <b>snore</b> ANC systems based on headboard and pillow setups. The two setups are tested using the single-channel, multi-channel, and pseudo feedforward ANC systems based on the FXLMS algorithm. The performance of the ANC systems based on the pillow setup yielded optimum noise reduction at the ears of the snorer's bed partner. It also shows that the multi-channel feedforward ANC system based on the 1 x 2 x 2 FXLMS algorithm has the best noise cancelling performance. In this thesis, a non-obtrusive method of detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is presented. This is integrated with the <b>snore</b> ANC system using common microphone and digital hardware. The detection of OSA is based on the bispectral analysis of the <b>snore</b> signals. Computer simulation is successfully used to detect OSA based on bispectrum plots from the <b>snore</b> signals...|$|R

5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (<b>snoring</b> and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints.

Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit <b>snoring</b> loudly through the service.

5|$|Oan, {{angered by}} the BBC's {{incorrect}} reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages {{would be the last}} to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the latter was apparently released {{for no other reason than}} his loud <b>snoring,</b> which kept the other hostages awake at night.|$|E
