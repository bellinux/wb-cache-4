5000|$|The Antonov An-28 (NATO {{reporting}} name Cash) is a twin-engined light turboprop transport aircraft, {{developed from}} the Antonov An-14M. It was the winner of a competition against the Beriev Be-30, for use by Aeroflot as a <b>short-range</b> <b>airliner.</b> [...] It first flew in 1969. A total of 191 were built and 16 remain in airline service as at August 2015. After a short pre-production series built by Antonov, it was licence-built in Poland by PZL-Mielec. In 1993, PZL-Mielec developed its own improved variant, the PZL M28 Skytruck.|$|E
5000|$|The Vickers VC.1 Viking was a British {{twin-engine}} <b>short-range</b> <b>airliner</b> {{derived from}} the Vickers Wellington bomber and built by Vickers-Armstrongs Limited at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey. In {{the aftermath of the}} Second World War, the Viking was an important airliner with British airlines pending the development of turboprop aircraft like the Viscount. An experimental airframe was fitted with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets and first flown in 1948 as the world's first pure jet transport aircraft. Military developments were the Vickers Valetta and the Vickers Varsity ...|$|E

50|$|The British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven, {{also known}} as the BAC-111 or BAC 1-11, was a British <b>short-range</b> jet <b>{{airliner}}</b> used during the 1960s and 1970s. It was the second short-haul jet airliner to enter service, following the French Sud Aviation Caravelle. The aircraft was also produced under license in Romania during the 1980s as the Rombac One-Eleven.|$|R
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Handley Page {{developed}} a new fast <b>short-range</b> regional <b>airliner,</b> intended to replace the venerable Douglas DC-3, particularly in third-world countries. The design, originally known as the HPR-3 Herald, emanated from the drawing office at Handley Page (Reading) Limited—the former Miles Aircraft factory site, which had developed an earlier airliner design, the Miles Marathon. The Herald was an extensive re-development of the original concept of the Marathon, notable for its high mounted wing. The HP Reading division succeeded in producing a modern design with excellent flight and performance characteristics. However, the company made a serious misjudgement which was, in the end, to cost the company dearly, and like some other classic British aircraft of the time, the Herald missed its chance.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{manufacture}} and certification of composite laminates, which pose interesting challenges, unique to their anisotropic, layered design. The aerospace industry is using composite materials more extensively {{with each new}} generation of aircraft, {{and there is a}} need to reduce cost and increase rate of production, particularly going forward with smaller, <b>short-range</b> <b>airliners.</b> A C-section laminate with novel, anti-symmetric stacking sequences is designed and manufactured using automated fibre placement (AFP) and autoclave cure. The layup is designed to improve consolidation and reduce warpage, whilst minimising the requirement for interim de-bulking. It is shown not only that anti-symmetric laminates can be successfully industrially manufactured, but that they provide significant potential benefit over more conventional balanced, symmetric laminates. Compared against such a baseline, the novel laminate is found to increase consolidation by 8. 7 % and achieve a cured ply thickness closer to the nominal value quoted by the manufacturer. It is also found to reduce twisting warpage by 48 %. The use of an antisymmetric layup is key to this success, since there are found to be more than an order of magnitude more fully uncoupled anti-symmetric sequences than symmetric. The increased design space allows for a ‘protected zone’, into which plies that would otherwise restrict consolidation are positioned. Industrial components are typically certified by testing narrow witness specimens, cut from their ends. These specimens have exposed free edges, which have been found to significantly reduce the 3 D strength. This is known as the edge effect and means this certification method does not truly represent the full-size component, which is typically very wide and built into surrounding structure. A new treatment process is developed, whereby a layer of resin is applied to the free edges. This significantly reduces the edge effect, increasing strength by as much as 22 % and improving the repeatability of experimentally tested laminates. Accurate prediction of resin treated laminate strength is achieved by modelling finite-thickness interface layers between plies, and using a combination of Camanho and Christensen failure criteria...|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Douglas Aircraft Company {{proposed}} a <b>short-range,</b> four-engined jet <b>airliner</b> {{to fill the}} gap below its new DC-8 intercontinental, known internally as the Model 2067. Intended to be marketed the DC-9, it was not directly related to the later twin-engined Douglas DC-9. Pratt & Whitney (P&W) had offered its JT8A turbojet for the airliner, but Douglas preferred to go with a turbofan engine, which would have a greater fuel efficiency than a turbojet. P&W then proposed the JT10A, a half-scale version of its newly developed JT8D turbofan. Development of the new design began in April 1959, using the core of the JT8. Douglas shelved the model 2067 design in 1960, as the targeted US airlines preferred the newly offered Boeing 727.|$|R
