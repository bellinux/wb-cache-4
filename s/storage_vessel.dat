25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but {{the downside is that}} the <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, with the result that round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E
25|$|Desmoulea {{remained}} at Suda Bay for several weeks, {{down on the}} sandy bottom by the stern, with its after well deck awash; the cargo {{was transferred to the}} tanker Eocene. Along with the torpedo attack on the cargo ship Clan Cumming by the Italian submarine Neghelli on 19 January, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea. After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the Antikithera Strait. Desmoulea was finally taken in tow by the armed boarding vessel HMS Chakla and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers. Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, India and ran aground twice during the passage. Desmoulea was converted into a store ship, named Empire Thane and remained in port at Cochin until 1947, from where it was towed back to the United Kingdom. It was rebuilt under its original name in 1949, before being laid up in 1955 and scrapped in 1961.|$|E

For this purpose, <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> are explicitly modeled on which material flows are defined, and storage capacity and storage time constraints are expressed. The approach {{is shown to}} be effective in modeling the scheduling problem in a variety of storage configurations such as single/multiple dedicated and multipurpose <b>storage</b> <b>vessels.</b> In a numerical study, cases where storage capacity and storage time limitations have significant impacts on scheduling production and storage operations are highlighted.

2500|$|Once a salt {{feature is}} {{discovered}} {{and found to}} be suitable {{for the development of}} a gas storage facility a cavern is created within the salt feature. This is done by the process of solution mining. [...] Fresh water is pumped down a borehole into the salt.

Once created, a salt cavern offers an underground natural gas <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> with very high deliverability.
