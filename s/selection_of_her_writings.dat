40|$|Charlotte Perkins Gilman died in 1935, but {{she remains}} today a provocative sociological writer; she makes us think, argue, and {{question}} our preconceptions, {{especially with regard}} to marriage and family. Several posthumous volumes of Gilman’s work have been produced and it has been my pleasure to help present three of Gilman’s (1997, 2002, 2004) major sociological writings to new generations of readers in English. As noted in the preface, it has been a special honor to acquaint an audience of Italian readers with a <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> powerful <b>writings</b> on families, marriages, and children. 1 The present volume joins a small but growing collection of translations of Gilman’s works into Italian. Gilman’s classic work, Women and Economics, was early translated into Italian (1902), and is followed recently by translations of The Yellow Wallpaper (1976), Herland (1980), and a collection of tales (2008). An intriguing digital experiment is the new Italian thesaurus edition of Our Androcentric Culture, or The Man-Made World (2008). A recent book-length exposition, in Italian, on Gilman’s life and work is provided by Laura Moschini (2006). My goal for Italian readers, in selecting and editing the exemplars in the present volume, was to provide each reader with insightful and often trenchant examples of Gilman’s sociological analyses and judgments about one of our most central social institutions: the family. Now, thanks to Transactions Publishers, these lively and insightful selections are also made more readily available to English readers...|$|R

Since the publication <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Letters and Memorials, Jane Welsh Carlyle's life {{has been a source of}} spirited scholarly debate. Some critics and biographers have argued that she was unfulfilled because she was childless; still others claim that her husband, Thomas Carlyle, neglected or even abused her. These opinions tend summarily to relegate Jane to the bleak, infantilized world in which many Victorian women were indeed trapped. The scholarly record, however, shows that Jane seldom saw herself as a victim, except to frequent bouts with ill health. She also was a very talented writer who used her writing skills throughout her life as a way to demonstrate her independence. Jane's written and verbal talents were regularly acknowledged by her contemporaries. Yet, to date, no study <b>of</b> <b>her</b> belletristic offerings exists. This study, therefore, is the first to address critically her poetry, her one extant play, and her short stories, along with a <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> narrative letters. <b>Her</b> <b>writings</b> are examined against a backdrop of important literary figures who were influential at specific periods in her life. From her tutor, Edward Irving, she embarked as a young girl on a lifelong program of reading, writing, and studying. Lord Byron inspired Jane indirectly both as a prominent literary personality and a poet, imbuing in her an adolescent desire to write Romantic verses. Thomas Carlyle continued where Irving left off by urging her, not always successfully, to learn new languages, to study history, and to write and publish. Later, the feminist novelist Geraldine Jewsbury, a close friend, also nurtured Jane's latent desire to write non-epistolary prose. These four notable people, by encouraging her and reinforcing her positive self-image, helped Jane to become a prolific and significant figure in the Victorian literary world...|$|R

40|$|International audienceElizabeth Durack (1915 – 2000) was a {{prolific}} Australian artist. She {{spent much of}} her life in Western Australia. Her subject of choice was most often aboriginal life. The book, Elizabeth Durack, Art & Life, Selected Writings (2016, edited by Perpetua Durack Clancy, Brisbane: Connor Court, 276 pp., A$ 29. 95) presents a chronological <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>writings</b> in nine chapters, one decade per chapter. There are personal letters and extracts from her diaries, along with some published and unpublished essays. The style is frank, sometimes irreverent, and she rails against political correctness. In her 80 th year, Elizabeth was gripped with a manic burst of creativity. She produced a remarkable suite of works in the thrall of her new muse, Eddie Burrup. The book throws light on her relationship with Eddie Burrup and the unfolding controversy. The presenting of art works of a white woman as those of an aboriginal man caused grief for some of the local artocrats. The first 80 years of Elizabeth Durack can be regarded as a long art apprenticeship and at the culmination of which she graduated to be Eddie Burrup. In this guise and in the twilight of her life, she produced the masterworks of her career, scores of remarkable paintings. The Eddie Burrup suite of paintings are big and bold, fresh and expansive, and uniquely Australian. They reveal Australia’s ancient landscape as a playground for the spirits and totems of the land. This book reveals some of the story of Elizabeth Durack and Eddie Burrup...|$|E
