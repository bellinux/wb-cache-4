40|$|International audienceSocial insect nests {{provide a}} safe and {{favourable}} shelter to many guests and parasites. In Aphaenogaster senilis nests many guests are tolerated. Among them we studied the chemical integration of two myrmecophile beetles, Sternocoelis hispanus (Coleoptera: Histeridae) and Chitosa nigrita (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), and a silverfish. <b>Silverfishes</b> bear low quantities of the host hydrocarbons (chemical insignificance), acquired probably passively, {{and they do not}} match the colony odour. Both beetle species use chemical mimicry to be accepted; they have the same specific cuticular hydrocarbon profile as their host. They also match the ant colony odour, but they keep some specificity and can be recognised by the ants as a different element. Sternocoelis are always adopted in other conspecific colonies of A. senilis with different delays. They are adopted in the twin species A. iberica but never in A. simonellii or A. subterranea. They are readopted easily into their mother colony after an isolation of different durations until one month. After isolation they keep their hydrocarbons quantity, showing that they are able to synthesize them. Nevertheless, their profile diverges from the host colony, indicating that they adjust it in contact with the hosts. This had never been demonstrated before in myrmecophile beetles. We suggest that the chemical mimicry of Sternocoelis {{is the result of a}} coevolution with A. senilis with a possible cleaning symbiosis...|$|E

50|$|<b>Silverfish</b> are {{considered}} household pests, {{due to their}} consumption and destruction of property.

50|$|<b>Silverfish</b> consume {{matter that}} {{contains}} polysaccharides, such as starches and dextrin in adhesives. These include book bindings, carpet, clothing, coffee, dandruff, glue, hair, some paints, paper, photos, plaster, and sugar.

Other substances they may eat include cotton, dead insects, linen, silk, or even their own exuvia (moulted exoskeleton). During famine, a <b>silverfish</b> may even attack leatherware and synthetic fabrics. <b>Silverfish</b> can live {{for a year or}} more without eating if water is available.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMolecular phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have revealed}} that Hexapoda and Crustacea form a common clade (the Pancrustacea), which is now widely accepted among zoologists; however, the origin of Hexapoda remains unresolved. The main problems are the unclear relationships among the basal hexapod lineages, Protura (proturans), Collembola (springtails), Diplura (diplurans), and Ectognatha (bristletails, <b>silverfishes,</b> and all winged insects). Mitogenomic analyses have challenged hexapod monophyly and suggested the reciprocal paraphyly of Hexapoda and Crustacea, whereas studies based on nuclear molecular data support the monophyletic origin of hexapods. Additionally, there are significant discrepancies with respect to these issues between the results of morphological and molecular studies. To investigate these problems, we performed phylogenetic analyses of Pancrustacea based on the protein sequences of three orthologous nuclear genes encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta and the largest and second largest subunits of RNA polymerase II from 64 species of arthropods, including representatives of all hexapod orders. ResultsPhylogenetic analyses were conducted based on the inferred amino acid (aa) sequences (~ 3400 aa in total) of the three genes using the maximum likelihood (ML) method and Bayesian inference. Analyses were also performed with additional datasets generated by excluding long-branch taxa or by using different outgroups. These analyses all yielded essentially the same results. All hexapods were clustered into a common clade, with Branchiopoda as its sister lineage, whereas Crustacea was paraphyletic. Within Hexapoda, the lineages Ectognatha, Palaeoptera, Neoptera, Polyneoptera, and Holometabola were each confirmed to be monophyletic with robust support, but monophyly was not supported for Entognatha (Protura[*]+[*]Collembola[*]+[*]Diplura), Ellipura (Protura[*]+[*]Collembola), or Nonoculata (Protura[*]+[*]Diplura). Instead, our results showed that Protura is the sister lineage to all other hexapods and that Diplura or Diplura[*]+[*]Collembola {{is closely related to}} Ectognatha. ConclusionThis is the first study to include all hexapod orders in a phylogenetic analysis using multiple nuclear protein-coding genes to investigate the phylogeny of Hexapoda, with an emphasis on Entognatha. The results strongly support the monophyletic origin of hexapods but reject the monophyly of Entognatha, Ellipura, and Nonoculata. Our results provided the first molecular evidence in support of Protura as the sister group to other hexapods. These findings are expected to provide additional insights into the origin of hexapods and the processes involved in the adaptation of insects to life on land...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnts, {{like any}} animal, {{are subject to}} parasitism. However, as they are also superorganisms living in common nests, their parasites {{experience}} environments wholly {{different from those of}} parasites affecting solitary organisms [1]. The nests of most ant species are relatively stable microhabitats prone to provide both readily available resources and some degree of protection against predators to many organisms. Consequently, ant-parasite (or ant-myrmecophile) associations gather a great deal of diversity ranging from the casual, opportunistic, unspecialized interaction—through temporary protection or sharing of some resources or even predation—, to obligate, specific mutualism that may involve coevolution of both the host and the parasite [2 – 5]. The first issue of this series examined a wide range of species: viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, <b>silverfishes,</b> flies, butterflies, beetles, spiders, wasps, and ants themselves. However, it could not cover all possible ant parasites. More studies examining their complex interactions from every possible angle, attempting to bring a more global vision of the functioning of such an evolutionary important relationship, are a challenging and fascinating goal. In this second volume, we continued giving specific attention to both the mechanisms used by ant parasites to integrate into their host colony and the way parasite pressure could affect patterns of reproduction and life history in ant hosts. Moreover, considering the increasing pace of losses in biodiversity due to habitat destruction and climate change, we also wanted to reflect the effort towards accurate faunistic surveys of the diversity of the associations involving ants as hosts and the exact nature of these associations. This volume is divided into two main sections: (1) ant-parasite interactions and the mechanisms of integration into the host colony, in which both already known and new associations between ants and a diverse fauna including numerous beetle families, phorid and syrphid flies, diapriid, eucharitid and eurytomid wasps, myrmecophilid crickets, spiders, and bacteria are reviewed and/or discussed considering behavioral, taxonomical, phylogenetical, and even conceptual aspects; (2) social parasitism involving ant-ant interactions, in which different interspecific associations between ant species are reviewed, from the most basic forms illustrated by independent plesiobiotic associations to sophisticated, permanent ones found between slave-making ants or inquiline species and their single specialized hosts...|$|E

40|$|Two assays {{have been}} {{developed}} to measure arthropod levels in house dust. The first assay measures <b>silverfish</b> antigens. The second assay measures invertebrate tropomyosin and gives a global assessment of the level of arthropod-derived material. These assays and a Der p 1 and Der p 2 assay were used to analyse 53 dust samples. In most dust samples the ratio of tropomyosin/Der p 2 was higher than in mite body extract, indicating that the assay measures other arthropods besides mites. <b>Silverfish</b> antigen was detectable in most of the dust samples.

However, such running is possible only on horizontal surfaces, as they lack any additional appendages, and therefore are not fast enough to climb walls at the same speed. They also avoid light.|$|R
