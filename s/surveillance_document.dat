5000|$|Donati gained {{national}} attention when he charged that author Charles Higham committed literary fraud {{in his book}} about actor Errol Flynn. Higham’s Errol Flynn: The Untold Story (Doubleday 1980) claimed that Flynn had been a spy for Germany and {{was involved in the}} bombing of Pearl Harbor. Donati investigated the controversy and accused Higham of altering a government <b>surveillance</b> <b>document</b> in the paperback version to make it appear that Flynn had been identified as a Nazi spy, as reported in the Los Angeles Times. [...] Donati co-authored My Days With Errol Flynn (Roundtable 1988), the autobiography of stuntman Buster Wiles, Flynn’s close friend, and his research on Higham’s claims appears in a section of the book. Donati and Wiles were guests on Geraldo in a segment about Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, and Richard Burton.|$|E

Herein is reported the health <b>surveillance</b> <b>document</b> agreed upon during the Consensus Conference held in Rome at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità last year. The {{aim of the}} consensus conference was to define guidelines for epidemiologic and health {{surveillance of}} the resident population {{in the area of}} the Basilicata region exposed to tremolite pollution (Local Health Unit 3 territory Lagonegro, PZ). The health surveillance program for residents and the nested epidemiologic study evaluates for each resident willing to participate, individual exposure with a personal dosimeter, as well as the prevalence of obstructive, restrictive or mixed pulmonary functional patterns, searching for fiber and asbestos bodies in induced-sputum, the prevalence of non malignant asbestos disturbances related to pleural anomalies and, last but not least, provides information on risks and sensitization, advising on personal behaviour that could reduce the risks...|$|E

40|$|Asthma is {{a serious}} chronic disease that causes {{inflammation}} and narrowing of the airways. Due to the prevalence rates among children, asthma is a priority public health concern {{in the state of}} Georgia. The Georgia Asthma Control Program (GACP) seeks to improve asthma control by maximizing comprehensive asthma services. Surveillance is one of the ways this is done. This evaluation sought to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of asthma surveillance product packaging and dissemination efforts. The findings will be used to gain recommendations on how to improve surveillance products, reports, and the efforts that are made to disseminate the information. Four stakeholders were involved in the evaluation planning process to insure stakeholders’ needs would be met through the evaluation. Twelve stakeholders participated in evaluation interviews and focus groups in order to assess the effectiveness of current asthma surveillance products and dissemination. Interviews and focus group discussions were audio recorded to insure accuracy. A document review on current <b>surveillance</b> <b>documents</b> and the OASIS service were also performed. Stakeholders expressed their satisfaction with GACP surveillance products and dissemination efforts, and most also agreed that the data was easily accessible. Additionally, respondents indicated that there were few gaps in the data that is presently available, however others suggested additional measures and analysis that should be reported. Future recommendations include, making more efforts to get data and surveillance products to parents and community leaders, producing multiple <b>surveillance</b> <b>documents</b> for different audiences, updating surveillance data in a reasonable timeframe, and training all school staff to handle asthma events in children...|$|R

He has long lurked on the fringes of South African historiography, never playing more than a bit part in studies of early apartheid-era journalism, literature and intellectual culture. Indeed, the specifics of his life have been overshadowed in both popular memory and academic study by the potent symbolism of his death, frequently evoked as a marker of the destruction wrought on black intellectuals by National Party rule. Nakasa committed suicide in exile in the United States at the age of only 28.

40|$|Introduction. The {{goal is to}} {{investigate}} epidemiological characteristics of outbreaks of health-care-associated infections in health care institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and ambulatory care settings. Material and methods. Relevant data associated with outbreaks in health-care settings in the period from 1980 to 2004 were retrospectively collected from epidemiological annual reports of infectious diseases in Vojvodina. Descriptive statistics were applied to the data. Results. The mean number of outbreaks is 7 per year (ranging from 0 to 13 outbreaks) involving 22 cases per outbreak (ranging from 2 to 74 cases). The most frequently involved settings (51 %) were nursing homes and most (31 %) of the patients were more than 60 years old. This <b>surveillance</b> <b>documented</b> that wards for children less than 12 months of age were the most frequently (57. 5 %) associated with nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals. The leading diseases were gastrointestinal tract infections with case fatality rale of 1. 8 %, that is 10 - 100 fold higher than rales in general population. The leading transmission route in 70 % of outbreaks was contact, demonstrating the association between infections and poor general and hand-hygiene policies. Conclusion. The proportion of nosocomial outbreaks in total number of out­breaks is 9 %. The most frequent are gastrointestinal outbreaks transmited in long-term-care facilities by contact route, involving elderly patients. Introducing proper environmental and hand hygiene policies in health-care settings with strict imple­mentation of procedures may significantly decrease the number of nosocomial infections and prevent nosocomial outbreaks. ...|$|R
40|$|In-person {{structured}} {{observation is}} considered the best approach for measuring hand hygiene behavior, yet is expensive, time consuming, and may alter behavior. Video surveillance could be {{a useful tool for}} objectively monitoring hand hygiene behavior if validated against current methods. Student hand cleaning behavior was monitored with video surveillance and in-person structured observation, both simultaneously and separately, at four primary schools in urban Kenya over a study period of 8 weeks. Video surveillance and in-person observation captured similar rates of hand cleaning (absolute difference < 5 %, p = 0. 74). Video <b>surveillance</b> <b>documented</b> higher hand cleaning rates (71 %) when at least one other person was present at the hand cleaning station, compared to when a student was alone (48 %; rate ratio  = 1. 14 [95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 28]). Students increased hand cleaning rates during simultaneous video and in-person monitoring as compared to single-method monitoring, suggesting reactivity to each method of monitoring. This trend was documented at schools receiving a handwashing with soap intervention, but not at schools receiving a sanitizer intervention. Video surveillance of hand hygiene behavior yields results comparable to in-person observation among schools in a resource-constrained setting. Video surveillance also has certain advantages over in-person observation, including rapid data processing and the capability to capture new behavioral insights. Peer influence can significantly improve student hand cleaning behavior and, when possible, should be exploited in the design and implementation of school hand hygiene programs...|$|R
