40|$|While {{there is}} a large body of {{research}} on cervical cancer screening, fewer studies address the experiences of women receiving abnormal Pap smear results after routine screening. Those studies highlighting such experiences tend to concentrate on resulting psychosocial distress, with an absence in the literature about women's experiences of their bodies during <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> for dysplasia, and no studies were found that explore such experiences over time. In this article, we focus on bodily experiences over time during <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> of an abnormal Pap smear among a group of women in Sweden. This qualitative analysis is based on interview data from a total of 30 women, and with in-depth analysis of the content of 34 transcribed interviews with nine women who were followed longitudinally. We found that <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> involved an experience of both "having" and "being" a body, which changed over time. Women described a process that ranged from having a cervix that was neither felt, 'heard', nor seen, to having a body that became known to them first indirectly through professional mediation and later through direct experience after professional manipulation. The conceptualization of bodily boundaries appeared to change, e. g. through visualization of the previously unfamiliar cervix, pain, vaginal discharge, and bleeding, as well as linkages to the bodies of women in their extended families through the generations. Thus, bodily experiences appear to be an intrinsic part of <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> of an abnormal Pap smear through which health, disease, and risks in the past, present, and future were reconceptualised.

40|$|Context: Upper {{gastrointestinal}} {{cancer is}} associated with a poor prognosis. The multidimensional problems of incurable patients require close monitoring and frequent support, which cannot sufficiently be provided during conventional one to two month follow-up visits to the outpatient clinic. Objectives: To compare nurse-led follow-up at home with conventional <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> in the outpatient clinic for patients with incurable primary or recurrent esophageal, pancreatic, or hepatobiliary cancer. Methods: Patients were randomized to nurse-led follow-up at home or conventional <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> in the outpatient clinic. Outcome parameters were quality of life (QoL), patient satisfaction, and health care consumption, measured by different questionnaires at one and a half and four months after randomization. As well, cost analyses were done for both follow-up strategies in the first four months. Results: In total, 138 patients were randomized, of which 66 (48 %) were evaluable. At baseline, both groups were similar with respect to clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and health-related QoL. Patients in the nurse-led follow-up group were significantly more satisfied with the visits, whereas QoL and health care consumption within the first four months were comparable between the two groups. Nurse-led follow-up was less expensive than conventional <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up.</b> However, the total costs for the first four months of follow-up in this study were higher in the nurse-led follow-up group because of a higher frequency of visits. Conclusion: The results suggest that conventional <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> is interchangeable with nurse-led follow-up. A cost utility study is necessary to determine the preferred frequency and duration of the home visits...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of strategies for management of primary asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism: surgical strategies and <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> versus surgery. Design: We used a Markov state-transition decision-analytic model for an hypothetical cohort of 55 -year-old women {{to compare with}} a lifetime horizon costs and effectiveness of bilateral neck explora-tion (BNE), unilateral neck exploration (UNE), video-assisted parathyroidectomy (VAP) and lifelong <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> shifting for either BNE or UNE in case of disease progression. Methods: Data on localization tests, complications and treatment efficacies were derived from a sys-tematic review of the literature. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Costs (e 2002) discounted at 3 % yearly were estimated from {{the health care system}} perspective. Results: In the base-case analysis, VAP strategy (VAPS) was the most effective and BNE strategy (BNES) was the least costly. UNE strategy (UNES) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of e 2688 /QALY versus BNES and VAPS of e 17 250 /QALY in comparison with UNES. Surgical manage-ment was more effective than <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> with acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. VAPS became less effective than UNES over 71 years.

40|$|Percutaneous {{coronary}} angioplasty (PTCA) of a coronary stenosis without documented ischemia at noninvasive stress testing is often performed, but its benefit is unproven. Coronary pressure– derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an invasive index of stenosis severity {{defined as the}} ratio of maximal blood pressure in a stenotic vessel to the normal maximal pressure in the same vessel. FFR is a reliable substitute for noninvasive stress testing and values below 75 % identifies stenoses with hemodynamic significance. It is a method that can provide a reliable assessment of coronary stenosis especially in those with intermediate lesions. It can highly impact on decision-making in therapeutic planning and prevent many unnecessary procedures that are routinely done in these cases. In the present study, we report the results of FFR measurements {{in a series of}} patients, {{and this is the first}} report on the FFR measurement in Iran. The FFR measurement was performed for eleven vessels with intermediate stenosis, and in seven lesions (63. 6 %) it led to changes in the treatment strategy. On the basis of FFR, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was changed into <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> in five lesions, <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> changed to PCI in one lesion, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) changed to <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> in another...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} first version of an eHealth system for sports physicians who support employees in improving their health and fitness. Regular physical activity improves {{quality of life and}} has various health benefits. Companies have an interest in the health and fitness of their employees. For employers it is important to encourage this in a safe way. To this end, the sports physicians of Isala Hospital in Zwolle, The Netherlands, offer <b>sports</b> <b>medical</b> examination and guidance programs to companies. The sports physicians wanted to use smartphone technology to improve and expand their services. It was important for them to have all the client data stored confidentially in one database under their own supervision, e. g., to perform scientific analyses. Since not all details of the end product were clear {{at the start of the}} project, an incremental and iterative development method was used. In this way, a prototype online and mobile data tracking system is developed that makes it possible (among others) to: give employees access to their <b>sports</b> <b>medical</b> examinations results with personalized standard values; insert goals that are advised by the sport physicians; use a heart rate sensor and a smartphone application (app) for training data entry by the employees themselves; import data from other sports apps; compute individual ‘s heart rate zones and energy use of a training based on <b>sports</b> <b>medical</b> test results. A focus group session with sports physicians have been performed to evaluate the prototype and to discuss extensions. Important enhancements include periodical entry of health data and comparing sports activities with the Dutch Standard for Healthy Exercise and the Fit Standard. We present the approach we have chosen and the functionalities of the first prototype of the system, which typically make it an application that supports <b>sports</b> <b>medical</b> services...|$|R

40|$|In the U.

Others, like osteoporosis, depression and anxiety are associated with aging, genetics, or environmental influences. Chronic health problems are a public health challenge in the U. S., fueled by ready access to an abundant food supply and an environment that offers few opportunities for daily physical activity. Chronic health problems are an even bigger challenge for childhood cancer survivors, whose medical and psychosocial late effects not only contribute to disease, but also prevent them from participation in life activities that may modify their risk for future disease. As the prevalence of childhood cancer survivors continues to increase, the need for long term <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> and interventions to address or prevent late effects and to remediate activity limitations becomes more important. Individualized <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> for long-term survivors of childhood cancer is encouraged by at least three pediatric professional medical organizations...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{breast and}} ovarian cancers are mainly {{attributable}} to predisposition genes whose germinal mutations {{are responsible for}} the disease. The most common genes associated with breast/ovarian cancer are BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 but at least 20 other genes of medium of high penetrance have been associated with these types of cancer. Lifetime risk of breast cancer for BRCA mutations carriers approaches 90 %. Appropriate <b>medical</b> <b>follow-up</b> is therefore essential for women carrying mutations in these genes.
