50|$|There are six- and five-light {{high-speed}} signals (kōsoku shingōki) {{with two}} green lights. In a six-light signal, the additional green light is located above the yellow light; in a five-light signal, the additional green light replaces the top yellow light (eliminating the <b>speed-restriction</b> <b>signal).</b> The high-speed signal was introduced on the Hokuetsu Express Hokuhoku Line—where limited express trains travel at 160 kph mph—in 1997; and also introduced on Keisei Narita Airport Line in 2010. Two green lights indicate high-speed (no speed limit), and one green light (proceed signal) indicates a 130 kph mph speed limit. High-speed are displayed only for limited express Hakutaka trains using 681 series and 683 series EMUs.|$|E
