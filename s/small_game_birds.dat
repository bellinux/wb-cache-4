5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired falconry bird, and {{has been used in}} falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E

5000|$|The word perlin is a falconer's {{term for}} a cross breed of a {{peregrine}} falcon and a merlin. It is much bigger and faster than a merlin, but is {{not as big as}} a peregrine so the quarry it takes varies from larger songbirds to <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> such as hen pheasant.

5000|$|The {{smaller and}} more agile males are {{particularly}} effective in the taking of <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks, while the larger and more powerful females reliably take larger game up through the size of large ducks and even pheasants. [...] Some prairie falcons will strike still larger game such as geese and greater sage-grouse, but their willingness to do so {{runs the risk of}} injury to the falcon. The sage-grouse in particular is difficult game, with the males weighing as much as 8 lbs, and being so hard-muscled that inexperienced falcons can easily be injured in striking them in a high-speed stoop. It takes a skilled falcon that knows how to forcefully but carefully and accurately strike them in the head or wing to bring them down cleanly. For this difficult prey experienced falconers usually prefer larger peregrine females, gyrfalcons, or gyr-peregrine hybrids, though some female prairie falcons do master the art of bringing down larger game.|$|E

5000|$|In medieval Europe, merlins {{were popular}} in falconry: the Book of St. Albans listed it as [...] "the falcon for a lady", {{where it was}} noted for classic [...] "ringing" [...] (circling rapidly upward) pursuits of the English skylark. [...] Though the merlin is only {{slightly}} larger than the American kestrel in dimensions, it averages about one third to one half larger by weight, with this weight mostly being extra muscle that gives it greater speed and endurance than the kestrel. Like the American kestrel, the merlin offers the modern falconer the ability to hunt year round against sparrows and starlings, in urban settings not requiring large tracts of land or hunting dogs, with the additional advantage {{of being able to}} reliably take <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> such as dove and quail during hunting season. A large and exceptionally aggressive female merlin may take prey as large as pigeons and occasionally even small ducks. They also offer an exciting style of flight, generally at closer range than large falcons where it may be more clearly witnessed and enjoyed by the falconer. In addition to horizontal tail-chases in the manner of American kestrels, they will also [...] "ring up" [...] in pursuit of prey that seeks to escape by out-climbing them, and perform high speed diving stoops on prey beneath them in the manner of larger falcons. Quoting from one popular falconry book on the eagerness of merlins to chase a swung lure, [...] "Every stoop, outrun, dodge, and aerial maneuver of a hard flight to real quarry can be duplicated with no risk of loss of the falcon. Merlins regularly flown to the lure take most field quarries with such ease and such assurance as to make the field flight the less interesting and exciting of the two." ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, consumption of wild game birds has been increasing, concurrent with a rise in consumer interest in free-range and 'healthy-eating' foodstuffs. Game birds can carry zoonotic pathogens, predominantly within the viscera. Whilst removal of the viscera is normal practice during the dressing of game birds, there is a specialised market in the UK for certain <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> that are consumed uneviscerated. This qualitative risk assessment evaluates the risks to the consumer from the production and consumption of both uneviscerated and eviscerated <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> for Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli (verotoxigenic), E. coli (antimicrobial resistant), Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Chlamydophila psittaci and Listeria monocytogenes. Whilst most pathogen/bird combinations were considered to have a very low risk, results suggest that Campylobacter spp. and T. gondii can pose an increased risk to consumers for some species of wild game birds. There was no greater risk associated with the consumption of uneviscerated game birds than for eviscerated birds. In some cases, the risk from eviscerated birds may even be slightly higher, as the risk of cross-contamination during evisceration can outweigh the reduction in pathogenic organisms due to removal of the viscera. Additionally, the current low frequency of consumption of uneviscerated game birds of most species reduced the overall risk estimate for these birds. If there is an increased frequency of consumption in the future, then this risk should be re-examined. Assuming a general level of compliance with regulations and basic hygiene practices, the results suggested that large outbreaks of infection among UK consumers are unlikely, but sporadic, infectious events could occur due to combinations of 'rare-event, hygiene-related issues' in the 'field-to-fork' chain and/or inadequate cooking of the bird...|$|E
40|$|Northern {{bobwhite quail}} (Colinus virginianus) are a non-migratory, <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>bird</b> found {{throughout}} Indiana {{and the eastern}} United States. Once very common throughout the agricultural landscape, recent population indices of this native species continue to be at or near historical lows in Indiana (Figure 1). Loss of habitat is most likely responsible for the declines in bobwhite quail over the past half century. A shift in agricultural practices during this time is the primary cause. When quail populations in Indiana and the Midwest were much higher in the 1950 s, farming practices were different than today. Farms were generally divided into smaller parcels, field sizes were smaller and divided by fencerows, and production was more evenly distributed among row crops, small grains, and pastures. Today, "clean farming" dominates the agricultural landscape (Figure 2) ...|$|R

40|$|The Pleistocene–Holocene {{transition}} c. 11. 5 ka cal. BP {{is associated}} with dramatic climatic changes. These events led to fundamental shifts in landscape and have, therefore, been seen as responsible for {{a major impact on}} the human ecological behavior of the last hunter–gatherers in the Western European territory. In the case of Iberian Peninsula, it is commonly assumed that these human ecological adaptations are reflected in the new settlement and subsistence patterns that characterized the Late Upper Paleolithic–Mesolithic transition. Following the argument, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} present the state-of-the-art and consider this theoretical model using zooarchaeological data of small terrestrial vertebrates and fish from SW Portugal. Archaeological data are reviewed and discussed in order to analyze the change in the exploitation of <b>small</b> <b>game,</b> <b>birds,</b> and aquatic resources during this period. In this paper, we reinforce the idea that in SW Iberia, subsistence intensification and diversification precede the transition itself and are more likely to be related to other long-term phenomena, cultural and/or demographical, than to the changes in settlement behavior. The state-of-theart discussed here led to new research questions related to the role of small vertebrates on the changes in human subsistence behavior during the Pleistocene–Holocene from Western Iberia. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Introduction of {{wildlife}} for game restocking is one major pathway of genetic homogenization. The redlegged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae), a <b>small</b> <b>game</b> <b>bird</b> native to south-western Europe, is {{in high demand}} by hunters and natural populations are constantly supplemented by commercial stocks of captive- bred individuals. Also, in recent years human-mediated hybridization with congeneric chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar: Greece, Cyprus, from Middle East to East Asia) has been frequently documented in the wild and in captivity. This study attempts to evaluate the genetic consequences of intensive captive breeding and restocking in the A. rufa species. We investigated A. rufa genetic diversity by making comparisons in both a spatial (across the entire species’ range) and a temporal framework. We accomplished this latter by comparing modern vs. ancient partridges resident in museums and collected 1856 – 1934, well before supplemental stocking became common. Using mtDNA we found {{significant changes in the}} haplotype profile of modern vs. ancient A. rufa, and widespread introgression with chukar genes across the entire species range only in modern representatives, with the relevant exception of Corsican populations. However, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), as opposed to microsatellite DNA markers, showed also modern Corsican populations to harbour many A. rufa A. chukar hybrids. We conclude that captive breeding programs should make strict use of time-saving and comparatively low cost DNA barcodes to minimize genetic pollution, such as those provided by diagnostic RAPD markers. We also recommend that the active ban on import of exotics and/or hybrids be extended to non-local populations. Altogether this would represent a substantial step forward to preserve A. rufa as well as other game species subjected to similar intensive management...|$|R
