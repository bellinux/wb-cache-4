5|$|While health {{insurance}} premium costs have moderated, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because of insurance {{policies that have}} a higher deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients. In addition, many employees are choosing to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making {{the impact of the}} ACA difficult to determine precisely.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{coastline}} suffers {{the highest}} rate of coastal erosion in Europe: 2 metres a year on average or 2million tonnes of material a year. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> transported by longshore drift with about 3% of material being deposited at Spurn Head spit, to the south. The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing concern in the area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been carrying out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951. The Holderness area drains mostly into the Humber and the eponymous River Hull drains the area north of Hull.|$|E

50|$|A {{closer look}} at the club's history reveals a more nomadic nature. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> planned as the club took over the Caledonia Reds district; or a liberal {{spreading}} of the Warriors brand to various grounds for friendlies and smaller ties; and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> caused by inclement weather. The laying of a synthetic pitch at Scotstoun Stadium for the 2016-17 season it is hoped should forestall those weather-related issues.|$|R

25|$|Some {{countries}} {{regard it}} as desecration to make toilet paper, napkins, doormats, and other such items bearing {{the image of the}} flag, so that the flag's image will be destroyed or soiled. It is, however, increasingly common in some countries to see clothing with the image of the flag forming a substantial part of the piece. Views vary as to whether <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an act of national pride or disrespect.|$|E
25|$|Esperanto {{has some}} slang {{in the sense}} of in-group talk as well. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> borrowed; for example, fajfi priio (to whistle about something) means not to care about it, as in German. Other {{expressions}} deriving from Esperanto history or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A volapukaĵo, for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years and was replaced by it.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{importance}} of the Cathedral Church of the Holy Cross comes from the extensive array of bas-relief carving of mostly biblical scenes that adorn its external walls. The meanings of these reliefs {{have been the subject}} of much and varied interpretation. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> speculation - for example, a few sources interpret Islamic and Turkic influences behind the artistic rendering of the reliefs, syncretised with Armenian influences. Some scholars assert that the friezes parallel contemporary motifs found in Umayyad art - such as a turbaned prince, Arab styles of dress, wine imagery; allusions to royal Sassanian imagery are also present (Griffins, for example).|$|E
50|$|Human {{population}} here {{reverted to}} medieval levels after 1806 when common land was enclosed to make Arundel Park, depriving unlanded villagers <b>of</b> sheep-grazing land. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> returned to woodland {{after a few}} centuries of being used as pasture.|$|R

50|$|A {{large part}} of the city's supply was {{obtained}} through the free market. Prices in the city were invariably high, and merchants could count on making a profit.

25|$|Whereas {{during the}} nineteenth {{and most of the}} twentieth century, new plesiosaurs were {{described}} at a rate of three or four genera each decade, the pace suddenly picked up in the 1990s, with seventeen plesiosaurs being discovered in this period. The tempo of discovery accelerated in the early twenty-first century, with about three or four plesiosaurs being named each year. This implies that about half of the known plesiosaurs are relatively new to science, a result of a far more intense field research. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> taking place away from the traditional areas, e.g. in new sites developed in New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, Japan, China and Morocco, but the locations of the more original discoveries have proven to be still productive, with important new finds in England and Germany. Some of the new genera are a renaming of already known species, which were deemed sufficiently different to warrant a separate genus name.|$|E
500|$|Everyone has {{a natural}} set point {{for their ability}} to {{experience}} stress. For some people, this is a very high threshold, whereas other people can become overwhelmed very quickly. [...] Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain, so this can be a significantly intolerable state for some people. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> environmental and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to physiological differences in responding. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two components: the sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation (e.g., the fight-or-flight response) and the parasympathetic nervous system controls physical processes that are automatic (e.g., saliva production). The sympathetic nervous system innervates (e.g., is physically connected to and regulates) many parts of the body involved in stress responses. Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self-injure have greater physiological reactivity (e.g., skin conductance) to stress than adolescents who do not self-injure. This stress response persists over time, staying constant or even increasing in self-injuring adolescents, but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self-injure.|$|E
500|$|If an {{unstable}} spinal column injury is moved, damage may occur to the spinal cord. Between 3 and 25% of SCIs occur {{not at the}} time of the initial trauma but later during treatment or transport. [...] While <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to the nature of the injury itself, particularly in the case of multiple or massive trauma, some of it reflects the failure to immobilize the spine adequately.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Model T (colloquially {{known as}} the Tin Lizzie, Leaping Lena, or flivver) is an {{automobile}} produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927. It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> because <b>of</b> Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} amount of zirconium is formed by the fission process; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> short-lived radioactives (95Zr and 97Zr which decay to molybdenum), while almost 10% of the fission products mixture after years of decay consists of five stable or nearly stable isotopes of zirconium plus 93Zr with a halflife of 1.53 million years {{which is one of}} the 7 major long-lived fission products.|$|R

500|$|According to Wallenstein, {{historians and}} other writers [...] "have had great {{difficulty}} {{coming to grips}} with Mason in his historical context, and they have jumbled the story in related ways, misleading each other and following each other's errors". <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to conflation of Mason's views on slavery with that of his desire to ban the African slave trade, which he unquestionably opposed and fought against. His record otherwise is mixed: Virginia banned the importation of slaves from abroad in 1778, while Mason was in the House of Delegates. In 1782, after he had returned to Gunston Hall, it enacted legislation that allowed manumission of adult slaves young enough to support themselves (not older than 45), but a proposal, supported by Mason, to require freed slaves to leave Virginia within a year or be sold at auction, was defeated. Broadwater asserted, [...] "Mason must have shared the fears of Jefferson and countless other whites that whites and free blacks could not live together".|$|E
500|$|During {{the medieval}} period, Britons {{regarded}} Constantine as a king {{of their own}} people, particularly associating him with Caernarfon in Gwynedd. While <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> owed to his fame and his proclamation as Emperor in Britain, there was also confusion of his family with Magnus Maximus's supposed wife Saint Elen and her son, another Constantine [...] In the 12th century Henry of Huntingdon included a passage in his Historia Anglorum that the emperor Constantine's mother was a Briton, making her the daughter of King Cole of Colchester. Geoffrey of Monmouth expanded this story in his highly fictionalized Historia Regum Britanniae, {{an account of the}} supposed Kings of Britain from their Trojan origins to the Anglo-Saxon invasion. According to Geoffrey, Cole was King of the Britons when Constantius, here a senator, came to Britain. Afraid of the Romans, Cole submitted to Roman law so long as he retained his kingship. However, he died only a month later, and Constantius took the throne himself, marrying Cole's daughter Helena. They had their son Constantine, who succeeded his father as King of Britain before becoming Roman Emperor.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOLTV complimented Jones in [...] "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] for [...] "shining in this storyline" [...] as Coach Beiste: [...] "Her {{scene as}} Santa, {{and then her}} knowing {{expression}} as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] The Atlantic Patrick Burns agreed: Jones's [...] "performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of}} the absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] A similar sentiment was expressed by VanDerWerff in his review of the following episode, [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle": [...] "I also like Coach Beiste because she’s one of the few characters who seems to grasp how insane <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is.</b> I always like when a show that frequently goes over the top introduces someone who’s able to undercut some of that ridiculousness." ...|$|E
50|$|From the 1870s {{the number}} of coopers in the Powder Mills declined. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to the decline of {{production}} in the Ballincollig mills, but some {{was due to the}} use of metal canisters to hold powder as the mills changed their production to sporting powders. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the decline was also due to the importation of barrels from Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, as machine cut staves were cheaper than those produced by the Ballincollig coopers.|$|R

50|$|After abdicating {{his social}} {{responsibilities}} Sir Vauncey concentrated on building up his enormous collection of stuffed birds, bird's eggs and Lepidoptera.

By the time of Sir Vauncey's death, the taxidermy collection numbered several thousand cases. Although <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> subsequently sold to meet heavy death duties, much remained at Calke, only coming to light sixty years later.|$|R
2500|$|Harman has {{received}} general acceptance of his translation as being technically accurate and true {{to the original}} German. [...] He has, though, received criticism for, at times not creating the prosaic form of Kafka.

2500|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} problem. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to overuse of antibiotics in humans, {{but some of it}} is probably due to the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds. A study published in the journal Science in August 2007 found the rate of adaptative mutations in E. coli is [...] "on the order of 10−5 per genome per generation, which is 1,000 times as high as previous estimates," [...] a finding which may have significance for the study and management of bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E

The decision to convert this famous lecture hall and performance venue from a proscenium stage to theater-in-the-round was, according to Misha Berson, [...] "the most controversial aspect of the renovation". The proscenium stage from which Martin Luther King, Jr. once spoke, and on which the Grateful Dead performed, [...] "is now just a painted relic in the background." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{large part}} of the {{original}} [...] "Cotton Belt". This was considered to extend from eastern North Carolina to South Carolina and through the Gulf States as far west as East Texas, and including those parts of western Tennessee and eastern Arkansas in the Mississippi embayment. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> coterminous with the Black Belt, originally referring to upland areas of Alabama and Mississippi with fertile soil, which were developed for cotton under slave labor.

2500|$|RTÉ {{decided that}} the channel needed another revamp to keep it fresh. The channel's name reverted to RTÉ Two {{on the morning of}} 2 October 2004, with a themed evening of {{programmes}} called [...] "Farewell Network 2" [...] beginning at 20:00, featuring Podge and Rodge (see The Den). The new logo is similar in style to the current RTÉ One logo. The new branding is designed to promote the Irishness of the station, green is the dominant colour. New strands were developed. In particular, the number of Irish made programmes has increased, though <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> made up of a new strand of early evening repeats. The idents from this time were based on a Green Room theme.|$|E

25|$|ODBC 1.0 was {{released}} in September 1992. At the time, there was little direct support for SQL databases (versus ISAM), and early drivers were noted for poor performance. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> unavoidable due to the path that the calls took through the Jet-based stack; ODBC calls to SQL databases were first converted from Simba Technologies's SQL dialect to Jet's internal C-based format, then passed to a driver for conversion back into SQL calls for the database. Digital Equipment and Oracle both contracted Simba Technologies to develop drivers for their databases as well.|$|R
