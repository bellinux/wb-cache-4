25|$|Knife blades can be {{manufactured}} {{from a variety}} of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminate blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Pattern-welding is similar to laminate construction. Layers of different <b>steel</b> <b>types</b> are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.|$|E

Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> AISI 316 L undergoes dynamic recrystallisation, with a peak efficiency of 35 % at 1250 -degrees-C and 0. 05 s- 1, which are the optimum parameters for hot working this material.

The increase in the dynamic recrystallisation and dynamic recovery temperatures in comparison with stainless <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> AISI 304 L is attributed to the presence of a backstress caused by the molybdenum additions. These results are in general agreement with those reported elsewhere on stainless <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> 316 deformed in hot extrusion and hot torsion. At temperatures 10 s- 1, the material exhibits flow localisation owing to adiabatic shear band formation, whereas at higher temperatures (> 850 -degrees-C) and strain rates (> 10 s- 1) mechanical twinning and wavy slip bands are observed.

The {{purpose of the present}} study is to provide the basic microstructure and deformation data for austenitic and ferritic stainless steel under mushy state. As well known, the stainless steels solidify in different modes according to the different chemical compositions. In this paper, microstructural evolution of austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> 304 which solidifies in FA mode (γγδγδδ →+→++→+ → LLL),austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> 310 S which solidifies in A mode (γγ →+ → LL), and ferritic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> 430 which solidifies in F mode (δδ →+ → LL) are investigated during partial remelting by way of SIMA (Strain Induced Melted Activation).

Specimens were cast into sand mould, machined and heat treated. A specimen and forty three ceramic balls in a pot were rotated at the speed of 1. 67 rev. per sec. for 3. 6 × 10 ^ 2 ks in dry wear test. In wet wear test, a specimen, 43 ceramic balls and sea water in a pot were done in same rotating condition as that of dry wear condition. Weight loss of specimens was measured and evaluated as wear loss. In dry wear condition, wear loss of high speed <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> alloys containing high carbon was smaller than that of high chromium cast irons. Wear loss of high speed <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> alloys with high carbon was larger than that of high chromium cast iron in wet wear condition. It was because high chromium cast iron had more excellent corrosion resistance than that of high speed <b>steel</b> <b>type</b> alloys containing high carbon.

Structure of active solder type Sn 3 Ti is composed of a tin matrix in which the Ti 6 Sn 5 phase is uniformly precipitated and the Ti 3 Sn phase is non-uniformly distributed. Wettability of Sn 3 Ti solder was determined in 10 - 4 Pa vacuum, at temperatures 860, 900 and 950 °C. Wetting angle of Sn 3 Ti solder on graphite is reduced with increasing soldering temperature and also with prolonged dwell time at soldering temperature. Temperature exerts greater effect on reduction of wetting angle. The lowest wetting angle on graphite 23 ° was observed at temperature 950 °C/ 20 min.
