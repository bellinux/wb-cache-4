40|$|<b>Stereotypes</b> are {{descriptive}} "pictures in our heads" (Lippman, 1922) about {{members of}} other social groups, such as people of a different ethnic or national origin. Individuals can draw on <b>stereotypes</b> in a controlled, conscious manner (explicit <b>stereotypes),</b> {{but they are not}} always aware of their automatic activation (implicit <b>stereotypes)</b> and subsequent influence on perception. This automatic activation is also critical for the cognitive efficiency function and the prejudice justification function of <b>stereotypes.</b> In the international business domain, <b>stereotypes</b> about {{members of other}} cultures are relevant, but research on such <b>stereotypes</b> is comparatively sparse...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} found that perspective-taking reduces <b>stereotyping</b> and prejudice, but they have only {{involved}} negative <b>stereotypes.</b> Because target negativity has been empirically confounded with reduced <b>stereotyping,</b> the general effects of perspective-taking on <b>stereotyping</b> and prejudice are unclear. By including both positively and negatively <b>stereotyped</b> targets, this research offers the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses: The positivity hypothesis predicts that perspective-taking produces a positivity bias, with less <b>stereotyping</b> of negative targets but more <b>stereotyping</b> of positive targets. In contrast, the stereotype-reduction hypothesis predicts that perspective-taking reduces <b>stereotyping,</b> regardless of target valence. Three studies support the stereotype-reduction hypothesis. Perspective-taking also produced less positive attitudes toward positive targets, with reduced <b>stereotyping</b> mediating this effect. A final study demonstrated that perspective-taking reduced all <b>stereotyping</b> because it increased self–other overlap. These findings help answer fundamental questions about perspective-taking’s effects and processes, and provide evidence that perspective-taking does not improve attitudes invariantly...|$|R

Gender differences in math performance {{may be influenced}} by <b>stereotypes</b> held by adolescent girls and <b>stereotypes</b> passed down by their parents. Mothers' and daughters' gender and math <b>stereotypes</b> {{have been shown to be}} correlated in previous research. Past research has also found gender differences in actual math performance. This study looked at the correlation between mothers' gender <b>stereotypes</b> and their daughters' math <b>stereotypes</b> as well as with their daughters' math performance. The possible mediating role(s) of subjective task value and competence beliefs were also investigated. The participants in this study were adolescent girls and their mothers (N = 100). Gender <b>stereotypes</b> of mothers, <b>stereotypes</b> of daughters, daughters' competence beliefs, subjective task value, and actual math scores were collected via a take home survey given to the girls at school after parental permission was obtained. Correlations were found between mothers' and daughters' gender <b>stereotypes</b> as well as between daughters' gender <b>stereotypes</b> and their math scores. The mediation hypotheses were not supported. Gender <b>stereotypes</b> were found to be correlated with several demographic variables and daughters' math performance was negatively correlated with the mothers being married.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} research was to explore the causes of gender <b>stereotyping</b> in the workplace. The study sought to gain insights on <b>stereotyping,</b> particularly factors that cause the development of <b>stereotypes</b> and {{the role played by}} organisations in promoting <b>stereotyping.</b> In this qualitative study, thirteen purposefully selected participants were interviewed through in-depth face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Data was analysed using content, narrative and frequency analysis methods. Understanding of <b>stereotyping</b> and gender <b>stereotyping</b> was tested and confirmed amongst participants. Similarities in defining <b>stereotyping</b> and gender <b>stereotyping</b> were found, which implied an automatic association of <b>stereotypes</b> to gender. The study found evidence of the existence of <b>stereotypes</b> in the workplace; however <b>stereotypes</b> are formed in childhood, particularly in the school and home environments. Finally, the study found that the workplace plays a role in the formation of gender <b>stereotypes</b> through comments made by its employees, employee behaviours such as awarding special privileges to female employees, and through work social settings such as sports events, particularly where alcohol is served.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{represents}} a “developing ” perspective on <b>stereotyping</b> and <b>stereotypes.</b> The paper briefly introduces a less popular and potentially new theory or perspective on <b>stereotyping,</b> a process or social phenomenon {{often seen as}} a highly undesirable and negative in modern society. The author cites cultural dimension theory, socialization, social learning, cultural syncretism, and other sociological and behavioral processes and theories as having both elements and bases for <b>stereotyping</b> and <b>stereotypes.</b> The author agues that these processes {{by their very nature}} make <b>stereotyping</b> natural, if not a legitimate rationale approach to human relationships, interaction, and communication in the process of knowing each other as well as self more fully. This perspective does not underscore the negative aspects and consequences of <b>stereotyping</b> and <b>stereotypes</b> as we have come to know them in our modern society and everyday living. The author also proposes a Social Competitive Theory of <b>Stereotypes</b> to further explain the “usefulness ” from a Darwinian and materially oriented Malthusian perspective- resources competition makes <b>stereotyping</b> a necessity. The author recommends further consideration on the views presented in this paper, and if possible, further research into the positive perspective or view of <b>stereotyping</b> and <b>stereotypes</b> as serving an important social function...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{validity}} and reliability of the Inventory of Malaysian Multi Ethnic <b>Stereotypes</b> (ISMEM) instrument developed by the researchers. The qualitative phase was using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The employment of qualitative method was to explore the concept of <b>stereotypes</b> among the ethnic groups. Quantitative phase involves the formation of items by themed and categorised the items that were built from the qualitative phase. A total of 1, 000 university students from various ethnic groups in Malaysia {{were involved in the}} quantitative phase. Exploratory factor analysis on ISMEM has formed two main components labelled as Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes.</b> The psychometric assessment of ISMEM involves i) testing the construct validity between the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and the Phenomenon Stereotypes; (ii) determining the convergent validity between the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and the Phenomenon Stereotypes; (iii) testing the reliability coefficient of the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and the Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes,</b> and (iv) examining the item quality of the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and the Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes.</b> An assessment of the suitability of data for factor analysis was conducted before the psychometric assessment was carried out. The correlation (r≥. 30) between the scores of the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and the Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes</b> suggested a reasonable factoring. Construct validity test such as the Test Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, the Bartlettt's Test of Sphereity, the communality, the load factor, the Eigen value and the percentage of variance factor in both components of the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> and the Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes</b> are reasonable. The reliability value of Cronbach Alpha for the Antecedents <b>Stereotypes</b> (α =. 897 -. 933) and the Phenomenon <b>Stereotypes</b> are well accepted (α =. 706 -. 821). Therefore, ISMEM is a reliable and valid measure. However, further studies need to be conducted in other groups of sample to further validate the instrument...|$|R
40|$|Although {{parents may}} {{represent}} influential sources of children’s gender <b>stereotypes,</b> to date no study has directly investigated {{the relations between}} parents’ and children’s gender <b>stereotypes</b> regarding academic abilities.

40|$|Education {{is home to}} one of America’s most {{pervasive}} gender <b>stereotypes.</b> A disproportionately {{low frequency}} of male elementary school teachers has reinforced such <b>stereotypes.</b> This study was designed to investigate gender <b>stereotypes</b> further. Forty-three undergraduate students answered questions assessing their attitudes and views towards four different fictitious teachers. The teacher descriptions were varied by gender and competency (incompetent versus competent). Competent teachers were rated significantly higher across all measures including emotional supportiveness and subject-area competency, while teacher gender produced no significant differences on any of the measures. However, participant gender interacted with teacher competency significantly for leadership ratings. The findings do not support the bulk of previous findings on <b>stereotypes</b> in education.

40|$|Orientation: After the 1994 {{democratic}} elections, South African organisations had {{to replace}} discriminatory policies with new policies to integrate all {{people and to}} embrace diversity. As a consequence <b>stereotypes</b> may be more prevalent in diverse working environments. Research purpose: The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the experience of <b>stereotypes</b> amongst the support staff within a higher education institution. Motivation for this study: Changes within South African working environments, and specifically higher education institutions, resulted in more diverse management teams and a more culturally diverse workforce. With this in mind, the experience of <b>stereotypes</b> may become more prevalent within South African working environments. Many researchers have focused on stereotypes; however, studies on <b>stereotypes</b> within South Africa are limited, especially within higher education institutions. Research approach, design and method: The research approach was qualitative and a case study design was employed. A combination of both quota and convenience sampling was used. The sample consisted of (N = 30) support staff within a higher education institution in South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Main findings: The results indicated that the participants do experience <b>stereotypes</b> within their workplace and also hold <b>stereotypes</b> of other people within their workplace. The most prevalent <b>stereotypes</b> mentioned by participants were age, gender, racial and occupational <b>stereotypes.</b> There is also an indication that <b>stereotypes</b> have cognitive, emotional and behavioural effects on the <b>stereotyped.</b> Practical/managerial implications: Organisations should do away with <b>stereotyping</b> by embracing and managing diversity and dealing with <b>stereotypes,</b> specifically within higher education institutions. When managers are aware of <b>stereotypes</b> and the effects thereof in the organisation, they can make every effort to eradicate the <b>stereotypes</b> and address the impact thereof. Contribution: In an environment where there is a diverse workforce, <b>stereotyping</b> is more likely to exist. This study will provide useful information about <b>stereotypes</b> within a higher education institution seeing that there are a limited number of studies on this topic within South Africa and within this specific occupation. The results of the study will enlighten the organisation to become more aware of <b>stereotypes</b> and the debilitating impact that they have on the individual and the organisation, thereby providing the organisation with the opportunity to address <b>stereotypes</b> and the impact thereof on employees and the organisation. </p...|$|R
