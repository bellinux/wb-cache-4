50|$|Some {{pioneering}} <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays</b> were MIT Project MAC's ARDS (Advanced Remote Display Station), the Computek 400 Series Display terminals (a commercial derivative), {{which both}} used a Tektronix type 611 <b>storage</b> <b>display</b> unit, and Tektronix's 4014 terminal, the latter becoming {{a de facto}} computer terminal standard some time after its introduction (later being emulated by other systems due to this status).|$|R
50|$|Some refresh vector {{displays}} use {{a normal}} phosphor that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second {{to show a}} stable image. These displays such as the Imlac PDS-1 require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays</b> such as the popular Tektronix 4010 use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. <b>Storage</b> <b>displays</b> do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of vector displays were much more affordable than bitmap raster graphics displays when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, raster displays have replaced nearly all uses of vector displays.|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and built a computer terminal that provides low cost, high quality graphics and programmable text processing {{by taking advantage of}} the latest memory and microprocessor technology. A microprocessor control element allows most of the control functions to be programmed so that all of the control electronics require less than 100 integrated circuits.

50|$|The {{graphic display}} {{software}} {{was based upon}} software originally developed in the 1960s by Corning Glass Works for their Type 904 graphics terminal. The display for this system had characteristics to the {{similar to those of}} Tektronix <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>display.</b> It used small pixel regions composed of photochromic glass, which could be darkened (forming a black line image) by writing, and would display this persistently until the entire display was erased. When Corning left the market this software base was sold to Tektronix.|$|R
5000|$|..... {{for many}} years, {{they had no}} {{suitable}} terminals. They carried on with TTYs and other printing terminals for a long time, {{and when they did}} buy screens for everyone, they got Tektronix 4014s. These were large <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays.</b> You can't run a screen editor on a storage-tube display as the picture can't be updated. Thus it had to fall to someone else to pioneer screen editing for Unix, and that was us initially, and we continued to do so for many years.|$|R
40|$|Creating {{graphics}} for TV and <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays</b> {{is common}} and easy at most computer installations today. It is less easy to produce high-quality hard-copy of graphics for publication. This manual describes {{a program called}} Plaster which produces a raster representation of a picture created with the PlotlO graphics package for display on the Santec S 700 printer. Plaster (PlotlO to Raster) thus allows one to obtain hard-copy of an image created with the prevalent {{and easy to use}} PlotlO language on the inexpensive but high quality Santec printer...|$|R
50|$|The Tektronix 4050 was {{a series}} of three {{computer}} graphics microcomputers produced by Tektronix in the late 1970s through the early 1980s. The display technology was similar to the Tektronix 4010 terminal, using a <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>display</b> to avoid the need for video RAM. They were all-in-one designs with the display, keyboard, CPU and DC300 tape drive in a single desktop case. They also included a GPIB parallel bus interface for controlling lab and test equipment as well as connecting to external peripherals. A simple operating system and BASIC interpreter were included in ROM.|$|R
50|$|At this time, Applicon's {{software}} was written entirely in DEC's assembler language. A four workstation system had typically only about 64K words of memory. A word was 16 bits long. Program code was swapped {{in and out}} of memory using what was then called memory overlay techniques. Magnetic core memory was used until around 1979. Work stations used <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays.</b> Hard drives used removable platters and were as large as washing machines. A four workstation system cost about $400,000 in 1970s dollars including a pen plotter which cost about $60,000 (Xynetics plotter). At this time, only large companies could afford to use CAD machines and they had to man the workstations three shifts a day because of the cost.|$|R

25|$|Gitton's design {{relies on}} gravity {{powering}} multiple siphons {{in the same}} principle as the Pythagorean cup; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour <b>display</b> <b>tubes</b> is reached, an overflow tube starts {{to act as a}} siphon and thus empties the <b>display</b> <b>tube.</b> Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a water stream piped from the clock's reservoir. The pendulum has a carefully constructed container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the Royal Gorge water clock in Colorado, the Woodgrove Mall in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and the Hornsby Water Clock in Sydney, Australia.|$|R

40|$|Increasing <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> {{temperature}} {{and time of}} ground beef significantly increased microbial counts but lean level had no effect. Prolonged storage at abusive temperatures (48 °F) caused up to 90 % unacceptable chubs and aerobic bacteria counts as high as 7. 7 log 10 CFU/g, which would render chubs unsatisfactory for further processing, packaging and sale. Thus, ground beef chubs should be stored at 32 °F. and as briefly as possible to minimize pre- and post-display microbial counts. Maintaining both optimal <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> temperatures is critical because combining abusive <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> conditions resulted in the greatest microbial growth. Shelf life and wholesomeness benefits from maintaining cold (32 °F) <b>storage</b> and <b>display</b> temperatures are clearly demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|... 2.FED display {{requires}} a vacuum to operate, so the <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> {{has to be}} sealed and mechanically robust.
