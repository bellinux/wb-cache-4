5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage.

Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for location-based services (LBSs) {{and the lack of}} GPS signals in indoor environments, indoor localization has become more and more popular in recent years. Researchers have proposed a vast range of approaches, among which WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization {{is one of the most}} promising technologies [1 – 4]. A typical WiFi fingerprint-based localization algorithm consists of two phases, offline site survey and online operating. In the offline site survey phase, the service provider collects WiFi <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> from multiple access points (APs) at every location of an interested area. Next, in the online operating phase, a to-be-localized client measures the <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> at a specific location from nearby APs, and then algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors [1, 3] or probability-based algorithms [5] are employed to infer the user’s location based on the measured WiFi <b>signal</b> <b>strengths.</b>|$|R

30|$|To {{construct}} a “radio map” of the indoor environment, {{we need to}} know the distribution of <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> in each location area, since RSS values vary in space over the area. Since we use the room as the smallest location unit, we performed space sampling by collecting a large number of <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> in each room. This was done by recording the RSS with the TEMS held in hand during a random walk throughout the accessible space of each room, rather than, for example, using a grid or a set of special representative points.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme to employ {{backpropagation}} neural networks (BPNNs) for both stages of fingerprinting-based indoor positioning using WLAN/WiFi <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> (FWIPS) : radio map construction during the offline stage, and localization during the online stage. Given a training radio map (TRM), i. e., a set of coordinate vectors and associated WLAN/WiFi <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> of the available access points, a BPNN can be trained to output the expected <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> for any input position within the region of interest (BPNN-RM). This {{can be used to}} provide a continuous representation of the radio map and to filter, densify or decimate a discrete radio map. Correspondingly, the TRM {{can also be used to}} train another BPNN to output the expected position within the region of interest for any input vector of recorded <b>signal</b> <b>strengths</b> and thus carry out localization (BPNN-LA). Key aspects of the design of such artificial neural networks for a specific application are the selection of design parameters like the number of hidden layers and nodes within the network, and the training procedure. Summarizing extensive numerical simulations, based on real measurements in a testbed, we analyze the impact of these design choices on the performance of the BPNN and compare the results in particular to those obtained using the $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$NN) and weighted $k$ nearest neighbors approaches to FWIPS.
