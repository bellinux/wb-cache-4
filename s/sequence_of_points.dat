2500|$|One such {{generalization}} {{is that a}} {{topological space}} is sequentially compact if any infinite <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> sampled from the space must have an infinite subsequence that converges to some point of the space. [...] The Heine–Borel theorem states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense {{if and only if}} it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the closed unit interval [...] some of those points must get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers [...] accumulate to 0 (others accumulate to 1). The same set of points would not accumulate to any point of the open unit interval so the open unit interval is not compact. Euclidean space itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> [...] has no subsequence that converges to any given real number.|$|E

2500|$|Any finite {{space is}} trivially compact. A non-trivial {{example of a}} compact space is the (closed) unit {{interval}} [...] of real numbers. [...] If one chooses {{an infinite number of}} distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some accumulation point in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence [...] get arbitrarily close to0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to1. [...] The given example sequence shows the importance of including the boundary points of the interval, since the limit points must be in the space itself — an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be bounded, since in the interval [...] one could choose the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> , of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century, several {{disparate}} mathematical properties were {{understood that}} would later be seen as consequences of compactness. [...] On the one hand, Bernard Bolzano (1817) had been aware that any bounded <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a limit point. [...] Bolzano's proof relied on the method of bisection: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected. [...] The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point. [...] The full significance of Bolzano's theorem, and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by Karl Weierstrass.|$|E
