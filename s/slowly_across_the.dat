5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Betsy was {{the strongest}} and most devastating storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was {{reported}} in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane {{in the history of the}} United States to result in at least $1billion (1965USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and moved <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965Atlantic hurricane season caused 76fatalities and $1.45billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> surface of the ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E

5|$|The season's eighteenth {{tropical}} depression formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18. Later that day, {{it became the}} seventeenth tropical storm of the season. Rita slowly intensified to become a hurricane on September 20. It was at Category1 and later Category2 intensity as it moved south of the Florida Keys. Rapid intensification ensued as Rita moved into the Gulf of Mexico on September 20, and Rita became a Category5 hurricane on September 21, becoming {{at the time the}} third-most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin with a minimum central pressure of 895mbar, though it would later fall to fourth following Hurricane Wilma. However, as the storm moved <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico it gradually weakened until landfall. Rita made landfall as a strong Category3 hurricane in Cameron Parish, Louisiana near the Texas/Louisiana border on September 24, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Tracking <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{center of}} the island, the intense inner rainbands dropped heavy {{rainfall}} which peaked at 650mm (25.61in) at the University of Guam. The precipitation led to record river flow on the Pago and Asan Rivers; overflown rivers caused damage to some roads and bridges. The rainfall also caused extensive flooding in several villages. Pongsona produced a storm surge of up to 6m (20ft) at some locations, with 3– 4m (9– 13ft) recorded near the eyewall. Considerable storm surge flooding occurred from Tumon southward to Piti, leaving some buildings {{on the west coast}} of the island flooded with 1m (4ft) of water. The combination of strong storm surge and rough waves caused considerable beach erosion and severe coastal damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iris was {{the ninth}} named storm and fifth {{hurricane}} of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Iris {{was the first}} of three tropical cyclones to affect the Lesser Antilles in a three-week period, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn. It developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August22 and attained hurricane status within 30hours. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern Caribbean from August26 through August28. During that time, Iris became one of four active tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. Earlier it had interacted with Hurricane Humberto, and beginning on August30, Iris interacted with Tropical Storm Karen. Iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) while moving <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> central Atlantic. The hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating Tropical Depression Karen on September3. Iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September4, though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western Europe on September7.|$|E

5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E

Problems were sometimes encountered with aircraft getting stuck in waterlogged fields, bushes and small trees causing damage and animals straying into the way.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{favorable}} conditions, {{the remnants}} of Nadine regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September24. After re-developing, the storm executed a cyclonic loop and meandered <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> eastern Atlantic. Eventually, Nadine turned south-southwestward, at which time it became nearly stationary. By September28, the storm curved northwestward and re-strengthened into a hurricane. The tenacious cyclone intensified further and peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h) on September30. By the following day, however, Nadine weakened back to a [...] tropical storm, as conditions became increasingly unfavorable. Strong wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures significantly weakened the storm. Nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October3, shortly before merging with an approaching cold front northeast of the Azores. The remnants of Nadine passed through the Azores on October4 and again brought relatively strong winds to the islands.|$|E
500|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was {{the strongest}} {{off-season}} Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the United States. The second tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed on May26 from a low-pressure system offshore North Carolina. Initially subtropical, the storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics as it tracked across warmer sea surface temperatures and within an environment of decreasing vertical wind shear. Late on May27, Beryl transitioned into a tropical cyclone less than [...] from North Florida. Early the following day, the storm moved ashore near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, dropping heavy rainfall while moving <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> southeastern United States. A cold front turned Beryl to the northeast, and the storm became extratropical on May30.|$|E
500|$|The {{synaptic}} {{network that}} finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In {{many parts of}} the brain, axons initially [...] "overgrow", and then are [...] "pruned" [...] by mechanisms that depend on neural activity. In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point {{on the surface of the}} retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> retinal layer. These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Saturday, July 18, 1998, 24 mujahideen fighters and 200 KLA militants left their base in {{northern}} Albania and departed for Kosovo. They were carrying a large quantity of arms and ammunition, which significantly impeded their movement and obliged them to move <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Albanian–Yugoslav frontier. One hypothesis is that they were heading to reinforce KLA fighters battling for the town of Orahovac. At 02:00, the column was ambushed by Yugoslav border guards near Mount Đeravica, about [...] from the Albanian border, just west of Dečani. The clashes reportedly lasted until about 07:00. According to Human Rights Watch observer Fred C. Abrahams, a total of 22 militants were killed in the clash (18 mujahideen and four KLA). Rabiçi was among those killed, and documents recording the KLA and mujahideen's journey were recovered off his corpse by Yugoslav authorities. Sixteen of the mujahideen were citizens of Saudi Arabia and one was a citizen of Yemen. Six were carrying forged Macedonian passports under ethnic Albanian pseudonyms. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the incident represented the first skirmish between the VJ and foreign mujahideen during the Kosovo War. It is unclear if the ambush came as a result of Yugoslav vigilance or if the KLA deliberately led the mujahideen into a trap with the goal of eliminating them and thus limiting the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks. Survivors told monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe that KLA fighters had led the mujahideen into a trap and fled. A Yugoslav lance corporal was seriously wounded in the exchange.|$|E
500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her boiler-room, engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, fresh breeze and a choppy sea. The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew pouring out of the conning tower, steamed <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held up their hands in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as she went down. The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E
