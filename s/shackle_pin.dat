50|$|A {{month after}} his win at Ascot, Dunbeath started 4/7 {{favourite}} for the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. His participation {{had been in}} doubt as he had suffered an allergic reaction to a new batch of oats {{two days before the}} race, leading to swelling in his legs. Lyphard's Special was again in opposition, as well as Muscatite, the Gran Criterium runner-up Beldale Concorde and the previously undefeated Cock Robin. Piggott restrained the colt {{at the back of the}} field as Muscatite and the outsider <b>Shackle</b> <b>Pin</b> set the pace before making rapid progress in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong, opened up a three length advantage, and was then eased down by Piggott to win by a length and a half from Cock Robin with Lyphard's Special in third.|$|E
50|$|The best rope for warps is nylon {{which is}} strong and flexible. Terylene (polyester) is {{stronger}} but has less flex. Both ropes sink, so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water. Neither breaks down quickly in sunlight. Polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres. They break down in sunlight. Natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water, are relatively weak and rot. They do give good grip and are often very cheap. All anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat's length. Some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters. Boats less than 8 m typically use 6 mm galvanized chain. 8-14 m craft use 9 mm chain and over 14 m use 12 mm chain. The chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice. The <b>shackle</b> <b>pin</b> should be securely wired. Either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles.|$|E
50|$|Suspension is by half-elliptical springs, {{those at}} the rear are underslung. Gaiters {{allowing}} leaf lubrication by oil are fitted, and such parts as <b>shackle</b> <b>pins</b> are greased by gun.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pin</b> <b>shackle</b> {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. <b>Pin</b> <b>shackles</b> can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter <b>pin.</b> <b>Pin</b> <b>shackles</b> are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R
50|$|This car now has {{the same}} Rover {{patented}} carburettor as their 8 hp car. The change speed lever is now in an exterior quadrant near the driver's right hand instead of beneath the steering wheel. The universal joint to the propellor shaft has been redesigned and the propellor shaft's casing now acts as a torque rod. The brake {{on the back of}} the gearbox which is controlled by the clutch is now very much larger. There are now separate levers for throttle and ignition timing. The front springs now have <b>shackle</b> <b>pins.</b> A fan has been added to the engine cooling system. Petrol is now carried on the dashboard. There is a pawl below the brake pedal so it can be used to brake the car on a slope.|$|R
40|$|Chief Cook either tripped or /slipped at top of {{external}} stair from bunker deck to starboard lifeboat deck {{and fell on}} his back down approx. 3 metres of steps. He was taken to hospital by ambulance for further assessment. 22 / 10 / 11 MA 201100085 23 : 05 UTC+ 11 No At its berth in Hobart Aurora Australis IMO No 8717283 Equipment failure At 2305 22. 10. 11 whilst attempting to load a heavy lift with ships crane, stroops parted, there were no injuries or damage. As the crane driver was taking the weight on the hook the rigid plastic protectors around the sharp metal edges of the lift (rock crusher) shattered and the fibre stroops were cut through, as lift had not as yet lifted off there was no damage or injury, also the <b>pin</b> in one <b>shackle</b> came loose and was thrown 5 m. After another toolbox and safety meeting adnd a change to chain lifting gear and use of rubber around sharp edges the lift was successfully completed.

40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} pin clevis joints, and more particularly, to zero play pin clevis joints for connecting structural members of a deployable space structure. A joint includes a pin, a tang, and a <b>shackle.</b> The <b>pin</b> is tapered at the same angle as the bores extending through the projections of the shackle and the tang. A spring washer biases the tang onto the tapered sidewall of the pin. The invention solves the free play problem associated with deployable space structures by using a tapered pin which is held in tapered holes by the spring washers...|$|R
50|$|For safety, it {{is common}} to mouse a {{threaded}} shackle to keep the pin from coming loose. This is done by looping mousing wire or a nylon zip tie {{through the hole in the}} pin and around the <b>shackle</b> body. For <b>pins</b> that have a cross-hole in the threaded end a cotter pin can be used. One disadvantage of wire is that mousing can introduce galvanic corrosion because of material differences; it is especially bad when used in places where the shackle is exposed to air and water. Nylon is not recommended for use where significant movement of the shackle is expected.|$|R
