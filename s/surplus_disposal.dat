40|$|Autophagy {{is a key}} cytoplasmic biomass and organellar {{quality and}} {{quantity}} control pathway of the eukaryotic cell. It is particularly suited to capture and degrade large, multi-macromolecular cytosplasmic targets earmarked for degradation or turnover. Typical autophagic cargos represent large swaths of cytosol {{as a source of}} energy and anabolic precursors at times of growth restrictions imposed by the absence of growth factors, nutrient limitation or hypoxia. Autophagy is the only effective mechanism for removal of whole organelles such as leaky or <b>surplus</b> mitochondria, <b>disposal</b> of potentially toxic protein aggregates too large for proteasomal removal, and elimination of intracellular microbes including bacteria, protozoa and viruses. Recent studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is targeted for eliminated by autophagy but that this is countered by the viral protein Nef. Here we review these relationships and underscore the untapped potential of autophagy as a druggable antiviral process. Introduction to autophagy The sensu stricto autophagy refers to the process of macroautophagy whereby cytoplasmic targets are captured within organelles of endomembranous origin, termed autophagosomes, which subsequently mature into autolysosomes where the captured cargo is degraded o...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{research}} and other literature concerning {{the planning and}} development of redundant defence estate. It concentrates on UK sources but includes reference to material from Europe and the North America were it is relevant for comparative purposes.

It concludes that there is a significant body of work focusing on the reuse and redevelopment of redundant defence estate in the UK and abroad, but that much of this work is based on limited research or on personal experience. One particular weakness of the current literature is that it does not fully reflect the institutional difficulties posed by the disposal process and the day-today pressures which MOD personnel have to deal with. In doing this, it also under-emphasises the embedded cultures of individuals and professional groups who are required to operationalise the policies, procedures and practices for planning and redeveloping redundan...|$|R

40|$|The market-oriented {{focus of}} the global food regime, as it functioned from the late 1940 s to the early 1970 s, has proved inadequate.
