25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in Tibet at that time, the Tibetan government started striking its own coins, modelled on Nepalese prototypes. This occurred in 1763-64 and again in 1785 without any interference by the Chinese government.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> {{led to the}} {{issuance}} of private tokens by the principal colonial company on Ngazidja and a sugar plantation on Mayotte. Denominations included 25 and 50 centimes and 1 and 2 francs. Aluminium and bronze were used in these tokens.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} this <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins,</b> Governor Lachlan Macquarie {{took the initiative}} of using £10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government to produce suitable coins {{in a similar manner}} to that described above. These coins to the value of 40,000 Spanish dollars came on 26 November 1812 on HMS Samarang from Madras, via the East India Company.|$|E
50|$|In his treatise, Breve trattato delle cause che possono far abbondare li regni d’oro e d’argento dove non sono miniere, Serra {{analysed}} {{the causes}} <b>of</b> the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> in the Kingdom of Naples and {{the factors that}} could have reversed this economic trend. He {{was the first to}} analyse and fully understand the concept of balance of trade for both visible goods and invisible services and capital movements. He explained how the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> in the Kingdom of Naples was due to balance of payments deficit. Using his findings he was able to reject the popular idea {{at the time that the}} scarcity in money was due to the exchange rate. The solution to the problem was found in the active encouragement of exports.|$|R
2500|$|Staff tokens {{were issued}} to staff of {{businesses}} in lieu <b>of</b> <b>coin.</b> In the 19th century the argument supporting payment to staff was the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> in circulation, {{but in reality}} employees were forced to spend their wages in the company's stores at highly inflated prices—resulting in an effective dramatic lowering of their actual salary and disposable income.|$|R
40|$|<b>Shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in 1999 and 2000 {{motivated}} the authors to develop models for forecasting coin demand. A variety of models were developed, tested, {{and used in}} realtime forecasting. This paper describes the models that were developed and examines the forecast errors from the models both in quasi-ex-ante forecasting exercises and in realtime use. Tests for forecast efficiency are run on each model. Real-time forecasts are examined. The authors conclude with suggestions for further refinements of the models. Coinage...|$|R
25|$|From the 17th to {{the early}} 19th century in the British Isles and North America, tokens were {{commonly}} issued by merchants in times of acute <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> {{of the state to}} enable trading activities to proceed. The token was in effect a pledge redeemable in goods but not necessarily for currency. These tokens never received official sanction from government but were accepted and circulated quite widely.|$|E
25|$|Recently, fake 10- and 5-piso coins dating 2001 and 2002 {{have entered}} circulation. Because of this, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas issued a warning and several {{security}} measures on importing and falsifying Philippine coins. And {{it is because}} the BSP has announced that there is an artificial <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> last June 2006. The BSP has asked the public to use all small coins or to have them exchanged for banknotes in local banks or other financial institution.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, {{there was}} a severe <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins.</b> [...] Silver prices were rising, and the public responded by {{hoarding}} not only the wildly popular new coin, the Kennedy half dollar, but the other denominations, including the non-silver cent and nickel. [...] Hopeful that issuing more 1964-dated coins would counter the speculation in them, the Treasury obtained Congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century, the Royalty of Spain {{authorized}} the production <b>of</b> copper <b>coins</b> by the Ayuntamiento (Municipality) of Manila {{in response to}} the acute <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> fractional <b>coins.</b> These were called barrillas and first appeared in 1728.|$|R
50|$|Particularly in Kent, because <b>of</b> a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> {{small-denomination}} <b>coin</b> <b>of</b> the realm, many growers issued {{their own}} currency to those doing the labor. In some cases, the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images, making them quite beautiful.|$|R
50|$|During {{the change}} over period, fear <b>of</b> a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> {{led to the}} {{introduction}} of the one-dollar note, fixed at an exchange rate against gold instead of silver. To effect this, the British gold sovereign was for the first time declared legal tender, and the Straits dollar was given an arbitrary value of two shillings and four pence sterling. This dollar note proved so popular that it was retained in all future issues, so that to a very large extent it replaced the need for the silver coin.|$|R
500|$|Section 101 {{authorized}} the Secretary of the Treasury to issue dimes, quarters, and half dollars of clad composition, with the half dollar {{to be made}} of 40 percent silver. So long as there was a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins,</b> the Mint could strike dimes, quarters, and half dollars from [...]900 silver, but this authority was to end once the secretary certified there was an adequate supply of the new coins in circulation, and in any event five years after the law was enacted (thus, ending July 23, 1970). [...] During that five-year period, no standard silver dollars could be minted.|$|E
500|$|The {{rapidly growing}} United States {{in the early}} 1830s {{experienced}} a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins.</b> It is estimated that in 1830 there was one small silver coin (quarter, dime or half dime) per person. [...] Also, production of silver dollars was suspended in 1804 because they were being exchanged for underweight Spanish coins in the West Indies. [...] That left the half-dollar as the largest denomination of circulating coin being minted in the U. S. [...] Foreign coins were being circulated in the U. S. to alleviate the shortage. [...] The Philadelphia Mint {{had been the only}} U. S. mint until 1838, when operations began at the first branch mints.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} solve {{temporarily}} the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in Tibet when the Chinese army arrived in 1791, the Chinese had allowed the striking {{of the so-called}} [...] "Kong-par tangkas" [...] which were produced from alloyed silver and had a design copied from Nepalese prototypes. These tangkas which first were produced in the Kongpo province and later in Lhasa, were the first mass-produced silver coins of Tibet and had about the same weight as their Nepalese counterparts, i.e. about 5.2grams.|$|E
500|$|Records {{state that}} a {{building}} was located {{here from the}} 11th century and during medieval times it {{is believed to have}} been a monastic or manorial mint. but the current Grade II* listed inn (...) is dated to the 16th century, aside from restoration work; it was once thatched roofed. It was run for many years in Tudor times by the Raglan family. In the mid 17th century there is evidence that its owner Edward Craddock was again using it as a mint to [...] "mint his own tokens as there was a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> at this time." [...] There are five other pubs and four restaurants in the town.|$|R
40|$|Very {{preliminary}} and incomplete, comments invited There {{are numerous}} historical episodes in which agents have complained about {{there being a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> small <b>coins</b> (low value media of exchange). In the paper, we build a pairwise matching model with two indivisible commodity monies. Because the monies are indivisible, the model takes seriously the idea that these monies are coins. These commodity monies have different intrinsic values, and agents may hold more than one unit of one or both. We find equilibria in which both coins are used for trades, having two coins has a higher welfare than having only one, the smaller coin is used to make change in some transactions, and <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> small <b>coins</b> hurts the poor. The predictions of the model are evaluated against England’s experience with silver and gold coins...|$|R
25|$|Between July 1, 1990 (the {{currency}} union with East Germany) and July 1, 1991, East German coins in denominations up to 50 pfennigs continued to circulate as Deutsche Mark coins at their face value, owing to a temporary <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> small <b>coins.</b> These coins were legal tender {{only in the}} territory of the former East Germany.|$|R
50|$|Unofficial {{gold coins}} were {{used during the}} gold rush of the 1850s. Traders' tokens were also used because of the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> caused by the large {{increase}} in population. Requests to make gold coins in Adelaide in 1852 {{to compensate for the}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> were rejected by Britain after 25,000 One Pound pieces were struck.|$|E

50|$|In October 2009, a new 10 ruble <b>coin</b> made <b>of</b> brass-plated steel was issued, {{featuring}} optical security features. The 10 ruble banknote {{would have}} been withdrawn in 2012, but a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> 10-ruble <b>coins</b> prompted the Central Bank to delay this and put new ones in circulation. Bimetallic commemorative 10 ruble coins {{will continue to be}} issued.|$|R
50|$|In September 1942, non-serialised {{currency}} notes were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 cents {{as a response}} to a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> old <b>coins.</b> The cent notes were of a simpler design, lacking plantation crops on the obverse; the 50 cent note is an exception. The cent notes are noticeably smaller than dollar notes.|$|R
5000|$|Cwmdwyfran Iron Works was {{engraved}} {{on some of}} the tokens issued by the Works, in 1792, in order to facilitate the business. These were payable in London, Bristol and Carmarthen. The only known illustration of the Cwmdwyfran Iron Works is the engraving contained on the copper tokens. Although the making <b>of</b> such <b>coins</b> was illegal, the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> small <b>coins</b> had become so acute that in 1792, the prohibition was, in many cases, ignored.|$|R

50|$|As chief {{administrator}} of the Colony, he issued playing cards as legal tender from 1684 onwards owing to a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins.</b> The funds were used, in part, to pay soldiers who arrived in New France since 1665 to protect and built the colony.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout the German {{occupation}} of Belgium during World War I {{there was a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> official <b>coins</b> and banknotes in circulation. As a result, around 600 communes, local governments and companies issued their own unofficial [...] "Necessity Money" [...] (monnaie de nécessité, noodgeld) to enable the continued functioning of the local economies. These usually {{took the form of}} locally-produced banknotes, but a few types <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> were also issued in towns and cities. In 2013, the National Bank of Belgium's museum digitized its collection of Belgian notgeld, which is available online.|$|R
25|$|The second Shah king, {{who ruled}} from Kathmandu, Pratap Singh Shah, {{supplied}} alloyed silver coins {{during the period}} 1775 until 1777. Thereafter, when the Nepalese again tried to introduce into Tibet <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> good silver, which should have circulated at a considerable premium compared with the Malla and Pratap Simha coins, the Tibetans refused {{which resulted in a}} disruption of trade between Nepal and Tibet. Tibet again experimented with its own coinage in 1785, in order to mitigate the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> silver <b>coins.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{presently}} two series <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in circulation: aluminium bronze and bi-metallic coins from 1991-1998 and light-weight aluminium coins from 1999 onwards. Due {{to the low}} value and general <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> small denomination <b>coins</b> (below 100 rupiah), {{it is common to}} receive sweets in lieu of the last few rupiah of change in supermarkets and stores. The 1 rupiah coin is officially legal tender for completeness' sake, but is not circulated as it is effectively worthless.|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} after the first Australian colony, New South Wales, was founded in 1788, it did not have its own {{currency}} and had to rely on the coins of other countries. During {{the early days of the}} colony, commodities such as wheat were sometimes used as a currency because of the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{presently}} two series <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in circulation: aluminium, bronze and nickel coins dated between 1991 and 2010. These come in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 rupiah. The older series <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> has been gradually disappearing. Due {{to the low}} value and general <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> small denomination <b>coins</b> (below 100 rupiah), {{it is common to}} have amounts rounded up (or down) or to receive sweets in lieu of the last few rupiah of change in supermarkets and stores.. A new series <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> was issued in 2016 in 100, 200, 500 and 1000 rupiah.|$|R
50|$|To {{alleviate}} the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> silver <b>coins,</b> between 1797 and 1804, the Bank of England counterstamped Spanish dollars (8 reales) and other Spanish and Spanish colonial coins for circulation. A small counterstamp of the King's head was used. Until 1800, these circulated {{at a rate}} of 4/9 for 8 reales. After 1800, a rate of 5/- for 8 reales was used. The Bank then issued silver tokens for 5/- (struck over Spanish dollars) in 1804, followed by tokens for 1/6 and 3/- between 1811 and 1816.|$|R
50|$|Towards the {{beginning}} of the 1900s, the Silver Party was formed, bringing many Republicans and Democrats together from the western states. The party was so-named because of the federal government’s <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> silver <b>coins</b> in 1873. The Silver Party played a prominent role in Nevada’s politics in the 1894 and 1898 elections. The Silver Party later formed the Silver Democratic Party. The Silver Democratic Party was prominent in Nevada until the election of 1906. After the election of 1906, the Democratic and Republican parties became the two primary parties in Nevada.|$|R
