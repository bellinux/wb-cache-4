[...] One of the special editions notes that the Festival is continuing to uphold its Depression era mission of lifting Chicagoans' hearts and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> arrive at the Festival an hour early to get good lawn seats.

500|$|For the episode, McCreary {{composed}} a {{theme for the}} character of Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name with the notes arranged [...] "so that the syllables in her name land with the right emphasis. The melody basically <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sing along with her name ... I also put two of the A’s and the D in Akela Amador’s name on those exact notes ... Starting with this association with her name was a fun way to kickstart my creative process, and it also produced a malleable melody that could be adapted to my needs throughout the episode." [...] The theme is initially used with low strings or brass to sound ominous, or even evil, but when she [...] "reunites with Coulson for an emotional conversation, the strings repeat her theme in twisting, circular statements, adding angst and heartbreak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephenson's process {{progresses}} from sketch pad, {{to computer}} graphics, to clay models, and finally test models. He says {{the advantage of}} working with clay {{is that you can}} feel the transitions and feel where there is too much surface or more surface needed. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could almost design a car blind, because [...] "you don't have to see it, you have to feel it, and by feeling it you feel if it's right or it's not right".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Perhaps,' said Mr. Tryan, feeling {{slightly}} uncomfortable, 'since you are {{not very}} strong, my dear sir, it will be well, as Mrs. Jerome <b>suggests,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should not {{run the risk of}} any excitement.' ...|$|E

It's curious that several of my friends have wanted to do so--first the Colonel, then Bertram, and now you. Not flattering, is it? <b>Suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> doubt my talents, or that I look like a deserving object of charity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Gresham {{has made}} his {{acceptance}} of office,--well, I will not say strictly conditional on your joining him. That would hardly be correct. But he has expressed himself quite {{willing to make the}} attempt with your aid, and doubtful whether he can succeed without it. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should join him as President of the Council." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed a}} sunny little laugh, like one well {{accustomed}} to receive such inquiries. [...] "Fancy asking A WOMAN {{to give you}} 'the train of reasoning' for her intuitions!" [...] she cried, merrily. [...] "That shows, Dr. Cumberledge, {{that you are a}} mere man--a man of science, perhaps, but NOT a psychologist. It also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a confirmed bachelor. A married man accepts intuitions, without expecting them to be based on reasoning.... Well, just this once, I will stretch a point to enlighten you. If I recollect right, your mother died about three years ago?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You bid me {{ask myself}} if I have used you well in not sending {{intelligence}} of myself till a fortnight after I had left you. Now, George, don't be unreasonable! Let {{me remind you}} that, as a certain apostle said, there are a thousand things lawful which are not expedient. I say this, not from pride in my own conduct, but to offer you a very fair explanation of it. Your resolve not {{to be out of}} humour with me <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been sorely tempted that way, else why should such a resolve have been necessary? ...|$|E
6000|$|With true ingratitude {{you see me}} pitch {{upon your}} exception; but {{it is easier to}} defend oneself {{gracefully}} than to acknowledge praise. [...] I am truly glad that you should like my books; for I think I see from what you write that you are a reader worth convincing. Your name, if I have properly deciphered it, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may be also something of my countrywoman; for {{it is hard to see}} where Monroe came from, if not from Scotland. I seem to have here a double claim on your good nature: being myself pure Scotch and having appreciated your letter, make up two undeniable merits which, perhaps, if it should be quite without trouble, you might reward with your photograph. - Yours truly, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. One of {{the coolest}} and most practised men in London was ill-mannered towards me from sheer absence of mind--and {{could there be}} higher flattery? When a man of that sort does not give you the politeness you deserve, it means that in his heart he is rebelling against another feeling which his pride <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not deserve. O, I forgot {{to say that he}} is a Mr. Neigh, a nephew of Mr. Doncastle's, who lives at ease about Piccadilly and Pall Mall, and has a few acres somewhere--but I don't know much of him. The worst of my {{position}} now is that I excite this superficial interest in many people and a deep friendship in nobody. If what all my supporters feel could be collected into the hearts of two or three they would love me better than they love themselves; but now it pervades all and operates in none.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{walk over}} the {{building}} with Mr. Havill and myself, and detail your ideas to us on each portion.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> let {{the fellow}} produce his {{mortgages}} and receive {{him at a}} council meeting. The matter's of interest to everybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should coerce her, {{as you put}} it. I merely meant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{could point}} out to her, as a father, where her duty and {{happiness}} lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Levine {{considers}} {{it one of}} the most difficult cases he has ever been engaged in,' said Danvers. 'He says frankly he does not think you have the remotest chance of getting a verdict, unless before the trial comes on you can lay your hand on this woman, and he <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and he together should see Gilliat--who, of course, has no personal feeling in the matter, and would naturally be most averse to taking anything like hostile action against you--and inform him of the exact position of the case, and your desire that they should not send in their account to you for another three or four months. This would give at least six months before the trial would come on, and in that time, if ever, we ought to be able to lay our hands on this woman, and you would still have the option of paying, if before the case comes on you can obtain no evidence. Lastly, he says that, unpleasant as it is to contemplate the possibility of such a thing, it must not be forgotten that in the event of the trial coming on, and the verdict being an adverse one, it is quite upon the cards that if public opinion is strongly aroused on the subject, the Treasury may feel compelled to order a prosecution of Miss Hawtrey for perjury--if not for obtaining goods under false pretences--or possibly for theft.' ...|$|E

50|$|Low volume per {{exercise}} (average volume per week): HST <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{limit the}} number of sets per exercise per workout to 1 or 2, based on evidence that sets beyond the first effective set do little to contribute to hypertrophy. Instead of doing 6 sets of a bench press in one workout once or twice per week, those sets are spread over three workouts {{in the course of a}} week. This accommodates the concept of chronic load by allowing for exercise every two days or so.|$|E
