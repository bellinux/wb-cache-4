40|$|European forests have a {{prominent}} role in the global carbon cycle and an increase in carbon storage has been consistently reported during the 20 th century. Any further increase in forest carbon storage, however, could be hampered by increases in aridity and extreme climatic events. Here we use forest inventory data to identify the relative importance of stand structure (<b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> and mean d. b. h.), mean climate (water availability) and recent climate change (temperature and precipitation anomalies) on forest basal area change during the late 20 th century in three major European biomes. Using linear mixed-effects models we observed that stand structure, mean climate and recent climatic change strongly interact to modulate basal area change. Although we observed a net increment in <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> during the late 20 th century, we found the highest basal area increments in forests with medium <b>stand</b> basal <b>areas</b> and small to medium sized trees. <b>Stand</b> basal <b>area</b> increases correlated positively with water availability, and were enhanced in warmer areas. Recent climatic warming caused an increase in <b>stand</b> basal <b>area,</b> but this increase was offset by water availability. Based on recent trends in basal area change we conclude that the potential rate of aboveground carbon accumulation in European forests strongly depends on both stand structure and concomitant climate warming, adding weight to suggestions that European carbon stocks may saturate in the near future...|$|R

30|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that birch {{is the best}} canopy for spruce understorey and birch is the best admixture in a spruce stand. However, the current study showed {{that this is not}} necessarily the case; if the effects of <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> and site fertility are removed, the growth is equally good or even better (Pukkala et al., 2013) under pine than under birch. The common belief of the smaller competitive effect of birch may be partly due to lower <b>stand</b> basal <b>areas</b> and better site fertility of birch stands, as compared to pine stands. Due to fertile site and low <b>stand</b> basal <b>area,</b> understorey spruces often grow well under birch canopies although the competitive effect of pine would be fairly similar with the same basal area.|$|R

50|$|Places to See and Various Pastimes :The {{place of}} {{historical}} importance to visit is the Old Fort situated {{on a hill}} top. The fort is in a dilapidated state but still representative of family of Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch. A place of religious importance is the old Shiva temple. The popular belief about the Shivalinga in the temple is that it grows every year by a height equal to one grain of rice. Another place of great religious significance for Sikhs is Gurdwara overlooking the river Beas. It was started after visit of Guru Gobind Singh to this place during Battle of Nadaun. Hence Nadaun is considered a town of multiple-religions all living in mutual-harmony. A favorite pastime of people of Nadaun is evening walk to the Nadaun Bridge. There are many restaurants which have come up in this area. This Bridge provides fantastic views of Beas River and of sunset. This bridge separates Hamirpur district from Kangra district. Another interesting pastime is river-cruise in a small wooden boat. One can enjoy this ride the whole day. The boat is still used {{as a mode of}} transport.

40|$|The species {{richness}} and abundance of arboreal marsupials are {{positively related to}} the proportion of total <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> occupied by Corymbia citriodora ssp. variegata and tree height in South-East Queensland and have been related to nutrient availability and productivity {{in other parts of}} Australia. The objectives of this study were to assess the relationships of <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> occupied by C. citriodora and tree height, and the available nutrients and productivity in the dry sclerophyll forests of South-East Queensland. Leaf nutrient analysis of seven species of trees in South-East Queensland showed that the percentage by weight of phosphorus in leaves increased with the proportion of the total <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> of C. citriodora. This rate of increase was greater for C. citriodora than other species, indicating that C. citriodora may be more competitive on soils with greater available phosphorus. C. citriodora leaves also contained higher concentrations of nitrogen and potassium than the other tree species on multispecies sites. Timber productivity was greater at the sites where trees were taller, and tree height was positively correlated to the proportion of total <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> of C. citriodora and rainfall but was negatively correlated to the slope. These findings indicate that the most used habitat by arboreal marsupials in the dry sclerophyll forests of South-East Queensland (i. e., taller forests with a high proportion of the <b>stand</b> basal <b>area</b> occupied by C. citriodora) had higher concentrations of foliar nutrients and were more productive than less used habitats.
