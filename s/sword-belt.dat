25|$|The most {{impressive}} of the burials without a chamber {{is that of}} a young man who was buried with his horse, in Mound 17. The horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral, in a ritual sufficiently standardised to indicate a lack of sentimental attachment to it. Two undisturbed grave-hollows existed side-by-side under the mound. The man's oak coffin contained his pattern welded sword on his right and his <b>sword-belt,</b> wrapped around the blade, which had a bronze buckle with garnet cloisonné cellwork, two pyramidal strapmounts and a scabbard-buckle. By the man's head was a firesteel and a leather pouch, containing rough garnets and a piece of millefiori glass. Around the coffin were two spears, a shield, a small cauldron and a bronze bowl, a pot, an iron-bound bucket and some animal ribs. In the north-west corner of his grave was a bridle, mounted with circular gilt bronze plaques with interlace ornamentation. These items are on display at Sutton Hoo.|$|E
500|$|The {{protective}} sign of {{the hammer}} was worn by women, as {{we know from the}} fact that it has been found in women's graves. It seems to have been used by the warrior also, in the form of the swastika. [...] Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his <b>sword-belt,</b> the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.|$|E
2500|$|In Mounds 5, 6, and 7, Carver found cremations {{deposited}} in bronze bowls. In Mound 5 [...] were found gaming-pieces, small iron shears, a cup, and an ivory box. Mound 7 also contained gaming-pieces, {{as well as}} an iron-bound bucket, a <b>sword-belt</b> fitting and a drinking vessel, together with the remains of horse, cattle, red deer, sheep, and pig that had been burnt with the deceased on a pyre. Mound 6 contained cremated animals, gaming-pieces, a <b>sword-belt</b> fitting, and a comb. The Mound 18 grave was very damaged, but of similar kind. Two cremations were found during the 1960s exploration to define the extent of Mound 5, together with two inhumations and a pit with a skull and fragments of decorative foil. In level areas between the mounds, Carver found three furnished inhumations. One small mound held a child's remains, along with his buckle and miniature spear. A man's grave included two belt buckles and a knife, and that of a woman contained a leather bag, a pin and a chatelaine.|$|E
60|$|While {{waiting for}} the ladies, two <b>sword-belts</b> had been bought for the lads, Edgar's being {{embroidered}} with gold thread, Albert's with silver.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sword-belts</b> were {{generally}} broad and handsomely embroidered. Swords give actual beauty to the Mughal Era. On horseback they were worn on a belt {{hanging over the}} shoulder. Otherwise a man carried his sword by three straps hanging from a waist-belt.|$|R
60|$|Glance {{fore and}} aft our flush decks. What a {{swarming}} crew! All told, they muster hard upon eight hundred millions of souls. Over these we have authoritative Lieutenants, a <b>sword-belted</b> Officer of Marines, a Chaplain, a Professor, a Purser, a Doctor, a Cook, a Master-at-arms.|$|R
2500|$|The sword {{was often}} {{modified}} by its users. The point was originally a 'hatchet point', a curved diagonal front edge {{similar to that}} of the Japanese katana, but most were altered to a symmetrical 'spear point', more common at the time, or alternatively made more acute whilst retaining the asymmetry of the tip. This was done in order to improve the sword's ability to thrust. Quite large numbers of spear-pointed examples exist with [...] blades, along with an appropriately shortened scabbard. These may be conversions of the original standard [...] blade, although many appear to have been manufactured to this shorter length. The sword was carried in an iron scabbard with wooden liners, [...] and hung from the waist via <b>sword-belt</b> slings attached to two loose suspension rings.|$|E
6000|$|... "May not my poor poniard serve, honoured madam?" [...] said Varney, {{presenting}} a small dagger of exquisite workmanship, which hung in his Turkey-leather <b>sword-belt.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} the stranger. [...] "It had formerly been the <b>sword-belt</b> of Mars; {{and it can}} only make the wearer valiant and courageous." ...|$|E
60|$|Ole's sudden alarm {{was caused}} by his {{stumbling}} in the dark over the root of a shrub which grew on the edge of, and partly concealed, a precipice, over which he was precipitated, and {{at the foot of}} which his mangled and lifeless form would soon have reposed, had not his warlike forefathers, being impressed with the advantage of wearing strong <b>sword-belts,</b> furnished the sword which Ole wore with such a belt as was not only on all occasions sufficient to support the sword itself, but which, on this particular occasion, was strong enough to support its owner when he was suspended from, and entangled with, the shrubs of the cliff.|$|R
50|$|Swordsmanship {{is known}} as asiyuddha or karaga-yuddha. Ancient swords (assu or khadga) were mostly of the {{straight}} variety, their form preserved in the khanda. The {{most common type of}} sword today is the Central Asian-derived talwar, but a wide variety of other swords are also incorporated. The more traditional katti is used for advanced forms, in particular those styles based on the Hindu gods. <b>Sword-belts</b> were in general broad and handsomely embroidered. On horseback they were worn on a belt hanging over the shoulder. Otherwise warriors carried their sword by three straps hanging from a waist-belt. The sword may be paired with another sword, an axe, a spear, a katara, a maru, or any other one-handed weapon, but its most typical pairing is with a shield.Types of swords include the following.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{the current}} was swift and strong, and, good swimmer as he was, {{it was no}} easy task which Alleyne had set himself. To clutch at Tranter and to seize him by the hair {{was the work of}} a few seconds, but to hold his head above water and to make {{their way out of the}} current was another matter. For a hundred strokes he did not seem to gain an inch. Then at last, amid a shout of joy and praise from the bank, they slowly drew clear into more {{stagnant}} water, at the instant that a rope, made of a dozen <b>sword-belts</b> linked together by the buckles, was thrown by Ford into their very hands. Three pulls from eager arms, and the two combatants, dripping and pale, were dragged up the bank, and lay panting upon the grass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Caleb," [...] {{replied the}} Master, [...] "help me {{on with my}} cloak, and hand me my <b>sword-belt.</b> What clatter {{is that in the}} courtyard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Serviteur, madame!" [...] And, {{buckling}} his <b>sword-belt</b> as he went, {{he swept}} out, leaving the door wide open, Belmont following, Wentworth saluting and the guards presenting arms.|$|E
60|$|The Turks then rose, {{tied the}} legs of the {{sergeant}} with his own <b>sword-belt,</b> lest he should recover inopportunely, and bore him to a neighbouring thicket which loomed darkly through the fog.|$|E
60|$|Such a personage {{was not to}} be {{received}} in deshabille. Her dignity and the dignity of the archbishop demanded that the gate should be served in full costume. For half an hour, therefore, had the princess to wait, in feverish impatience, until the two dignitaries of the porter's lodge arrayed themselves; and three o'clock sounded from the tower of Notre Dame before they came forth. They were in grand livery, of a buff color, with amaranth galloons, plaited with silver, and fringed <b>sword-belts</b> reaching to their knees, in which were suspended long rapiers. They had small three-cornered hats, surmounted with plumes; and each bore in his hand a halbert. Thus equipped at all points, they planted themselves before the door of the carriage; struck the ends of their halberts on the ground with emphasis; and stood waiting with official importance, but profound respect, to know the pleasure of the princess.|$|R
6000|$|Reservery {{and general}} militarismus (as the Germans call it) were rampant. A camp of conical white tents without the town {{looked like a}} leaf out of a picture Bible; <b>sword-belts</b> {{decorated}} {{the walls of the}} cafés, and the streets kept sounding all day long with military music. It was not possible to be an Englishman and avoid a feeling of elation; for the men who followed the drums were small, and walked shabbily. Each man inclined at his own angle, and jolted to his own convenience, as he went. There was nothing of the superb gait with which a regiment of tall Highlanders moves behind its music, solemn and inevitable, like a natural phenomenon. Who that has seen it can forget the drum-major pacing in front, the drummers' tiger-skins, the pipers' swinging plaids, the strange elastic rhythm of the whole regiment footing it in time--and the bang of the drum, when the brasses cease, and the shrill pipes take up the martial story in their place? ...|$|R
60|$|They were of all ages, from greybeards down to lads scarce out {{of their}} teens, all with the same solemn and austere {{expression}} of countenance, and clad in the same homely and sombre garb. Save their wide white collars and cuffs, not a string of any colour lessened the sad severity of their attire. Their black coats and doublets were cut straight and close, and their cordovan leather shoes, which {{in the days of}} our youth were usually the seat of some little ornament, were uniformly square toed and tied with sad-coloured ribbon. Most of them wore plain <b>sword-belts</b> of untanned hide, but the weapons themselves, with their broad felt hats and black cloaks, were laid under the benches or placed upon the settles which lined the walls. They stood with their hands clasped and their heads bent, listening to the untimely address, and occasionally by some groan or exclamation testifying that the preacher's words had moved them.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast Dinah {{washed his}} shirt, his white nankeen trousers, and jacket, and, {{as he had}} not a red sash to wind round his waist, he took the {{ornaments}} and slings from his <b>sword-belt</b> and put this on.|$|E
60|$|Having {{finished}} the lesson, the little old woman retired {{to a remote}} part of the palace which, through Hafrydda's influence, {{had been assigned to}} her, and the great northern chief, unbuckling his <b>sword-belt,</b> called lustily for his mid-day meal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're a janius,' said Horse Egan. 'O' coorse {{she will}} not. I wish this crool {{war was over}} an' we'd get back to canteen. Faith, the Commander- in-Chief ought to be hanged in his own little <b>sword-belt</b> for makin' us work on wather.' ...|$|E
50|$|Based on literary, archaeological {{and genetic}} studies, {{it appears that}} those {{depicted}} were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture. The name {{of some of those}} portrayed are known from inscriptions, they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions. One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term grammatike (γραμματική). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to Girton College, Cambridge, the first residential college for women in Britain), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show <b>sword-belts</b> or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.|$|R
6000|$|Fancy, now, this {{transcendental}} divine {{standing behind}} a gun-carriage on the main-deck, and addressing five hundred salt-sea sinners upon the psychological phenomena of the soul, and the ontological necessity of every sailor's saving {{it at all}} hazards. He enlarged upon the follies of the ancient philosophers; learnedly alluded to the Phiedon of Plato; exposed the follies of Simplicius's Commentary on Aristotle's [...] "De Coelo," [...] by arraying against that clever Pagan author the admired tract of Tertullian--De Prascriptionibus Haereticorum--and concluded by a Sanscrit invocation. He was particularly hard upon the Gnostics and Marcionites of the second century of the Christian era; but he never, in the remotest manner, attacked the everyday vices of the nineteenth century, as eminently illustrated in our man-of-war world. Concerning drunkenness, fighting, flogging, and oppression--things expressly or impliedly prohibited by Christianity--he never said aught. But the most mighty Commodore and Captain sat before him; and in general, if, in a monarchy, the state form the audience of the church, little evangelical piety will be preached. Hence, the harmless, non-committal abstrusities of our Chaplain {{were not to be}} wondered at. He was no Massillon, to thunder forth his ecclesiastical rhetoric, even when a Louis le Grand was enthroned among his congregation. Nor did the chaplains who preached on the quarter-deck of Lord Nelson ever allude to the guilty Felix, nor to Delilah, nor practically reason of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, when that renowned Admiral sat, <b>sword-belted,</b> before them.|$|R
50|$|Uniform {{differed}} {{depending on}} rank, as corporals wore a yellow lace {{around the top}} of the coat cuffs. That of sergeants was quite similar, but made of higher quality material, having an inch-wide stripe of gold lace edging the cuffs and pocket flaps. Sergeants wore a grey-white uniform with a red lining and red stockings. This was very specific to the Compagnies franches de la Marine at this time. They also carried halberds, a tradition which was to be found across Europe. Two gold lace stripes were worn on the cuffs and pocket slaps of sergeant-majors. Common soldiers wore a grey-white uniform lined and faced with blue. This was also a very distinctive colour of the Troupes de la Marine. Their hats were trimmed with imitation gold braid, which was a blend of brass wire and yellow cord. This difference in materials demarked the lesser ranking of the soldier. In terms of weapons, they carried a musket, bayonet, and a sword. Drummers wore the King's small livery or insignia. Their blue coat had brass buttons and red cuffs and lining. Although similar to the uniform of a private soldier, it was heavily ornamented along the seams and buttonholes with the King's livery lace, featuring white chain on a crimson ground. Their waistcoat, breeches, and stockings were also red. Buff <b>sword-belts</b> and drum slings were bordered with livery lace, while the blue drum shells were spread with fleur-de-lis. Drummers a rank above wore the great livery, which only distinguished itself through the red triangles on white ground that appeared between the strips of livery lace.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} {{carefully}} noticed by Lord Glenvarloch, who, as he adjusted his cloak, and drew his <b>sword-belt</b> round {{so as to}} bring the hilt closer to his hand, muttered--"Dalgarno shall explain all this to me, for {{it is evident that}} he is in the secret!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{put us on}} the viva voce--particularly when we {{understood}} how the owner was navigatin' abroad in his <b>sword-belt</b> trustin' us like brothers.

6000|$|... "I will go as a spectator," [...] he said. Removing his <b>sword-belt</b> {{and taking}} the pistols from his {{holsters}} he handed them to his servant, who took them back to headquarters. I realized the brutality of my remark, but not clearly seeing my way to an apology, said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hilda, wilt thou {{manage to}} lead Glumm aside and keep {{talking to him}} for a short time, while I speak with Erling? I want to ask him {{something}} about that <b>sword-belt</b> which I am making for Glumm, and which I intend to send him as the gift of an enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is poor comfort {{when you}} are starved to know that another {{is in the same}} plight. I give you my word, Micah, I took in one hole of my <b>sword-belt</b> on Monday, two on Tuesday, one yesterday, and one to-day. I tell you, I am thawing like an icicle in the sun.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so!" [...] said Leonard. [...] "Up in the morn {{hours before the}} sun, to mass like a choir of novices, to clean our own arms and the Knight's, like so many horse-boys, and if there be but a speck of rust, or a <b>sword-belt</b> half a finger's length awry--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And hardly that," [...] Terence laughed, [...] "for the {{adjutant}} {{was down}} upon you pretty sharply; your coatee was all buttoned up wrong; your hair {{had not been}} brushed, and stuck up all ways below your shako; your <b>sword-belt</b> was all awry, and you looked worse than you did when I brought you home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is {{what will}} be very welcome," [...] said the Captain, [...] "for I have tasted no food since daybreak but a farl of oatcake, which I divided with my horse. So I have been fain to draw my <b>sword-belt</b> three bores tighter for very extenuation, lest hunger and heavy iron should make the gird slip." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{little effort}} Halbert Glendinning forced {{himself through the}} opening thus wonderfully effected, and using his leathern <b>sword-belt</b> as a rope to assist him, let himself safely drop on the shelf of rock upon which the preacher's window opened. But through this no passage could be effected, being scarce larger than a loop-hole for musketry, and {{apparently}} constructed for that purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, though I had her heart, {{her father}} was set upon her marrying Barclay. I was a harum-scarum, {{reckless}} lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the <b>sword-belt.</b> But the girl held true to me, {{and it seemed that}} I would have had her when the Mutiny broke out, and all hell was loose in the country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Check and mate, my lord Cardinal," [...] he said drily, {{as he took}} {{advantage}} of His Eminence's absence of mind to bring the game to a successful close. Then he rose to go. He was already booted and spurred for his journey northwards, and had unhitched his <b>sword-belt</b> when settling down to play. Whilst he was buckling it on again, Don Miguel approached him.|$|E
60|$|Saxon began {{forthwith}} to undo his buckles and to {{pull off}} his harness, while Reuben, throwing himself into a chair, appeared to be too weary {{to do more than}} unfasten his <b>sword-belt.</b> For my own part, I was glad to throw off my gear, but I kept my attention all the while upon the movements of our host, whose graceful manners and learned appearance had aroused my curiosity and admiration.|$|E
