The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research {{in the areas of}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>technology</b> and agriculture. As an example of Cradle to Cradle Design, it uses solar-powered dormitories, aquaculture ponds, and organic gardens while providing an environmentally-sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students. In 2010, with the installation of a 210,000kW hours CPV system by Amonix, the center became the first carbon neutral facility in the California State University system. The center is part of Agriscapes, a [...] research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food, conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste. Agriscapes is home of the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch which sells locally and campus grown foods and products. The Cal Poly campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse, a California ethnobotany garden, and an aquatic biology center collectively known as BioTrek, which provides environmental education to all academic levels.|$|E
500|$|At the Beecher's facility, their {{process for}} cheese {{manufacturing}} is multi-staged. Thousands {{of gallons of}} milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and rennet, a coagulant, {{are added to the}} developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the <b>sustainable</b> <b>technology</b> of steam power. [...] "A variation of half a degree [...] can change the flavor of the cheese," [...] he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel [...] "rakes" [...] to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into cheese molds, stacked on top of each other, and the remaining excess moisture is forced from the cheese with a constant [...] of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age. For every 10 pounds (10 kilograms) of milk and whey, Beecher's will typically create 1 pound (1 kilogram) of finished cheese.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Sustainable waste management {{is one of the}} biggest environmental challenges facing the United Kingdom (UK). European and national legislation is beginning to require a fundamental shift from waste disposal - predominantly landfill in the UK - to a more integrated style of resource management involving <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> that deliver waste minimisation, re-use, recycling and composting. Although these principles have underpinned the development of national waste strategies for a number of years, successive regulatory and economic measures have so far failed to deliver. Many recycling and composting technologies are well established overseas, but with a recycling rate around 12 per cent, their uptake in the UK remains marginal. The main problem is not the development of appropriate systems and technologies, but the factors affecting their uptake. Developing <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Technologies</b> for Waste: Improving Uptake through Partnership, 2004 - 2006 aims to investigate the potential for multi-agent partnerships between local authorities, local/small businesses, and the community sector for developing and delivering public policy and <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies.</b> The study identifies local authorities as key players in waste management. The case studies used are based in different Local Authority boundaries. The study is part of the <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Technologies</b> Programme (STP) which is a major research initiative by the ESRC. It funds innovative and policy-relevant research on the social and economic processes that shape, foster or inhibit more <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies.</b> More information can be found at the <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Technologies</b> Programme web page.

40|$|Fulltext in: [URL] {{the design}} and {{construction}} of sustainable retail buildings, there are various stakeholders involved with the overall aim of selecting appropriate <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Previous studies and literature review indicate there is no comprehensive selection process to assist stakeholders. This can be classified as a complex multi-criteria decision problem due to {{the high number of}} alternatives, potential solutions and variety of stakeholders (e. g. clients, professional advisors, end-users) with multiple, often conflicting, objectives leading in turn to the slow take-up of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies.</b> There is a demand for a systematic and effective evaluation tool for the selection of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> based on the needs of stakeholders. This paper is part of an on-going study to develop a decision making system to assist stakeholders in the selection process and aims to establish the decision criteria for the selection of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> for existing retail buildings based on the clients' (retailers') perspective. The arguments are informed by a combination of literature review and an in-depth case study with a leading construction company in the UK. The data collected was both qualitative (establishing and verifying decision criteria) and quantitative (establishing weightings and priorities). Five broad decision criteria currently used by clients in the selection of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> to achieve reductions in energy and carbon were established (i. e. cost, time, proven success of technology, risk and sustainability). Using AHP survey and expert opinions, the identified criteria were weighted and ranked, with risk (37 %) being the most important, followed by cost (22 %), proven success (20 %) and time (12 %), and sustainability (9 %) the least important factor. Although the established criteria would be most relevant for the selection of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> for existing retail buildings, it will also be beneficial for new build retail buildings and be transferable to other types of buildings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. When individuals consider the adoption of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies,</b> they engage with an increasingly complex decision-making process. It was the contention of this research project {{that in order to}} develop promotional strategies that can raise the adoption rates of <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies,</b> researchers must understand real decision-making processes in all their complexity. This research therefore attempted to capture the decision-making process in great detail, paying particular attention to criteria that people regard as important and how they make trade-offs between these criteria, and the types and sources of information that people consult as part of this process. The overall aims of the project were to investigate individual decision-making for <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies</b> at a micro level, and to understand the trade-offs in decision-making for <b>sustainable</b> <b>technologies.</b> Main Topics : The dataset includes 80 qualitative interviews with self-selecting 'ethical consumers' on the decision-making process employed when purchasing their last two or more technological products, e. g. car, fridge, computer, etc. The interviews covered selection of the items and criteria used, whether sales advice was sought, where the item was purchased from, and experiences after purchase...|$|R
