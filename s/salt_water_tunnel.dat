40|$|The {{ability of}} West Indian {{manatees}} (Trichechus manatus) to move between fresh and <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> {{raises the question}} of whether manatees drink <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> Water turnover rates were estimated in captive West Indian manatees using the deuterium oxide dilution technique. Rates were quantified in animals using four experimental treatments: (1) held in fresh water and fed lettuce (N= 4), (2) held in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce (N= 2), (3) acutely exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce (N= 4), and (4) chronically exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> with limited access to fresh water and fed sea grass (N= 5). Animals held in fresh water had the highest turnover rates (145 +/- 12 ml kg- 1 day- 1) (mean +/- s. e. m.). Animals acutely exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> decreased their turnover rate significantly when moved into <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> (from 124 +/- 15 to 65 +/- 15 ml kg- 1 day- 1) and subsequently increased their turnover rate upon re-entry to fresh water (146 +/- 19 ml kg- 1 day- 1). Manatees chronically exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> had significantly lower turnover rates (21 +/- 3 ml kg- 1 day- 1) compared with animals held in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce (45 +/- 3 ml kg- 1 day- 1). Manatees chronically exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed sea grass had very low turnover rates compared with manatees held in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce, which is consistent with a lack of mariposia.

An increase in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion is considered as problematic in a lot of estuaries in the world. Various solutions are developed in the past to reduce <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion. These solutions have also negative side effects. An alternative developed idea is to prevent increases in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion by the creation of islands in the outer delta. However it is unknown if it is possible to reduce <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion by the creation of these islands and how effective it will be. In this study three kind of outer-delta bottom topography adaptations are studied on their effect on <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion in estuaries. One of the considered adaptations is the creation of an island. The effectiveness is determined with model simulations of an estuary in the Mekong delta in Vietnam. Is it possible to reduce <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion with outer-delta bottom topography adaptations? And which aspects are responsible for a changed <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion distance?

40|$|A <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> is {{a device}} used in {{hydraulic}} research and design studies {{for the purpose}} of observing the relative motion between a solid body and a liquid and the effect which this motion has on the body. Its basic function is the production of a test stream of water of uniform and controllable pressure and velocity in which solid bodies can be supported under varying conditions. The free-jet type of <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> has a test stream which, ideally, is surrounded by a gaseous medium and which, practically, has only a partial solid-contact boundary required to permit observation of the interior of the stream. This type of tunnel thus differs from conventional <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> such as the closed-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which has a test stream completely surrounded by a solid-contact surface, and the open-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which has a test stream surrounded by water and which thus resembles a submerged jet. The essentially unbounded nature of the test stream of the free-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> permits deformation of the test stream and avoids formation of adverse pressure and velocity gradients which form in conventional <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> because of gravitational effects and boundary layer formation; the result is that in the free-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> natural cavitation about solid bodies in the test stream can be studied at lower cavitation indices and with less influence due to the finite extent of the test stream than is possible in conventional tunnels.

In this paper, {{the aging}} of an epoxy {{adhesive}} {{which is used to}} aluminum- aluminum composite joints in medium was studied by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scan electronic microscope (SEM) and shear strength test. In <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> Na and Cl can accelerate hydrolyzation of the adhesive and enhance water ingress ability in the adhesive. Shear strength tests indicate that the durability of the adhesive in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> aging is lower than that in water.

40|$|Oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are {{experimental}} facilities {{commonly used}} in coastal engineering research. They are intended to reproduce near-bed hydrodynamic and sediment transport phenomena at a realistic scale. In an oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a piston generates an oscillatory motion that propagates almost instantaneously to the whole tunnel; consequently, flow is uniform along the tunnel, unlike the propagating wave motion in the sea or in a wave flume. This results in subtle differences between the boundary-layer hydrodynamics of an oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> and of a propagating wave, which may {{have a significant effect}} in the resulting sediment transport. In this paper, we present a zeroth-order analytical model of the turbulent boundary-layer hydrodynamics in an oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel.</b> By using a time-varying eddy viscosity and by accounting for the constraints arising from the tunnel's geometry, the model predicts the oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> hydrodynamics and yields analytical expressions to compute bed shear stresses for asymmetric and skewed waves, both in the absence or presence of an imposed current. These expressions are applied to successfully quantify bedload sediment transport in oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> experiments.

In the Baltic Sea, the input of <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> from the North Sea through the Danish Straits is important in determining the area of hypoxia each year. Denser, saltier water comes into the Baltic Sea and flows along the bottom. Although large <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> inputs help to renew the bottom waters and increase oxygen concentrations, the new oxygen added with the <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> inflow is rapidly used to decompose organic matter {{that is in the}} sediments. The denser <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> also reduces mixing of oxygen poor bottom waters with more brackish, lighter surface waters.
