500|$|Portal was {{the first}} Valve-developed game {{to be added to}} the OS X-compatible list of games {{available}} on the launch of the Steam client for Mac on May 12, 2010, supporting Steam Play, in which players that had bought the game either on a Macintosh or Windows computer could also play it on the alternate system. As part of the promotion, Portal was offered as a free title for any Steam user during the two weeks following the Mac client's launch. Within the first week of this offer, over 1.5 million copies of the game were downloaded through Steam. A similar promotion was held in September 2011, near the start of a traditional school year, encouraging the use of the game as an educational tool for science and mathematics. Valve wrote that they felt that Portal [...] "makes physics, math, logic, <b>spatial</b> <b>reasoning,</b> probability, and problem-solving interesting, cool, and fun", a necessary feature to draw children into learning. This was tied to Digital Promise, a United States Department of Education initiative to help develop new digital tools for education, and which Valve is part of.|$|E

40|$|The World Wide Web {{provides}} {{new opportunities}} for collecting information from distributed, multiple, and heterogeneous data sources. Information brokering {{can be used to}} provide coordinated access to these sources if they are structured or semi-structured. The BUSTER (Bremen University Semantic Translator for Enhanced Retrieval) approach provides enabling technologies for information search and integration and can be seen as an information broker. However, {{it is not possible to}} represent and reason about spatial objects. In this paper, we motivate the need for the integration of <b>spatial</b> representation and <b>reasoning.</b> We start with information brokering in general and proceed with a brief overview of BUSTER. In the following, use cases are defined that demand certain representations and reasoning methods and give examples for these cases. We discuss gazetteers as an example of seeking spatial objects and discuss shortcomings of this approach. We conclude with a new concept for an extension of BUSTER with explicit representations of <b>spatial</b> concepts and <b>reasoning</b> mechanisms that can be applied in order to support spatial information brokering.

Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested.
