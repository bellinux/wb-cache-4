5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual <b>scaling</b> <b>exponent</b> of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{disagree}} {{about the two}} main aspects of this theory, the pattern and the mechanism. [...] The primary pattern in question is whether metabolic rate scales {{to the power of}} ¾ or ⅔w, or whether either of these can even be considered a universal constant. [...] The majority view is currently that ¾ is the correct exponent, but a large minority believe that ⅔ is the more accurate value. In addition to disagreeing about the pattern, researchers also {{disagree about}} mechanism. Various authors have proposed at least eight different types of mechanisms that predict an allometric <b>scaling</b> <b>exponent</b> of either ⅔ or ¾. Some of these models make a large number of testable predictions while others are less comprehensive.|$|E

That is, scaling by a {{constant}} [...] simply multiplies the original power-law relation {{by the constant}} [...] Thus, it follows that all power laws with a particular <b>scaling</b> <b>exponent</b> are equivalent up to constant factors, since each is simply a scaled version of the others. This behavior is what produces the linear relationship when logarithms are taken of both [...] and , and the straight-line on the log–log plot is often called the signature of a power law. With real data, such straightness is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the data following a power-law relation. In fact, {{there are many ways}} to generate finite amounts of data that mimic this signature behavior, but, in their asymptotic limit, are not true power laws (e.g., if the generating process of some data follows a Log-normal distribution). Thus, accurately fitting and validating power-law models is an active area of research in statistics; see below.|$|E
2500|$|The {{equivalence}} {{of power}} laws {{with a particular}} <b>scaling</b> <b>exponent</b> can have a deeper origin in the dynamical processes that generate the power-law relation. In physics, for example, phase transitions in thermodynamic systems {{are associated with the}} emergence of power-law distributions of certain quantities, whose exponents are referred to as the critical exponents of the system. Diverse systems with the same critical exponents—that is, which display identical scaling behaviour as they approach criticality—can be shown, via renormalization group theory, to share the same fundamental dynamics. For instance, the behavior of water and CO2 at their boiling points fall in the same universality class because they have identical critical exponents. In fact, almost all material phase transitions are described by a small set of universality classes. Similar observations have been made, though not as comprehensively, for various self-organized critical systems, where the critical point of the system is an attractor. [...] Formally, this sharing of dynamics is referred to as universality, and systems with precisely the same critical exponents are said to belong to the same universality class.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} is the scale dependence of water vapor variability as observed by remote sensing and in situ measurements, and predicted by aqua-planet simulation. Global observations of the water vapor field from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are used {{to show that the}} first order structure function of the water vapor field exhibits power law behavior for scales between 50 km and 500 km throughout much of the troposphere. The power law <b>scaling</b> <b>exponents</b> are shown to vary between the boundary layer and free troposphere, with first order structure function <b>scaling</b> <b>exponents</b> of approximately 1 / 3 in the boundary layer and less than 1 / 2 in the free troposphere.

40|$|Developmental {{constraints}} and selective pressures interact {{to determine the}} strength of allometric scaling relationships between body size {{and the size of}} morphological traits among related species. Different traits are expected to relate to body size with different <b>scaling</b> <b>exponents,</b> depending on how their function changes disproportionately with increasing body size. For trematodes parasitic in vertebrate guts, the risk of being dislodged should increase disproportionately with body size, whereas basic physiological functions are more likely to increase in proportion to changes in body size. Allometric <b>scaling</b> <b>exponents</b> for attachment structures should thus be higher than those for other structures and should be higher for trematode families using endothermic hosts than for those using ectotherms, given the feeding and digestive characteristics of these hosts.

Sizes of four morphological structures were investigated, two associated with attachment (oral and ventral suckers) and the other two with feeding and reproduction (pharynx and cirrus sac).
