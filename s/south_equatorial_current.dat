50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Currents</b> of the Atlantic and Pacific {{straddle}} the equator. Though the Coriolis {{effect is}} weak near the equator (and absent at the equator), water {{moving in the}} currents {{on either side of}} the equator is deflected slightly poleward and replaced by deeper water. Thus, equatorial upwelling occurs in these westward flowing <b>equatorial</b> surface <b>currents.</b> Upwelling is an important process because this water from within and below the pycnocline is often rich in nutrients and greatly benefits the growth of marine organisms. By contrast, generally poor conditions for growth prevail in most of the open tropical ocean because strong layering isolates deep, nutrient rich water from the sunlit ocean surface. Surface currents make up only 8% of all water in the ocean, are generally restricted to the upper 400 m of ocean water, and are separated from lower regions by varying temperatures and salinity which affect the density of the water, which in turn, defines each oceanic region. Because the movement of deep water in ocean basins is caused by density driven forces and gravity, deep waters sink into deep ocean basins at high latitudes where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase.|$|R

All products employ the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Oceans model, and the ORAs share very similar configurations. The ORA basin interior transports are consistently modified relative to the FRMs, especially in the Argo period, with an improved representation of the <b>south</b> <b>equatorial</b> <b>currents.</b> The ORAs also exhibit systematically higher meridional transports than the FRMs, in closer agreement with large-scale observational estimates at 35 ˚S and western boundary measurements at 11 ˚S. However, the transport impacts by data assimilation still greatly vary between the ORAs, leading to differences up to ~ 8 Sv and 0. 4 PW in the South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the Meridional Heat Transports (MHTs), respectively. Large inter-product discrepancies arise in the ORA western boundary currents at both upper and deep levels explaining up to ~ 85 % of the inter-product differences in their total MHTs, and meridional velocity differences, rather than temperatures differences, drive ~ 83 % of this spread. Further analysis shows that only very confined temperature differences right against the western boundary geostrophically explain the large boundary current velocity differences.

The Agulhas Current is a root cause of these sporadic conditions. Along the South African coast, near Madagascar, the oceanic current, when mixed with a cold front, can cause freak waves that can destroy ships. This current is the largest current to follow adjacent to a continent for that distance. Being on the border of the Indian Ocean gyre, the intense ranges of water temperatures can result in major storms. Tropical storms that have turned into recorded cyclones, have caused billions of dollars worth of damages. Each cyclone originally forming from the north-eastern coast of the African continent, and slowly accumulating down the coast, where its energy accumulates the most. The storms that result from combining warm and cold temperatures have a huge affect in the northern region of the Agulhas Current. [...] As it goes down the continent of Africa, the atmosphere becomes warmer, and the weather mellows out into a steady rainfall, giving South Africa and West Madagascar humidity and storms. Another factor contributing to weather conditions in the South African- Madagascar region is the contribution of the <b>South</b> <b>Equatorial</b> Madagascar <b>Current.</b> This particular current travels westward from the Indian ocean, hitting the east coast of Madagascar. This can be a challenge for ships traveling on the east coast of Madagascar because instead of being able to follow the oceans strong general current, they would have to fight it, no matter which way they were traveling. As the SEMC continues <b>South</b> <b>Equatorial</b> Madagascar <b>Current</b> hits Madagascar, the current changes position southward, where it meets up with the stronger Agulhas current, creating conflicting currents that can be a huge hassle for anyone trying to navigate those waters.|$|R

The highest fCO(2) (655 mu atm) was measured in the eastern Coastal upwelling. However, area of low fCO(2) are also observed. Those occurred north of 2 degrees N, in the Guinea Current, and near 6 degrees S close to the coast due to the Congo River discharge. The decrease of salinity is a major factor explaining low fCO(2). In the <b>South</b> <b>Equatorial</b> Counter <b>Current</b> region, <b>south</b> of 6 degrees S near 10 degrees W, low fCO(2) are not related to a salinity effect as this region is subject to excess evaporation. A comparison with the meridional transects of the RMS St Helena made in 1995 - 1996 near 15 degrees W suggests that these low ICO 2 or even slight undersaturations can be observed from about 4 degrees S to 10 degrees S. it seems that they occur mainly in boreal summer. They could be caused by transport of water that has been in contact with the atmosphere long enough to come close to equilibrium. The low fCO(2) area are not reproduced by the CO 2 climatology probably because of the coarse resolution and the lack of data in this region. Despite the low fCO(7) area observed in 2006, the Delta fCO(2) in 2006 is higher than the 1995 climatology for the region 10 degrees S- 2 degrees N, 10 degrees W- 10 degrees E suggesting that fCO(2) is increasing over time but from the few cruises available, it is difficult to definitely conclude...|$|R
