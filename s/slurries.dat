A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E

40|$|A <b>slurry</b> system draws <b>slurry</b> from a <b>slurry</b> tank via one {{of several}} intake pipes, where each pipe has an intake opening at a {{different}} depth in the <b>slurry.</b> The <b>slurry</b> is returned to the <b>slurry</b> tank via a bypass pipe {{in order to continue}} the agitation of the <b>slurry.</b> The <b>slurry</b> is then diverted to a delivery pipe, which supplies <b>slurry</b> to a polisher. The flow of shiny in the bypass pipe is stopped in order for the <b>slurry</b> in the <b>slurry</b> tank to begin to settle. As the polishing continues, <b>slurry</b> is removed from shallower depths in order to pull finer grit from the <b>slurry.</b> When the polishing is complete, the flow in the delivery pipe is ceased. The flow of <b>slurry</b> in the bypass pipe is resumed to start agitating the <b>slurry.</b> In another embodiment, the multiple intake pipes are replaced by a single adjustable pipe.

40|$|In this study, <b>slurry</b> {{availability}} {{and the extent}} of the <b>slurry</b> mixing (i. e., among fresh <b>slurry,</b> spent <b>slurry,</b> and residual rinse-water) were varied via three different injection schemes. An ultraviolet enhanced fluorescence technique was employed to qualitatively indicate <b>slurry</b> {{availability and}} its flow on the pad during polishing. This study investigated standard pad center area <b>slurry</b> application and a <b>slurry</b> injection system (SIS) that covered only the outer half of the wafer track. Results indicated that the radial position of <b>slurry</b> injection and the alteration of fluid mechanics by the SIS played important roles in <b>slurry</b> mixing characteristics and availability atop the pad. Removal rates were found to decrease with <b>slurry</b> availability, while a higher degree of <b>slurry</b> mixing decreased the fraction of fresh <b>slurry</b> and consequently lowered the removal rate. By using a hybrid system (i. e., a combination of <b>slurry</b> injection via SIS and standard pad center <b>slurry</b> application), the polishing process benefited from higher <b>slurry</b> availability and higher fraction of fresh <b>slurry</b> than the conventional pad center <b>slurry</b> application and the shorter SIS, individually.

25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable <b>slurries,</b> high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
