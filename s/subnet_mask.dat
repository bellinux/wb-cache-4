25|$|The {{result of}} the bitwise AND {{operation}} of IP address and the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> is the network prefix 192.168.5.0. The host part, which is 130, is derived by the bitwise AND operation of the address and the one's complement of the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{routing prefix}} of an address is {{identified}} by using another address, called the network mask or <b>subnet</b> <b>mask,</b> {{written in a}} form identical {{to that of the}} address itself. For example, the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> for a routing prefix that is composed of the most-significant 18 bits of an IPv4 address is written as 11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000 in binary, or as 255.255.192.0 in decimal notation. This form of denoting the network mask, however, is only used for IPv4 networks.|$|E
25|$|A /24 network may {{be divided}} into the {{following}} subnets by increasing the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> successively by one bit. This affects {{the total number of}} hosts that can be addressed in the /24 network (last column).|$|E
5000|$|Variable Length <b>Subnet</b> <b>Masks</b> are not {{supported}} by RIP version 1 (which is obsolete).|$|R
50|$|Classless Inter-Domain Routing {{is based}} on variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masking</b> (VLSM), which allows a network to be divided into {{variously}} sized subnets, providing the opportunity to size a network more appropriately for local needs. Variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masks</b> are mentioned in RFC 950. Accordingly, techniques for grouping addresses for common operations {{were based on the}} concept of cluster addressing, first proposed by Carl-Herbert Rokitansky.|$|R
5000|$|Prefix-Length: where longer <b>subnet</b> <b>masks</b> are {{preferred}} (independent if it {{is within}} a routing protocol or over different routing protocol) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{remaining}} bits {{after the}} subnet bits {{are used for}} addressing hosts within the subnet. In the above example the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> consists of 26 bits, leaving 6 bits for the host identifier. This allows for 62 host combinations (26−2).|$|E
25|$|For IPv4, {{a network}} {{may also be}} {{characterized}} by its <b>subnet</b> <b>mask,</b> which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address. For example, 255.255.255.0 is the network mask for the 192.168.1.0/24 prefix.|$|E
2500|$|Subnetting is {{the process}} of {{designating}} some high-order bits from the host part and grouping them with the network mask to form the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask.</b> This divides a network into smaller subnets. The following diagram modifies the example by moving 2 bits from the host part to the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> to form four smaller subnets one quarter the previous size: ...|$|E
5000|$|Support for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) and {{variable}} length <b>subnet</b> <b>masking.</b> Routes are not summarized at the classful network boundary unless auto summary is enabled.|$|R
50|$|Wildcard {{masks are}} used in {{situations}} where <b>subnet</b> <b>masks</b> may not apply. For example, when two affected hosts fall in different subnets, {{the use of a}} wildcard mask will group them together.|$|R
50|$|Networks with <b>subnet</b> <b>masks</b> of {{at least}} 24 bits, i.e. Class C {{networks}} in classful networking, and networks with CIDR suffixes /24 to /32 (255.255.255.0-255.255.255.255) may not have an address ending in 0 or 255.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{link state}} routing protocol, OSPF {{establishes}} and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an adjacency database. Two OSPF routers are neighbors {{if they are}} members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, <b>subnet</b> <b>mask,</b> timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information – the only packets they exchange are Hello packets. [...] OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if {{at least one of them}} is Designated Router or Backup Designated Router (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.|$|E
50|$|At {{a simplistic}} level a {{wildcard}} mask {{can be thought}} of as an inverted <b>subnet</b> <b>mask.</b> For example, a <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> of 255.255.255.0 (binary equivalent = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) inverts to a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255.|$|E
50|$|IGRP is {{considered}} a classful routing protocol. Because the protocol has no field for a <b>subnet</b> <b>mask,</b> the router assumes that all subnetwork addresses within the same Class A, Class B, or Class C network have the same <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> as the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> configured for the interfaces in question. This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use variable length subnet masks. Classful protocols have become less popular as they are wasteful of IP address space.|$|E
50|$|Since its discontinuation, {{remnants}} of classful network concepts remain in practice only in limited scope in the default configuration parameters of some network {{software and hardware}} components, most notably in the default configuration of <b>subnet</b> <b>masks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subnetting in IPv6 {{is based}} on the {{concepts}} of variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masking</b> (VLSM) and the Classless Inter-Domain Routing methodology. It is used to route traffic between the global allocation spaces and within customer networks between subnets and the Internet at large.|$|R
50|$|Network {{management}} allows defining multiple VLANs {{that can}} be bridged to the network interfaces available on the nodes. Configuration of bonded interfaces, IP addresses, <b>subnet</b> <b>masks</b> and gateways on managed nodes are all supported within webadmin portal interface, as is SR-IOV on hardware configurations that support this feature.|$|R
50|$|A <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> is a bitmask that encodes the prefix size in quad-dotted notation: 32 bits, {{starting}} {{with a number of}} 1 bits equal to the prefix size, ending with 0 bits, and encoded in four-part dotted-decimal format: 255.255.255.0. A <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> encodes the same information as a prefix size, but predates the advent of CIDR. In CIDR notation, the prefix bits are always contiguous, whereas subnet masks may specify non-contiguous bits. However, since IP addresses are almost always allocated in contiguous blocks, a <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> has no practical advantage over CIDR notation.|$|E
50|$|On an Internet Protocol (IP) network, clients should {{automatically}} send IP packets with {{a destination}} outside a given <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> {{to a network}} gateway. A <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> defines the IP range of a private network. For example, if a private network has a base IP address of 192.168.0.0 and has a <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> of 255.255.255.0, then any data going to an IP address outside of 192.168.0.X {{will be sent to}} that network's gateway. While forwarding an IP packet to another network, the gateway might or might not perform Network Address Translation.|$|E
50|$|The {{summarized}} {{route is}} 192.168.96.0/20. The <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> is 255.255.240.0.|$|E
25|$|RFC 3021 {{specifies}} {{an exception}} to this rule for 31-bit <b>subnet</b> <b>masks,</b> which means the host identifier is only one bit long for two permissible addresses. In such networks, usually point-to-point links, only two hosts (the end points) may be connected and a specification of network and broadcast addresses is not necessary.|$|R
50|$|Both IS-IS and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) are {{link state}} protocols, and both {{use the same}} Dijkstra {{algorithm}} for computing the best path through the network. As a result, they are conceptually similar. Both support variable length <b>subnet</b> <b>masks,</b> can use multicast to discover neighboring routers using hello packets, and can support authentication of routing updates.|$|R
50|$|Classful network design served {{its purpose}} in the startup stage of the Internet, but it lacked {{scalability}} {{in the face of}} the rapid expansion of the network in the 1990s. The class system of the address space was replaced with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masking</b> (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes.|$|R
50|$|The {{broadcast}} address for an IPv4 host {{can be obtained}} by performing a bitwise OR operation between the bit complement of the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> and the host's IP address. In other words, take the host's IP address, and set to '1' any bit positions which hold a '0' in the <b>subnet</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If {{the route}} is [...] "more specific" [...] than an {{existing}} route, install it {{in addition to}} the existing routes. [...] "More specific" [...] means that it has a longer prefix. A /28 route, with a <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> of 255.255.255.240, is more specific than a /24 route, with a <b>subnet</b> <b>mask</b> of 255.255.255.0.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{specification of}} RIP, defined in RFC 1058, {{was published in}} 1988 and uses classful routing. The periodic routing updates do not carry subnet information, lacking support for variable length <b>subnet</b> <b>masks</b> (VLSM). This limitation {{makes it impossible to}} have different-sized subnets inside of the same network class. In other words, all subnets in a network class must have the same size. There is also no support for router authentication, making RIP vulnerable to various attacks.|$|R
25|$|While {{subnetting}} {{may improve}} network performance in an organizational network, it increases routing complexity, since each locally connected subnet must {{be represented by}} a separate entry in the routing tables of each connected router. However, by careful design of the network, routes to collections of more distant subnets within {{the branches of a}} tree-hierarchy can be aggregated by single routes. Variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masking</b> (VLSM) functionality in commercial routers made the introduction of CIDR seamless across the Internet and in enterprise networks.|$|R
5000|$|Fuzzball routers {{were the}} first modern routers on the Internet. They were DEC LSI-11 {{computers}} loaded with the Fuzzball software written by David L. Mills (of the University of Delaware). The name [...] "Fuzzball" [...] was the colloquialism for Mills' routing software. Six Fuzzball routers provided the routing backbone of the first 56 kbit/s NSFnet, allowing the testing {{of many of the}} Internet's first protocols. It allowed the development of the first TCP/IP routing protocols, and the Network Time Protocol. They {{were the first}} routers to implement key refinements to TCP/IP like variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masks.</b>|$|R

50|$|CIDR {{encompasses}} several concepts. It {{is based}} on the variable-length <b>subnet</b> <b>masking</b> (VLSM) technique with effective qualities of specifying arbitrary-length prefixes. CIDR introduced a new method of representation for IP addresses, now commonly known as CIDR notation, in which an address or routing prefix is written with a suffix indicating the number of bits of the prefix, such as 192.168.2.0/24 for IPv4, and 2001:db8::/32 for IPv6. CIDR introduced an administrative process of allocating address blocks to organizations based on their actual and short-term projected needs. The aggregation of multiple contiguous prefixes resulted in supernets in the larger Internet, which whenever possible are advertised as aggregates, thus reducing the number of entries in the global routing table.|$|R
