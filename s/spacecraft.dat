5|$|Several Gemini Ferry <b>spacecraft</b> were {{proposed}} to provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini <b>spacecraft</b> to support this. Three <b>spacecraft</b> were envisioned; a manned <b>spacecraft</b> to transport crew to the stations, a manned <b>spacecraft</b> with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned <b>spacecraft</b> to resupply the station every three or four months.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the <b>spacecraft</b> over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific <b>spacecraft</b> systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the <b>spacecraft</b> around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the <b>spacecraft</b> attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the <b>spacecraft</b> to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived <b>spacecraft</b> were {{considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini <b>spacecraft,</b> with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The <b>spacecraft</b> would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the <b>spacecraft.</b> Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the <b>spacecraft,</b> where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned <b>spacecraft.</b> The <b>spacecraft</b> was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new <b>spacecraft</b> to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini <b>spacecraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost <b>spacecraft.</b> The two <b>spacecraft</b> (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the <b>spacecraft</b> took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the <b>spacecraft</b> and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II. He became a naval aviator in 1946, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected {{as one of the}} original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first manned Project Mercury flight, MR-3, in a <b>spacecraft</b> he named Freedom 7. His craft entered space, but did not achieve orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first person to manually control the orientation of his <b>spacecraft.</b> In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury <b>Spacecraft</b> 15B Freedom 7 II in honor of his first <b>spacecraft,</b> but the mission was cancelled.|$|E

50|$|The Beagle 2 fate {{remained}} a mystery until January 2015 {{when it was}} located intact {{on the surface of}} Mars in a series of images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE camera. The images suggest that two of the <b>spacecraft's</b> four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the <b>spacecraft's</b> communications antenna.|$|R
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the <b>spacecraft</b> and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the <b>spacecraft</b> moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the <b>spacecraft,</b> which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} Moon race there were years of near quietude but {{starting}} in the 1990s, many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon. In 1990, Japan became the third country to place a <b>spacecraft</b> into lunar orbit with its Hiten <b>spacecraft.</b> The <b>spacecraft</b> released a smaller probe, Hagoromo, in lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, preventing further scientific use of the mission. In 1994, the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department/NASA <b>spacecraft</b> Clementine to lunar orbit. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface. This was followed in 1998 by the Lunar Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, {{which is likely to}} have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the <b>spacecraft.</b> This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini <b>spacecraft</b> attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the <b>spacecraft</b> being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the <b>spacecraft</b> would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E

5|$|Transmission of many Ida images {{was delayed}} {{due to a}} {{permanent}} failure in the <b>spacecraft's</b> high-gain antenna. The first five images were received in September 1993. These comprised a high-resolution mosaic of the asteroid at a resolution of 31–38m/pixel. The remaining images were sent in February 1994, when the <b>spacecraft's</b> proximity to the Earth allowed higher speed transmissions.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1973, several <b>spacecraft</b> have {{performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both <b>spacecraft</b> managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these <b>spacecraft</b> were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} on the optimization of the trajectories {{and analysis of the}} evolution of the <b>spacecrafts</b> with electric rocket plants are investigated. The new numerical methods for optimization of the trajectories for the <b>spacecrafts</b> with propulsion systems of small traction of the continuation method type, characterizing with the widened convergence field have been constructed. The practical-regular method of trajectory optimization has been developed for case of the ideal-regulated propulsion system. The evolution in the spiral motion of the <b>spacecrafts</b> with small traction engines in the gravitation field of the celestial bodies has been investigated. The results have been introduced at the Research Institute of Applied Mechanics and Electrodynamics of the Moscow Aviation Institute, Design Office "Salut", Scientific-Technical Centre "Energokosmos".
