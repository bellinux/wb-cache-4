500|$|After {{trying to}} choose between the song, [...] "Criminal" [...] and [...] "Inside Out" [...] to be the fourth single from Femme Fatale, [...] "Criminal" [...] was selected, {{although}} Sabi revealed <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> a music video for [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in a similar style to the performance of 2011's Femme Fatale Tour. The performance consists of Spears singing and dancing to the song while her dancers are carrying picture frames. Sabi performed the song with Spears in selected cities. Despite not being released as a single, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] managed to peak at number forty-one on South Korea's Gaon International Chart, due to digital sales separate from Femme Fatale, and also appeared on Billboards Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} by Sabi at the Wango Tango of 2011. On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, a video interlude {{in which the}} stalker talks about femme fatales in history sees {{the beginning of the}} third section. Spears returns to the stage wearing a golden outfit and performs an Egyptian-inspired version of [...] "Gimme More", containing a barge and fireworks. In her next number, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears is surrounded by her dancers carrying picture frames, and includes an appearance by Sabi in select cities. Sabi revealed <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> the music video for the song based on the live performance of the tour, saying, [...] "what we do onstage is very Egyptian, Middle Eastern-like feel and a lot of vanity kind of stuff. So I would just imagine what we kind of did for the green screen, where there's mirrors and there's boys that are like oiled up. [...] I would imagine us in goddess-looking outfits and us looking vain". On August 3, 2011, ABC Family announced that [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] would be available for free download on their website, until the premiere of the Teen Spirit series on August 5, 2011.|$|E

50|$|Harmony {{believes}} {{animals are}} {{more interesting than}} humans and so <b>she</b> <b>pictures</b> the people <b>she</b> meets as animals. Her father is a sea lion, her mother a Pouter pigeon and her sister a Siamese cat.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> {{the world}} outside in colors of such splendor that the romance of her story-papers seemed weak and pale.|$|E
6000|$|How {{could she}} meet him? She must! For {{an hour of}} talk. He was all that she was hungry for. She could not {{let him get away}} without a word--and she would have to. <b>She</b> <b>pictured,</b> and ridiculed, herself as walking up to him and remarking, [...] "I am sick with the Village Virus. Will you please tell me what people are saying and playing in New York?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>pictured,</b> and groaned over, the {{expression}} of Kennicott if she should say, [...] "Why wouldn't it be reasonable for you, my soul, to ask that complete stranger in the brown jersey coat to come to supper tonight?" ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{more they}} were on the move; on the way to Leyden--distant six leagues from her home. Gilda could have cried out now in her misery. <b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> her father--broken-hearted all through the night, sending {{messengers}} hither and thither to the various gates of the city, unable no doubt to get satisfactory information at this late hour: <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> Nicolaes feigning ignorance of the whole thing, making pretence of anxiety and grief. Torturing thoughts kept her awake, though her body was racked with fatigue. The night was bitterly cold, and the wind, now that they had reached open country, cut at times across her face like a knife.|$|E

50|$|In {{her work}} Bot has often chosen those socio-political themes {{which are a}} taboo. She {{researched}} and studies her subjects at length before she presented her work.

60|$|She flushed darkly. I {{imagined}} {{that she saw}} her husband installed in a luxurious suite of rooms, dining at one smart restaurant after another, and <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> his days spent at race-meetings and his evenings at the play.|$|E
60|$|Bob, {{though not}} tall, was {{not likely to}} be {{specially}} selected for shortness. <b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> him on the upper deck, in his snow-white trousers and jacket of navy blue, looking perhaps towards the very point of land where she then was.|$|E
60|$|She {{passed the}} most wretched {{day of her}} whole life. She saw in {{anticipation}} the happiness of that household broken up. <b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> his coming, {{but she could not}} picture his departure. For she had never seen him baffled and defeated.|$|E

6000|$|And {{then with}} rapid touches {{she began to}} picture the {{disaster}} before me. <b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> the Court and our ineffectual denials, she made me realize the storm of hostility that was bound to burst over us.

60|$|Miserable Ginger! <b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> him, {{his little}} stock of money gone, {{wandering}} foot-sore about London, seeking {{in vain for}} work; forcing himself to call on Uncle Donald; being thrown down the front steps by haughty footmen; sleeping on the Embankment; gazing into the dark waters of the Thames with the stare of hopelessness; climbing to the parapet and...|$|E
60|$|Anne's {{convalescence}} was long, {{and made}} bitter for her by many things. The bloom and sunshine of the Four Winds world grated harshly on her; and yet, {{when the rain}} fell heavily, <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> it beating so mercilessly down on that little grave across the harbor; and when the wind blew around the eaves she heard sad voices in it {{she had never heard}} before.|$|E

60|$|There is an attitude--approximatively called pensive--in {{which the}} soul of a human being, and {{especially}} of a woman, dominates outwardly and expresses its presence so strongly, that the intangible essence seems more apparent than the body itself. This was Cytherea's expression now. What old days and sunny eves at Budmouth Bay was <b>she</b> <b>picturing?</b> Her reverie had caused her not to notice his knock.|$|R

6000|$|She {{could not}} comment. <b>She</b> <b>pictured</b> herself {{running across the}} room to pat his hair. She saw that his lips were firm, under his soft faded mustache. She sat still and maundered, [...] "I know. The Village Virus. Perhaps it will get me. Some day I'm going----Oh, no matter. At least, I am making you talk! Usually you have to be polite to my garrulousness, but now I'm sitting at your feet." ...|$|E
60|$|But a few marches to {{the north}} Lady Greystoke {{looked forward to the}} day when her mighty lord and master should {{discover}} the crime of Achmet Zek, and be speeding to rescue and avenge, and even as <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> the coming of John Clayton, the object of her thoughts squatted almost naked, beside a fallen log, beneath which he was searching with grimy fingers for a chance beetle or a luscious grub.|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MR.

50|$|She begins {{thinking}} of her husband, her best friend. She then {{in an effort to}} call to her husband and save herself, she sings to the beast.

60|$|No reproaches {{which the}} Misses Harmer had lavished upon her were one-tenth {{as severe as}} those she {{bestowed}} upon herself. Over and over again she called herself her grandfather's murderess. Constantly <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> up harrowing scenes of his death, and how he had died, invoking the curse of heaven upon her and hers with his latest breath. Above all, she insisted on returning at any rate to London, that Robert might go down to Canterbury to hear the particulars.|$|E
60|$|She awoke, bewildered to {{find that}} dawn was {{slipping}} into the air. While she had slept Milt had taken his arm from about her and fished out a lap-robe for her. Behind them, Dlorus was slumbering, with her soft mouth wide open. Claire felt the luxury of the pocket of warmth under the lap-robe; she comfortably stretched her legs while <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> Milt driving on all the night, rigid, tireless, impersonal as the engineer of a night express.|$|E
60|$|Aggie {{was wild}} with delight, {{when she was}} called in and {{informed}} of the arrangement. The thought of her grandfather tramping the country, alone, {{had been the one}} drawback to the pleasure of her life at Mrs. Walsham's, and many a time she had cried herself to sleep, as <b>she</b> <b>pictured</b> to herself his loneliness. That he was to be with her always, was to give up his work to settle down in comfort, was indeed a delight to her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{knew that}} if she was ever to effect any of the [...] "reforms" [...] which <b>she</b> had <b>pictured,</b> <b>she</b> must have a starting-place.
