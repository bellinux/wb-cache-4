30|$|A new frequency-based control {{strategy}} for a microgrid with an energy storage is proposed. The {{frequency of the}} main AC bus {{is determined by the}} battery SoC in terms of implementing a proposed droop curve. The microgrid could consist of both converter-interfaced and rotating generators. In the examined microgrid, only RES have been considered, showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology even under intermittency of the primary source. The aim of the proposed {{control strategy}} is to ensure a frequency deviation among the strict limits of the Standard EN 50160 for providing a high quality power to the connected loads. At the same time, the battery SoC is controlled in order to avoid overcharging or deep discharging. Finally, in case of a <b>solid</b> <b>short-circuit</b> within the microgrid, the battery undertakes to feed the fault with a high current and clear it. The proposed methodology is confirmed by detailed simulation results representing a microgrid in a Greek island. The microgrid contains a battery as an energy storage and is mainly fed by PVs and WGs.|$|E
30|$|When a {{microgrid}} {{is mainly}} supplied by {{renewable energy sources}} (RESs), the frequency deviations may deteriorate significantly the power quality delivered to the loads. This paper proposes a frequency-based control strategy, ensuring the frequency among the strict limits imposed by the Standard EN 50160. The frequency of the microgrid common AC bus {{is determined by the}} energy storage converter, implementing a proposed droop curve among the state of charge (SoC) of the battery and the frequency. Therefore, the information of the SoC becomes known to every distributed energy resource (DER) of the microgrid and determines the active power injection of the converter-interfaced DERs. The active power injection of the rotating generators remains unaffected, while any mismatch among the power generation and consumption is absorbed by the energy storage system. Finally, in case of a <b>solid</b> <b>short-circuit</b> within the microgrid, the energy storage system detects the severe voltage decrease and injects a large current in order to clear the fault by activating the protection device closer to the fault. The proposed control methodology is applied in a microgrid with PVs, wind generators and a battery, while its effectiveness is evaluated by detailed simulation tests.|$|E
40|$|Two {{preceding}} {{parts of}} a paper (cond-mat/ 0508457, cond-mat/ 0508460) considered the heuristic values of recent experiments pointing to the nearly universal occurrence of photovoltages across <b>solid</b> surfaces under <b>short-circuit</b> conditions. These voltages arise by virtue {{of a variety of}} spectrally-dependent mechanisms activated by incident photons. For the visible range, the photovoltages are obliged to the photodetachment of ions which leave the surface charged. In an attempt to learn more, we now study short-circuit photovoltages in well-defined materials including high-Tc superconductors within a broad temperature range down to liquid nitrogen. We believe our data provide a new insight into the process. Comment: 10 pages of wording plus 14 figures, all pdf forma...|$|R
40|$|Although a Al/H 2 tpp (5, 10, 15, 20 -tetraphenylporphyrin) Schottky-barrier cell did {{not show}} a clear {{rectification}} property {{because of the large}} electric resistance of the H 2 tpp solid, the rectification property was remarkably improved when o-chloranil was added into the H 2 tpp <b>solid.</b> The <b>short-circuit</b> dark-current was observed for the Al/dye cells with the mixed solid in contrast to that with the pure H 2 tpp solid, and it increased with increasing molar ratio (R) of o-chloranil to H 2 tpp. Furthermore, a much larger photocurrent was observed for the mixed-solid cells than for the pure H 2 tpp cell, but in the former cells in contrast to the latter cell, the open-circuit photovoltage was approximately the same as the open-circuit dark-voltage. These results indicate that the photocurrent of the mixed-solid cells was from the photocorrosion of the Al electrode. The short-circuit photocurrent action spectra obtained by irradiating from the Al side followed the absorption spectra of the dye solid films on the Al substrate below the R value of about 1, but above R = 1. 5, a clear difference was observed in the spectra. This difference arises because a small amount of metal-free porphyrin dications, which is hardly detected by UV-visible spectra, was produced in the immediate neighborhood of the Al electrode when spin-coated with a larger R value because of dark-corrosion of aluminum by both assistance of the hydrogen bonds (between H 2 tpp and o-chloranil) and the electric field (in a Schottky barrier built during the spin coating). Thus the metal-free porphyrin dications efficiently underwent a photoinduced charge-separation by the potential gradient in the Schottky barrier...|$|R
