40|$|This paper {{responds}} to two observations regarding current government service delivery. First, despite reasonable {{efforts to improve}} the design of forms and to establish <b>single</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> in the course of one-stop-shops, citizens still perceive forms as cumbersome. Second, citizens expect governments to act more proactively by initiating relevant government services themselves instead of relying on a manual trigger from the citizen. To overcome these two issues, this paper proposes the transition from a one-stop-shop to a no-stop-shop, where the citizen has to perform no action and to fill no form to receive a government service. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model to guide the transition from a one-stop-shop to a no-stop-shop. It describes the three stages of government service delivery “One-Stop-Shop”, “Limited No-Stop-Shop” and “No-Stop-Shop” according to the dimensions “Integration of Data Collection”, “Integration of Data Storage” and “Purpose of Data Use”. The stage model is exemplarily applied to a real-world case. An initial evaluation of the stage model is executed through discussions with researchers and semi-structured interviews with government employees...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} new {{results of}} the Brazilian transportation vehicle MagLev-Cobra. This technology proposes a magnetically levitated vehicle composed of small units of 1. 5 m length, allowing curves with minimal radius of 50 m, ramps of 10 % and velocities up to 70 km/h. When these short units are connected, the vehicle resembles a snake or rsquo;cobra’ in Portuguese. Since there is no contact between the vehicle and the magnetic rail, the noise level is low. Also, the load is distributed along the vehicle and not concentrated on <b>single</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> as in a conventional wheel and rail transportation system, which results in lower mechanical moment and lighter civil engineering constructions. These factors make MagLev-Cobra ideal to run on elevated structures inside cities. The estimated construction costs are 1 / 3 of that necessary for subways. The levitation technology {{is based on the}} flux pinning property of Y-Ba-Cu-O blocks and the magnetic field of Nd-Fe-B magnets.

DOD {{goals for the}} National Performance Review and accomplishments are analyzed. DOD incorporation of entrepreneurial government ideas of restructuring, reengineering, reinventing realigning, and rethinking are evaluated. Over $ 16. 4 billion in financial savings achieved through increased efficiency are described. In particular, lessons learned from successful and unsuccessful initiatives presented at the initial DOD Reinvention Laboratories Symposium are analyzed. Key leadership practices instrumental to successfully achieving reinvention goals include creating total commitment {{and a sense of}} urgency, communicating a vision, establishing clear goals and plan for action, overcoming obstacles with persistence, measuring performance, recognizing people, and institutionalizing continuous improvement. The following barriers to implementing reinvention are identified: absence of top management support, no <b>single</b> DOD <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> to guide reinvention, no clearly defined DOD waiver processes, Insufficient financial resources, lack of knowledge and training on reinvention procedures, poor communication on goals and means, and cultural resistance to change.
