50|$|The soldier <b>settlers</b> <b>house</b> is a high-set, timber {{building}} {{constructed in}} 1920, on property owned by RS Davies. An ex-serviceman from the First World War, Davies had acquired title to Portion 115 (as it was known) under the Ubobo Soldier Settlement Scheme. In the 1960s, the Davies family purchased Lot 114 (formerly Portion 114), on which another soldier <b>settler's</b> <b>house</b> is located. Non-Indigenous exploration of Boyne Valley area commenced with Captain James Cook in 1770, Matthew Flinders (who named Port Curtis) in 1802 and John Oxley in 1823.

50|$|The {{history of}} {{sweeping}} in the United States varies little {{from that in}} the United Kingdom. Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early <b>settler</b> <b>houses</b> were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties. This caused the authorities to regulate the design of flues. From an early date, fire wardens and inspectors were appointed.|$|R
