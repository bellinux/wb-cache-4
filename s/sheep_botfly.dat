40|$|Ophthalmomyiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of the eye}} by fly larvae. Commonly {{caused by}} Oestrus ovis, a female <b>sheep</b> <b>botfly</b> will accidentally deposit her larvae into a human eye, resulting in disease. Prompt recognition and treatment of this condition will improve patient care and reduce potential complications. We report a case of ophthalmomyiasis in {{a young man from}} Molokai who was infested while unloading a Christmas tree...|$|E
40|$|Ophthalmomyiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of human}} eye by the larvae of certain flies. <b>Sheep</b> <b>botfly</b> commonly manifests as Ophthalmomyiasis externa {{when there is}} conjunctival involvement or rarely as Opthalmomyiasis interna when there is larval penetration into the eyeball. It {{appears to be more}} common than what has been indicated by previously published reports. We present a report of seven cases of Ophthalmomyiasis by Oestrus ovis, from central India who presented with features of conjunctivitis varying between mild to severe. The larvae were seen in bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva and also entangled in lashes with discharge. Since the larvae are photophobic, it is prudent to look for them in the fornices and also in discharge. Prompt removal of the larvae from the conjunctiva helps in relieving the symptoms and also prevents serious complications. Taxonomic identification of the species is important to estimate the risk of globe penetration by the larvae...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOphthalmomyiasis is an {{infestation}} of the {{eye with}} larvae of most common <b>sheep</b> nasal <b>botfly</b> (Oestrus ovis). We describe a case of ophthalmomyiasis in a 50 -year-old man who presented with ocular foreign body sensation, redness and tearing. The causative larvae were removed {{in the emergency room}} and sent to laboratory for identification. The patient symptoms improved after topical treatment with antibioticsâ€“steroid combination therapy...|$|R
40|$|Myiasis of {{different}} organs {{has been reported}} off and on from various regions in the world. We report a human case of external ophthalmomyiasis caused by the larvae of a <b>sheep</b> nasal <b>botfly,</b> Oestrus ovis, {{for the first time}} from Meerut city in Western Uttar Pradesh, India. A 25 -year-old farmer presented with severe symptoms of conjunctivitis. The larvae, 3 in number, were observed in the bulbar conjunctiva, and following removal the symptoms of eye inflammation improved within a few hours...|$|R
40|$|Ophthalmomyiasis is an {{infestation}} of {{eye with}} larvae or maggots of certain flies. Oestrus ovis (<b>sheep</b> nasal <b>botfly)</b> belonging to family Oestridae {{is the most}} common cause of human myiasis. We describe here an acute presentation of a case of external ophthalmomyiasis, i. e., infestation of conjunctiva due to first instar larvae of Oestrus ovis. In this case report the occurrence, diagnosis and treatment all took place in the setting of a single day. Prompt treatment by removal of larvae mechanically followed by instillation of antibiotic and steroid eye drops helped to prevent serious complications. The taxonomic identification of fly is also important as some fly species are capable of penetrating deeper tissues of eyes, which is sight threatening...|$|R
40|$|Ophthalmomyiasis, fly larvae {{infestation}} of eye, {{is a rare}} {{condition that}} can have variable presentation {{depending on the type}} of fly, the ocular structures involved, and the level of penetration. A case of ophthalmomyiasis externa presented with foreign body sensation, itching and redness of eyes for 4 days is documented. Mechanical removal and good local treatment helped the patient. The larva isolated was that of Oestrus ovis (<b>sheep</b> nasal <b>botfly).</b> Ophthalmomyiasis externa is mainly caused by sheep botflyOestrus ovis and it is more common in farming communities. Our patient was also a 35 years old male farmer and had history of contact with farm animals. This infestation is rare in India as very few casesare on records...|$|R
40|$|Oestrosis {{caused by}} larvae of the <b>sheep</b> nasal <b>botfly,</b> Oestrus ovis (Diptera, Oestridae), is a {{zoonotic}} nasal myiasis affecting small ruminants (mainly sheep and goats) across the world, particularly in African and European Mediterranean countries. Reports of human oestrosis generally refer {{to people who}} have been closely associated with sheep and goat husbandry such as shepherds and farmers. Different clinical forms of human oestrosis are known, including external ophthalmitis, pharyngeal or laryngeal myiasis, nasal or auricular forms, with the possibility of combined clinical presentations. Reports of human infection by O. ovis have been increasing {{over the last few years}} and, recently, the first case of human oestrosis has been detected in a farmer living in the Canary Islands. Here we report the first confirmed case of human ocular myiasis by O. ovis, which has occurred in an urban environment...|$|R
