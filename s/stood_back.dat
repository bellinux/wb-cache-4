5|$|On 5 November 1827 Antoinette von Leykam became Metternich's second wife. She {{was only}} twenty, and their marriage, a small affair at Hetzendorf (a village just outside Vienna), drew {{considerable}} criticism. Antoinette's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society. The same day British, Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire, upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815. To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia {{the upper hand}} in the Balkans. After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected, Metternich <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> from the Eastern Question, watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829. Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey, privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy, making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state. Metternich's private life was filled with grief. In November 1828 his mother died, and in January 1829 Antoinette died, five days after giving birth to their son, Richard von Metternich. After fighting tuberculosis for many months, Metternich's son Viktor, then a junior diplomat, died on 30 November 1829. Consequently, he spent Christmas alone and depressed, worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism.|$|E

25|$|The parliament-elect prime {{minister}} and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued, slightly late, but for the election itself to occur on time, thereby avoiding {{a continuation of the}} constitutional crisis. The crisis was tense at times, but largely restricted to the political and legal fraternity, plus some police factions. The public and public service (including most police and military) <b>stood</b> <b>back.</b> It was a period when, with increased telecommunication access and use of social media (notably Facebook and mobile phones), the public and students played some part in helping maintain restraint and demanding the leadership to adhere to constitutional processes. They insisted on having the elections so that the people could say who should be their legitimate representatives for the next five years.|$|E

25|$|The song {{became a}} {{favourite}} at Oasis's live performances. Noel encouraged {{the crowd to}} sing along and often kept quiet during the first chorus, allowing the fans instead to sing along while he played the song's guitar part. During the Dig Out Your Soul Tour, Noel Gallagher abandoned the song's previous, full-band live arrangement in favour of a much slower, primarily acoustic arrangement in a lower key (B major). From 2008 through Oasis's breakup, the song was performed by Gallagher on his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar backed up by Gem Archer on electric guitar, and Chris Sharrock playing tambourine. On 11 and 12 July 2009, during performances of the song at London's Wembley Stadium, Gallagher didn't sing a word; instead, he <b>stood</b> <b>back,</b> played guitar, and allowed the crowd to sing the entire song. Since 2011, he has alternated between the acoustic version and the original arrangement when playing the song with his solo project, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{engagement}} are not clear. The Genoese Annales Ianuenses claims that when the signal to attack was given, only fourteen Genoese ships advanced, while the rest <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> and then suddenly fled. The Venetian chronicler Canale, however, records that the Venetian ships attacked first, while the Genoese were trying to ambush them. The battle ended in a clear Venetian victory: the Genoese fleet, half of which failed to engage at all, lost many men, including an admiral and two of their flagships, before breaking off and fleeing. Canale claimed 1,000 Genoese losses as compared to 420 Venetian casualties. At any rate, the outcome was clearly the result of both the divided command of the Genoese fleet, and the reluctance, consistently displayed in earlier and later engagements, of the Genoese admirals to risk their ships: this was because the Genoese ships were fitted by private contractors, usually the rich noble merchants who ran the city, and thus constituted valuable assets for which the admirals were answerable.|$|E
500|$|Mudhoney {{recorded}} the song at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio in March 1988, {{three months after}} the band's formation. Producer Jack Endino was surprised by how noisy the sessions were and how dirty the band wanted the guitars to sound; [...] "for the most part, I just sort of <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> and let them go at it". Guitarist Steve Turner said that the band selected two of their [...] "grungiest" [...] songs for the single. [...] "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" [...] was to be the A-side of the single and [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] the B-side before, in drummer Dan Peters's words, [...] "that all got flipped around".|$|E

500|$|Development {{accelerated}} after Thomas Read Kemp {{was declared}} bankrupt in 1837, {{forcing him to}} sell all his land and move to France. Parcels of land were rapidly developed with terraced streets (especially to the south, leading up from Western Road) and set-piece squares and crescents. The Temple was still isolated until 1834–35, when the firm of George Cheesman & Son built a new vicarage for the Vicar of Brighton Henry Michell Wagner. [...] The [...] "austere Neo-Tudor" [...] house <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> from the nearest road. In about 1840, Wagner's sister moved to the newly built Belvedere House nearby, and encouraged development of the adjacent road which became Montpelier Place. (The four-storey houses of Belvedere Terrace were built on her behalf in the grounds of Belvedere House in about 1852.) ...|$|E
500|$|Artist Dave Gibbons, who had {{collaborated with}} Moore on {{previous}} projects, recalled he [...] "must have {{heard on the}} grapevine {{that he was doing}} a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying I’d like to be involved with what he was doing." [...] and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his [...] "unusual" [...] style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to [...] "discuss [...] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> and [...] "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, [...] "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?" ...|$|E
500|$|Swift {{performed}} a medley, which included [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Wearing casual white blouse and black skinny jeans, Swift performed [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] and then announced, [...] "Its a fairly tale and {{an honor to}} share the stage with Stevie Nicks". Following, the two {{performed a}} cover of Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Rhiannon" [...] (1976). Swift then grabbed her acoustic guitar for {{the third and final}} part in her medley, jumping into a twangy version of [...] "You Belong with Me". Nicks <b>stood</b> <b>back,</b> tapping her tambourine and nodding, every so often stepping up to the microphone to sing with Swift. Eric Ditzian of MTV News was disappointed at Swift's and Nicks' harmonies, but said the two [...] "made for a compelling twosome". The performance followed much backlash in regards to Swift's off key singing, which caused Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, to issue a statement defending the performance.|$|E

500|$|Tallon's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party {{surprised}} commentators. In selection deliberations, Bradman had {{lobbied for}} Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, Chappie Dwyer from New South Wales and Bill Johnson from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett, {{because of his}} previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett, regarded alongside Bill O'Reilly as the world's leading legspinner. No official reason was given for Tallon's non-selection. A leak revealed {{that the reason for}} his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three spinners: O'Reilly, Chuck Fleetwood-Smith and Frank Ward. [...] Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to medium pacers. In reality, Tallon <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> and stood up to the stumps depending on the situation. While the medium pacers were swinging the ball, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an edge. When the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 September, {{the ship}} left Little Creek for a delayed and much needed {{overhaul}} {{which was to}} be completed in two phases and at two different yards.

After that, Barnstable County <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> down Chesapeake Bay bound for Horne Brothers Shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, conducting sea trials as she went. The ship began the second phase at the Horne Brothers yard on 9 December with an anticipated completion date of 2 May 1978. She commenced sea trials late in May and returned to duty with PhibRon 8 on 2 June 1978. On 18 June, the ship arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and commenced three weeks of refresher training. Immediately upon return from the West Indies, the ship launched into three weeks of amphibious refresher training at Little Creek, Virginia ...|$|E

If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
