40|$|AbstractThe {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the effect of thermocycling on the microshear bond strength of one solvent free <b>self</b> etch <b>adhesive</b> system, Bond- 1 SF, and two solvent containing self-etch adhesives, Futurabond DC and Adper Easy One. Materials and methodsSixty caries free third molars were used to prepare specimens of dentin surfaces. The adhesives were applied on dentin surfaces according to the manufacturer's instructions then Grandio-SO Composite resin was condensed through a polyethylene tube with a one mm internal diameter and height attached firmly to dentin surfaces and light cured. The bonded specimens were stored in distilled water at 37  °C for 24  h before being tested. Half of the bonded specimens were tested for microshear bond strength without thermocycling and the other half were thermocycled in water baths held at 5 °c and 55 °c with a dwell time of 1  min each for 500 cycles prior to testing. The micro shears bond strength before and after thermocycling was calculated and statistically analyzed to show the interaction between different materials. ResultsWithout thermocycling, the bond strength of Futurabond DC and Adper Easy, were 22. 524  MPa and 23. 397  MPa respectively, while Bond- 1 SF solvent free one step at lowered mean value 22. 284  MPa and the difference was not statistically significant (p >  0. 05). After thermocycling the bond strength of Futurabond DC and Adper Easy were 14. 904  MPa, 22. 713  MPa respectively, while Bond- 1 SF solvent free one step <b>self</b> etch <b>adhesive</b> had 18. 318  MPa and the differences were statistically significant (p >  0. 05).

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is the synthesis and characterization of sulfonic or, respectively sulfonic and carbonic acid functionalized polysiloxanes for dental <b>self</b> -etching <b>adhesives.</b> The primary aim of dental adhesives {{is to provide a}} strong and long term stable adhesion to both the composite filling and the dental hard tissue.

Group 1 : Adper Single Bond 2. Group 2 : l-bond. Group 3 : is a control group of composite resin restoration without bonding agent. All cavities were restored with Filtek Z 250 composite resin, stored in distilled water at 37  °C for 24  h and thermal cycled for 500 cycles. The root apices were sealed with utility wax, and all the surfaces, except for the restorations and 1  mm from the margins, were coated with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were immersed in a 3 % methylene blue dye solution for 24  h, and then rinsed in running water, blot-dried and sectioned longitudinally through the center of restorations from the facial to lingual surface. The sections were blindly assessed for microleakage of dye penetration by two independent evaluators using a stereomicroscope at 30 × magnification for both the occlusal and gingival margins.

50|$|The United States Postal Service's {{first foray}} into {{self-adhesive}} stamps was in 1974 with the 10-cent dove weathervane, produced by Avery Dennison, that soon became discolored due to the instability of the adhesive. It was another 15 years (1989) before another such stamp was issued by the USPS. Stamp collectors criticized the format, as the rubber base adhesive used tended to progressively yellow the stamps. They also found them difficult to remove from covers, and to save in mint condition, though self-adhesives of recent years have improved in these respects. The British Post Office first issued self-adhesive stamps on October 19, 1993, {{with the introduction of}} books of 20 First Class stamps, later a 2nd class stamp was introduced. In later years other issues were produced in the self-adhesive format. Die cutting tools for the UK <b>self</b> <b>adhesive</b> stamps were manufactured by Arden Dies of Stockport, Cheshire using tools designed by Robert Clapham.

Posts were cemented respectively with two different <b>self</b> <b>adhesive</b> luting cements: Group A - RelyX Unicem (3 M Espe) and Group B - Multilink Sprint (Ivoclar-Vivadent) following the manufacturers' instructions. Teeth were then thermocycled according to protocol ISO/TR 11405 and were immersed 24 hours in 2 % methylene-blue solution. Each tooth was sectioned by a diamond-coated saw (Isomet-Buhler) from CEJ to apex. Each slice was examined for the presence or absence of gutta-percha remnants, voids, bubbles, dye infiltration degree and polymerization grade of the luting agent. Findings were evidenced by stereoscopic microscopy (30 x) and Micro-Raman spectroscopy. Mann-Whitney and ANOVA statistical analyses were performed for all results.

30|$|For {{cementation}} to zirconia without separate primer application before luting, bonding efficacy depends {{entirely on}} the luting agent and its mechanical stability [24]. Regular bis-GMA resin cements which do not contain the MDP itself may show low bond strength values. However, RelyX U 200 cement contains methacrylate monomers with phosphoric ester functional groups (MDP) and these functional monomers of RelyX U 200 cement are able to form hydrogen bonds with zirconium oxide surfaces, enhancing adhesion and bond strength [26 – 28]. Significantly higher bond strength values between lithium disilicate ceramic and <b>self</b> <b>adhesive</b> resin cement was also stated. This was attributed to phosphoric-acid methacrylates in the self-adhesive resin cement, which provided a strong physical interaction, such as chemical reaction with the substructure [29]. Regarding the effect of cement type, in this study, the self-adhesive resin cement had significantly higher SBS values when compared to those of both adhesive resin cement and zinc phosphate cement.|$|E

When affected tubules were occluded by intratubular mineralized deposits, the interface displayed a dense poly-HEMA hydrogel as water sorption by the hydrophilic S 3 bond toward the porous affected collagen. Conversely, when tubules appeared empty, voids of various sizes were formed by tubular fluid shift. In DSD, S bond clearly exhibited voids and water channels as signs of the high permeability of the sub-surface. Although porosities were somewhat retained, Pbond expression showed a hermetic character which was independent of the dentin substrate. S 3 bond bonding to dentin was compromised as shown by signs of water movement within the resin/dentin bond outlining a weak capacity to produce an impermeable hybridiztion...|$|R
40|$|Background: The perfect sealing of the tooth/restoration {{interface}} {{is important}} to prevent bacteria penetration {{that may lead to}} secondary caries and also, when dentin is involved, prevent excessive fluid movement in the dentinal tubules that may cause hypersensitivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of deproteinization and application of reducing agent on the marginal integrity of composite restorations using three different bonding agents (Prime & Bond NT, AdheSE and G-Bond). Materials and Methods: Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 90 recently extracted human premolars and were divided into three groups (I, II, and III) based on the adhesives. Each group was subdivided into three subgroups of 10 each according to the surface treatment: application according to clinical protocol; etching with 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 seconds/ 5 % NaOCl; 10 % sodium ascorbate after etching/NaOCl. The cavities were restored with Filtek Z 350 nanocomposite. The specimens were sectioned and evaluated under stereomicroscope. The morphology of the resin-dentin interface was visualized using SEM. Statistical analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by a Mann-Whitney U- test (P< 0. 05). Results: Group I showed significantly least microleakage among the groups. No significant difference in microleakage was found between groups I and II. Within the subgroups for each group, no significant difference in microleakage scores was observed. SEM micrographs presented gap free areas in group I and varying degrees of gaps in the other two groups. Conclusion: Etch and rinse adhesives were tenable for deproteinization than <b>self</b> etch <b>adhesives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the tensile bond strength of three one step self-etch adhesives: Adper easy Bond, G-Bond, Tetric N bond self etch to dentin which contained ethanol and water, acetone {{and water and}} only water as a solvent respectively. Materials and Methods: Freshly extracted intact sixty permanent molars were collected for the study. To standardize the depth of cavity, 1. 5 mm hole was drilled in the deepest part of the central fossa. All the teeth were ground and polished to expose the flat dentinal surface. All the teeth were embedded in the autopolymerising acrylic resin in separate moulds and were divided into three equal groups of twenty teeth each. Group 1 : Twenty samples restored with composite and Adper easy one as bonding agent. Group 2 : Twenty samples restored with composite and G-Bond as bonding agent. Group 3 : Twenty samples restored with composite and Tetric N Bond as bonding agent. A wire loop was placed over the predesigned locationin the composite held with the split brass mold. Tensile loading was done using UTM and statistical analysis was done using one step ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test. Results: The mean bond strengths of ethanol containing, acetone containing and water containing adhesives were 12. 57 MPa, 10. 16 MPa and 11. 46 MPa. Conclusion: Comparison of contemporary adhesives in this ex-vivo study revealed that in self-etch adhesives, the type of solvent {{may be one of}} the factors that affects the bond strength. The adhesives containing ethanol based solvent showed better bonding than acetone and water based <b>self</b> etch <b>adhesives...</b>|$|R
