5|$|Most Egyptian {{vultures}} in the subtropical zone of Europe migrate {{south to}} Africa in winter. Like many other large soaring migrants, they avoid making long crossings over water. Italian birds cross over through Sicily and into Tunisia making <b>short</b> <b>sea</b> crossings by {{passing through the}} islands of Marettimo and Pantelleria. Those that migrate through the Iberian Peninsula cross into Africa over the Strait of Gibraltar while others cross further east through the Levant. In summer, some African birds fly further north into Europe and vagrants have been recorded in England and southern Sweden.|$|E

5|$|In May 1908, {{the fleet}} {{went on a}} major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea. Kaiser Wilhelm II stopped in Horta in the Azores. The fleet {{returned}} to Kiel on 13 August {{to prepare for the}} autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. At the conclusion of these maneuvers, Kaiser Wilhelm II was taken out of service. In 1909–1910, she underwent a major reconstruction in Wilhelmshaven. The superstructure amidships was cut down to reduce top-heaviness, new circular funnels were installed, and the conning tower was enlarged. The fighting tops from the masts were removed, and the secondary battery was significantly revised. Four of the 15cm guns were removed and two 8.8cm guns were added; most of the 8.8cm guns were moved from the upper decks into casemates in the main deck. On 14 October 1910, Kaiser Wilhelm II was recommissioned for service in the Baltic reserve division. She underwent <b>short</b> <b>sea</b> trials from 21 to 23 October before proceeding to Kiel, where she was based with her four sister ships.|$|E
