5|$|Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz {{and his men}} {{probably}} {{forced the}} Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At that moment Paskevich was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces {{to look for the}} Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E

[...] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is [...] "not the best technical singer", but described her as the [...] "best communicator that we've got". Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has [...] "put a lot of work" [...] into improving it. It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.

[...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews criticized the episode, writing that [...] "the story is thin and the laughter absent." [...] The episode sparked controversy over a depiction of the Charwoman cleaning character, a character used by Carol Burnett [...] in The Carol Burnett Show that was used in the episode without her consent.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ben Richards. The general plot of India and Pakistan {{on the verge of}} nuclear war is based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. The beginning was not originally in the script; Richards wanted to feature a submarine crisis, but the producers were not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> crisis would be. They eventually decided to have an Indian submarine [...] "taken hostage" [...] by the Pakistanis. They wanted to add a personal stake towards Tariq, by revealing that members of his family live in Pakistan. The intent was to include and develop a potential relationship between Ros and Lawrence {{to the point where they}} bond during their final scenes before the hotel explosion. They also wanted to touch up on the Harry/Ruth relationship, which was not in the original script; so Ben Richards added the scenes as additional dialogue.|$|E
500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He summed it up, saying [...] "We've seen all of this before, and it was barely interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E
500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the {{polarization}} of religion {{viewed in the}} episode, noting that [...] "although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic—and distorted view of religion." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I {{have always been the}} type of person who admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success. [...] This is precisely the mindset I'm feeling after watching 'Signs and Wonders'. I admire the attempt to spook me, to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness, even if I'm not completely <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> point of it all was." [...] Nevertheless, Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode's occasional quips of humor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+". Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were [...] "surprisingly horrifying" [...] and that the episode contained [...] "plenty [...] to recommend", he was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey. Although he had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes, he wrote that the [...] "last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going, and in a way that hurts everything that came before." ...|$|E
500|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} intended for Kakashi to {{debut in the}} second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to {{the other members of}} Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite [...] "de gozaru" [...] in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.|$|E

2500|$|Nobody {{knows for}} <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> true {{value of the}} total {{physical}} capital stock is, because all statistical estimates of that value involve theoretical extrapolations, with {{a margin of error}} which remains unknown unless very detailed and comprehensive surveys are done. What a fixed asset is worth becomes apparent only upon sale, yet even then assets may be sold above or below their true value – an important reason why statisticians adjust depreciation rates retrospectively and use price deflators. [...] Even where detailed information is available, however, assessments of what an asset is worth still depend on the valuation criteria used. Those criteria often differ from the actual criteria used by business, since they must conform to a standard statistical definition for measurement comparisons.|$|E
2500|$|Ancestry {{data was}} {{included}} in the 1986 census.

2500|$|Buffy earned {{international}} attention for its unflinching {{focus on the}} relationship between Willow and Tara Maclay. Whedon and the writing staff had been considering developing a story arc in which a character explores his or her sexuality as the Scoobies left high school, but no particular effort was made to assign this arc to Willow. In 1999, {{at the end of the}} third season, the Boston Herald called Buffy [...] "the most gay show on network TV this year" [...] despite having no overtly gay characters among the core cast. It simply presented storylines that resembled coming out stories. In the fourth season episode [...] "Hush", Willow meets Tara, and to avoid being killed by a group of ghouls, they join hands to move a large vending machine telekinetically to barricade a door. The scene was, upon completion, noticeably sensual to Whedon, the producers, and network executives, who encouraged Whedon to develop a romantic storyline between Willow and Tara, but at the same time placed barriers on how far it could go and what could be shown. Two episodes later, Hannigan and Amber Benson were informed that their characters would become romantically involved. The actors were not told the end result of the Willow–Oz–Tara storyline, not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> eventual trajectory of the relationship would be, until Hannigan said, [...] "Then finally it was, 'Great! It's official. We're in luurrvvve.'" ...|$|E
