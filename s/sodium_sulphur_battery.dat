40|$|Generator {{curtailment}} allows Distribution Network Operators {{to increase}} the maximum capacity of distributed renewable generation connections to their networks, but curtailment means lost revenue for generators. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) can mitigate curtailment by time-shifting generation away from congested periods and can combine this with other tasks. This paper develops a linear-programming optimization to maximize the revenue generated by an ESS connected to a wind farm in a curtailment scheme. The storage is used for curtailment reduction and price-arbitrage in an external market. A case study is developed and the optimization applied for storage devices {{with a range of}} efficiencies and penetrations. The effect of storage efficiency on revenue is shown to be stronger in price arbitrage than in generation-curtailment.

40|$|Against the {{background}} of an increasing share of intermittent renewable energies in power generation, in the medium to long term, electricity storage could be a key technology of strategic importance with regard to grid stability, grid extension and security of supply. In this context, this chapter analyses the economic feasibility of applying electricity storage technologies in energy markets. Additionally, resource requirements and environmental aspects, as well as health and safety issues, resulting from electricity storage are examined. The focus is on stationary storage technologies with the potential of balancing fluctuations due to intermittent renewable energies, i. e. allowing storing electricity over time periods of several hours, days or weeks. Conventional technologies, such as pumped hydro-energy storage and lead acid (LA) batteries, as well as innovative alternatives such as advanced adiabatic (AA) {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) and redox flow batteries (RFB), which are still under development, are considered.

40|$|Power plant cycling in thermal plants {{typically}} implies {{high costs}} and emissions. It is, therefore, important {{to find ways}} to reduce the influence of variations in wind power generation on these plants without forsaking large amounts of wind power. Using a unit commitment model, this work investigates the possibility to reduce variations by means of a moderator, such as a storage unit or import/export capacity. The relation between the reduction in CO 2 -emissions and the power rating of the moderator is investigated, as well as the benefit of a moderator which handles weekly variations compared with a moderator which has to be balanced on a daily basis. It is found that a daily balanced moderator yields a decrease in emissions of about 2 % at 20 % wind power grid penetration. The reduction in emissions is mainly due to an avoidance of start-up and part load emissions and a moderator of modest power rating is sufficient to achieve most of this decrease. In the case of a weekly balanced moderator, emissions are reduced as the moderator power rating increases. At 40 % wind power grid penetration, a weekly balanced moderator reduces emissions with up to 11 %. The major part of this reduction is due to the avoidance of wind power curtailment. The simulated benefit (CO 2 -emissions and costs) from adding a general moderator is compared with emissions from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies and cost data of five available moderator technologies; transmission capacity, pumped hydro power, compressed air energy storage, flow <b>batteries</b> and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>batteries.</b> Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This work {{outlines}} the conceptualization, modelling {{and design of}} a novel electrical energy storage (EES) receiver for use in solar parabolic trough collector (PTC) power plants. A hybridization of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphur</b> (NaS) <b>battery</b> and parabolic trough collector (PTC) Technologies, the EES receiver concept could one day enable PTC power plants to operate 24 hrs using solar energy only, while simultaneously providing them significant ancillary power benefits. Modelling of the EES receiver operation is achieved using {{of a system of}} ten steady state (algebraic) equations and two transient (partial differential) temperature dependent equations. The method of solving the system consisted of precedence ordering and back substituting of the steady state equations to develop a single complex and highly non-linear algebraic equation, in terms of the main process heat flux ݍ′̇ ௖௢௡ௗ,௔௧,. This equation was solved {{with the assistance of the}} Microsoft Excel goalseek tool. For the partial differential equations, a one dimensional finite difference approximation, consisting of a forward difference predictor, and a modified central difference corrector was used in discretization. Visual Basic code was then written to solve the system at each increment, each time utilizing the solution obtained for the complex non-linear algebraic equation in ݍ′̇ ௖௢௡ௗ,௔௧. This allowed investigation of the initial heat-up and charge/discharge function of the conceptual solar field. Results of simulations indicate the concept is both promising and implementable and that the slightly higher heat losses in the order of 400 – 600 W/m (a direct result of the unavoidably larger size of the conceptual receiver), are seen to be insignificant when compared to the possible energy storage and power support benefits. Though NaS batteries are currently expensive, this condition is thought to be ephemeral, since cells are made from low cost and widely available materials. Thus falling battery prices (with future mass production) could make this novel energy storage concept worthy of evaluation in a prototype PTC power plant...|$|R

The lithium-sulphur (Li-S) system {{is one of}} the most promising candidates for high energy density applications.

The objective of the present work is to prepare a ternary composite of MWCNT/S/conducting polymer system with unique characteristics to be used as a {{cathode material}} for lithium <b>sulphur</b> <b>batteries.</b> The synthesis has been carried out in two steps.

This thesis describes research {{carried out in the}} area of materials electrochemistry. The general goal was to develop and test advanced materials that might improve the performance of real-world electrochemical systems. Particular systems of interest were lithium thionyl chloride <b>batteries,</b> lithium <b>sulphur</b> <b>batteries,</b> and carbon-based electrochemical capacitors. Developments are reported in all three cases. Materials electrochemistry is an interdisciplinary field that investigates the relationship between the structure, properties, processing and electrochemical performance of novel materials. These may be electrodes, solutions, or combinations of both. Besides conventional electrochemical measurements, materials electrochemistry also includes elements of process development and engineering. In the present work, much effort was expended on the formulation, mixing, extrusion and curing of particulate carbon electrodes. In particular, numerous large-scale screening programs were carried out {{to examine the effects of}} multiple independent variables on battery performance. Although this required much effort to set up, the payoff was that it allowed improved processing parameters, and materials of advanced performance to be determined with a high level of confidence. Considerable effort was also expended on the development of apparatus for handling air-sensitive battery solvents, such as thionyl chloride. Amongst the achievements of the present work are: (i) the successful reformulation of the manufacturing solvent for commercial lithium battery electrodes, to halve the quantity of isopropyl alcohol used.

While cycling, the mean sulphur particle diameters decrease in a qualitatively similar fashion as the discharge capacity fades. The particles spread, migrate into the current collector and accumulate in the upper part again.

The initial surface structure of the lithium anode largely influenced the ensuing morphological changes taking place through lithium dissolution (pits) and lithium deposition (dendrites) during discharge and charge respectively. The rate of lithium dissolution and deposition was found to be linearly proportional to the current density applied to the cell and the effect of cycling on the anode was proportional to the total charge of the cell in general in agreement with the expected reaction. The effect of self-discharge on the anode was also studied using photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in tandem with SEM. The results indicated that self-discharge, occurring in the form of corrosion of the anode SEI by PS reduction, was influenced by the altered morphology of the cell after cycling.

The underlying physics of this model is hinged {{on the development of}} a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphur,</b> and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100 's of MWh.
