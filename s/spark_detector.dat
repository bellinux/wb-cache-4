The spark is formed between two thoriated tungsten electrodes by {{the discharge of}} a coaxial capacitor. The <b>spark</b> <b>detector</b> is coupled to the gas chromatograph by a heated transfer line. The gas chromatographic effluent is introduced into the heated spark chamber where atomization and excitation of the effluent occurs upon breakdown of the analytical gap.

40|$|Different RF power {{couplers}} for the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) [1] {{are under}} development and operation at DESY. TTF power couplers type II which are mainly used {{up till now}} together with "FNAL " couplers [2] recently have been improved by design of coupler TTF III [3]. RF power couplers are tested normally with full RF power, at first two couplers on a test stand and afterwards each coupler together with its superconducting cavity in a horizontal test cryostat. Results of coupler tests showed stable operation at full pulse length of 1. 3 ms and RF power even up to about 1 MW without breakdowns. The average power needed for cavity operation at about 25 MV/m is 230 kW. New procedures to improve RF performance and to shorten processing time, like TiN coating of the inner surfaces, are being investigated. Also, the next coupler designs TTF IV and V are being developed. 1 TTF III COUPLER The TTF III coupler (see Fig. 1) consists of the same cold window design as TTF II and is compatible with it. Unlike TTF II it has a cylindrical warm window in the half height waveguide to coax transition. The isolation foil {{is not in the}} vacuum in order to avoid outgassing. The waveguide is on air so that the surfaces in the warm vacuum are reduced. On both couplers the warm and cold coax have impedance of 50 Ohm (diameter 62 mm) and 70 Ohm (diameter 40 mm) respectively. All couplers have detectors for e- in the warm and cold coaxial line and a light detector on the vacuum side of the room temperature window (see Fig. 1).

40|$|AbstractA {{difficulty}} of using confocal microscopy to study Ca 2 + sparks is {{the uncertainty of}} the linescan position with respect to the source of Ca 2 + release. Random placement of the linescan is expected to result in a broad distribution of measured Ca 2 + spark amplitudes (a) even if all Ca 2 + sparks were generated identically. Thus variations in Ca 2 + spark amplitude due to positional differences between confocal linescans and Ca 2 + release site are intertwined with variations due to intrinsic differences in Ca 2 + release properties. To separate these two sources of variations on the Ca 2 + spark amplitude, we determined the effect changes of channel current or channel open time—collectively called the source strength, α—had on the measured Ca 2 + spark amplitude histogram, N(a). This was done by 1) simulating Ca 2 + release, Ca 2 + and fluo- 3 diffusion, and Ca 2 + binding reactions; 2) simulation of image formation of the Ca 2 + spark by a confocal microscope; and 3) using a novel automatic Ca 2 + <b>spark</b> <b>detector.</b> From these results we derived an integral equation relating the probability density function of source strengths, fα(α), to N(a), which takes into account random positional variations between the source and linescan. In the special, but important, case that the spatial distribution of Ca 2 +-bound fluo- 3 is Gaussian, we show the following: 1) variations of Ca 2 + spark amplitude due to positional or intrinsic differences can be separated, and 2) fα(α) can, in principle, be calculated from the Ca 2 + spark amplitude histogram since N(a) is the sum of shifted hyperbolas, where the magnitudes of the shifts and weights depend on fα(α). In particular, if all Ca 2 + sparks were generated identically, then the plot of 1 /N(a) against a will be a straight line. Multiple populations of channels carrying distinct currents are revealed by discontinuities in the 1 /N(a) plot. 3) Although the inverse relationship between Ca 2 + spark amplitude and decay time might be used to distinguish Ca 2 + sparks from different channel populations, noise can render the measured decay times meaningless for small amplitude Ca 2 + sparks...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} of high-speed, two-dimensional (2 -D) confocal microscopes and the expanding armamentarium of fluorescent probes presents unprecedented opportunities and new challenges {{for studying the}} spatial and temporal dynamics of cellular processes. The need to remove subjectivity from the detection process, {{the difficulty of the}} human eye to detect subtle changes in fluorescence in these 2 -D images, and the large volume of data produced by these confocal microscopes call for the need to develop algorithms to automatically mark the changes in fluorescence. These fluorescence signal changes are often subtle, so the statistical estimate of the likelihood that the detected signal is not noise {{is an integral part of}} the detection algorithm. This statistical estimation is fundamental to our new approach to detection; in earlier Ca 2 + <b>spark</b> <b>detectors,</b> this statistical assessment was incidental to detection. Importantly, the use of the statistical properties of the signal local to the spark, instead of over the whole image, reduces the false positive and false negative rates. We developed an automatic spark detection algorithm based on these principles and used it to detect sparks on an inhomogeneous background of transverse tubule-labeled rat ventricular cells. Because of the large region of the cell surveyed by the confocal microscope, we can detect a large enough number of sparks to measure the dynamic changes in spark frequency in individual cells. We also found, in contrast to earlier results, that cardiac sparks are spatially symmetric. This new approach puts the detection of fluorescent signals on a firm statistical foundation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} several wafer {{post-processing}} steps {{have been applied}} to CMOS chips. Amplification gas strucutures are built {{on top of the}} microchips. A complete radiation imaging detector is obtained this way. Integrated Micromegas-like and GEM-like structures were fabricated on top of Timepix CMOS chips. Single electron efficiency, measured by counting the number of detected electrons from an 55 Fe conversion in Ar/iC 4 H 10 (95 / 5) was found to be well above 90 %. The detector provides high single electron efficiency, three dimensional reconstruction of charged particles trajectory, a fine pixel pitch and it has a low mass. All these features make it a suitable candidate for tracking of charged particles in future detectors like ATLAS or CMS after the LHC upgrade or the International Linear Collider. Micromegas-like and GEM-like structures can be fairly compared as same materials and dimentions can be used. It was found that GEM-like structures having a big amount of insulator perform worse than similar Micromegas-like structures. The maximum achievable gain before sparks is lower for GEM-like that for Micromegas-like. When the amount of insulator is reduced in the GEM-like structures, having recessed insulator walls with respect to the metal electrodes, the performance is similar to Micromegas-like structures. Multistage detectors on top of Timepix chips were also built using wafer postprocessing. Tge devices were fully operational and cosmic rays could be detected. The spark rate of multistage detectors compared to single detectors must be studied. Also the signal development in these detectors is expected to be faster that in single stage <b>detectors.</b> <b>Spark</b> damage is a commong problem in gaseous <b>detectors.</b> <b>Sparks</b> can destroy the readout electronics. We have deposited a-Si:H and SiRN on Timepix chips. We have shown that these high resistive layer deposited on top of the CMOS chip can help to reduce the spark problems. Discharges energy is reduced and microchips can survive the discharges that before would destroy them. Future detectors are not required any more not to spark as they can now be made <b>spark</b> proof. Integrated <b>detectors</b> can suffer reliability problems because of degradation due to moisture exposure. Also mechanical attacks will make the devices not to work. We have evaluated these problems to give storage and transportations recommendations. The use of other materials less sensitive to humidity were also studied...|$|R
