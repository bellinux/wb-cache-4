40|$|The genus Psychotria {{comprises}} approximately 2, 000 {{species that}} are mostly shrubs distributed in forests of the tropics and subtropics. Within the Rubiaceae, Psychotria {{is well known for}} its species that produce bioactive alkaloids and for its taxonomic complexity. The anatomical and micromorphological characters of the leaves of P. hoffmannseggiana, P. carthagenensis, P. deflexa, P. glaziovii, P. leiocarpa, P. racemosa, and P. vellosiana were investigated and described to understand the interspecific variation of these species, which will contribute to the systematics of the genus. Principal component analysis (PCA) and unweighted pair group method analysis (UPGMA) indicated four groups based on {{the presence or absence of}} some of the characters studied. Dorsiventral mesophyll, hypostomatic leaves, paracytic stomata, organization of the vascular system of the petiole and midrib in an arc and the presence of accessory bundles are common in the species examined and are typical characteristics of the Rubiaceae. The presence of <b>styloid</b> <b>crystals</b> and alkaloids are considered diagnostic characters of Psychotria. Other characteristics used to separate species in the genus are the petiole contour, cuticle ornamentation, and presence of trichomes. The results of the UPGMA cluster analyses indicated that there is similarity between Psychotria (subg. Heteropsychotria) and Palicourea species...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBaccharis L. sect. Caulopterae, Asteraceae, {{comprises}} thirty {{species in}} Brazil that show stems represented by cladodes, {{which are very}} similar in morphology. These species are popularly known as &# 8220;carqueja&# 8221; in Brazil and Argentina and are used in popular medicine as diuretic and stomachic. The aim of this work {{was to examine the}} morpho-anatomical characters of cladodes of Baccharis pentaptera (Less.) DC. for diagnosis purposes. The plant material was prepared by light and scanning electron microscopy. B. pentaptera shows opposite and spread wings in the two-winged cladode axis and irregular arrangement in the three-winged cladode. The wings have a uniseriate epidermis with palisade parenchyma next to both sides of epidermis. The spongy parenchyma crossed by minor collateral vascular bundles is observed in the central region of wings. The glandular trichomes are capitate and biseriate and the non-glandular trichomes are uniseriate and flagelliform with 2 &# 8211; 3 cells that extend from the base. In caulinar axis, there are uniseriate epidermis, chlorenchyma alternating with angular collenchyma and perivascular fiber caps adjoining the phloem which is outside the xylem. Prismatic and <b>styloid</b> <b>crystals</b> are verified in the perimedullary zone. These combined characters can assist the diagnosis of Baccharis species sect. Caulopterae...|$|R

For all Araceae studied using SEM, the oxalate crystals exuding on the epidermal surface correspond to extended aggregate/druses or crystal sand and the oxalate crystals mixed with pollen correspond to raphides or <b>styloids</b> (prismatic <b>crystals).</b> The type of crystals associated with pollen varies among genera. However, the presence of crystals associated with pollen is a specific rather than a generic characteristic.

40|$|Anatomical {{characteristics}} of five "gaharu " wood species, Aquilaria malaccensis. Aetoxyl­ sympetalum. Gonystylus bancanus, Gonystylus macrophyllus, and Gyrinops versteeghii were described and compared, {{to find out}} how to identify and differentiate gaharu wood by their taxa. The knowledge of the difference between Aquilaria malaccensis, which has been listed in Appendix II CITES. from other gaharu wood that have not been listed, would be advantages in supporting the conservation of A. malaccensis as well as in promoting the utilization of the other gaharu wood species. The result of study indicated that all gaharu wood examined have several same features: 1) fibers with distinctly bordered pit at radial face and tend to be arranged in two series: 2) intervessel pit small,. 4 - 7 microns: 3) rays of commonly uniseriate. Both Aquilaria malaccensis and Gyrinops versteeghii have included phloem, while the other three gaharu wood species do not contain included phloem. Aquilaria malaccensis that has been listed in Appendix II CITES could be differentiated from Gyrinops versteeghii based on vessel characteristics. aquilaria malaccensis has medium vessel diameter, 100 - 200 microns, frequency less than 10 vessels per sq. mm. and radial multiples of 2 - 4 cells. Gyrinops versteeghii has moderately small vessel diameter, less than 100 microns, frequency more than 10 vessels per sq. mm, and radial multiples of 2 - 6 cells. Aetoxylon sympetalum and Gonystylus spp. are together characterized by the presence of aliform and confluent parenchyma and the occurrence of prismatic and <b>styloid</b> <b>crystals</b> in ray tissue. The presence of very thick walled fibers and rays of 1 - 2 to 3 seriate wide, could be used to differentiate Actoxylon sympetalum from Gonystylus spp. The latter have fibers of medium thickness and rays of commonly uniseriate...|$|R

40|$|Claoxylon and Micrococca are {{the only}} Euphorbiaceae genera that have rough dried leaves (fresh ones are smooth) because of {{protruding}} <b>styloid</b> (needle-like) <b>crystals</b> more or less perpendicular to the leaf surface, which perforate the epidermis and cuticle. A broad leaf anatomical study of the subtribes Claoxylinae, the monogeneric Lobaniliinae, and Mercurialis of the Mercurialinae (95 of a possible 235 species in all six genera) showed that styloids are present in Claoxylon, Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca, and lacking in Claoxylopsis and Mercurialis. Contrary to Claoxylon, the dried leaves of Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca are not rough, because the styloids do not perforate the epidermis during drying and therefore herbarium leaves generally remain smooth. The presence of styloids supports a clade in a recent molecular phylogenetic study that unites subtribes Claoxylinae and Lobaniliinae as Claoxylinae s. l. Mercurialis (no styloids) is sister to all other taxa (with styloids) in the monophyletic Claoxylinae s. l. The styloids form a synapomorphy for a monophyletic part of the Claoxylinae (Claoxylon, Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca). Other leaf anatomical notes are provided, together with {{an overview of the}} occurrence of styloids, stomata, and druse crystals for most species in the Claoxylinae. The indumentum ranges from (virtually) absent to a sparse or dense tomentum of straight and thick- or thin-walled unicellular hairs (most common), curly hairs, or two-armed hairs (‘Malpighiaceous hairs’).

40|$|Croton agrupa cerca de 1. 200 espécies portadoras {{de flores}} bissexuais e representa um grupo complexo, sob o ponto de vista taxonômico e morfológico. Astraea, recentemente separada de Croton e com quem divide inúmeras características morfológicas, é um gênero pouco estudado. A natureza dos verticilos florais, especialmente nectários e estruturas filamentosas das flores pistiladas, é um assunto bastante controvertido, nos dois gêneros. Estudos com as flores de Croton mostram o desenvolvimento do óvulo e da semente e outros apenas descrevem a morfologia do grão de pólen maduro. Entretanto, para o gênero Astraea nada se conhece até o momento. Analisando o desenvolvimento, a vascularização e a morfologia de flores estaminadas e pistiladas, de Croton e Astraea, verificou-se que as estruturas filamentosas das flores pistiladas correspondem às pétalas presentes nas flores estaminadas, e que os nectários representam estames transformados; observou-se, inclusive, que flores pistiladas podem desenvolver estames em substituição aos nectários. Também foi possível apontar caracteres que apóiem a segregação de Astraea e Croton, embora os dois gêneros compartilhem inúmeras características morfológicas. O estudo do desenvolvimento da antera e óvulo de duas espécies de Astraea e de sete de Croton mostrou a ocorrência de cristais estilóides, no tapete, e de idioblastos portadores de drusa, no endotécio; mostrou também, a presença de óvulos com os dois tegumentos de origem epidérmica e a diferenciação de megásporo funcional em posição micropilar. Esses aspectos, descritos pela primeira vez para a família, precisam ser melhor investigados a fim de se determinar sua ocorrência e distribuição, dentro do grupo, e avaliar melhor seu potencial taxonômico. Croton {{comprises}} approximately 1, 200 species with bisexual flowers {{and is a}} taxonomically and morphologically complex group. Astraea, which was recently separated from Croton and shares innumerous morphological characteristics, is still a poorly studied genus. The nature of the floral whorls, especially the nectaries and the filamentous structures of the pistillate flowers, is a controversial subject in both genera. Some studies with Croton flowers have examined the development of ovules and seeds, while others have only described the morphology of mature pollen grains. Very little is currently known about Astraea. Analyses of the development, vascularization, and morphology of the staminate and pistillate flowers of Croton and Astraea demonstrated that the filamentous structures of the pistillate flowers represent transformed petals, and that nectaries represent transformed stamens in pistillate flowers; stamens were occasionally observed in place of nectaries. Many characteristics were observed that support the segregation of Astraea from Croton, although the two genera do share numerous morphological features. An examination {{of the development of}} the anthers and ovules of two species of Astraea and seven species of Croton demonstrated the presence of <b>styloid</b> <b>crystals</b> in the tapetum as well as idioblasts with druses in the endothecia; ovules with two teguments of epidermal origin and the differentiation of a functional megaspore in a micropylar position were also observed. These aspects, described {{here for the first time}} for the family, need to be further investigated to determine their occurrence and distribution within the taxon, and to evaluate their taxonomic potential...|$|R
40|$|Quillaja {{has been}} shuffled among tribes and subfamilies of Rosaceae, {{segregated}} from it {{as a separate}} family, and, most recently, transferred to the Fabales as a separate family. Many anomalous characters have kept it from being settled anywhere permanently. One character never mentioned by systematists, but long known, is the anomalous (for Rosaceae) occurrence of prominent <b>styloid</b> calcium oxalate <b>crystals,</b> reported from the inner bark of stems. We describe in more detail the macropattern of crystal distribution in stem and leaf, using vibratome sections, sodium hypochlorite clearings of leaves, and polarizing and scanning electron microscopy. Styloids are extremely numerous in the phloem of stems, and they continue in phloem of the short petiole and midrib bundle and in main lateral veins of the leaf lamina. Druses, never reported before, occur in cortex and pith of young stems (not seen in old stems) and are numerous in the spongy mesophyll, but not the palisade mesophyll, of the leaf lamina. Styloids occur {{in three of the}} four families of the newly constituted Fabales.

30|$|Although the shape, {{size and}} number of {{crystals}} show variations among taxa, they have been classified into five main groups based on their morphology: as prism, druses, <b>styloids,</b> raphides and <b>crystal</b> sand (Webb 1999). Various physical, chemical and biological parameters such as light, temperature, pH, ion concentration and herbivory may affect the location, size and other properties of crystals in plants (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Molano-Flores 2001; Kuo-Huang et al. 2007; Meriç 2009). However, many authors have stated that crystal formation within the cell is under genetic control (Ilarslan et al. 2001). Thus the shape and location of the crystals within a taxon are often very specific and may be represented as a taxonomic character (Genua and Hillson 1985; Prychid and Rudall 1999; Lersten and Horner 2000). Furthermore, {{the presence or absence}} of crystals may represent useful taxonomic characters and also be used for understanding the evolutionary relationships of plant species (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Prychid and Rudall 1999). For example, by considering both morphological and molecular characteristics and the distribution of calcium oxalate crystals in some taxa, Rudall and Chase (1996) have shown that the genera formerly included in Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato may belong to three different families: Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu stricto, Lomandraceae and Dasypogonaceae (Prychid and Rudall 1999).|$|R
