50|$|Eletriptan has higher {{affinity}} for the receptor, which is probably {{a result of the}} bulky substituents of the structure.

For the R1 substituent an electron rich <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>groups</b> and amide group has shown the best results in receptor binding and activity.

50|$|Since Vemurafenib only {{differs from}} its precursor, PLX4720, in a phenyl ring added for {{pharmacokinetic}} reasons, PLX4720's {{mode of action}} is equivalent to Vemurafenib's. PLX4720 has good affinity for the ATP binding site partially because its anchor region, a 7-azaindole bicyclic, only differs from the natural adenine that occupies the site in two places where nitrogen atoms {{have been replaced by}} carbon. This enables strong intermolecular interactions like N7 hydrogen bonding to C532 and N1 hydrogen bonding to Q530 to be preserved. Excellent fit within the ATP-binding hydrophobic pocket (C532, W531, T529, L514, A481) increases binding affinity as well. Ketone linker hydrogen bonding to water and difluoro-phenyl fit in a second hydrophobic pocket (A481, V482, K483, V471, I527, T529, L514, and F583) contribute to the exceptionally high binding affinity overall. Selective binding to active Raf is accomplished by the terminal propyl group that binds to a Raf-selective pocket created by a shift of the αC helix. Selectivity for the active conformation of the kinase is further increased by a pH-sensitive deprotonated <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>group</b> that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the backbone peptide NH of D594 in the active state. In the inactive state, the inhibitor's <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>group</b> interacts with the backbone carbonyl of that residue instead, creating repulsion.
