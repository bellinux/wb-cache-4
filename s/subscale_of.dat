2500|$|At a broad level, the {{construct}} of trait nature connectedness is associated with well-being. [...] This means that individuals who are highly connected to nature also report higher psychological well-being (i.e. greater acceptance of self), and social well-being (i.e. socially integrated). Emotional well-being (i.e. positive emotions and life satisfaction), is related to nature connectedness but less consistently However, psychological and social well-being are consistently related to nature connectedness suggesting that feeling connected to nature is related to participant's well-being in their personal and social lives. Trait nature relatedness is significantly correlated with psychological well-being and its 6 dimensions (autonomy, environmental mastery, positive relations with others, self-acceptance, purpose in life, and personal growth). More specifically, nature relatedness relates to all six dimensions (in a sample with undergraduate students), and relates with autonomy, purpose in life, and personal growth (in a sample with business people). It also significantly relates to positive affect in both populations. Finally, nature connectedness is associated with mindfulness. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} research has examined the benefits of mindfulness such as increased self-awareness, self-esteem, resilience and reduced maladaptive rumination. The awareness <b>subscale</b> (<b>of</b> mindfulness) correlates with nature connectedness but the other <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> mindfulness (the acceptance subscale) does not consistently correlate. As the authors state, this suggests that mindfulness is related to a person's awareness in nature and their experiences in nature but not with whether they accept these experiences or not.|$|E
2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{researchers have}} generally {{agreed on a}} five-factor model of personality. The five factors are extraversion (i.e. social, outgoing), agreeableness (i.e. trusting, helpful), neuroticism (i.e. worried, anxious), openness to experience (i.e. imaginative, creative), and conscientiousness (i.e. organized, careful). [...] Nature relatedness (overall) is significantly related to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. In addition, a <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> nature relatedness (nature relatedness-experience) is negatively related with neuroticism. These authors describe the nature relatedness person {{as someone who is}} more adventurous, easy going, and gregarious. It may also be that highly nature related people are more environmental friendly because of the positive (albeit weak) relationship with conscientiousness. Evidence suggests that people vary in their subjective sense of connectedness with nature much like any of the five factors listed above. Supportive of these results, a recent study has found that environmental engagement (protecting the environment, electricity conservation and environmental values) is related to agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Another study found that nature connectedness accounted for (mediated) the relationship between openness and pro-environmental behaviours.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveThe {{reliability}} and validity of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C 30) has not been examined while taking into account the correlation between <b>subscales.</b> The reliability <b>of</b> the EORTC QLQ-C 30 subscales is modest, thus limiting their utility in both clinical and research settings. The {{purpose of this study was}} to validate the factor structure <b>of</b> multiple-item <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and to improve their reliability by means of an item response analysis by using the multidimensional partial credit model. MethodsA total of 2295 patients with complete data were used for the analysis. One- and nine-dimensional partial credit models were used to fit the data to validate the construct validity <b>of</b> the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> the QLQ-C 30. ResultsThe model comparison showed that the nine-dimensional factor structure <b>of</b> multiple-item <b>subscales</b> was satisfactory. The multidimensional partial credit model fit data <b>of</b> the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> the QLQ-C 30 reasonably well. The estimated test reliabilities of each domain obtained from the multidimensional approach were higher than those obtained from the unidimensional approach. ConclusionsThe constructs represented by the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> the QLQ-C 30 were validated. The improved reliability <b>of</b> the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> the QLQ-C 30 under the multidimensional approach can facilitate their applications in clinical and research settings...|$|R

This research is aimed to appraise the role of family structure, personality characteristics and demographical factors in predicting problematic use of internet.
