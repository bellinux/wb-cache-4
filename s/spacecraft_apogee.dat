40|$|As the Polar <b>spacecraft</b> <b>apogee</b> precessed {{through the}} {{magnetic}} equator in 2001, Polar encountered numerous substorm {{events in the}} region between geosynchronous orbit and 10 RE geocentric distance; {{most of them in}} the plasma sheet boundary layers. Of these, a small number was recorded near the neutral sheet in the evening sector. Polar/Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment provides a unique perspective on the lowest-energy ion plasma, showing that these events exhibited a damped wavelike character, initiated by a burst of radially outward flow transverse to the local magnetic field at approximately 80 km/s. They then exhibit strongly damped cycles of inward/outward flow with a period of several minutes. After one or two cycles, they culminated in a hot plasma electron and ion injection, quite similar to those observed at geosynchronous orbit. Cold plasmaspheric plasmas comprise the outward flow cycles, while the inward flow cycles contain counterstreaming field-parallel polar wind-like flows. The observed wavelike structure, preceding the arrival of an earthward moving substorm injection front, suggests an outward displacement driven by the inward motion at local times closer to midnight, that is, a "snowplow" effect. The damped in/out flows are consistent with interchange oscillations driven by the arrival at the observed local time by an injection originating at greater radius and local time...|$|E

The image motion (file to the satellite spin is minimal during such a short exposure. Each image is electronically distortion corrected using the look up table scheme. An offset is added to each memory address that is proportional to the image shift due to satellite rotation, and the charge signal is digitally summed in memory. On orbit, approximately 300 frames will be added to produce one WIC image in memory. The advantage of the electronic motion compensation and distortion correction is that it is extremely flexible, permitting several kinds of corrections including motions parallel and perpendicular to the predicted axis of rotation. File instrument was calibrated by applying ultraviolet light through a vacuum monochromator and measuring the absolute responsivity of the instrument. To obtain the data for the distortion look up table the camera was turned through various angles and the input angles corresponding to a pixel matrix were recorded. It was found that the spectral response peaked at 150 nm and fell off in either direction. The equivalent aperture of the camera, including mirror reflectivities and effective photocathode quantum efficiency, is about 0. 04 sq cm.

Another example of robotic service operations would be the servicing of low-earth orbit satellites. Currently, this expertise is being developed at GSOC in order to operate the Orbit Life Extension Vehicle (OLEV) and the German Orbital Servicing Mission (DEOS). The multinational commercial mission OLEV will achieve this task by docking a smaller servicer <b>spacecraft</b> to the <b>apogee</b> engine nozzle of a regular geostationary communication satellite and performing the station keeping task for a number of additional years in service and a de-orbiting at the end. The mission features a novel space-application of interesting technologies like high level autonomy and robotics. Contrary to the other mission phases, a different network architecture must be used because of the challenging telepresence (short latency) requirement.

Over the course of its two-year mission, the three spacecraft will perform ten, 1 -week dipping campaigns whereby they maneuver to lower their perigee to near 134 km. Using available launch vehicle performance data, an optimal parking orbit of 222 x 1525 km was found to maximize the dry mass available while providing enough propellant to perform the ten deep-dipping campaigns over its two-year mission. The results were used to create multi-variable contour plots containing the orbit perigee, the orbit <b>apogee,</b> <b>spacecraft</b> dry mass, propellant mass, and T 500 (a science data collection figure of merit that tabulates the cumulative time spent below 500 km).

We have analyzed ion distributions {{on both sides of}} the magnetopause in order to investigate any local time and energy dependence, giving information about physical processes at the magnetopause and the bow shock. Particle measurements are from the Charge Energy Mass (CHEM) (1. 5 to 300 keV/e) and Medium-Energy Particle Analyzer (MEPA) (10 keV to 2 MeV) instruments. The wide total energy range (1. 5 keV to 2 MeV) covered describes the magnetospheric distributions quite well, and for the purpose of this study, adequately describes the high-energy part of the shocked solar wind. Thus both solar wind and magnetospheric components can be recognized in a mixed particle distribution. Case studies of representative magnetopause crossings at dawn, noon, and dusk, as well as a survey of several other crossings, indicated: (1) a local time and energy dependence of magnetosheath spectra at energies greater than or equal to 50 KeV; spectra were harder at the duskside than at the dawnside and also correlated with magnetospheric activity, (2) constantly much higher intensities in the magnetosphere than in the magnetosheath at energies greater than 10 KeV and an earthward gradient in the subsolar magnetosheath. In addition to the steady state magnetosheath population there exists a burst-type component indicative of a magnetospheric source, and most of the time this is recognized as a flux transfer event. Overall, the results about the origin of the greater than or equal to 50 KeV magnetosheath ions are consistent with the continuous leakage of magnetospheric particles across a tangential discontinuity magnetopause, locally distributed according to magnetospheric drift paths. Magnetic reconnection, although present, should not be a dominant source on average, because it is not continuous in time. Fermi acceleration should not be dominant because it predicts the opposite local time asymmetry, and shock drift acceleration should be a minor contributor at E greater than or equal to 50 keV because of upper-energy cutoff limitations. Our observations also indicate a significant magnetospheric contribution to energies as low as approximately 10 KeV, where the magnetosphere-magnetosheath intensity gradient reverses. However, in orderto examine the relative strength and local time distribution of all possible sources at these energies, a detailed analysis is required...|$|R
40|$|Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) {{launched}} Nozomi, {{its first}} {{mission to the}} planet Mars using the newly developed M-V launch vehicle on July 3, 1998. Scientific objectives of the mission are to study the structure and dynamics of the Martian upper atmosphere and its interaction with the solar wind. Nozomi is a cooperative mission between ISAS and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The NASA contribution includes navigation and tracking services provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The spacecraft also serves as an engineering demonstration of basic technology for planetary exploration. One of the new technologies was a unique trajectory, developed by ISAS, which used solar gravitational perturbations at the weak stability boundary {{as an aid to}} achieve an Earth-Mars transfer orbit. This trajectory saves approximately 120 m/s of Delta V compared to direct hyperbolic insertion and is considered an enabling technology for the mission. Nozomi was the first spacecraft to employ this trajectory and provided on-orbit validation of the technique. The trajectory was achieved by initially placing the spacecraft in a highly elliptical cis-lunar phasing orbit. Six maneuvers were performed during this period to correct injection errors and target an outbound lunar swingby in September 1998. The gravity assist from the lunar swingby raised apogee to the vicinity of the weak stability boundary. After three more targeting maneuvers, Nozomi performed an inbound lunar swingby followed immediately by a powered Earth swingby in late December 1998. A 420 m/s Trans Mars Insertion (TMI) burn at the final Earth periapsis was intended to place the spacecraft on a heliocentric trajectory leading to Mars orbit insertion in October 1999. Orbit determination for Nozomi is performed in parallel by both ISAS and the Multi-Mission Navigation (MMNAV) group at JPL. This was an advantage for the mission because each group would generate solutions based on data collected from their respective tracking networks. Spacecraft events, such as sequence uplinks and maneuvers, were generally scheduled during passes at the Usuda tracking station in Japan. As a result, maneuver design and reconstruction was derived from MMNAV solutions based on JPL tracking data obtained immediately prior to or following maneuvers. Data was also exchanged between ISAS and MMNAV so orbit determination could be performed on joint data sets in support of critical targeting late in the cis-lunar phase. In this paper, information regarding the MMNAV orbit determination effort {{for the first six months}} of the mission is presented. The spacecraft trajectory is characterized first, followed by a discussion of the orbit determination estimation procedure and models. Results from selected orbit solutions are presented and compared against reconstructed trajectories. One area of emphasis in this paper is orbit determination in the vicinity of the weak stability boundary. Precise navigation was necessary to target the second lunar swingby and the powered Earth swingby. Delivery accuracy of 150 m was required for these critical encounters, but a number of factors contributed to the general degradation of orbit determination accuracy. This included the fact that the <b>spacecraft</b> was at <b>apogee,</b> at a range of 1. 7 million km and moving at less than I km/sec perpendicular to the line of sight. Nozomi was also close to zero degrees declination where there are known limitations on orbit determination performance. Finally, S-band tracking data was acquired through the Nozomi backup low gain antenna. This antenna is offset from the axis of this spin stabilized spacecraft and superimposed large signatures in the Doppler and range data. These difficulties were overcome by combining long data arcs, spanning several maneuvers, with a high fidelity solar pressure model. The model included a physically accurate representation of the spacecraft structure and a high time resolution orientation model. Observation modeling included the removal of the spin induced Doppler bias, spin signature and per pass correction of range calibration errors applied for data leading up to critical events. As a result, all orbit determination goals were met. A second area of emphasis in this paper is the JPL tracking and orbit determination effort in support of the TMI maneuver. TMI occurred out of contact with ground stations and the JPL Goldstone tracking complex had the first pass following the bum. As a result, MMNAV had the responsibility to make a rapid assessment of the maneuver performance. MMNAV made the determination that a 100 m/s under bum had occurred and promptly informed ISAS via voice lines. ISAS immediately began preparations for a correction maneuver (TMIc), which had to be performed during the next Usuda pass. The near real time assessment by MMNAV provided accurate antenna frequency and pointing updates for the spacecraft acquisition at Usuda and the close coordination between the two agencies enabled the design and successful execution of the TMc maneuver. Propellant consumption during the correction burn dictated that the mission be redesigned. ISAS developed a new plan which adds 3 full solar orbits, two Earth swingbys and one lunar swingby with arrival at Mars in January 2004. The final Mars orbit will still enable the mission to achieve all of its science objectives...|$|R
