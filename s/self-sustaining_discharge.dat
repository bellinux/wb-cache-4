Pulse discharges in quartz tubes supplied from a capacitor bank are used. A lithium plasma (more precisely lithium-vanadium) {{with a high degree of}} ionization is produced. Distinctive features of the discharges were the following: 1) the discharges are produced at continuous vacuum pumping and filling the tube by plasma from the special pulse source. The duration of the <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>discharge</b> exceeds the time of injection by one order of magnitude and more. 2) Such source in [1] was the electrical explosion of a lithium wire, in “Robotron”, it is an arc discharge with a solid lithium cathode.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{atmospheric}} ion generation {{were first}} simulated using a Particle In Cell-Monte Carlo (PIC-MC) method to predict ion generation and breakdown characteristics in microscale gaps. Simulation results were validated and have revealed {{the significance of}} each relevant electron-molecule reaction. <b>Self-sustaining</b> <b>discharge</b> and ionization were reproduced numerically under sufficient voltage bias, and the predicted trends of breakdown voltage are similar to prior results. Experimentally, the atmospheric field emission and ionization capabilities of highly graphitic polycrystalline diamond (HGPD) film were characterized. The HGPD sample was activated by applying a moderate voltage bias for an extended period. After activation, a smaller turn-on voltage and a larger, more sustainable current of 10 μA were observed. A hydrogen plasma treatment after long-term operation was shown to restore emission current back to or even exceeding the original level, which suggests an important role of surface termination in electron emission processes. ^ An atomistic Green 2 ̆ 7 s function (AGF) method was developed to simulate nanoscale phonon transport {{in the second part}} of this dissertation. The theory of the AGF method was established with a full derivation of transmission function and heat flux expressions based on lattice dynamics and Green 2 ̆ 7 s function theories. Basic implementations were demonstrated using simple homogeneous and heterogeneous atomic chain examples. The thermal impact of lattice strain was studied in a strained Si/Ge thin film and was shown to be less important than the heterogeneous material effect. The thermal boundary resistance of a single Si/Ge interface was obtained and compared well with the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) at low temperatures. Ballistic behavior of phonons was illustrated through length-dependence and multi-interface case studies. The AGF method was also extended to calculate the thermal conductance of a nanowire-plane junction structure. A method to evaluate self-energy matrices of the abrupt interface was introduced. The dependence of thermal transport on nanowire diameter and length were investigated. Normalized thermal conductance of nanowire-plane junction structure converges with thin-film conductance at large nanowire diameters. Increasing nanowire length reduces thermal conductance due to the weakened coupling between contacts and the device. ...|$|E

40|$|The ALICE TPC [1] is an 88 m 3 {{detector}} {{filled with}} a Ne-CO 2 [90 - 10] gas. Because the multiplicities expected {{at the time of}} the detector design were very high (dN/dy = 8000) and because of the necessary signal-to-noise ratio for achieving the required position and energy resolution, the pads of the readout wire chambers at the detector endplates must be relatively small, and the operating gas gain unprecedentedly high (2 × 10 4).

In addition, the low amount of quencher renders chambers with minor defects prone to <b>self-sustained</b> <b>discharges.</b> However, no other gas mixture or composition seems to be possible, due to various constrains: flammability, ageing, multiple scattering, ion build-up, maximum field for maximum drift time, and chemical agressivity.

40|$|Characteristics of {{electrical}} breakdown of a planar magnetron enhanced with an electromagnet and a hollow-cathode structure, are studied experimentally and numerically. At lower pressures the breakdown voltage shows a {{dependence on the}} applied magnetic field, and the voltage necessary to achieve the <b>self-sustained</b> <b>discharge</b> regime can be significantly reduced. At higher pressures, the dependence is less sensitive to the magnetic field magnitude and shows a tendency of increased breakdown voltage at the stronger magnetic fields. A model of the magnetron discharge breakdown is developed with the background gas pressure and the magnetic field used as parameters. The model describes the motion of electrons, which gain energy by passing the electric field across the magnetic field and undergo collisions with neutrals, thus generating new bulk electrons. The electrons are in turn accelerated in the electric field and effectively ionize a sufficient amount of neutrals to enable the discharge self-sustainment regime.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{applications}} are emerging requiring efficient, long pulse, long-life sealed CO 2 lasers. Examples include the proposed NASA and ESA wind lidars. Electron-beam sustained discharge devices are strong contenders. Unlike <b>self-sustained</b> <b>discharges,</b> e-beam sustenance readily provides efficient performance from large volume discharges and offers pulse lengths well {{in excess of the}} microsecond or so generally associated with self-sustained devices. In the case of the e-beam sustained laser, since the plasma is externally maintained and operated at electric field strengths less than that associated with the glow to arc transition, the discharges can be run even in the presence of strongly attacking species such as O 2. Build up of large levels of attacking contaminants is nevertheless undesirable as their presence reduces the current drawn by the plasma and thus the pumping rate to the upper laser level. The impedance rise leads to a mismatch of the pulse forming network with a consequent loss of control over energy deposition, operating E/N, and gain. Clearly CO 2 dissociation rates, the influence of dissociation products on the discharge and gain, and tolerance of the discharge to these products need to be determined.

40|$|Current-voltage {{characteristics}} of the planar magnetron are studied experimentally and by numerical simulation. Based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, {{a model of the}} planar magnetron discharge is developed with the background gas pressure and magnetic field used as parameters. The discharge pressure was varied in a range of 0. 7 - 1. 7 Pa, the magnetic field of the magnetron was of 0. 033 - 0. 12 T near the cathode surface, the discharge current was from 1 to 25 A, and the magnetic field lines were tangential to the substrate surface in the region of the magnetron discharge ignition. The discharge model describes the motion of energetic secondary electrons that gain energy by passing the cathode sheath across the magnetic field, and the power required to sustain the plasma generation in the bulk. The plasma electrons, in turn, are accelerated in the electric field and ionize effectively the background gas species. The model {{is based on the assumption}} about the prevailing Bohm mechanism of electron conductivity across the magnetic field.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{introduced}} a novel gas sensor that works by fingerprinting the ionization breakdown {{characteristics of the}} unknown gases. This technique provides excellent selectivity; it is well established that at a constant temperature and pressure, every gas displays a unique breakdown electric field. In addition, because this technique does not involve adsorption or desorption of gases, the sensor exhibits a fast response and is not limited by considerations of reversibility and recovery. We employed vertically-aligned, self-standing arrays of gold nanowires (AuNWs) {{at one of the}} electrodes of a miniature parallel-plate ionization cell. The AuNW arrays were synthesized using a tailored version of the electrochemical template-assisted technique, resulting freestanding structures with controlled sparseness. Individual AuNWs, owing to their nanoscale tips, generate very high non-linear electric fields near their tips that provoke the breakdown process due to formation of a corona and allow <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>discharges</b> to be created at relatively low voltages. In an alternative approach, we exploited the tunneling field ionization characteristics of the gases to identify the unknown gas type and measure its concentration. The phenomenon of field ionization consists of electron tunneling from gas atoms (molecules) through a potential barrier into a vacant energy level of the conduction band of a metal. It has been widely used in field-ion microscopy and mass spectrometry. However, the electric fields required to field-ionize gaseous species are in the range of 2 - 5 V/Å, orders of magnitude higher than the breakdown fields. With the provision of low voltage operation, this method can be utilized in detection of gases at very low concentrations.
