50|$|Scottish or <b>Scots</b> <b>units</b> of {{measurement}} are the {{weights and measures}} peculiar to Scotland which were nominally replaced by English units in 1685 but continued {{to be used in}} unofficial contexts until at least the late 18th century. The system was based on the ell (length), stone (mass), and boll and firlot (volume). This official system coexisted with local variants, especially for the measurement of land area.|$|R
50|$|After the Truce of Altmark of 1629, Aston left Poland for {{the service}} of Sweden and was {{commissioned}} by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to raise an English regiment in 1631. His unit was shipped from Britain in 1632, but fought in the secondary theatres of Germany, never attaining the fame of <b>Scots</b> <b>units</b> such as Mackay's Regiment. Its strength had fallen so much, mostly due to sickness, that by 1634 Aston was recruiting Germans to fill the ranks.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Scots</b> <b>units</b> {{of length}} were {{technically}} {{replaced by the}} English system by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland in 1685, and the other units by the Treaty of Union with England in 1706. However many continued to be used locally during the 18th century. The introduction of the Imperial system by the Weights and Measures Act 1824 saw the end of any formal use in trade and commerce, although some informal use as customary units continued into the 20th century. [...] "Scotch measure" [...] or [...] "Cunningham measure" [...] was brought to parts of Ulster in Ireland by Ulster Scots settlers, and used into the mid-19th century.|$|R
25|$|When James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, England and Scotland had different systems of measure. Superficially the English and the <b>Scots</b> <b>units</b> of measure were similar – many {{had the same}} names – but there were differences in their sizes: in particular the Scots pint and gallon were {{more than twice the}} size of their English counterparts. In 1707, under the Act of Union, the Parliaments of England and Scotland were merged and the English units of measurement became the standard for the whole new Kingdom of Great Britain. The practical effect of this was that both systems were used in Scotland, and the Scottish measures remained in common use until the Weights and Measures Act 1824 outlawed them.|$|R
5000|$|Previous {{captains of}} the 19th Tennessee Infantry Reenactors were Scott Templeton, Jerry Nave, Richard Gouge, Richard Ragle and <b>Scot</b> Koenig. The <b>unit</b> is {{currently}} commanded by Captain Ric Dulaney ...|$|R
2500|$|Charles Stuart's Jacobite army {{consisted}} {{largely of}} Catholics and Scottish Episcopalians – mainly Scots {{but with a}} small detachment of Englishmen from the Manchester Regiment. The Jacobites were supported and supplied by the Kingdom of France from Irish and <b>Scots</b> <b>units</b> in French service. A composite battalion of infantry ("Irish [...] "), comprising detachments {{from each of the}} regiments of the Irish Brigade plus one squadron of Irish in the French army, served at the battle alongside the regiment of Royal Scots (...) raised the previous year to support the Stuart claim. The British Government (Hanoverian loyalist) forces were mostly Protestants – English, along with a significant number of Scottish Lowlanders and Highlanders, a battalion of Ulstermen, and some Hessians from Germany, and Austrians. The quick and bloody battle on Culloden Moor was over in less than an hour, when after an unsuccessful Highland charge against the government lines, the Jacobites were routed and driven from the field.|$|R
50|$|Anstice was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Tank Corps on 7 April 1916 and from August that year he saw service in France and Belgium {{until the end}} of the First World War. In October 1922, he was transferred to the 5th Battalion Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. Between January 1934 and September 1937, Anstice was Adjutant of The Lanarkshire Yeomanry, a <b>Scots</b> Territorial Army <b>unit.</b> In 1939, he returned to the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, this time as Commanding Officer, taking the unit to France.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, it escaped {{physical}} damage from bombing or ground fighting: {{it had been}} used as a mustering base for the British 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards, who were joined there on 28 March 1944 by 'S' Company <b>Scots</b> Guards. These <b>units</b> were in the town of Cassino when the German army withdrew on 17 - 18 May. In the battle of Monte Piccolo on 27 May 1944, 'S' Company and the 2nd Coldstreams suffered heavy casualties clearing the defending 14 Kompanie, 4th Regiment of the German 1st Parachute Division from the hill so that Route 6 could be opened up for the advance on Rome.|$|R
50|$|The 11th (Service) Battalion was a hostilities-only {{battalion}} {{raised in}} 1940, originally as the 50th (Holding) Battalion, whose {{role was to}} temporarily 'hold' men who were medically unfit, awaiting orders, on courses or returning from abroad. In October 1940 the battalion was redesignated the 11th Battalion. The 11th Battalion served in the garrison of Malta during the Siege with the 233rd Infantry Brigade. In July 1944 {{it was to be}} disbanded but instead it transferred to the 66th Infantry Brigade, serving alongside the 2nd Battalion, Royal <b>Scots,</b> a Regular <b>unit,</b> and 1st Battalion, Hertfordshire Regiment, a Territorial. The brigade became part of 1st Infantry Division which was serving in the Italian Campaign, where it took part in the fighting on the Gothic Line, suffering severe casualties. Early in 1945 the 11th Battalion was transferred to Palestine {{with the rest of the}} 1st Infantry Division and remained there for the rest of the war.|$|R
5000|$|In 1631 the Scottish brigades in the Swedish main (Crown) army {{marched to}} Leipzig, while other <b>Scots</b> and English <b>units</b> served with James 3rd Marquis Hamilton in an {{auxiliary}} British Army guarding {{the rear of}} the army. The famous Battle of Breitenfield (also known as the Battle of Leipzig) took place, near Leipzig, in September of that year. Tilly was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus and the Munros, who by their last charge contributed most to the victory of the Swedish Army. Sir James Ramsay was in command of the Scottish vanguard, and then it was on 7 September [...] "after we had in the early morning, as the larke begunne to peep commended ourselbes and the event of the day to God," [...] that the great battle commenced. Whilst the Imperial cavalry scattered the Saxons on the left wing, the Scottish stood firm, firing {{for the first time in}} platoons. Hepburn formed a square and, when the Austrians had approached near enough, caused his victorious pikemen to advance. In the meantime Lord Reay’s MacKay and Munro Highlanders were equally successful.|$|R
5000|$|Outnumbered {{and with}} many wounded, the 99 {{surviving}} Royal Norfolks made a final push {{into an open}} field but eventually, under the orders of their commander, Major Lisle Ryder, the Royal Norfolks surrendered to the German forces. Due to {{the boundary between the}} Royal Scots and Royal Norfolk regiments being a road, the Norfolks surrendered not to the German company they had been fighting but to the 2nd Infantry Regiment (SS-Hauptsturmführer and Obersturmbannführer Fritz Knöchlein) of the SS Division Totenkopf, which had been fighting the 1st Royal <b>Scots</b> nearby. The <b>unit</b> was already notorious for their ruthlessness and had been engaged in [...] "mopping up" [...] operations against Allied forces to the north and east of Cambrai. The 99 prisoners were marched to farm buildings nearby and lined up along a barn wall. They were then fired on by two machine guns; Knöchlein armed his men with bayonets to kill any survivors. 97 Norfolks were killed and their bodies then buried in a shallow pit. Privates Albert Pooley and William O'Callaghan hid in a pigsty and were discovered later by the farm's owner, Mme Creton and her son. The two were later captured by a Wehrmacht unit and {{spent the rest of the}} war as prisoners of war (POWs).|$|R
