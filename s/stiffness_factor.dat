Potato tubers under different water irrigation (fresh water and treated water) {{were divided into two}} mass groups (90 - 180 g), M 1, and (1 - 90 g), M 2. Tubers dropped from four heights (40, 30, 20, 10 cm) onto the different surfaces and the different impact parameters were measured. Results showed impact damage measured in terms of bruise diameter is highly influenced by the impact surfaces. Steel surface inflicted the greatest impact damage on the tubers. Impact energy of tuber is greatly influenced by drop height and mass of tuber.

According to current design provisions, slab stiffness under lateral loads should account for stiffness reduction due to the effects of cracks. Several researchers have conducted for evaluating the stiffness reduction in flat plate slab systems under lateral loads.

We explore here the feasibility using patient-specific cardiac computer modeling to capture diastolic parameters in patients suffering from different degrees of systolic HF. Fifty eight patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have undergone thorough clinical evaluation, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), heart catheterization, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarker assessment. A previously-introduced framework for creating multi-scale patient-specific cardiac models has been applied on all these patients. Novel parameters, such as global <b>stiffness</b> <b>factor</b> and maximum left ventricular active stress, representing cardiac active and passive tissue properties have been computed for all patients.
