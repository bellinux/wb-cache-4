Given the right set of feature vectors, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) {{have been shown to}} perform reasonably well for the classification. In this paper, we address the following question: how does the choice of a kernel function and its parameters affect the SVM classification performance in such a system?

Twenty-seven hospital <b>staffs</b> (<b>mean</b> age: 29. 4 yr) in a stress management group and 28 hospital <b>staffs</b> (<b>mean</b> age: 29. 5 yr) in a wait-list group answered evaluation surveys at both pre- and post-intervention. Self-administered questionnaires including items on job stress, coping strategies, and interpersonal behaviors were evaluated. The stress management program was given six different participant groups: 3 groups were the stress management group and 3 groups were the wait-list group. The program increased active coping and decreased dependent behavior scores significantly in the stress management group, while decreasing assertive behavior scores in the wait-list group. A comparison of the education sub-groups showed that the first group had significantly increased assertiveness and decreased dependency scores. The second group had significantly decreased depression-anxiety scores. The data analyzed {{for men and women}} separately showed the stress management intervention significantly improved active coping and assertive behavior in men and dependent behavior in women. A brief one-time stress management program can be effective in improving active coping and assertive behaviors as well as reducing dependent behavior in hospital staffs.

40|$|Introduction: Since 2008, Spain {{has been}} in the throes of an {{economic}} crisis. This recession particularly affects the living conditions of vulnerable populations, and has also led to a reversal in social policies and a reduction in resources. In this context, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore intimate partner violence (IPV) service providers' perceptions of the impact of the current economic crisis on these resources in Spain and on their capacity to respond to immigrant women's needs experiencing IPV. Methods: A qualitative study was performed based on 43 semi-structured in-depth interviews to social workers, psychologists, intercultural mediators, judges, lawyers, police officers and health professionals from different services dealing with IPV (both, public and NGO's) and cities in Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Alicante) in 2011. Transcripts were imported into qualitative analysis software (Atlas. ti), and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: We identified four categories related to the perceived impact of the current economic crisis: a) "Immigrant women have it harder now", b) "IPV and immigration resources are the first in line for cuts", c) " Fewer <b>staff</b> <b>means</b> a less effective service" and d) "Equality and IPV policies are no longer a government priority". A cross-cutting theme emerged from these categories: immigrant women are triply affected; by IPV, by the crisis, and by structural violence. Conclusion: The professionals interviewed felt that present resources in Spain are insufficient to meet the needs of immigrant women, and that the situation might worsen in the future...|$|E
40|$|Background Miscommunication in the {{healthcare}} sector can be life-threatening. The rising number of migrant patients and foreign-trained <b>staff</b> <b>means</b> that communication errors between a healthcare practitioner and patient when one or both are speaking a second language are increasingly likely. However, there is limited research that addresses this issue systematically. This protocol outlines a hospital-based study examining interactions between healthcare practitioners and their patients who either share or do not share a first language. Of particular interest are the nature and efficacy of communication in language-discordant conversations, {{and the degree to}} which risk is communicated. Our aim is to understand language barriers and miscommunication that may occur in healthcare settings between patients and healthcare practitioners, especially where at least one of the speakers is using a second (weaker) language. Methods/Design Eighty individual interactions between patients and practitioners who speak either English or Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) as their first language will be video recorded in a range of in- and out-patient departments at three hospitals in the Metro South area of Brisbane, Australia. All participants will complete a language background questionnaire. Patients will also complete a short survey rating the effectiveness of the interaction. Recordings will be transcribed and submitted to both quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine elements of the language used that might be particularly problematic and the extent to which language concordance and discordance impacts on the quality of the patient-practitioner consultation. Discussion Understanding the role that language plays in creating barriers to healthcare is critical for healthcare systems that are experiencing an increasing range of culturally and linguistically diverse populations both amongst patients and practitioners. The data resulting from this study will inform policy and practical solutions for communication training, provide an agenda for future research, and extend theory in health communication...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} Academic Language and Learning (ALL) staff are {{expanding}} across the university sector in Australia. Duties include generic workshop delivery, one-to-one advising, and resource development {{as well as}} curricula development with embedded academic skills, design of rubrics, professional development for staff, team teaching assignment-specific workshops, and creating videos and recorded resources for online learning environments. Thus, universities seek to recruit ALL staff {{with a wide range}} of skills, experience and qualifications to fit such a diverse, expanding role. The widening scope of work of ALL <b>staff</b> <b>means</b> that a re-articulation of an ALL identity is needed. This study investigates the minimum professional requirements (MPRs) required in ALL recruitment, the training of ALL staff and the preferred pedagogy when advising individual students. A questionnaire was distributed electronically to Managers of Academic Skills Centres across 39 universities in Australia, with a 72 % response rate. The Managers were selected given their direct decision-making in ALL recruitment and training. Results of the study indicated that a significant proportion of ALL units exist centrally, with some working in consultation with cross-disciplinary professionals, including Educational Designers and Librarians. Despite this, the range of responsibilities and skills required of ALL staff was extensive. Barthel’s (2013) benchmarking reveals the range of the work carried out by ALL staff in Australia but not the experience or qualifications required. Cameron et al (2005) and Moore (2012) noted a preference for ALL staff with teaching qualifications and/or experience. Our study broadly confirmed this but also highlighted a range of preferred qualifications and experience. These ‘preferred’ qualifications (such as a PhD) and ‘preferred’ experience (such as one-to-one advising) indicate a transition for ALL from a niche field to one which is much more broadly based. A field where MPRs are less clearly defined than in other areas of student support (Careers Advising, for example) and a field presenting significant challenges for ALL managers seeking to identify suitable candidates with a complex combination of qualifications and experience. It is also interesting to note that many managers indicated the need to train staff post recruitment (in areas such as e-learning). In addition, managers highlighted the importance of using peer-to-peer modelling and shadowing of developmental teaching and advising approaches when training new ALL staff. The study also explored preferred pedagogy when ALL staff teach and consult one-to-one. Chanock (2007) noted this ten years ago and a literature review reveals little subsequent investigation around this important question except for Moore (2012) who found ALL staff working with students to co-construct knowledge. Thus, a gap remains regarding the articulation of advising pedagogy. This research into the current MPRs and preferred pedagogies of Australian University ALL centres provides a thought-provoking context around shared standards, expectations and responsibilities in the ALL field. The snapshot provided by this study serves as a benchmark to inform our understanding of the current ALL identity and how our positions are changing in the current higher education climate...|$|E

40|$|Registered nurses [RNs] {{experiences}} of caring in nursing, working conditions for caring and reflection in municipal night care was explored to create expanded {{knowledge and understanding}} of care for older people. As a consequence of the Ädelreform and development in hospital health care a displacement from clinical health care to municipal care of older people has taken place. Night RNs work in the complex municipal care of older people implies single handed work in a consultative function. The RNs are distanced from the care receivers; it is care staff who mainly perform bed side caring. Municipal RNs care for older people during nights means trusting their own knowledge and reflective ability, in having nursing responsibility for large groups of old care recipients. This thesis takes point of departure in a qualitative research approach, with four empirical studies. These have been accomplished in a medium sized municipality in the middle parts of Sweden. The aims of the part studies were: to elucidate municipal night nurses {{experiences of}} the meaning of caring in nursing (I), to explore Swedish municipal night nurses experiences of their working conditions for caring in nursing (II), to examine the caring for care staff offered by municipal night nurses, in the setting of old care recipients people enrolled in the municipal social care system (III) and to describe nurses conception of reflection in their working situation (IV). Data were collected with interviews (I, II, IV), diary notes (II) and participative observations (III). The data were analyzed with phenomenological hermeneutics (I), thematic content analysis (II, III) and phenomenography (IV). The results reveal that night RNs caring in nursing means the paradoxes: being close at a distance, being responsible without control and being independently dependent. Caring in nursing means a caring stance in prioritizing and taking responsibility for care recipients and care of care staff (I). Night RNs caring is dependent on the organization and care staff, and is complex {{by the fact that the}} RNs are not care staff leaders. The RNs autonomy prerequisite the ability to handle their work, which mainly means mediated caring communicated by telephone (II). The night RNs care of care <b>staff</b> <b>means</b> an informal nursing leadership. With their medical competence and authority the RNs occupy a superior caring leader function in nursing (III). Reflection is conceptualized as an instrument to handle the working situation and requires capacity of presence, flexibility and courage. To reflect is experienced to use knowledge, ethics and also personal values, in considering, estimating and assessing caring situations and actions (IV). The conclusion of the studies (I-V) is that the night RNs caring is dependent on the prerequisites described in the dimensions of the organization, self-understanding and vocational and professional relations. The RNs must be able to reflect and handle the situation of caring at a distance, without loosing the vocational fundamental condition of caring, though the consultant function implies that they seldom encounter the care recipients. Increased quality, development and creating possibilities for dignity in care for older people means the RNs must participate more in bed side caring. The RNs should also be caring leaders and be given the opportunity for adequate specialist training in gerontology nursing...|$|E

Results: Less than half of the participating aged care staff had received any training in depression, with particularly low rates in residential care. Although {{aware of the importance of}} engaging with depressed care recipients and demonstrating moderate knowledge of the symptoms of depression, a substantial proportion of staff members saw depression as a natural consequence of bereavement, aging or relocation to aged care. Conclusion: Experience in aged care appears to be insufficient for staff to develop high levels of knowledge of depression.

40|$|Aims: The overall {{objective}} was to summarise the best evidence available on safe staffing levels for qualified learning disability nurses to inform {{the implementation of the}} national Compassion into Practice Programme sub group for learning disability nursing; task area 5 ‘Ensuring we have the right staff with the right skills in the right place’. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and JBI data extraction tools were used. Main findings: There are seven key factors that impact on staffing: 1. Level of need 2. Staff perception of challenging behaviour 3. Stress, burnout and work overload 4. Staff attributes 5. Job satisfaction 6. Working as a team 7. Organizational support including feedback. Conclusions: There is need for an articulated agreement as to exactly what compassion and safe <b>staffing</b> <b>means,</b> and to whom. Services {{need to be able to}} articulate what <b>staffing</b> levels <b>mean</b> for the patient and or their relatives. Safe levels of staffing must ensure this means more than simply keeping people safe, although essential; it must also be able to offer a therapeutic milieu. It may be that services have to avoid the temptation of seeking comfort in the belief that numbers alone will address short comings in services rather than for example looking at the capability of teams to be empowered to deliver safe and compassionate nursing care. There is need for further work to validate the findings from the review of literature. This should include; 1. documentary analysis of all serious incidents in learning disability services and, or, clients that are directly or indirectly related to staffing issues in England/UK; 2. a survey of all learning disability nurses working in ‘inpatient’ care settings to better understand how they believe safer staffing and the delivery of compassionate care can be achieved, and identify what barriers they believe compromise it; and 3. semi structured interviews with people with learning disabilities and, or, their families about what safe staffing might look like for them, as well as with ‘key players’, clinicians, and stakeholders on safe and compassionate staffing levels...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This action-research study {{conducted}} in a Swiss male post-trial detention centre (120 detainees and 120 staff) explored the attitudes of detainees and staff towards tobacco smoking. Tackling public health matters through research involving stakeholders in prisons implies benefits and risks that need exploration. STUDY DESIGN: The observational study involved multiple strands (quantitative and qualitative components, and air quality measurements). This article presents qualitative data on participants' attitudes and expectations about research in a prison setting. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the attitudes of detainees and staff towards smoking before and after a smoke-free regulation change in the prison in 2009. Specific coding and thematic content analysis for research were performed {{with the support of}} ATLAS. ti. RESULTS: In total, 77 interviews were conducted (38 before the regulation change and 39 after the regulation change) with 31 detainees (mean age 35 years, range 22 - 60 years) and 27 prison <b>staff</b> (<b>mean</b> age 46 years, range 29 - 65 years). Both detainees and staff expressed satisfaction regarding their involvement in the study, and wished to be informed about the results.

CONCLUSION: Active involvement of stakeholders promotes public health. Interviewing detainees and prison staff as part of an action-research study aimed at tackling a public health matter is a way of raising awareness and facilitating change in prisons.
