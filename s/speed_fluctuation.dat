50|$|Insofar as the {{tangential}} force {{is the one}} acting {{in the direction of}} travel, {{tangential force}} variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the tangential force will change. As the tire rotates it exerts a high traction force to accelerate the vehicle and maintain its speed under constant velocity. Under steady-state conditions it would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. This variation would be characterized as TFV. In a constant velocity test condition, TFV would be manifested as a small <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuation</b> occurring every rotation due to the change in rolling radius of the tire. TFV is not measured in production testing.|$|E
50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|E

The exponent was a = 2. 0 + or - 0. 05 for all of the spectra considered, which is the exponent for a series of steps and for Burgers' (1971) turbulence. Spectra of large-scale <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuations</b> also have the form f exp - b from a period of a few hours to periods greater than 13 days in the region from 1 AU to 8. 9 AU.

5000|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of {{drive systems}} usually {{result in a}} significant fluctuation of the rotational speed of the rotor of the driving electric motor. Such oscillations of the angular speed superimposed on the average rotor rotational speed cause more or less severe perturbation of the electromagnetic flux and thus additional oscillations of the electric currents in the motor windings. Then, the generated electromagnetic torque is also characterized by additional variable in time components which induce torsional vibrations of the drive system. According to the above, mechanical vibrations of the drive system become coupled with the electrical vibrations of currents in the motor windings. Such a coupling is often complicated in character and thus computationally troublesome. Because of this reason, till present majority of authors used to simplify the matter regarding mechanical vibrations of drive systems and electric current vibrations in the motor windings as mutually uncoupled. Then, the mechanical engineers applied the electromagnetic torques generated by the electric motors as ‘a priori‘ assumed excitation functions of time or of the rotor-to-stator slip, e.g. in paper [...] usually basing on numerous experimental measurements carried out for the given electric motor dynamic behaviours. For this purpose, by means of measurement results, proper approximate formulas have been developed, which describe respective electromagnetic external excitations produced by the electric motor,. However, the electricians thoroughly modelled electric current flows in the electric motor windings, but they usually reduced the mechanical drive system to one or seldom to at most a few rotating rigid bodies, as e.g. in [...] In many cases, such simplifications yield sufficiently useful results for engineering applications, but very often they can lead to remarkable inaccuracies, since many qualitative dynamic properties of the mechanical systems, e.g. their mass distribution, torsional flexibility and damping effects, are being neglected. Thus, an influence of drive system vibratory behaviour on the electric machine rotor angular <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> {{and in this way}} on the electric current oscillations in the rotor and stator windings, can not be investigated with a satisfactory precision.|$|E

Passive drag and the passive drag coefficient were estimated using the gliding decay velocity method after a maximal push-off from the wall while being fully immersed. The technique drag index was also assessed as a ratio between active and passive drag.

Thus rapid variation of wind speed due {{to changes in the}} local meteorological conditions can lead to electrical power variations of the order of the nominal power output, in particular when wind power variations on very short time scales, range at few seconds to 1 h, are considered. In small grid as they exist on islands (Guadeloupean Archipelago: French West Indies) such fluctuations can cause instabilities in case of intermediate power shortages.

Nevertheless, the effect of rotation speed on the vibration became significant when the speed is non-stationary. In this case, instantaneous speed could be measured by using a tachometer signal and use to take account the speed for diagnostic. The rotating machine instantaneous speed provided by the tacho {{is also a very}} useful information. It could be sensitive to mechanical faults [1] and be used for diagnostic. It is also requested for computed order tracking [2]. Since, a tachometer speed signal is not always available, instantaneous speed have to be estimated from other signal like the accelerometric signal. Some instantaneous speed extraction methods are described in the MSSP Special Issue on Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) Processing and Angular Applications of [3]. These methods use analytic signal, parametric approach, [...] . Another approach based on cepstrum was proposed in the Surveillance 8 Contest.

40|$|Planetary gear {{is widely}} used in {{engineering}} and usually has symmetrical structure. As the number of teeth in contact changes during rotation, the time-varying mesh stiffness parametrically excites the planetary gear and may cause severe vibrations and instabilities. Taking speed fluctuations into account, the time-varying mesh stiffness is frequency modulated, and therefore sideband instabilities may arise and original instabilities are significantly affected. Considering two different speed fluctuations, original and sideband instabilities are numerically and analytically investigated. A rotational lumped-parameter model of the planetary gear is developed, in which the time-varying mesh stiffness, input speed fluctuations, and damping are considered. Closed-form approximations of instability boundaries for primary and combination instabilities are obtained by perturbation analysis and verified by numerical analysis. The effects of speed fluctuations and damping on parametric instability are systematically examined. Because of the frequency modulation, whether a parametric instability occurs cannot be simply predicted by the planet meshing phase which is applicable to constant speed. Besides adjusting the planet meshing phase, <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuation</b> supplies a new thought to minimize certain instability by adjusting the amplitude or frequency of the <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> Both original and sideband instabilities are shrunken by damping, and <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuation</b> further shrinks the original instability...|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of rolling}} element bearings is of major {{importance to the}} vast majority of rotating machines. Due to the varying assembly compliance and the internal clearance existing in the bearing in most cases, a highly non-linear behaviour of the rotor bearing system appears. Thus, a dynamic model of a horizontal rotor supported on ball bearings with radial internal clearance is considered, taking into account contact forces between the balls and the races, as well as the effect of varying compliance and of the internal radial clearance. However, since rotational <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of various levels practically appear in all rotating equipment, their effect is now additionally considered. Their effect is examined in two characteristic rotor bearing cases. The analysis includes all the characteristic states of the dynamic behaviour of the rotor, such as periodic, unstable periodic and chaotic responses, using methods like frequency spectra, phase spaces, higher-order Poincare maps and Lyapunov exponents. All results presented show a dominant stabilization effect of the <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuations</b> with respect to the system behaviour. From the analysis performed, it is concluded that even a minimum fluctuation of the rotor speed may result in major changes of the system dynamics, indicating that <b>speed</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of the rotor are a governing parameter for the dynamic behaviour of the system.
