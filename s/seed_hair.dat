This piece {{was intended to}} be displayed as a hands-on, dual-sided table cover. This research combined poplar <b>seed</b> <b>hair</b> fibers (cottonwood) with wool fibers, which were felted to silk chiffon. The color scheme and aesthetic was inspired by cotton candy. Cotton candy shares the open, light and airy essence of cottonwood <b>seed</b> <b>hair</b> fibers. The cottonwood fibers were washed and carded. In addition, the silk illustrates decorative fabric manipulation methods which included fold and clamp dye resist techniques, dye discharge, and felting. It was discovered that cottonwood seed fiber hairs accepted dye when manually manipulated, and lent themselves to being felted when mixed with wool roving.

40|$|Each {{cotton fiber}} is a {{single-celled}} seed trichome or hair, and over 20, 000 fibers may develop semi-synchronously on each seed. The molecular basis for <b>seed</b> <b>hair</b> development is unknown but {{is likely to}} share many similarities with leaf trichome development in Arabidopsis. Leaf trichome initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana is activated by GLABROUS 1 (GL 1) that is negatively regulated by TRIPTYCHON (TRY). Using laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis, we found that many putative MYB transcription factor and structural protein genes were differentially expressed in fiber and non-fiber tissues. Gossypium hirsutum MYB 2 (GhMYB 2), a putative GL 1 homolog, and its downstream gene, GhRDL 1, were highly expressed during fiber cell initiation. GhRDL 1, a fiber-related gene with unknown function, was predominately localized around cell walls in stems, sepals, seed coats, and pollen grains. GFP:GhRDL 1 and GhMYB 2 :YFP were co-localized in the nuclei of ectopic trichomes in siliques. Overexpressing GhRDL 1 or GhMYB 2 in A. thaliana Columbia- 0 (Col- 0) activated fiber-like hair production in 4 - 6 % of seeds and had on obvious effects on trichome development in leaves or siliques. Co-overexpressing GhRDL 1 and GhMYB 2 in A. thaliana Col- 0 plants increased hair formation in ∼ 8 % of seeds. Overexpressing both GhRDL 1 and GhMYB 2 in A. thaliana Col- 0 try mutant plants produced <b>seed</b> <b>hair</b> in ∼ 10 % of seeds as well as dense trichomes inside and outside siliques, suggesting synergistic effects of GhRDL 1 and GhMYB 2 with try on development of trichomes {{inside and outside of}} siliques and <b>seed</b> <b>hair</b> in A. thaliana. These data suggest that a different combination of factors is required for the full development of trichomes (hairs) in leaves, siliques, and seeds.

40|$|Aeschynanthus (Gesneriaceae) {{is a large}} genus of {{tropical}} epiphytes that is widely distributed from the Himalayas and China throughout South-East Asia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) consensus sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of Aeschynanthus nuclear ribosomal DNA showed sequence polymorphism that was difficult to interpret. Cloning individual sequences from the PCR product generated a phylogenetic tree of 23 Aeschynanthus species (two clones per species). The intraindividual clone pairs varied from 0 to 5. 01 %. We suggest that the high intraindividual sequence variation results from low molecular drive in the ITS of Aeschynanthus. However, this study shows that, despite the variation found within some individuals, {{it is still possible}} to use these data to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of the species, suggesting that clone variation, although persistent, does not pre-date the divergence of Aeschynanthus species.

40|$|Poplar <b>seed</b> <b>hair</b> fibers, {{harvested}} from the seed pods {{of one of}} the most common trees grown in the United States, have properties that make them ideal fibers for thermal insulation applications. This preliminary study examines some physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics of poplar fiber in relation to wool, down, and polyester. Results show that when compared to wool and down, poplar fiber has a finer diameter, is lighter in weight, and exhibits the highest fill power, a measure of a fiber’s ability to retain bulk. Thermal insulation tests reveal that although slightly less than down, poplar fiber has similar thermal resistance value (Rct) to that of wool and hollow polyester. In addition, the poplar fiber’s exceptionally large hollow core and its ability to resist wetting after treatments of solvents and laundering strongly suggest that poplar fiber has great potential as an environmentally friendly, effective, and lightweight textile bulk insulator.

The fluffy <b>seed</b> <b>hairs</b> have been used as the traditional background for mounted butterflies and other insects. The compressed floss has a beautiful silk-like sheen. The plant has also been explored for commercial use of its bast (inner bark) fiber which is both strong and soft. U. S. Department of Agriculture studies in the 1890s and 1940s found that common milkweed has more potential for commercial processing than any other indigenous bast fiber plant, with estimated yields as high as hemp and quality as good as flax. Both the bast fiber and the floss were used historically by Native Americans for cordage and textiles. Milkweed oil from the seeds can be easily converted into cinnamic acid, which is a very potent sunscreen when used at a 1-5% concentration.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{valuable}} fibres {{are located in}} the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), ropes, yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the fibre node, that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. <b>Seed</b> <b>hairs,</b> such as cotton, do not have nodes.|$|R

40|$|In {{the fine}} arts {{synthetic}} products are generally scorned as substrates for pigments and other media. Why are man-made fibers generally considered unsuitable as means of artistic expression? Why are natural fibers preferred? Is it just a traditional artistic prejudice? The material used in paper making is mainly cellulose from wood pulp or cotton. Even man-made cellulose products such as rayon fibers can’t be used exclusively for paper because they don’t adhere to each other properly. Canvases are usually made from traditional materials like cotton or linen and supported on wooden stretcher bars. A woven fabric doesn’t need adherent fiber properties like paper does but the coarsely woven, slightly rough texture of natural fibers absorbs the materials used for priming canvases in a useful manner to create a suitable surface for oil pigments.

40|$|Background: Pods of {{the vanilla}} orchid (Vanilla planifolia) {{accumulate}} {{large amounts of}} the flavor compound vanillin (3 -methoxy, 4 -hydroxy-benzaldehyde) as a glucoside during the later stages of their development. At earlier stages, the developing seeds within the pod synthesize a novel lignin polymer, catechyl (C) lignin, in their coats. Genomic resources for determining the biosynthetic routes to these compounds and other flavor components in V. planifolia are currently limited. Results: Using next-generation sequencing technologies, we have generated very large gene sequence datasets from vanilla pods {{at different times of}} development, and representing different tissue types, including the <b>seeds,</b> <b>hairs,</b> placental and mesocarp tissues. This developmental series was chosen as being the most informative for interrogation of pathways of vanillin and C-lignin biosynthesis in the pod and seed, respectively. The combined 454 /Illumina RNA-seq platforms provide both deep sequence coverage and high quality de novo transcriptome assembly for this non-model crop species. Conclusions: The annotated sequence data provide a foundation for understanding multiple aspects of the biochemistry and development of the vanilla bean, as exemplified by the identification of candidate genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Our transcriptome data indicate that C-lignin formation in the seed coat involves coordinate expression of monolignol biosynthetic genes with the exception of those encoding the caffeoyl coenzyme A 3 -O-methyltransferase for conversion of caffeoyl to feruloyl moieties.

Specific moisture content critical points for the onset of imbibitional injury at either 25 degrees C (0. 18 and 0. 27 g/g for Cuore di bue and Allflesh 1120, respectively) or 5 degrees C (0. 31 g/g for both hybrids) were determined. In addition, imbibition temperature affected the rate of germination decline across the different moisture contents. The hybrid with the lower seed vigour had higher critical moist-Lire content after which there was a linear decline in germination. Leakage rates were not similar to imbibition rates (peak of leakage at 0. 24 to 0. 26 g/g compared to peak of imbibition at 0. 1 to 0. 15 g/g). It is suggested a specific structure of the seed coat called semipermeable layer would {{play a significant role}} in regulating the electrolyte leakage. Chilling imbibition (5 degrees C) had a significant effect on numbers of atypical seedlings. Seed surface micrographs (SEM) revealed the existence of a dense network of surface <b>seed</b> <b>hairs</b> that facilitated imbibition by increasing the contact area of seed to water. Cross sections of hybrid I (Allflesh I 180) seeds, revealed the presence of gaps between the embryo and the endosperm. Those gaps were the free water accumulation area and therefore those seeds would be more exposed to imbibition damage compared to seeds of hybrid 11 (Cuore di bue) that lacked the gaps.
