40|$|A {{quality control}} method for {{combined}} online monitoring of weather radar antenna pointing biases and receiver calibration using solar signals detected by an operational radar is adapted for application to midrange radar data (80 - 150 km). As the original method was developed using long-range data, additional criteria based on robust statistical estimators are imposed {{in the sun}} signature detection and selection process, allowing to discard observations biased by ground clutter or precipitation and to remove very influential outliers. The validity ranges of the physical model describing the <b>solar</b> <b>interferences</b> detected by the scanning radar antenna are explicitly defined and an equation for estimation of the effective scanning width in reception is provided in a thorough theoretical derivation.

A comparative study on the goodness of fit between a three- and a five-parameter model highlights the effect on the stability and accuracy of the antenna and receiver parameters retrieved for each radar system, considering the dissimilar information content of the observations collected by each radar.

40|$|The {{absolute}} calibration of a dual-polarization radar of the German Weather Service is continuously monitored using the operational birdbath scan and collocated disdrometer measurements at the Hohenpeissenberg observatory. The {{goal is to}} measure the radar reflectivity constant Z better than ± 1 dB. The assumption is that a disdrometer measurement {{close to the surface}} can be related to the radar measurement at the first far-field range bin. This is verified using a Micro Rain Radar (MRR). The MRR data fill the gap between the measurement near the surface and the far-field range bin at 650 m. Using data from {{the first half of the}} warm season in 2014, a bias in radar calibration of 1. 8 dB is found. Data from only stratiform precipitation events are considered. After adjusting the radar calibration and using an independent data sample, very good agreement is found between the radar, the MRR, and the disdrometer with a bias in smaller than 1 dB. The bias in is not captured with the classic one-point calibration, which is performed twice a day using a built-in test signal generator. This is attributed to the fact that the characterization of the transmit and receive path is not accurate enough. <b>Solar</b> <b>interferences</b> during the operational scanning are used to characterize the receiver. There, the bias found is small, about 0. 2 dB, so that bias based on the comparison of the radar with external sensors is attributed to the transmit path.

The advantage of this combination method is its capability in predicting reflector antenna patterns not only in the forward region but also in the far-out sidelobes and backlobes. To verify the analytical model, measurements were performed on the Johnson Space Center far-field antenna test facility. Good agreement between computed and measured results was obtained.

40|$|Weather radar {{data and}} its {{downstream}} products are essential elements in weather surveillance and key parameters in the initialisation and validation of hydrological and meteorological models, among other downstream applications. Following the quality standards {{established by the}} European and global weather radar networking referents, the present thesis aims {{for the improvement of}} the base data quality control in the regional weather radar network operated by the Meteorological Service of Catalonia, the XRAD. This objective is accomplished through the analysis, development and implementation of new or existing procedures and algorithms for radar data quality assessment and improvement. Attending to the current radar technology and to the already implemented quality control procedures for the XRAD, the work is focused on the continuous evaluation of the radar system calibration status and on the correction of Doppler velocity data. The quality control algorithms and recommendations presented are easily translatable to any other operative weather radar networking environment. A Sun-based, fully automatic procedure for online monitoring the antenna alignment and the receiver chain calibration is adapted and operationally implemented for the XRAD. This Sun-monitoring technique was developed at the Royal Netherlands and Finnish Meteorological Institutes and is included in the quality control flow of numerous weather radar networks around the world. The method is modified for a robust detection and characterisation of <b>solar</b> <b>interferences</b> in raw data at all scan elevations, even when only data at relatively short ranges is available. The modified detection algorithm is also suitable for detecting interferences from wireless devices, which are stored for monitoring their incidence in the XRAD. The <b>solar</b> <b>interferences</b> detected, in turn, are input observations for the inversion of a two-dimensional Gaussian model that yields estimates of the calibration parameters of interest. A complete theoretical derivation of the model establishes its validity limits and provides analytical estimates of the effective solar widths directly from radar parameters. Results of application of this Sun-monitoring methodology to XRAD data reveal its ability to determine the accuracy of the antenna pointing and to detect changes in receiver calibration and radar system operation status. In order to facilitate the usage of the Sun-monitoring technique and the interpretation of its estimates, the methodology is reproduced under controlled conditions based on the distributions of solar observations collected by two of the XRAD radars. The analysis shows that the accuracy of the estimated calibration parameters is conditioned by the precision, number and distribution of the solar observations which constitute key variables that need to be controlled to ensure reliable estimates. In addition, the Sun-monitoring technique is compared under actual operative conditions with two other common techniques for quantifying the antenna azimuth and elevation pointing offsets. Pointing bias estimates gathered in a dedicated short-term campaign are studied in a direct inter- comparison of the methods that reflects the advantages and limitations in each case. The analysis of the bias estimates reported by the methods {{in the course of a}} one-year period reveals that the performance of the techniques depends on the antenna position at the time of the measurement. After this study, a reanalysis of the Sun-monitoring method results is proposed, which allows to additionally quantify the antenna pedestal levelling error. Finally, a post-processing, spatial image filtering algorithm for identification and correction of unfolding errors in dual-PRF Doppler velocity data is proposed. The correction of these errors benefits the usage of radar velocity data in downstream applications such as wind- shear and mesocyclone detection algorithms or assimilation in numerical weather prediction models. The main strengths of the proposed algorithm, in comparison with existing correction techniques, are its robustness to the presence of clustered unfolding errors and that it can be employed independently of post-processing dealiasing algorithms. By means of simulated dual-PRF velocity fields, the correction ability of the algorithm is quantitatively analysed and discussed with particular emphasis on the correction of clustered errors. The quality improvement in real dual-PRF data brought out by the new algorithm is illustrated through application to three selected severe weather events registered by the XRAD. Seguint els estàndards de qualitat establerts per a les xarxes de radars meteorològics de referència a nivell europeu i global, la present tesi té com a objectiu la millora del control de qualitat de les dades de la xarxa regional de radars meteorològics operada pel Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya (la XRAD). Atenent als procediments de control de qualitat ja implementats per a la XRAD, el treball es centra en l'avaluació contínua de l'estat del calibratge del sistema radar i en la correcció de les dades de velocitat Doppler. Es presenta l'adaptació i aplicació d’un procediment totalment automàtic basat en el Sol, que permet la quantificació remota dels errors d'alineació de l'antena i de calibratge en recepció del radar a la XRAD. El mètode ha estat modificat per a la detecció i caracterització robusta d'interferències solars a les dades primàries de radar. Les interferències solars són utilitzades per a la inversió d'un model físic que proporciona estimacions dels paràmetres de calibratge d'interès. L'algoritme de detecció modificat també és adequat per a la identificació d'interferències procedents de dispositius electrònics externs. Aquestes interferències són emmagatzemades per al seguiment de la seva incidència a la XRAD. La metodologia solar esmentada es modelitza en condicions controlades a partir de la distribució de les observacions solars recollides per dos dels radars de la XRAD. L'anàlisi mostra que la precisió, el nombre i la distribució de les observacions solars constitueixen variables clau que necessiten ser controlades per garantir estimacions fiables dels paràmetres de calibrage. A més, la tècnica solar es compara, sota condicions operatives reals, amb altres dues tècniques habitualment emprades per a la quantificació de l'error d'apuntament de l'antena. A partir d'aquest estudi, es proposa un nou mètode d'anàlisi de les interferències solars, el cual permet quantificar l'error d'anivellament del pedestal de l'antena. Finalment, es desenvolupa i valida un algoritme de filtrat d'imatges per a la identificació i correcció dels errors característics que es donen lloc a les dades dual-PRF de velocitat Doppler. Els punts forts de l'algoritme proposat, en comparació amb les tècniques de correcció existents, són la seva robustesa en la correció d'errors agrupats i que pot emprar- se amb independència dels algoritmes de dealiasing. La millora de la qualitat de les dades reals de velocitat s'il·lustra mitjançant l'aplicació de l’algoritme a tres episodis de temps sever enregistrats per la XRAD...|$|R
40|$|During the Spacelab- 2 flight, which {{occurred}} from July 29, to August 6, 1985, a spacecraft called the Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP) {{was released from}} the shuttle to explore the plasma environment around the shuttle.

The noise has broadband intensities ranging from 1 to 5 mV/m and was observed at distances of up to 400 m from the shuttle. The highest intensities occurred in the region downstream of the shuttle and along magnetic field lines passing near the shuttle. The intensities also tended to increase during periods of high thruster activity, which provides strong evidence that the noise is caused by an interaction of the ionosphere with gaseous emissions from the shuttle, similar in many respects to the interaction of a comet with the <b>solar</b> wind.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the universe relies mostly on electromagnetism. As photons are the messengers, fundamental physics is concerned in testing their properties. Photon mass upper limits have been earlier set through pulsar observations, but new investigations are offered by the excess of dispersion measure (DM) sometimes observed with pulsar and magnetar data at low frequencies, or with the fast radio bursts (FRBs), of yet unknown origin. Arguments for the excess of DM do not reach a consensus, but are not mutually exclusive. Thus, we remind that for massive electromagnetism, dispersion goes as the inverse of the frequency squared. Thereby, new avenues are offered also by the recently operating ground observatories in 10 - 80 MHz domain and by the proposed Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio astronomy (OLFAR). The latter acts as a large aperture dish by employing a swarm of nano-satellites observing the sky {{for the first time}} in the 0. 1 - 15 MHz spectrum.

We theoretically study different structures {{based on the same}} couple of organic materials (poly- 3 -hexylthiophène (P 3 HT) as donor and [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butiryc acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor) : a 2 D photonic crystal based on a perfectly ordered P 3 HT/PCBM blend (placed in the air), a 1 D photonic crystal based on a nanostructured PEDOT:PSS (Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate)) layer embedded in a P 3 HT:PCBM host matrix (first placed in the air and then inserted in an organic solar cell) and finally a 1 D photonic crystal based on a nanostructured P 3 HT:PCBM layer covered by a metallic electrode and inserted in an OSC (with and without nanostructuration of the PEDOT:PSS layer).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} three independent projects that advance {{the development of}} broadband quantum cryptography. While each project pertains to {{a different part of}} the QKD chain, together they provide key developments in implementing QKD at bit rates that are practical for use in the modern telecommunications infrastructure. The first project comprises the bulk of the thesis and involves developing a novel source of correlated photon pairs for use in free-space QKD. This source is based on a birefringent semiconductor optical waveguide as a Kerr medium. We demonstrate the feasibility of using birefringent phase-matched four-wave mixing to generate correlated photon pairs. We further propose that, by reversing the process and pumping with conjugate wavelengths, one can use the same effect to produce entangled photon pairs with the same device. These pairs can then be used for QKD to realize the most secure and efficient quantum cryptographic data links. The second project examines the implications of operating a BB 84 QKD protocol at clock rates that are faster than the recovery time of the constituent detectors. We show that operating such systems under conventional protocols results in a security violation that allows an eavesdropper to learn significant information about the key and present a modification to the BB 84 protocol that maintains key security at fast transmission rates. This modification to the protocol will become vital to QKD viability as links become faster and clock rates go into the tens of gigahertz. We also demonstrate, rather counterintuitively, that there exists an optimal transmission rate for a QKD system that exceeds the inverse of an individual detector's dead time. The final project describes a new design for a free-space QKD link that centers around faster silicon detectors. These detectors have a peak quantum efficiency in the visible range, requiring that the system operate at a wavelength that is more susceptible to <b>solar</b> <b>interference.</b> To mitigate this effect, the link is designed around a Fraunhofer line in the solar spectrum where the background solar light levels are reduced by up to 90 %. By implementing this system, we expect at least a two-fold increase in the secret key rate, coming ever closer to the goal of a 10 Mb/s QKD system compatible with first-generation ethernet technology...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{photovoltaics}} (OPVs) is an {{area that}} has attracted much attention recently as a potential low cost, sustainable source of energy with a good potential for full-scale commercialisation. Understanding the factors that determine the efficiency of such cells is therefore a high priority, as well as developing ways to boost efficiency to commercially-useful levels. In addition to an intensive search for new materials, significant effort has been spent on ways to squeeze more performance out of existing materials, such as multijunction cells. This thesis investigates double junction tandem cells in the context of small molecule organic materials. Two different organic electron donor materials, boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and aluminium phthalocyanine chloride (ClAlPc) were used as donors in heterojunctions with C 60 to create tandem cells for this thesis. These materials have been previously used for solar cells and the absorption spectra of the donor materials complement each other, making them good candidates for tandem cell architectures. The design of the recombination layer between the cells is considered first, with silver nanoparticles demonstrated to work well as recombination centres for charges from the front and back sub-cells, necessary to avoid a charge build-up at the interface. The growth conditions for the nanoparticles are optimised, with the tandem cells outperforming the single heterojunction architecture. Optical modelling is considered as a method to improve the understanding of thin film <b>solar</b> cells, where <b>interference</b> effects from the reflective aluminium electrode are important in determining the magnitude of absorption a cell can achieve. The use of such modelling is first demonstrated in hybrid solar cells based on a SubPc donor with a titanium oxide (TiOx) acceptor; this system is ideal for observing the effects of interference as only the SubPc layer has significant absorption. The modelling is then applied to tandem cells where it is used to predict the short-circuit current (Jsc) generation of the sub-cells, which is not accessible experimentally. Current-matching is then used to predict the Jsc of the complete tandem device. As a support to the optical modelling, ellipsometry measurements of thin films of ClAlPc are presented. These films of known thickness are analysed to extract the complex refractive index for use in optical modelling calculations. A dependence of the complex refractive index on film thickness and substrate is also noted. Finally, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) technique is considered as applied to solar cells, and an additional method is proposed to characterise current balancing in asymmetric tandem cells under illumination. This technique is verified experimentally by two separate sets of data...|$|R
