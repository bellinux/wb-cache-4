40|$|Style is an {{important}} aspect of literature, and stylistic deviations are sometimes labeled foregrounded, since their manner of expression deviates from the stylistic default. Russian Formalists have claimed that foregrounding increases processing demands and therefore causes slower reading – an effect called retardation. We tested this claim experimentally by having participants read short literary stories while measuring their eye movements. Our results confirm that readers indeed read slower and make more regressions towards foregrounded passages as compared to passages that are not foregrounded. A closer look, however, reveals significant individual differences in sensitivity to foregrounding. Some readers in fact do not slow down at all when reading foregrounded passages.

The <b>effect</b> of <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> the reorientational motion of the complex to increase relaxivity is obvious and this strategy has already been employed in producing MRI contrast agent that can bind to specific proteins. An example is MS- 325 binds to human serum albumin(HSA). The <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>effects</b> on the ligands around paramagnetic ion, and on the zero field splitting(ZFS) interaction are under studies and the physics behind is still not clear. In this thesis, a generalized Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan(GSBM) theory together with stochastic Liouville approach(SLA), is applied to investigate the mechanism behind the <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>effects.</b> Two gadolinium complexes, MS- 325 +HSA and Gd(H 2 O) 83 ++glycerol are studied by means of NMRD and ESR experiments. GSBM is a second order perturbation theory with closed analytical form. The computation based on this theory is fast, but it has its limitation {{and in the case}} of Gd(S= 7 / 2) the ZFS strength times its correlation time(Δt. τƒ) should be less than 0. 1. In comparison, the SLA is an "exact" theory that can evaluate the validity of GSBM calculation. However, the calculation in SLA is time consuming due to the large matrix it constructed. The major model used in GSBM is a two dynamic model, characterized by transient ZFS Δt and static ZFS Δs and their corresponding correlation time τƒ and τR, while in SLA the model is only described by Δt and τƒ. A combined NMRD and ESR analysis is used to understand the details of ZFS interaction. Both models can reproduce experimental NMRD profiles and model parameters are similar; for ESR linewidths the model parameters are quite different. The fitting results indicate the NMRD profiles are less sensitive to the detail expression of ZFS correlation function. In order to interpret both NMRD and ESR experiments with identical parameters, a more complex ZFS interaction model should be developed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{microscopic}} theory for the phonon-driven decay of the magnetization fluctuations {{in a wide}} class of nanomagnets where the dominant energy is set by isotropic exchange and/or uniaxial anisotropy. Based on the Zwanzig-Mori projection formalism, the theory reveals that the magnetization fluctuations are governed by a single decay rate ω_c, which we further identify with the zero-frequency portion of the associated self-energy. This dynamical decoupling from the remaining slow degrees of freedom is attributed to a conservation law and the discreteness of the energy spectrum, and explains the omnipresent mono-exponential decay of the magnetization over several decades in time, as observed experimentally. A physically transparent analytical expression for ω_c is derived which highlights the three specific mechanisms of the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>effect</b> which are known so far in nanomagnets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{short-time}} interdiffusion between bilayers of protonated and deuterated polystyrene {{was measured}} using neutron reflectivity. The moments of the segment density profiles were used as a model-independent means of characterizing the interdiffusion. It is shown that for diffusion times between the Rouse relaxation time and the reptation time of a single chain, the concentration profile at the polymer/ polymer interface can be described by a sharp gradient at the interface with a relatively long range decay away from it. With increasing molecular weight, the decay length increased substantially as expected for reptating chains. Furthermore, the effective diffusion coefficient is shown to decrease for all times less than the estimated reptation time and reduce to the bulk value at longer times.

Using Monte Carlo techniques and finite-size scaling analysis, we estimate the infinite lattice critical temperatures and the leading critical exponents in this model. In particular, we investigate the first- to second-order phase transition crossover when NLDSW links are inserted. A cluster-flip algorithm was used to reduce the critical <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>effect</b> in our simulations.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} trapped branes {{on the evolution of}} a test brane whose motion generates DBI inflation along a warped throat. The coupling between the inflationary brane and a trapped brane leads to the radiation of non-thermal particles on the trapped brane. We calculate the Gaussian spectrum of the radiated particles and their backreaction on the DBI motion of the inflationary brane. Radiation occurs for momenta lower than the speed of the test brane when crossing the trapped brane. The <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>effect</b> is either due to a parametric resonance when the interaction time is small compared to the Hubble time or a tachyonic resonance when the interaction time is large.

A more drastic effect is obtained when the DBI brane encounters a tightly spaced stack of trapped branes. Comment: 20 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|A {{few years}} ago, {{it has been}} {{realized}} that cyclodextrins (CDs) {{can be used as}} aid-excipients in polymeric drug delivery systems (DDS) with the aim to increase drug loading and modify release properties. This effect has been mainly ascribed to their complexation ability toward poorly soluble drugs which improves dissolution properties inside a DDS. From a look to the literature produced so far, it is immediately clear that this concept has severely limited their application in drug delivery technologies, in some cases prompting toward an “evidence-based” rather than rationalized use. For example, it has been neglected, or at least poorly investigated, that several other physico-chemical properties of both the drug and the polymer can be altered in the presence of CDs. Thus, the achievement of a speeding up or <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>effect</b> on drug release rate upon CD addition has been fortuitous rather than designed “ab initio”.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the α-relaxation during an isothermal crystallization process {{of a series of}} flexible copolyesters of hydroxybutyrate (HB) and hydroxyvalerate (HV) has been followed in real-time by wide-angle X-ray scattering and dielectric complex permittivity measurements. The change of the dielectric parameters with crystallization time can be phenomenologically described in terms of the Havriliak-Negami equation. The dielectric strength follows a sigmoidal-shaped pattern similar to that shown by the crystallinity. A reduction of the overall mobility with crystallization time of the polymeric chains in the amorphous phase has been observed. This <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>effect</b> depends on the HV molar content. The influence of the chain flexibility on the crystalline-induced restriction has been discussed in the light of similar studies carried out with more rigid polymers. Dielectric experiments suggest that the progressive immobilization of polymer segments as crystallization proceeds cannot be exclusively associated with the amount of crystalline material. Differences in microstructure, depending on the HV molar content, seem to be responsible for the observed behavior. The progressive broadening and symmetrization of the α-relaxation with increasing crystallization time has been explained as due to a restriction of the large-scale motions of the polymeric chains, as the material is being filled in with crystals. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The equations of the static interface have been solved, both numerically and using asymptotic analysis, with an emphasis on the effect of inclusion of the order parameter biaxiality on the physical properties. We have compared the results of the exact solutions to the commonly used de Gennes ansatz, which assumes positive and uniform unixiality through the interface. Although the de Gennes ansatz in general gives good results, when bend and splay elastic constants dominate over the twist constants, it can lead to errors of up to 10 % in the surface energy. The asymptotic analysis also shows that, by contrast with the de Gennes ansatz, the order parameter wings in the isotropic phase exhibit negative order parameter, with principal axis perpendicular to the surface. For moving interfaces, using an approximation which at this stage does not yet include hydrodynamic coupling, we have compared our results with the analogue of the de Gennes ansatz used by the present authors in an earlier paper. We find that including biaxiality leads to larger effects in the dynamic than in the static properties, and that whereas this is essentially a perturbation to the energy, the velocity of the moving interface can be significantly <b>slowed</b> <b>down.</b> The <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>effects</b> are strongly correlated with surface biaxiality, but both effects seem to be diminished when the isotropic phase is advancing...|$|R
50|$|Normally, in a conductor, {{increasing}} {{electric field}} causes higher charge carrier (usually electron) speeds {{and results in}} higher current consistent with Ohm's Law. In a multi-valley semiconductor, though, higher energy may push the carriers into a higher energy state where they actually have higher effective mass and thus <b>slow</b> <b>down.</b> In <b>effect,</b> carrier velocities and current drop as the voltage is increased. While this transfer occurs, the material exhibits a decrease in current - that is, a negative differential resistance. At higher voltages, the normal increase of current with voltage relation resumes once {{the bulk of the}} carriers are kicked into the higher energy-mass valley. Therefore the negative resistance only occurs over a limited range of voltages.|$|R
