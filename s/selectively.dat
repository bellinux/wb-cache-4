5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets <b>selectively</b> forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets <b>selectively</b> forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, SnCl2 {{is used to}} <b>selectively</b> reduce {{aromatic}} {{nitro groups}} to anilines.|$|E
5|$|By <b>selectively</b> {{feeding on}} nearby fruit trees and then defecating or regurgitating the seeds within the leks, these birds can {{actively}} influence the regeneration and succession {{of the forest}} habitat where they breed.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{structural}} elements. Artificial circularly permuted proteins {{can allow}} {{parts of a}} protein to be <b>selectively</b> deleted. This gives insight into which structural elements are essential or not.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{transitions}} {{are rather}} sharp (~10meV) and strong. Consequently, {{it is relatively}} easy to <b>selectively</b> excite nanotubes having certain (n,m) indices, as well as to detect optical signals from individual nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that <b>selectively</b> stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that <b>selectively</b> killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain.|$|E
5|$|A complex amine-phenol Ga(III) {{compound}} MR045 is <b>selectively</b> {{toxic to}} parasites resistant to chloroquine, a common drug against malaria. Both the Ga(III) complex and chloroquine act by inhibiting crystallization of hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by the parasites.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are <b>selectively</b> toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of the Central American bark scorpion, Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide <b>selectively</b> inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels. Patented by Merck, {{it has the potential to}} prevent neointimal hyperplasia, a common cause of bypass graft failure.|$|E
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that <b>selectively</b> interfere with viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein's {{books are}} {{an attempt to}} examine the works of {{mainstream}} scholarship. The authors whose work he has thus targeted, including Daniel Jonah Goldhagen and Dershowitz, along with others such as Benny Morris whose work Finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship, have in turn accused Finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting their work, and <b>selectively</b> quoting from their books.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Am(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Am3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes <b>selectively</b> interact with americium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides.|$|E
5|$|Proteasome inhibitors have {{effective}} anti-tumor {{activity in}} cell culture, inducing apoptosis by disrupting the regulated degradation of pro-growth cell cycle proteins. This approach of <b>selectively</b> inducing apoptosis in tumor cells has proven effective in animal models and human trials.|$|E
5|$|Television & Radio Index for Learning & Teaching (TRILT): Produced by the British Universities Film & Video Council (BUFVC), TRILT is a {{database}} of all UK television and radio broadcasts since 2001 (and <b>selectively</b> back to 1995). Its 16 million records, growing by a million per year, cover every channel, broadcast and repeat.|$|E
5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive handles {{large volumes}} of data which pose a {{significant}} storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA <b>selectively</b> discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements.|$|E
5|$|The Fix {{problems}} section provides {{access to}} TuneUp Repair Wizard which allows users to <b>selectively</b> repair problems that TuneUp Utilities cannot automatically detect, e.g., icons getting corrupted or items like My Computer and Recycle Bin having permanently vanished from Windows Desktop.|$|E
5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred <b>selectively</b> over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was <b>selectively</b> prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} <b>selectively</b> bred for head weight and {{morphological}} characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It <b>selectively</b> breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to <b>selectively</b> destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E
5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and <b>selectively</b> bred a heavier, more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used {{from the time of the}} Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Hyperpolarized xenon {{can be used}} {{by surface}} chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be <b>selectively</b> polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (<b>selectively</b> neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E
5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs <b>selectively</b> activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is a {{valuable}} research tool, both in cell culture and in living organisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can <b>selectively</b> and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi {{may be used for}} large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology, medicine and insecticides.|$|E
5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI <b>selectively</b> removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E
5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are <b>selectively</b> disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females <b>selectively</b> eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, {{and these were}} applied to the occupied and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied <b>selectively</b> due to {{the transfer of the}} territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in the occupied territories were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate, but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse {{developed}} from small gaited pinto ponies of Spanish ancestry. These were crossed with larger American breeds {{such as the}} Morgan and Standardbred, developed after the American Revolution, to increase size while retaining coloration and the desired gait. After the American Civil War, additional gaited blood was added, with contributing breeds including the Tennessee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso. Mustangs from the American West were also incorporated. Originally developed in central Tennessee, and <b>selectively</b> bred for pinto coloration, they were used for general pleasure and trail riding.|$|E
5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ <b>selectively</b> builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.|$|E
5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been <b>selectively</b> bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
5|$|The {{enterprise}} {{version of}} Windows 10 offers additional security features; administrators {{can set up}} policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data, <b>selectively</b> block applications from accessing encrypted data, and enable Device Guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E
5|$|Thescelosaurus {{would have}} browsed {{in the first}} meter or so from the ground, feeding <b>selectively,</b> with food held in the mouth by cheeks while chewing. Thescelosaurus was {{probably}} slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the upper leg was longer than the shin, the opposite of Hypsilophodon and running animals in general. One specimen {{is known to have}} had a bone pathology, with the long bones of the right foot fused at their tops, hindering swift movement.|$|E
