40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the microbiological quality of raw materials used for preparation of confectionery products. For microbiological evaluation total count of bacteria, mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, yeast and microscopic filamentous fungi in <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> raw materials used in the manufacture and creams of confectionery products were detected. In addition to these groups of microorganisms the presence of pathogenic microorganisms Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus in creams was monitored. Products are assessed according to the limit values {{of the number of}} microorganisms defined in the Codex Alimentary of the Slovak Republic. For microbiological analysis <b>of</b> confectionery products, <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> components of confectionary products and cream was carried out according to current health regulations and altogether 65 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> components and creams were collected: 10 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> raw materials sugar, 10 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> flour, 10 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> butter and 10 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> eggs, 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> butter yolk from cream-filled disposable bag without rum addition, 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> butter yolk from cream-filled disposable bag with rum addition, 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> cream-filled multiple use paid bag, 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> cream-filled newly purchased paid bag, 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> Venček corpus and 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the French cubes corpus. From raw material the highest TBC (2. 65 log CFU) was in flour, but the lowest in sugar (1. 35 log CFU), the highest years counts was found on flour (2. 42), but lowest in butter (1. 18), while wasn’t in egg. In <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> creams and corpus were increased occurrence of yeast, coliform bacteria. Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus weren’t isolated from any tested sample...|$|R

5|$|A <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> {{beryllium}} was {{bombarded with}} alpha rays from {{the decay of}} radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered {{the existence of the}} neutron.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and direction of}} statistical bias from nonrandom <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> specific types was investigated. Samples from school district populations were generated by a multistage sampling technique, with a modification that substituted for random selec-tion the nomination <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> units at each stage. Within these stages, superintendents were asked to nominate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> "repre-sentative " schools, principals to nominate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> "representa-tive " classrooms, and teachers to nominate <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> "representa-tive " students. Statistics for the nominated samples were compared to the corresponding theoretical sampling distributions, determined by the appropriate population parameters, under the assumption of random selection. As the sampling proceeded from <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> schools, to <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> classrooms, to <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> students, the respective sample statistics increasingly deviated from expectation implying greater degrees of statistical bias...|$|R

For TNFα, IL- 6, and IL- 10 measurements, 8 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the SHAM group and 13 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> all septic groups were used, and for leptin, 5 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the SHAM group and 8 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> all septic groups were used.|$|R
40|$|During the {{surveillance}} conducted in 1997, focusing on special slaughter locations, 61 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> urine, 16 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> skin, 16 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> meat and 13 <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> faeces were analysed {{for the presence}} of residues of anabolic steroids.

One animal was found positive for the beta-agonists clenbuterol and bromobuterol. Two animals were found positive for clenbuterol only. One animal was found positive for the thyreostatic, tapazole and one animal was for the anabolic steroid ethynylestradiol.

5|$|Because of self-irradiation, a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> {{plutonium}} fatigues {{throughout its}} crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time.
