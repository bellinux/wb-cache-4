25|$|A Vermeer {{painting}} plays a {{key part}} of the dénouement in Agatha Christie's After the Funeral (1953). Susan Vreeland's novel Girl in Hyacinth Blue follows eight individuals with a relationship to a painting of Vermeer. The young adult novel Chasing Vermeer by Blue Balliett centers around the fictional theft of Vermeer's A Lady Writing. J. P. Smith's novel The Discovery of Light deals largely with Vermeer. The character of Barney in Thomas Harris's novel Hannibal (1999) has a goal to <b>see</b> <b>every</b> Vermeer painting in the world before he dies.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained in this video are {{not the kind of}} thing you <b>see</b> <b>every</b> day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E
500|$|Nagarjuna {{added that}} the film's {{characters}} would reborn with no special purpose unlike other reincarnation films like Janaki Ramudu (1988), Arundhati (2009) and Magadheera (2009). Saran {{said in an interview}} that the film basically has a family-oriented theme and is about falling in love with [...] "small, little things that you sort of don't <b>see</b> <b>every</b> day, but are really, really important". Unlike other reincarnation based films, the film's story develops two separate themes— the relationship between reborn lovers, but also the relationship between reborn parents and their children. Naga Chaitanya acknowledged in an interview with The Hindu that the film's script might seem to have a few overly-convenient coincidences, but felt that Kumar's detailing in every scene made the script believable.|$|E

She told Warhol that he should paint [...] "Something you <b>see</b> <b>every</b> day and something that everybody would recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup." [...] Ted Carey, who was there at the time, said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: [...] "Oh that sounds fabulous." [...] According to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of [...] "all the soups", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, [...] "I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years." ...|$|E
500|$|Following 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick {{originally}} planned {{to make a}} film about the life of the French emperor Napoleon. Fascinated by his life and own [...] "self-destruction", Kubrick {{spent a great deal of}} time planning the film's development, and had conducted about two years of extensive research into Napoleon's life, reading several hundred books and gaining access to Napoleon's personal memoirs and commentaries. He also tried to <b>see</b> <b>every</b> film ever made about Napoleon and found none of them appealing, including Abel Gance's 1927 film which is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but for Kubrick, a [...] "really terrible" [...] movie. Lo Brutto states that Napoleon was an ideal subject for Kubrick, embracing the director's [...] "passion for control, power, obsession, strategy, and the military", while Napoleon's psychological intensity and depth, logistical genius and war, sex, and the evil nature of man were all ingredients which deeply appealed to Kubrick.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{qualifying}} sessions mirrored {{those from}} two weeks before, with many commentators repeating their criticism {{over the new}} format. However, at a meeting between the FIA, Formula One Management (FOM) and the teams on race Sunday, no agreement was reached to revert to the old qualifying format, which was outright ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season by the representatives of FIA and FOM. A new proposal was set before the teams, which would <b>see</b> <b>every</b> driver set two timed laps in every part of qualifying. Both times would than be added and the aggregate time would determine the grid positions. Reactions to the proposal were mixed. While Sebastian Vettel described it as [...] "a shit idea" [...] and Daniel Ricciardo said that he [...] "wouldn't be too keen on that", Jenson Button deemed it a better plan than the existing elimination format. On 7 April, the teams unanimously rejected the scheme, instead demanding a return to the format used between 2006 and 2015. The decision was finalised four days later.|$|E

500|$|Kimura {{eventually}} {{spoke with}} Marvelous Entertainment's Yoshiro Wada {{about creating a}} game mixing a [...] "flare of [...] and Japan {{a little while ago}} (say about 40 years ago)". Kimura wanted Chulip to be localized to show the world certain aspects of Japanese culture and [...] "all the kind of interesting stuff that you can <b>see</b> <b>every</b> day". He also wanted to display a real, modern truancy problem for Japanese students with the game's cast of underground dwellers. Norikazu Yasunaga designed many of the game's mechanics. According to Kimura, [...] "for efficient procedure, [...] set it up so that the personality and the characteristics for each NPC had to be one-by-one". The character designs were done by Ryuji Nouguchi, who used items from Kimura's personal scrapbook and [...] "made them funny". The musical score to Chulip was composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi, another former member of Love-de-Lic. The soundtrack was released by King Records in Japan on a single disc on November 22, 2002. Songs 35 through 44 represent the [...] "Tsurukame Movie Soundtrack", consisting of music for each of the game's short films, while songs 45 and 46 are bonus tracks.|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to <b>see</b> <b>every</b> character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E
500|$|In January 1945, McGovern used R time to <b>see</b> <b>every</b> {{sight that}} he could in Rome, and to {{participate}} in an audience with the Pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to First Lieutenant. On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern. (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern was greatly relieved.) On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern's 35thmission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force's requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said [...] "Hell can't be any worse than that" [...] – and the Dakota Queen was hit multiple times, resulting in 110holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.|$|E
