40|$|The task of {{developments}} is creation of optimum construction of <b>scintiscanner</b> of laser ray and {{method of determination}} of its parameters and terms of irradiation. District, rural clinics and hospitals can be interested in them, because its application and service are problematic and difficult on a construction and the processor management of devices. Instead of them simple and original laser scintiscanners constructions are developed providing permanent energy density in the irradiation area which are intended for the necessities of medical establishments with small profits. The parameters of <b>scintiscanner</b> (drive, managing cam profile) and terms of irradiation {{are determined by the}} developed method. The created constructions are cheap, simple in making and technological during exploitation and can be used instead of scintiscanners with programmable drives. They are tested in clinical terms. ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ???? ? ???????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ? ??????? ?????????. ? ??? ????? ???? ?????????????? ????????, ???????? ??????? ? ????????, ???????????-?????????? ??????, ??? ????????????? ?????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ?? ??????????? ? ? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????. ?????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???? ? ???????????? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ? ???? ?????????, ??????????????? ??? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ????????. ?? ????????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????

40|$|A thyroid nodule can {{frequently}} {{be considered}} hyperfunctioning {{with the following}} laboratory find ings: (A) it appears on the thyroid <b>scintiscanner</b> as a "hot " nodule, (B) its radioiodine uptake is not suppressed by exogenous thyroid hormone adminis tration, and (c) other areas with radioiodine uptake appear on the thyroid scintiscan after TSH admin istration. These autonomous thyroid nodules (ATN) are usually associated with {{a wide spectrum of}} thyroid activity. This report presents the prevalence of hyper-thyroidism in 100 patients with ATN as well as the natural history of these nodules. The diagnostic value of the clinical and laboratory data will be discussed and a numerical index derived from the relative in cidence of symptoms and signs in these patients will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{radioisotope}} {{techniques used}} for the measurement of gastric emptying of solid meals in man require complex and expensive <b>scintiscanners</b> of cameras. We have evaluated a simple technique which uses a fixed scintillation detector and compared the results with those obtained from a gamma camera. The rates and patterns of gastric emptying recorded by the two methods correlated well in both healthy volunteers (mean r= 0. 95) and patients with duodenal ulcer (mean r = 0. 89). The scintillation detector provides a reliable and inexpensive method for measurement of gastric emptying of solid meals...|$|R
