Although no date was recorded, the marriage was announced only to the Duchess of York, and a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> friends, so that Sarah could keep her court position as Maid of Honour.|$|E
5|$|Peart is {{the author}} of seven non-fiction books, the latest {{released}} in September 2016. His growth as an author predates the published work by several years (not including his work as Rush's primary lyricist), through private letters and short travelogues sent out to a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> friends and family.|$|E

She later explained that her intent was to reinstate {{the idea of an}} album release as a significant, exciting event which had lost meaning in the face of hype created around singles.|$|E

5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|His only son, Yissachar Dov, {{was raised}} by Rebbe Aharon. After Rebbe Aharon's death in 1957, the boy was educated by a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> trusted advisors. He became the fifth Belzer Rebbe in 1966. Rebbe Yissachar Dov named his only son, Aharon Mordechai Rokeach, born in 1975, after his uncle and his father.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 {{he married}} Dorothy Brooks Johnston. Notwithstanding his prodigious {{financial}} accomplishments, Killam {{was a very}} reserved man who eschewed publicity and was virtually unknown outside a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> close acquaintances. Killam died in 1955 at his Quebec fishing lodge. By then he {{was considered to be}} the richest man in Canada.|$|E

50|$|After 1990, Truhlar's poetry, {{which was}} {{previously}} {{known only to}} <b>small</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> the Slovenian Catholic underground, received a positive re-evaluation by many renowned literary critics. Among others, Truhlar's mystical thought influenced the philosopher and poet Gorazd Kocijančič.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{leadership}} of the Ponevezh yeshiva in the Israeli town of Bnei Berak convinced Rabbi Dessler to assume the role of mashgiach ruchani (spiritual counsellor and lecturer on ethical issues). He relocated to Israel, and again gathered a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> students around him. One of his pupils there, Chaim Friedländer, would later fill his position as Ponevezh mashgiach.|$|E
25|$|When the sect {{began to}} attract {{following}} and expanded from a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> learned disciples to a mass movement, it became evident that its complex philosophy could be imparted only partially {{to the new}} rank and file. As even intellectuals struggled with the sublime dialectics of infinity and corporeality, there was little hope to have the common folk truly internalize these, not as mere abstractions to pay lip service to.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to New York {{from her home in}} Portugal, on April 4, 1983, Swanson died in New York City in New York Hospital from a heart ailment, aged 84. She was cremated and her ashes interred at the Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue, in New York City, attended by only a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> family. Fellow silent star Jacqueline Logan died on the same day.|$|E

50|$|The patriciate {{is often}} {{referred}} to by city or region, for example as the Christiania Patriciate, the Skien Patriciate and so forth. These were usually relatively <b>small</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> related families which played a dominant role in the cities or regions.|$|R
25|$|Appreciation of Schubert's music {{while he}} was alive was limited to a {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of the late Classical and early Romantic eras {{and is one of}} the most frequently performed composers of the early 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Less {{well known}} today than Keats were others who loyally {{attended}} his lectures and constituted a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> admirers, {{such as the}} diarist and chronicler Henry Crabb Robinson and the novelist Mary Russell Mitford. But the rumours that had been spread demonising Hazlitt, along with the vilifications of the Tory press, not only hurt his pride but seriously obstructed his ability to earn a living. Income from his lectures had also proved insufficient to keep him afloat.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{associated with the}} region, its cliffs and climate in particular, settlement of this area developed during the late 15th century. From a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> three to four families, Cedros grew to about thirty neighbors by about 1715, so said Father António Cordeiro. The same author, referred {{to the existence of}} the hamlet of Ponta Ruiva with a few residents and a small port, which were integrated into the parish of São Pedro (in Ponta Delgada, Santa Cruz das Flores) at the time.|$|E

25|$|Whereas the Natiq was {{concerned}} with the rites and outward shape of religion, the inner meaning is entrusted to a Wasi (Representative). The Wasi would know the secret meaning of all rites and rules and would reveal them to a <b>small</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> initiates.|$|R
25|$|The {{reasons why}} a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> mostly senior Aum members {{committed}} atrocities {{and the extent}} of personal involvement by Asahara remain unclear, although several theories have attempted to explain these events. In response to the prosecution's charge that Asahara ordered the subway attacks to distract authorities, the defense maintained that Asahara was not aware of events, pointing to his deteriorating health. Shortly after his arrest, Asahara abandoned his post as the organization's leader, and since then has maintained silence, refusing to communicate even with lawyers and family members.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{distinct}} difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained {{the support of}} a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.|$|E
25|$|The Ukrainian Catholics {{continued}} to exist underground for decades and were the subject of vigorous attacks in the state media. The clergy gave up public exercise of their clerical duties, but secretly provided services for many lay people. Many priests took up civilian professions and celebrated the sacraments in private. The identities of former priests could {{have been known to}} the Soviet police who regularly watched them, interrogated them and put fines on them, but stopped short of arrest unless their activities went beyond a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> people. New secretly ordained priests were often treated more harshly.|$|E

25|$|Cropping {{an image}} and {{enlarging}} {{to the same}} size final image as an uncropped image taken under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format; the cropped image requires greater enlargement and consequently has a <b>smaller</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> confusion.

25|$|Stieglitz also {{continued}} to intertwine {{the walls of}} his galleries with the pages of his magazine. Stieglitz’s closest friends (Steichen, Demachy, White, Käsebier and Keiley) were represented in both, while many others were granted one but not the other. Increasingly, a single photographer was given the preponderance of coverage in an issue, and in doing so Stieglitz relied more and more on his <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> old supporters. This led to increase tensions among Stieglitz and some of his original colleagues, and when Stieglitz began to introduce paintings, drawings and other art forms in his gallery many photographers saw it as the breaking point in their relationship with Stieglitz.|$|E
25|$|Rutgers {{was among}} the first American {{institutions}} to engage in intercollegiate athletics, and participated in a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> schools that included Yale University, Columbia University and long-time rival, Princeton University (then called the College of New Jersey). The four schools met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan on October 19, 1873, to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate competition, and particularly to codify the new game of football. Though invited, Harvard chose not to attend. In the early years of intercollegiate athletics, the schools that participated in these athletic events were located solely in the American Northeast. However, {{by the turn of the}} 20th century, colleges and universities across the United States began to participate.|$|E
25|$|Within the kingdom, Hugh {{intensified}} his existing {{habit of}} giving any available offices or lands to relations, including his numerous legitimate and illegitimate progeny, and a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> old and trusted friends. The effect this had on Italian nobles who {{saw this as}} threatening themselves eventually resulted in rebellion. In 941, Hugh expelled Berengar of Ivrea from Italy and abolished the March of Ivrea. In 945, Berengar returned from exile in Germany and defeated Hugh in battle. By a diet Berengar held at Milan, Hugh was deposed, though he managed {{to come to terms}} by which he nominally kept the crown and the title rex (king) but returned to Provence, leaving Lothair as nominal king, but with all real power in Berengar's hands.|$|E
5000|$|The definition, as {{described}} by Crouch, is: [...] "A post-democratic society is one that continues to have and to use all the institutions of democracy, but in which they increasingly become a formal shell.

50|$|As a whole, {{during the}} early 20th century {{the idea of a}} {{separate}} Macedonian identity was promoted only by <b>small</b> <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> intellectuals, but the majority of the Slavic people in Macedonia considered themselves to be Bulgarians.
