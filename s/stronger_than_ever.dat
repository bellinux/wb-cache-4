Quinn retaliates by thanking Sue for helping her realize that believing in herself negates the need to bring other people down. Will realizes that his passion is teaching, not performing, and {{resolves}} to recommit to the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries to be <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> {{and he was}} courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E
5|$|Outwardly at least, by 743 the Umayyad {{position}} in Khurasan appeared <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> The reality beneath the splendid façade however was different. Tension and mutual mistrust {{existed between the}} Khurasani Arab levies (muqatila) and the 20,000 Syrian troops introduced into the province as a security measure after the disastrous Battle of the Defile in 731, while tribal antagonism continued to create trouble: apart from continued Yemeni resentment at Nasr, there was strong dislike of the Umayyads' Syrian regime, fanned by their unjust tax policies. Although Nasr tried to remedy the situation, it was too late.|$|E

5|$|Warwick's {{position}} {{after the}} accession of Edward IV was <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> He had now succeeded to his father's possessions, and in 1462 he also inherited his mother's lands and the Salisbury title. Altogether {{he had an}} annual income from his lands of over £7,000 far {{more than any other}} man in the realm but the king. Edward confirmed Warwick's position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, and the next year created Earl of Northumberland. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward, and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York.|$|E
5|$|In Heart of the Swarm, the Dominion discovers where Raynor and Kerrigan {{are hiding}} and launch {{an attack on}} them. Kerrigan manages to escape, but is cut off from Raynor and upon hearing news that he was {{captured}} and executed, she returns to Zerg territory to retake control of the swarm and exact revenge on Mengsk. During her quest, she has an encounter with Zeratul, who advises her to travel to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg, where she not only regains her powers as the Queen of Blades, returning <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> but also learns that a fallen Xel'Naga named Amon was responsible for making the Zerg what they are: A warring swarm, bound to a single overriding will. After confronting a legion of servants of Amon, including a breed of Protoss-Zerg hybrids, Mengsk informs Kerrigan that Raynor is still alive and uses him as a leverage against her, keeping the location where he is imprisoned a secret, until she joins forces with the Hyperion to locate and rescue him. However, seeing that she discarded her humanity after all the effort he took to restore it, Raynor rejects her, despite her confession that she loves him, and parts ways with her. Kerrigan then turns her attention to Korhal and sends her forces to bring down Mengsk once and for all. However, during their showdown, Mengsk uses the artifact to immobilize her, but Raynor appears to protect her, and Mengsk is ultimately killed by Kerrigan. With the Dominion under control of Mengsk's son Valerian, Kerrigan bids farewell to Raynor and departs with the Zerg Swarm to confront Amon and his forces.|$|E

60|$|As for the Pygmies, {{their capital}} city was laid in ruins by the {{concussion}} and vibration of the air; and, {{though there was}} uproar enough without their help, they all set up a shriek out of three millions of little throats, fancying, no doubt, that they swelled the Giant's bellow by at least ten times as much. Meanwhile, Antaeus had scrambled upon his feet again, and pulled his pine tree out of the earth; and, all aflame with fury, and more outrageously <b>strong</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> he ran at Hercules, and brought down another blow.|$|R
25|$|As fall neared, {{there was}} some {{optimism}} around the team though. On the player front, the Drillers resigned several key players to new, lucrative deals. Beyond that, it was also announced that 98/99 NPSL Rookie of the Year, Martin Nash, would be returning to the team, {{and he would be}} joined by Canadian National team teammate, Jeff Clarke. On the pitch, the team looked <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b>|$|E

25|$|Assyria now {{appeared}} <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> However, {{his long}} struggle with Babylonia and Elam and their allies, {{and the constant}} campaigning to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, left Assyria exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply {{the needs of the}} imperial exchequer, and it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison the huge empire.|$|E

25|$|The {{rise of the}} Socialist Workers' Party (later {{known as}} the Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD), {{declared}} its aim to establish peacefully a new socialist order through the transformation of existing political and social conditions. From 1878, Bismarck tried to repress the social democratic movement by outlawing the party's organisation, its assemblies {{and most of its}} newspapers. When it finally was allowed to run candidates, the Social Democrats were <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b>|$|E

With two new teams joining the league, the Brisbane Blue Tongues and Central Coast Rhinos, the Knights {{were one of the}} stronger and more stable teams of the league, winning 11 of 24 games and finishing in fifth place with 35 points. Coached by former player Laing Harrow, 2005 has been the strongest Canberra Knights AIHL season ever.|$|E

The already storied athletic program rose to dominance, winning state championships in Basketball, Football, Ice Hockey and Wrestling. In more recent history, the campus has been expanded to include modern facilities that support science, technology, performing arts and continued athletic success. The combination of the school's rich history, generous alumni and popular staff has built a promising future for Mount Carmel.|$|E
25|$|Shapur II {{pursued a}} harsh {{religious}} policy. Under his reign, {{the collection of}} the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, was completed, heresy and apostasy were punished, and Christians were persecuted. The latter was a reaction against the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. Shapur II, like Shapur I, was amicable towards Jews, who lived in relative freedom and gained many advantages in his period (see also Raba). At the time of Shapur's death, the Persian Empire was <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> with its enemies to the east pacified and Armenia under Persian control.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of Toronto and Dominion Bank {{emerged from}} the war in 1945 <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom they became more active in {{business}} lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. Neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities of the post-war economy.|$|E

However, before CJ {{can get to the}} fight, he {{receives}} a call from Cesar to meet elsewhere. Cesar shows CJ a shocking scene: Big Smoke, Ryder, Tenpenny, and the Ballas working together to hide the car used in the shooting which killed CJ's mother. Big Smoke and Ryder had arranged the shooting, and were working with Tenpenny and the Ballas to sell out Grove Street. CJ rushes to warn Sweet, {{but by the time he}} arrived, Sweet was already badly wounded by the Ballas counter-ambush. Tenpenny shows up and arrests them both. With Grove Street's leadership decapitated, Big Smoke and Ryder openly declare their alliance with the Ballas. They take over Los Santos and flood its streets with drugs, and with Tenpenny protecting them from police interference, they appear unstoppable.|$|E
25|$|The British and colonists triumphed jointly over {{a common}} foe. The colonists' {{loyalty to the}} mother country was <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before. However, disunity was {{beginning}} to form. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage {{the war in the}} colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.|$|E
