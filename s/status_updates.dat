There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> and a social utility.

The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

40|$|Does {{a preoccupation}} with one’s Facebook {{activity}} divert {{attention away from}} social cues? Eighty-six undergraduates browsed their NewsFeed on Facebook and composed a potential <b>status</b> <b>update</b> on paper about a personally meaningful event. Participants were then randomly assigned to either post the <b>status</b> <b>update</b> on Facebook {{so that it was}} visible to their Facebook friends, or continue passively browsing their friends’ Facebook content. A cue to one’s broader social network was also manipulated in the background, such that participants were randomly assigned to either sit at a desk with a mobile phone or notebook. Participants who sat at a desk with a notebook showed significantly higher private self-awareness than those who were exposed to a mobile phone (p =. 015). Compared to those who read their NewsFeed, participants who posted a <b>status</b> <b>update</b> indicated they were significantly more distracted by thoughts of their Facebook activity (p <. 001), experienced more uncertainty (p =. 007), and felt more negative affect (p =. 016). Participants who posted a <b>status</b> <b>update</b> also reported marginally less engagement to clips of social interactions (p =. 060), and scored slightly lower on standardized items of a social perspective-taking task (p =. 066), in comparison to those who read their friend’s content in their NewsFeed. Models for mediation were non-significant, suggesting that although posting a <b>status</b> <b>update</b> relates to higher Facebook-related distraction, negative affect, uncertainty, and somewhat lower scores on a social perspective-taking task, Facebook-related distraction, negative affect, and uncertainty did not explain why participants who posted a <b>status</b> <b>update</b> performed somewhat worse at integrating social cues. Results are discussed in light of the consequences associated with switching one’s attention between virtual and physical environments. Future research should address broader implications of this effect for interpersonal relationships...|$|R

40|$|Heuristics {{which use}} {{predicted}} process resource requirements to make scheduling decisions are proposed. Four heuristics are presented. The first two, MINQ and SMPL, employ centralized scheduling {{and the remaining}} two, DMINQ and FDMINQ, use distributed scheduling. These heuristics are first compared against random scheduling and then against two conventional heuristics, CENTEX and DISTED, which schedule processes solely based on system state information. Results based on trace-driven simulations show that the proposed centralized heuristics offer significantly improved mean response time and they require fewer <b>status</b> <b>update</b> messages. In experiments using the same <b>status</b> <b>update</b> rates, SMPL response times were, on the average, 22 percent lower than those for CENTEX; MINQ response times were, on the average, 18 percent lower. The simulations also showed that MINQ and SMPL can perform as well as, or better than, CENTEX while using up to 70 percent fewer <b>status</b> <b>update</b> messages. The use of fewer <b>status</b> <b>update</b> messages imposes less overhead on the system. The use of prediction for distributed scheduling produced similar results. When prediction was used to filter small processes and execute them locally a 50 percent improvement in response times was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Language {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect for communications in social interaction. One of the communication tools that the people often used now is social media. Twitter and Facebook are the most popular of social media used by users. Nowadays, Twitter and Facebook are able to share new words that commonly used by the users. The new words in Indonesia often called Lebay words. Lebay is the word that has the quality of being excessive. Lebay words also called hyperbole in figurative language. Hyperbole is commonly used even by ignorant people and peasants in the sense of exaggeration. In line with this background, this research intends to analyze and describe the similarities and differences of Lebay words found in Twitter and Facebook <b>status</b> <b>update.</b> Meanwhile, this research used descriptive qualitative research design in which the instrument used were observation and document analysis.

25|$|Hashtags (#topic) and user tags (@username) {{make use}} of {{metadata}} in order to track “trending” topics and to alert users of their name’s use within a post on a social media site. Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the status update option on Facebook. <b>Status</b> <b>updates</b> combine the affordances of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 status update button currently prompts a user, “What’s on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What are you doing right now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, video, image, links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media.|$|E

500|$|The city's {{decision}} {{to conduct the}} archaeological survey in phases subsequently led to a lawsuit filed on February 1, 2011, by the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation on behalf of cultural practitioner Paulette Kaleikini. The suit, which named both {{the city and the}} State of Hawaii as defendants, contended [...] that state law requires the full length of the rail line to have an archaeological survey conducted before any construction takes place, and seeks to void the environmental impact statement and all construction permits issued for the project. Kaleikini's lawyers filed on February 18 a request for an injunction to stop work on the project until the case is resolved. [...] The suit was initially dismissed on March 23, 2011, after Circuit Court Judge Gary Chang ruled that state and federal laws allow the archaeological surveys to be conducted in phases. Kaleikini's lawyers subsequently appealed to the Hawaii Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case on May 24, 2012. [...] The court ruled on August 24, 2012, that it agreed with plaintiff Kaleikini that the archaeological survey needed to be completed before construction could take place, and that the State Historic Preservation Division did not comply with state law when it approved the project. The case has now been remanded to Circuit Court. [...] On December 27, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii granted the plaintiffs' injunction, and ordered that all construction-related activities in segment 4 of the archaeological survey be halted until compliance with the Hawaii Supreme Court decision made earlier this year is met. [...] This ruling does not affect construction activities in the first three segments, nor does it affect construction planning, design, or engineering in segment 4, which is the final segment to be built. The Phase 4 area encompasses the downtown area and its immediate environs, including Chinatown, Mother Waldron Park, and Beretania Street. Judge Tashima, the only sitting judge on the case, ruled on condition of the injunction that the city is required to file periodic <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> on their compliance with the judgment. The injunction will then terminate 30 days after defendants file a notice of final compliance.
