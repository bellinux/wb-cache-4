5|$|Written by Phil Ford. This story {{idea was}} planned as fourth {{episode of the}} second series.

5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, <b>something</b> <b>in</b> short supply at the time.|$|E

In 1985, Horror Planet released a professionally produced recording on an EP record with hand-painted fabric sleeves.

The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated <b>something</b> <b>in</b> order to get some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed {{a couple of hours}} later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|Food {{security}} and food power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get <b>something</b> <b>in</b> return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not <b>something</b> <b>in</b> which they should interfere. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, immediately over the French border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army.|$|E
