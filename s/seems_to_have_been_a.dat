5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E
5|$|Gebeachan (died 937), {{also known}} as Gébennach, and Gebechán, was a tenth-century King of the Isles. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{subordinate}} to Amlaíb mac Gofraid, King of Dublin, and is recorded to have fought and died at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E

Irvine says: [...] "Roger <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> quite famous as a highwayman {{in the early nineteenth}} century.

5|$|While {{much of the}} {{construction}} in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E
5|$|Temples and shrines are strangely {{rare in the}} Mycenaean archaeological sites. Monumental cultic {{structures}} are absent at all the palatial centres, {{with the exception of}} Mycenae. However, the cultic center of Mycenae <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> later (13th century BC) development. Small shrines have been identified in Asine, Berbati, Malthi and Pylos, while a number of sacred enclosures have been located near Mycenae, Delphi and Amyklae. Linear B records mention a number of sanctuaries dedicated to a variety of deities, at least in Pylos and Knossos. They also indicate that there were various religious festivities including offerings. Written Mycenaean records mention various priests and priestesses who were responsible for specific shrines and temples. The latter were prominent figures in society, and the role of Mycenaean women in religious festivities was also important, just as in Minoan Crete.|$|E
