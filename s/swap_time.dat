40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{inefficiency}} of time-shared {{computer systems}} compared to batch processing systems {{is in the}} time lost in swapping operations. The larger the allocated quantum size, the less <b>swap</b> <b>time</b> is incurred. In order to guard against intolerable response time while lengthening the quantum size, the response time of a common request must be regulated. The criteria used in this paper to regulate the response time is to vary the quantum, {{with the number of}} users in the system, {{in such a way that}} the computer response time approaches the human response time. Based upon this concept, models are designed and analyzed to design an optimal scheduling algorithm which allocates the quantum dynamically. The models proposed are based upon Markovian assumptions for both arrival and service times. The priority discipline is round robin with dynamic quantum allocation. The <b>swap</b> <b>time</b> is assumed to be constant and the overhead time is zero. The inverse measure of performance is assumed to be the expected square difference between the cycle time and the mean human response time. In order to optimize these models two techniques are discussed. In the first, a mathematical optimization model is formulated in which a Markov chain is imbedded at the epochs of the beginning of a cycle. The cost function is assumed to be the inverse measure of performance. A technique suggested by Howard for optimizing a stochastic system under Markovian assumptions provides an optimal policy by which the scheduling algorithm allocates the quantum. The second technique discussed is based upon an optimal control system approach. The quantum size is chosen in such a way as to assure some stability property while improving system performance. A numerical example which illustrates these methods is provided...|$|E
40|$|A two-electron system {{confined}} in two coupled semiconductor quantum dots is investigated {{as a candidate}} for performing quantum logic operations on spin qubits. We study different processes of swapping the electron spins by controlled switching on/off the exchange interaction. The resulting spin swap corresponds to an elementary operation in quantum information processing. We perform a direct time evolution simulations of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. Our results show that [...] in order to obtain the full interchange of spins [...] the exchange interaction should change smoothly in time. The presence of jumps and spikes in the corresponding time characteristics leads to a considerable increase of the spin <b>swap</b> <b>time.</b> We propose several mechanisms to modify the exchange interaction by changing the confinement potential profile and discuss their advantages and disadvantages...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives {{the bulk}} local {{limit of the}} swap process of uniformly random sorting networks. The limit object is defined through a {{deterministic}} procedure, a local version of the Edelman-Greene algorithm, applied to a two dimensional determinantal point process with explicit kernel. The latter describes the asymptotic joint law near $ 0 $ of the eigenvalues of the corners in the antisymmetric Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. In particular, the limiting distribution of the first <b>swap</b> <b>time</b> at a given position is identified with the limiting distribution for the closest to $ 0 $ eigenvalue in the antisymmetric GUE. As a corollary, the asymptotic spacing between two swaps in the same line is given by the Gaudin-Mehta distribution - universal limiting law for gaps between eigenvalues of real symmetric random matrices. The proofs rely on the determinantal structure and a double contour integral representation for the kernel of random Poissonized Young tableaux.

40|$|Abstract—Cluster tools, each {{of which}} {{consists}} of several single-wafer processing chambers and a wafer handling robot, have been increasingly used for diverse wafer fabrication processes. Processes such as some low pressure chemical vapor deposition processes re-quire strict timing control. Unless a wafer processed at a chamber for such a process leaves the chamber within a specified time limit, the wafer is subject to quality problems due to residual gases and heat. We address the scheduling problem for such time-constrained dual-armed cluster tools that have diverse wafer flow patterns. We propose a systematic method of determining the schedulable process time range for which there exists a feasible schedule that satisfies the time constraints. We explain how to select the desir-able process times within the schedulable process time range. We present a method of determining the tool operation schedule. For more flexible scheduling under the time constraints, we propose a modification of the conventional swap operation {{in order to allow}} wafer delay on a robot arm during a swap operation. We compare the performance of the new swap strategy with that of the conven-tional swap strategy. Index Terms—Cluster tool, scheduling, <b>swap,</b> <b>time</b> constraint. I...|$|E
40|$|Time-shared {{computer}} (or processing) {{facilities are}} treated as stochastic queueing systems under priority service disciplines, and the performance measure of these systems is taken to be the average {{time spent in the}} system. Models are analyzed in which time-shared computer usage is obtained by giving each request a fixed quantum Q of time on the processor, after which the request is placed {{at the end of a}} queue of other requests; the queue of requests is constantly cycled, giving each user Q seconds on the machine per cycle. The case for which Q ~ 0 (a processor-shared model) is then analyzed using methods from queueing theory. A general time-shared facility is then considered in which priority groups are introduced. Specifically, the pth priority group is given gpQ seconds in the processor each time around. Letting Q [...] > 0 gives results for the priority processor-shared system. These disciplines are compared with the first-come-first-served disciplines. The systems considered provide the two basic features desired in any time-shared system, namely, rapid service for short jobs and the virtual appearance of a (fractional capacity) processor available on a full-time basis. No charge is made for <b>swap</b> <b>time,</b> thus providing results for "ideal" systems. The results hold only for Poisson arrivals and geometric (or exponential) service-time distributions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Time-shared {{processing}} systems (e. g. communication or computer systems) are studied by considering priority disciplines {{operating in a}} stochastic queueing environment. Results are obtained for the average time spent ia the system, conditioned {{on the length of}} required service (e. g. message length or number of computations). No charge is made for <b>swap</b> <b>time,</b> and the results hold only for Markov assumptions for the arrival and service processes. Two distinct feedback models with a single quantum-controlled service are considered. The first is a round-robin (RR) system in which the service facility processes each customer for a maximum of q sec. If the customer's service is completed during this quantum, he leaves the system; otherwise he returns {{to the end of the}} queue to await another quantum of service. The second is a feedback (FBN) system with N queues in which a new arrival joins the tail of the first queue. The server gives service to a customer from the nth queue only if all lower numbered queues are empty. When taken from the nth queue, a customer is given q sec of service. If this completes his processing requirement he leaves the system; otherwise he joins the tail of the (n q- 1) -st queue (n = 1, 2,. -., N- 1). The limiting case of N-+: ¢ is also treated. Both models are therefore quantum-controlled, and involve feedback to the tail of some queue, thus providing rapid service for customers with short service-time requirements. The interesting limiting case in which q [...] ~ 0 (a "processor-shared " model) is also examined. Comparison is made with the first-come-first-served system and also the shortest-job-first discipline. Finally the FB = system is generalized to include (priority) inputs at each of tim queues in the system...|$|E
