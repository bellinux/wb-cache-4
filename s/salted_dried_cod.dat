40|$|Temperatures {{higher than}} 20 ºC can boost the growth, on the <b>salted</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> surface, of {{bacteria}} that present a red pigment (Rodrigues et al., 2003; Rodrigues et al., 2005). These organisms, besides {{the change of}} the food product appearance, also cause an unpleasant flavor and the product is rejected by the consumers, although does not cause any health concern. Currently, the export of <b>salted</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>cod,</b> to Africa, has increased and {{a great amount of}} product is rejected due to the high environmental temperature and the lack of a proper cold chain storage infrastructure. Vacuum packaging, and modified atmosphere packaging have been used for fresh and cooked seafood preservation, but, as far as the authors know, were never used to preserve <b>salted</b> and <b>dried</b> fish.

40|$|This {{study is}} a demand {{analysis}} for the European Union mainland’s import of the different product forms of cod. A system of demand equations are specified with a Linearized Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) to analyze the demand for fresh, frozen, clip, <b>salt</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> using a data set from 1988 - 2014. The time series properties are explored and found to be non-stationary but they cointegrate. To avoid the problem of spurious results due to non-stationarity the variables have been written in first difference form. The competition between these product forms has received little attention in the literature. There could be some important substitution effects between the commodities. All the different product forms considered {{come from the same}} raw material, cod. The processing industry has the opportunity to produce all of the different product forms under consideration: fresh, frozen, <b>salt,</b> clip and <b>dried</b> <b>cod.</b> It is important for this industry to enhance its knowledge about the demand for these different product forms. Harmonic variables are included in the model to account for seasonal fluctuations. The result show that almost all of the product forms are substitutes with each other except for fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>cod,</b> which are complements. Papers that investigate the different product forms of cod are either rare or non-existent. Hence, this paper should provide a unique insight into on how the different product forms of cod operate in the European market...|$|R
40|$|The demand {{function}} represents the fundamental building block in economics and provides important information for investment and policy purposes. The {{aim of this}} paper is to characterize and measure the demand structure for imported cod products to Portugal. A PCAIDS model is used to identify and measure own- and cross-price elasticities of demand for frozen, salted and <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> products. The calculated elasticities of demand are then used in combination with a demand growth index model to measure shifts in demand impacting price of product. Controlling for supply shocks the growth index shows over the period a positive growth in demand for frozen product but a negative change in demand growth for salted, and to a lesser degree, for <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> products. The results are used in simulating alternative price demand scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Cod fishing off of Newfoundland {{played a}} vital role in the economies of France and Britain, the rival nations of the 18 th Century. Thousands of men and whole {{communities}} depended on fishing and exporting <b>salt</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> from the Newfoundland fisheries to Southern Europe, the Near East and the West Indies. In the age of Enlightenment, Encyclopédistes and Philosophes contrasted cod fishing — a lonely venture in northern climates, simultaneously virtuous and profitable — to the corrupt enterprises of settlers in the tropics; the real treasures of the New World were the bounties of the sea.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the Dominican market for <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> <b>cod,</b> by presenting an analysis of demand for this product from 1988 to 2015. Additionally, the study investigates how demand for slated & <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> influences the Norwegian companies´ current and future market position. Finally, it examines whether Country-of-Origin (COO) has an effect on Dominican consumer choice. Data collection is triangulated through the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. An OLS model was used to identify income, own and cross-price elasticities of demand in addition to 11 in-depth interviews to test the proposed framework. The findings indicate that the market is price and income sensitive, i. e. changes in price and income has a significant effect on demand. This is confirmed both in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. The Dominican market is currently dominated by Norwegian companies who have approximately 98 % of the market. Future prospects indicate increased competition from China, due to an increase in national wealth. Furthermore, COO is found to have no effect on consumer choice...|$|R

40|$|Electrophoresis and {{chromatography}} {{were used}} to analyse the water-soluble proteins of fresh, <b>salted</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus mor- hua L.) and of re-hydrated products. Sodium dodecyl sulphate pore gradient gel electrophoresis showed {{that there was a}} great loss of water-soluble proteins during stockfish re-hydration. Furthermore, comparison of the electrophoresis patterns of cod products, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, showed the presence of cross-linked protein aggregates, related to the oxidation of SH groups and oxidative stress. Similar results were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography, which confirmed a great loss of water-soluble proteins and a higher level of SH oxidation in hydrated stockfish samples. Finally, capillary electrophoresis allowed definition of the unfolded state of denatured proteins in salted cod. This technique also proved a fast and useful way to differentiate the two products by analysis of water-soluble proteins...|$|R

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. In this paper, {{we measure}} demand {{characteristics}} for imported cod products in Portugal. Portugal imports cod primarily in three forms; frozen, salted and <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> but consumption of cod is primarily <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> product. Norway {{is the major}} producer and exporter of <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> <b>cod</b> but Portugal also produces this product from. Our interest is twofold; first, in measuring the elasticity of demand for imported product and, second in measuring growth in demand for imported products. It is common in economics to measure elasticities based on the Almost Ideal Demand System. However, to estimate an AIDS model requires price/quantity information on all commodities within the market structure of interest. For this paper, the Proportionally Calibrated Almost Ideal Demand System model is used (Epstein and Rubinfeld 2002, 2004). The PCAIDS model maintains the economic structure of the AIDS model but when data is limited, it is designed as a calibrated simulated model used to recover demand elasticities. Marsh (2003) shows a straightforward technique for measuring growth in market demand using an index approach. The technique is a decomposition {{of a change in}} quantity demanded between the percentage change accounted for by a price change along the demand curve and the percentage change accounted for by a shift in the demand curve. Results suggest a strong positive growth in demand for frozen product doubling the price of the product relative to the initial period. But both imported <b>salted</b> & <b>dried</b> and <b>salted</b> product show overall negative shifts in demand...|$|R
5000|$|On first {{entering}} the bays and ports of Newfoundland, {{the attention of}} a stranger is mostly attracted by the remarkable appearance exhibited by the innumerable stages erected along the sea-shore for the <b>salting</b> and <b>drying</b> of <b>cod.</b> The shores around the harbour of St. John's are entirely covered with them, and their construction is particularly simple. Numerous supporters, exactly resembling [...] "Kentish" [...] hop-poles, are first fixed in the ground: over these is placed a horizontal platform of similar poles; and the whole is finally overspread with a covering of dry fern. This sort of structure is called, by the fishermen, a Fish Flake: but there are other stages, erected in a similar manner, although standing partly in the water, with a hut at their extremity, for the reception and salting of cod, previous to its final removal to the [...] "Flakes", for the purpose of being dried in the sun.|$|R

40|$|Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) {{has been}} an {{economically}} and culturally important food in Spain for hundreds of years. The Spanish cod fishery in Newfoundland waters developed slowly over time, and was sometimes erratic in its operation. The demand for <b>dried</b> <b>salted</b> <b>cod</b> was always high, and what was not caught by the Spanish fleet was imported. Fishery development accelerated after WW II, but the fleets then faced economic difficulties during the 1970 s and 1980 s. Catch levels of cod in the Northwest Atlantic declined during this time due to overfishing {{and a reduction in}} the number of boats in the fleet. Although cod has always been the target of the fishery, fishers in recent years have increasingly caught other species as well, especially with the introduction of freezer trawlers into the fleet. The demand for salted cod has remained high, however, despite the increasing importance of other target species and the growing competition with fresh fish. Although data sources in the Spanish fisheries often underestimate landings and rarely identify where fish were caught, Atlantic cod catch data taken from the Spanish Fishery Yearbooks fit closely with NAFO-FAO data. However, discards since the 1970 s and non-reported catches may each represent up to 25 % of the weight of cod landed. Thus, Spanish cod catches are probably substantially underestimated...|$|R
