5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted {{to emulate the}} sound of a Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons to emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki <b>sales</b> <b>rep</b> Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, when office {{administrator}} Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{gets a new}} computer for the receptionist's desk to replace the older model, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) wants a new computer, too. Pam points out that {{if she were to}} get a new computer for one <b>sales</b> <b>rep,</b> she would have to get one for every <b>sales</b> <b>rep.</b> Unwilling to let it go, Andy convinces Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) into trading computers with him. Pam is angry when she finds out, and forces him to switch the computers back. In addition to continue pushing for a new computer, Andy confronts Pam about humiliating him in front of the office. In order to make it up to him, she tells him that the only way he can get a new computer is if his breaks. To accomplish this, he accepts all cookies, intentionally opens pop-up ads, and places food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, but they scratch it up to make it not look brand new. When they pretend to argue about {{it in front of the}} office, Pam claims that she found it in the warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that is in the warehouse and where it is stored, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days. Pam gleefully tells the interviewers that she is now [...] "full-on corrupt".|$|E

40|$|Innovation commercialization, an {{important}} managerial challenge, depends {{heavily on the}} sales force for its success. However, little empirical research has examined how firms should direct <b>sales</b> <b>reps</b> in this task in a global, multicultural context. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study investigates how to motivate <b>sales</b> <b>reps</b> for innovation selling in different cultures with various financial and nonfinancial steering instruments. The authors collected data in two waves from <b>sales</b> <b>reps</b> in 38 countries on four continents, making this study {{one of the largest}} international investigations in sales research. Results reveal that steering instruments should correspond closely with reps’ national culture in terms of power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. For example, findings show that whereas individualism strengthens the positive relationship between variable compensation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation, power distance and uncertainty avoidance weaken this relationship. Results also reveal that long-term orientation strengthens the positive relationship between supervisor appreciation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation...|$|R
