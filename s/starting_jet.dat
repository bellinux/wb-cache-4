The initial treatment involves ensuring an adequate airway and it ranges from tracheostomy to endo-extralaryngeal laterofixating operations in general anesthesia. Subglottic high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is an alternative ventilatory approach in airway surgery. HFJV offers optimal endolaryngeal working conditions, immobility of vocal cords, adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The HFJV was prospectively studied in 20 consecutive female patients with bilateral vocal fold paralysis. Ventilation was performed as subglottic HFJV via jet catheter inserted through the vocal cord. Anesthesia was administered as total intravenous anesthesia. At the end of the procedure, the jet catheter was exchanged with LMA laryngeal mask until spontaneous breathing was established. Subglottic HFJV was used in 20 patients undergoing endo-extralaryngeal laterofixating operations with suspension microlaryngoscopy. The mean duration of surgery was 32. 25 minutes, mean age 47. 35 (SD 9. 75) years, and mean body mass index 26. 39 kg m(- 2) (SD 5. 03).

To resolve {{the relative importance of}} the vortex ring and trailing jet for propulsion, a piston-cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance is used to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by <b>starting</b> <b>jets</b> for L/D ratios in the range 2 – 8.

The latter result leads to a local maximum in the average thrust during a pulse near L/D values associated with vortex rings whose circulation has been maximized. These results are shown to be related to the nozzle exit over-pressure generated during vortex ring formation. The over-pressure is in turn shown to be associated with the acceleration of ambient fluid by vortex ring formation in the form of added and entrained mass...|$|R

Pulsatile jet propulsion {{can be accomplished}} using a fully-pulsed jet (i. e., a periodic series of <b>starting</b> <b>jets</b> or pulses), the unsteady nature of which engenders vortex ring formation. The significance of vortex ring formation {{for this type of}} propulsion is studied experimentally using a piston-cylinder mechanism to generate starting and fully-pulsed, round jets of water into water at a maximum jet Reynolds number of 13, 000. <b>Starting</b> <b>jets</b> are considered separately since they are the limiting case of a fully-pulsed jet at zero pulsing frequency. Direct measurements of the total impulse per pulse (<b>starting</b> <b>jets)</b> and time-averaged thrust (fully-pulsed jets) are made using a force balance. Hotfilm anemometry is used to measure the jet velocity and Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) is used to measure vortex ring position, vorticity, energy, circulation, and impulse. The pulses for both types of jets are generated using piston stroke to diameter ratios (L/D) in the range 2 to 8 for piston velocity programs in a generally positive-sloping (PS) or negative-sloping (NS) family. The range of L/D considered brackets the transition between the case where an individual vortex ring is produced with each pulse (small L/D) and the case where the vortex ring stops growing and pinches off from its generating jet, producing a trailing jet (large L/D). This transition occurs at a higher L/D for the PS ramps, allowing the effects of vortex ring formation and pinch off to be illuminated by comparison of the results for the NS and PS ramps. The significance of vortex ring formation is first analyzed for <b>starting</b> <b>jets.</b> Measurements of the total impulse per pulse as a function of L/D show that a leading vortex ring adds more impulse per unit L/D than a trailing jet. This leads to a maximum in the average thrust during a pulse at the L/Ds just before vortex ring pinch off is observed for both the PS and NS ramps. The propulsive benefit provided by a leading vortex ring over a trailing jet is connected to over-pressure at the nozzle exit plane during vortex ring formation. DPIV measurements demonstrate that nozzle exit over-pressure also makes an important contribution to energy and circulation. It is shown that this over-pressure can be related to the momentum that must be supplied by the forming vortex ring to ambient fluid in the form of added and entrained mass. A model is proposed for nozzle exit over-pressure near the initiation of an impulsive velocity program where entrainment can be ignored. The model readily accounts for the pressure contribution to circulation in the NS ramps, but modeling of entrainment is required to properly determine impulse and energy. For the fully-pulsed jet experiments, a normalized thrust, [ [...] . ], is introduced to characterize the pressure effects associated with vortex ring formation. The pulsing frequency is expressed in dimensionless form as [ [...] . ], which is between 0 and 1 for all fully-pulsed jets. A propulsive benefit from pressure ([ [...] . ]) is observed for all L/D and [ [...] . ] considered. At low [ [...] . ], the results are similar to those for the <b>starting</b> <b>jets.</b> At higher [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] decreases with L/D as with the <b>starting</b> <b>jets,</b> which is related to the existence of vortex ring pinch off for all observed [ [...] . ].

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to examine the}} buoyancy-driven gravitational spreading currents, especially as applied to ocean disposal of wastewater and the accidental release of hazardous fluids, such as liquefied natural gas. A series of asymptotic solutions are used to describe the displacement of a gravitationally driven spreading front during an inertial phase of motion and the subsequent viscous phase. Solutions are derived by a force scale analysis and a self-similar technique for flows in stagnant, homogeneous, or linearly density-stratified environments. The self-similar solutions for inertial-buoyancy currents are found using an analogy to the well-known shallow-water wave propagation equations and also to those applicable to a blast wave in gasdynamics. For the viscous-buoyancy currents the analogy is to the viscous long wave approximation to a nonlinear diffusive wave, or thermal wave propagation. Other similarity solutions describing the initial stage of motion of the flow formed by the collapse of a finite volume fluid are developed by analogy to the expansion of a gas cloud into a vacuum.

40|$|The present thesis {{involves}} {{the study of}} introducing passive exit flexibility in a two dimensional <b>starting</b> <b>jet.</b> This is relevant to various biological flows like propulsion of aquatic creatures (jellyfish, squid etc.) and flow in the human heart. In the present study we introduce exit flexibility in two ways. The first method was by hinging rigid plates at the channel exit and the second was by attaching deformable flaps at the exit. In the hinged flaps cases, the experimental arrangement closely approximates the limiting case of a free-to-rotate rigid flap with negligible structural stiffness, damping and flap inertia; these limiting structural properties permitting the largest flap openings. In the deformable flaps cases, the flap’s stiffness (or its flexural rigidity EI) becomes an important parameter. In both cases, the initial condition was such that the flaps were parallel to the channel walls. With this, a piston was pushed {{in a controlled manner}} to form the <b>starting</b> <b>jet.</b> Using this arrangement, we start the flow and visualize the flap kinematics and make flow field measurements. A number of parameters were varied which include the piston speed, the flap length and the flap stiffness (in case of the deformable flaps). In the hinged rigid flaps cases, the typical motion of the flaps involves a rapid opening with flow initiation and a subsequent more gradual return to its initial position, which occurs while the piston is still moving. The initial opening of the flaps can be attributed to an excess pressure that develops in the channel when the flow starts, due to the acceleration that has to be imparted to the fluid slug between the flaps. In the case with flaps, additional pairs of vortices are formed because of the motion of the flaps and a complete redistribution of vorticity is observed. The length of the flaps is found to significantly affect flap kinematics when plotted using the conventional time scale L/d. However, with a newly defined time-scale based on the flap length (L/Lf), we find a good collapse of all the measured flap motions irrespective of flap length and piston velocity for an impulsively started piston motion. The maximum opening angle in all these impulsive velocity program cases, irrespective of the flap length, is found to be close to 15 degrees. Even though the flap kinematics collapses well with L/Lf, there are differences in the distribution of the ejected vorticity even for the same L/Lf. In the deformable flap cases, the initial excess pressure in the flap region causes the flaps to bulge outwards. The size of the bulge grows in size, as well as moves outwards as the flow develops and the flaps open out to reach their maximum opening. Thereafter, the flaps start returning to their initial straight position and remain there as long as the piston is in motion. Once the piston stops, the flaps collapse inwards and the two flap tips touch each other. It was found that the flap’s flexural rigidity {{played an important role in}} the kinematics. We define a new time scale (t) based on the flexural rigidity of the flaps (EI) and the flap length (Lf). Using this new time scale, we find that the time taken to reach the maximum bulge (t* 0. 03) and the time taken to reach the maximum opening (t* 0. 1) were approximately similar across various flap stiffness and flap length cases. The motion of the flaps results in the formation of additional pairs of vortices. Interestingly, the total final circulation remains almost the same as that of a rigid exit case, for all the flap stiffness and flap lengths studied. However, the final fluid impulse (after all the fluid had come out of the flap region) was always higher in the flap cases as compared to the rigid exit case because of vorticity redistribution. The rate at which the impulse increases was also higher in most flap cases. The final impulse values were as large as 1. 8 times the rigid exit case. Since the time rate of change of impulse is linked with force, the measurements suggest that introduction of flexible flaps at the exit could result in better propulsion performances for a system using starting jets. The work carried out in this thesis has shown that by attaching flexible flaps at the exit of an unsteady <b>starting</b> <b>jet,</b> dramatic changes can be made to the flow field. The coupled kinematics of the flaps with the flow dynamics led to desirable changes in the flow. Although the flaps introduced in this work are idealized and may not represent the kind of flexibility we encounter in biological systems, it gives us a better understanding of the importance of exit flexibility in these kinds of flows...|$|E

40|$|Vortex {{structures}} (monopoles, dipoles, quadrupoles) {{as well as}} {{more complex}} structures (vortex streets) are fundamental elements of geophysical turbulence. Because they can effectively transport momentum, heat, salt and biochemical products, they play an essential role in ocean dynamics. Organized vortex structures are a well-known feature of quasi-two-dimensional flows where motion in one direction is suppressed due to one of the following physical mechanisms: background rotation of the system, density stratification or geometrical restrictions such as for the flows in thin layers or soap films. [...] Vortex dipoles are formed in a viscous fluid when a force is applied locally to some volume of fluid. If the force acts impulsively, a translating vortex dipole is generated. If the force starts at t = 0 and then acts continuously a <b>starting</b> <b>jet</b> with a dipole at its front is generated. Solutions for unsteady viscous flows generated by the action of continuous or impulsive localized forces are obtained in Oseen approximation. The solutions are compared with direct numerical simulations of vortex dipoles as well as with laboratory experiments. The comparison shows good quantitative agreement in both cases. [...] A physical problem where the localized force acting continuously on fluid is placed in a uniform stream is equivalent to a problem of a fixed body in a uniform stream, while the couple of forces acting in opposite direction are equivalent to the problem of self-propelled body moving at constant velocity through a fluid. The solutions for the two-dimensional far-field wake are obtained in both cases. At a certain Reynolds number, wakes become unstable and form vortex streets. New series of high-resolution 2 D numerical simulations is performed to study the characteristics of the wakes including the shedding frequency {{for a wide range of}} control parameters such as translational velocity, magnitude and spatial extent of a localized force. The results of numerical experiments of unsteady wake flow show existence of a great variety of flow regimes and are in good qualitative agreement with laboratory experiments...|$|E

The {{results show that the}} development of the <b>starting</b> buoyant <b>jet</b> may be identified to three stages: an initial growth stage, a transitional stage and a fully developing stage. It is observed that the buoyant jet flow in the fully developing stage is steady in the cases with Rayleigh numbers lower than a critical value but unsteady in those with Rayleigh numbers higher than the critical value. Further, the dependence on the Rayleigh number of the flux of the buoyant jet is quantified...|$|R
