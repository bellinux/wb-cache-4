5|$|As a group, the Sclerodermatineae {{have a broad}} distribution, {{and some}} genera (Pisolithus and <b>Scleroderma)</b> have been found on all continents except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations of}} several Sclerodermatineae genera have been established. Studies {{have demonstrated that}} Astraeus, Pisolithus, and <b>Scleroderma</b> form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previously thought to be saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and <b>Scleroderma</b> {{have been used in}} forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings.|$|E
5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms {{of these patients}} can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and <b>scleroderma.</b> Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E
5|$|Most species {{historically}} {{named as}} Mycenastrum {{have since been}} transferred to other genera, usually <b>Scleroderma,</b> but also Glyptoderma, Bovista, and Gastropila. Many, including those species {{that have not been}} reclassified are poorly known; the nomenclatural authority Index Fungorum considers only four of these former Mycenastrum species to be currently valid: Bovista bovistoides, B.lycoperdoides, Gastropila fragilis, and Glyptoderma coelatum.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} and evolutionary origins of Calostoma were {{a matter of}} considerable historical debate. Based on various morphological features, 19th-century mycologists viewed it as a relative of, variously, <b>Scleroderma,</b> Clathrus, Geastrum, or Tulostoma. The advent of molecular phylogenetics in the late 20th century confirmed that the Gasteromycetales order was polyphyletic because gasteroid fungi do not form a single clade. Efforts to use nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequencing to resolve the proper taxonomic placement of these fungi revealed that Calostoma cinnabarinum was not closely related to true puffballs, stinkhorns, most earthstars, or gasteroid agarics such as Tulostoma or Podaxis, but instead belonged within the Boletales. Further research organized a group of mostly gasteroid fungi, including Calostoma, into the newly named suborder Sclerodermatineae. This analysis confirmed that C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelii are distinct species, and identified their closest relatives outside the genus as Gyroporus, Astraeus, and <b>Scleroderma.</b> A subsequent multigene (nuc-ssu, nuc-lsu, 5.8S, atp6, and mt-lsu) study redrew the Sclerodermatineae cladogram slightly, making Pisolithus the closest relatives of Calostoma.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, a phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences helped {{to clarify the}} phylogeny of Calostoma. Using the species C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelli as representative examples, the research showed the genus evolutionarily related to the monophyletic Boletales clade, and separate from clades containing most of the gilled mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and non-bolete Gasteromycetes. Calostoma belongs to the suborder Sclerodermatineae in the Boletales order. The Boletales comprise the following genera: Boletinellus, Calostoma, Gyroporus, Phlebopus, Pisolithus, <b>Scleroderma,</b> and Veligaster. Calostoma {{is thought to have}} diverged evolutionarily from the other Boletales between 52–115 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Sclerocitrin, a pigment {{compound}} originally {{isolated from}} the common earthball (<b>Scleroderma</b> citrinum), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow pigment, chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described in 1805 as Lycoperdon corium {{in the second}} volume of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Flore Française. They attributed authorship to French botanist Louis Ben Guersent, who discovered it in an alfalfa field between the town of La Sotte and Rouen in northern France. Synonyms include <b>Scleroderma</b> corium published by Arthur Harmount Graves in 1830, and Steerbekia corium published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1849. The species was given its current name by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1842, who circumscribed the genus Mycenastrum to contain it. Generic synonyms are Vassiliĭ Matveievitch Czernajew's 1845 Endonevrum and Stephan Schulzer von Müggenburg's 1876 Pachyderma.|$|E
5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either <b>scleroderma,</b> polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both <b>scleroderma</b> and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The Juvenile <b>Scleroderma</b> Network is an {{organization}} dedicated to provide emotional support and educational information to {{parents and their children}} living with juvenile <b>scleroderma,</b> to support pediatric research to identify the cause of and the cure for juvenile <b>scleroderma,</b> and to enhance public awareness.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Scleroderma</b> Society is a UK charity {{founded in}} 1982 {{to provide support}} for both people with <b>scleroderma</b> and their families.|$|E
25|$|Treatments for <b>scleroderma</b> renal crisis include ACE inhibitors. Prophylactic use of ACE inhibitors is {{currently}} not recommended, as recent data suggest a poorer prognosis in patient treated with these drugs {{prior to the}} development of renal crisis. Transplanted kidneys are known to be affected by <b>scleroderma</b> and patients with early onset renal disease (within one year of the <b>scleroderma</b> diagnosis) are thought to have the highest risk for recurrence.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Scl-70 {{antibodies}} {{are linked}} to <b>scleroderma.</b> The sensitivity of the antibodies for <b>scleroderma</b> is approximately 34%, but is higher for cases with diffuse cutaneous involvement (40%), and lower for limited cutaneous involvement (10%). The specificity of the antibodies is 98% and 99.6% in other rheumatic diseases and normal individuals, respectively. In addition to <b>scleroderma,</b> these antibodies are found in approximately 5% of individuals with SLE. The antigenic target of anti-Scl-70 antibodies is topoisomerase I.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} clinical complication of <b>scleroderma</b> involving the kidney is <b>scleroderma</b> renal crisis. Symptoms of <b>scleroderma</b> renal crisis are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure {{with evidence of}} acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), azotemia (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scleroderma</b> and {{systemic}} sclerosis, which can feature esophageal dysmotility.|$|E
25|$|Autoantibodies to titin are {{produced}} {{in patients with}} the autoimmune disease <b>scleroderma.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Scleroderma</b> {{may also}} be {{associated}} with gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), also known as watermelon stomach. This is a condition where atypical blood vessels proliferate usually in a radially symmetric pattern around the pylorus of the stomach. GAVE can be a cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia in patients with <b>scleroderma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diffuse <b>scleroderma</b> {{can cause}} musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and other complications. Patients with greater {{cutaneous}} involvement {{are more likely}} to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud's phenomenon, which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic <b>scleroderma</b> and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. Calcinosis (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic <b>scleroderma,</b> and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other joints.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the American College of Rheumatology {{agreed on}} {{diagnostic}} criteria for <b>scleroderma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Renal involvement, in <b>scleroderma,</b> is {{considered}} a poor prognostic factor and frequently a cause of death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scleroderma</b> renal crisis, the {{occurrence}} of acute renal failure and malignant hypertension (very high blood pressure with evidence of organ damage) in people with <b>scleroderma,</b> is effectively treated with drugs from the class of the ACE inhibitors. The benefit of ACE inhibitors extends even {{to those who have}} to commence dialysis to treat their kidney disease, and may give sufficient benefit to allow the discontinuation of renal replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the <b>Scleroderma</b> Research Foundation is {{dedicated}} {{to raise awareness of}} the disease and assist those who are affected. The <b>Scleroderma</b> Research Foundation sponsors research into the condition. Comedian and television presenter Bob Saget, {{a board member of the}} SRF, directed the 1996 ABC TV movie For Hope, starring Dana Delany, which depicts a young woman fatally affected by scleroderma; the film was based on the experiences of Saget's sister Gay.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no clear}} obvious cause for <b>scleroderma</b> and {{systemic}} sclerosis. Genetic predisposition appears to be limited: genetic concordance is small; still, {{there is often a}} familial predisposition for autoimmune disease. Polymorphisms in COL1A2 and TGF-β1 may influence severity and development of the disease. There is limited evidence implicating cytomegalovirus (CMV) as the original epitope of the immune reaction, as well as parvovirus B19. Organic solvents and other chemical agents have been linked with <b>scleroderma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prognosis is {{determined}} by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited cutaneous <b>scleroderma</b> have a 10-year survival rate of 75%; less than 10% develop pulmonary arterial hypertension after 10 to 20 years. Patients with diffuse cutaneous <b>scleroderma</b> have a 10-year survival rate of 55%. Death is most often caused by lung, heart, and kidney involvement. There is also a slight increase in the risk of cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} <b>scleroderma</b> renal crisis was almost uniformily fatal. While {{outcomes}} have improved significantly {{with the use}} of ACE inhibitors the prognosis is often guarded, as a significant number of patients are refractory to treatment and develop renal failure. Approximately 5–10% of all diffuse cutaneous <b>scleroderma</b> patients develop renal crisis {{at some point in the}} course of their disease. Patients that have rapid skin involvement have the highest risk of renal complications. It is most common in diffuse cutaneous <b>scleroderma,</b> and is often associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase (in 59% of cases). Many proceed to dialysis, although this can be stopped within three years in about a third of cases. Higher age and (paradoxically) a lower blood pressure at presentation make it more likely that dialysis is needed.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{have also}} been used in chronic kidney failure and kidney {{involvement}} in systemic sclerosis (hardening of tissues, as <b>scleroderma</b> renal crisis).|$|E
25|$|UV rays also treat certain skin conditions. Modern {{phototherapy}} {{has been}} used to successfully treat psoriasis, eczema, jaundice, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and localized <b>scleroderma.</b>|$|E
25|$|The earthballs (<b>Scleroderma</b> species), dyeballs (Pisolithus species), {{and many}} false {{truffles}} are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial {{relationship with the}} roots of living trees.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the {{prevalence}} of systemic <b>scleroderma</b> is about 50,000, with different studies giving different estimates, usually ranging between 40,000 and 165,000.|$|E
25|$|Systemic <b>scleroderma,</b> {{also called}} diffuse <b>scleroderma</b> or {{systemic}} sclerosis, is an autoimmune {{disease of the}} connective tissue. It is characterized by thickening of the skin caused by accumulation of collagen, and by injuries to small arteries. There are two forms of scleroderma: localized and systemic. The localized (limited) form affects the skin of only the face, hands, and feet. The systemic (diffuse) form involves those and, in addition, may progress to visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Bleomycin (a {{chemotherapeutic}} agent) {{and possibly}} taxane chemotherapy may cause <b>scleroderma,</b> and occupational exposure to solvents {{has been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, <b>scleroderma</b> and {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus are also seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} form of <b>scleroderma</b> {{and systemic}} sclerosis may develop {{in patients with}} chronic renal failure. This form, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, {{has been linked to}} exposure to gadolinium-containing radiocontrast.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostaglandin}} iloprost is used {{to manage}} critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan {{is used to}} manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in <b>scleroderma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients with Secondary Raynaud's {{can also}} have {{symptoms}} related to their underlying diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon is the initial symptom that presents for 70% of patients with <b>scleroderma,</b> a skin and joint disease.|$|E
