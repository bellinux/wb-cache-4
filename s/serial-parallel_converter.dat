40|$|We present {{serial-parallel}} conversion for a heralded single photon source (heralded SPS). We theoretically {{show that}} with the heralding signal, the <b>serial-parallel</b> <b>converter</b> can route a stream of n photons to n different spatial modes more efficiently than is the case without using a heralding signal. We also experimentally demonstrate serial-parallel conversion for two photons generated from a heralded SPS. We achieve a conversion efficiency of 0. 533 ± 0. 003, which exceeds the maximum achievable efficiency of 0. 5 for serial-parallel conversion using unheralded photons, and is double the efficiency (0. 25) for that using beamsplitters. When the losses in the optical converter are corrected for, {{the efficiency of the}} current setup can be increased up to 0. 996 ± 0. 006. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the first {{complete}} system-level demonstration of a superconducting digital communication system. In today's digital computer and communication systems, managing data flow is a major challenge as the systems {{have to deal with}} a huge amount of information. A superconductor device may solve this problem. There have been several attempts to make superconducting switching core circuits, but there have been no complete system-level demonstrations. We have built such a system to demonstrate the efficiency of superconducting devices used in a communication system. Our system is focused on parallel processor communication, and consists of three-node PCs as processor elements, three interface boxes, and a superconductive chip immersed in a 4. 2 -K cryostat. The interconnection chip operation is essentially packet switching that was designed with a pipeline ring architecture. The interface box consists of parallel-serial <b>converters,</b> <b>serial-parallel</b> <b>converters,</b> a FIFO output buffer, and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{power energy}} {{conversion}} is growing {{rapidly in the}} world. There are two main wind farm types, namely ac grid-based and dc grid-based wind farms. The dc grid-based approach reduces the size and weight of the magnetic components and cables. In the dc system, the step-up dc/dc converter is the key component when interfacing the wind turbine to the ac grid, via its low/medium voltage generator. This thesis focuses on the control and design of a wind energy conversion system based on dc/dc current source converters. An optimized One-Power-Point method for maximum power tracking is proposed. It incorporates One-Power-Point control and Maximum Power Differential Voltage control to allow the wind turbine to extract more energy during rapid wind speed changes. A current output hard-switched full bridge <b>converter</b> and <b>serial-parallel</b> resonant <b>converter</b> with an intermediate high frequency transformer are investigated for interfacing wind turbines to a local dc grid. These converters are assessed and compared in terms of semiconductor stresses and losses. A new modified One-Power-Point control method is proposed for the dc/dc converter, which tracks the maximum power during wind speed changes. A design procedure for the <b>serial-parallel</b> resonant <b>converter</b> is presented, based on its characteristics specific to a wind energy conversion system (WECS). A current source dc/dc converter based multi-terminal dc WECS is presented, investigated, and simulated. A practical multi-terminal dc WECS verifies its feasibility and stability, using two dc current output wind turbine units. Furthermore, a coordinated de-loading control scheme for the current sourcing based WECS is proposed, to cater for ac grid demand changes. It combines pitch control, dc dumping chopper control, and dc/dc converter control, to safely and quickly establish de-loading control. Both simulation and experimental results verify the de-loading scheme. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
