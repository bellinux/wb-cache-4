5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{relative}} {{or a friend}} who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would {{go a step further}} in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{was born}} in Missouri and trained for {{a career as a}} printworker. He moved to Montana because he wanted an {{adventure}} in the West, but ended up staying there for the remainder of his life. At first he worked as an itinerant printer, but after getting married he trained in medicine and became a physician. The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wanderlust, frequently changing location and often considering a change of career (he qualified as an attorney at one point). This became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated into the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{unfolding}} events <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{negative impact}} on the cohesion between U.S. and South Vietnamese indigenous forces. The resolve of the South Vietnamese, Montagnard CIDG soldiers in particular, had apparently been shaken and they disobeyed an order to carry out a sweep operation at the rear end of the camp, and their Vietnamese commander even refused to leave his bunker to encourage the soldiers. The morale and discipline of the indigenous forces had sunk so low that they began to leave their defensive positions without permission, although their section of the camp was never subjected to a major ground attack. Consequently, the behavior of indigenous CIDG soldiers during the various stages of the battle, coupled with information that 'friendly' Montagnard soldiers had turned on U.S. Marines at Ngok Tavak, had the effect of unnerving U.S. Army soldiers in Khâm Đức. To ensure CIDG soldiers would not abandon their posts, U.S. soldiers threatened to shoot anyone attempting to run away.|$|E

In correspondence with the United States Government {{he noted that}} the country <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> difficult climate, few North Americans and no roads. Attempts to deliver on Buchanan's instructions for a cross-border treaty with Peru were also rebuffed, as the Peruvian Government had not been advised that Appleton would be undertaking this task and declined to negotiate with him. Discontented and in poor health, Appleton requested that he be recalled to the United States. He resigned on May 4, 1849, less than six months after assuming his post.|$|E
25|$|By late August, Majerus <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> slim lead among {{executive}} board members over Ephlin, {{while the other}} candidates (including Bieber) {{did not have much}} support. At its meeting on September 20, the UAW {{executive board}} agreed to lift the campaigning moratorium, and set November 12 as the date for choosing its official slate. Support for the four candidates had not changed by this time. The relatively youthful Yokich was considered a dark horse candidate, and he was under pressure to withdraw and support one of the others. Ephlin, however, appeared to be gaining support due to his successful contract negotiations with Ford and his increasingly polished public speaking skills.|$|E

He never married, but <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rewarding social life — he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends whom he frequently met, among them Joseph Green, an English merchant in Königsberg.|$|E

The {{remaining}} riders of the Rabobank team were given the choice to start the 17th stage without Michael Rasmussen, or to withdraw. That evening they decided to withdraw, but the team changed its mind and announced the following morning that the riders would be starting the 17th stage. Although he started with the rest of the team, Denis Menchov (team leader on the road, who deferred to Rasmussen when the latter <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better chance at winning) abandoned the race in the middle of the stage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{creation}} of the residential school's, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem with any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{sighting}} of eight objects also occurred over Tulsa, Oklahoma on July 12, 1947. In this instance, a photo was taken {{and published in}} the Tulsa Daily World the following day (photo at right). Interestingly, the photographer, Enlo Gilmore, said that in blowups of the photo, the objects resembled baseball catcher's mitts or flying wings. He was {{of the opinion that}} the military had a secret fleet of flying wing airplanes. He had been a gunnery officer in the Navy during the war, and using information from another witness, also a veteran, he performed a triangulation and arrived at an estimation of speed of , or essentially the same estimate as Arnold's.

25|$|During {{the first}} rounds, Trout <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good game plan. However, Álvarez's power took over {{after the third}} round, {{eventually}} scoring a knockdown in the seventh round to give Trout the first knockdown of his career. Álvarez set up the knockdown with a pawing left jab, followed by the straight right hand. The fight was closer than expected, but Álvarez still managed to dominate Trout throughout the fight with impressive head movement and shocking power. All three judges scorecards {{were in favor of}} Álvarez with a fair margin (115-112, 116-111 and 118-109). Although the last score card (118-109) created controversy, the majority of sport analysts had Álvarez winning by at least 2 points. Immediately after the bout, Trout stated that he hadn't underestimated Álvarez but that he trained to fight a completely different fighter.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} Group A saw Kenya {{taking on the}} New Zealanders. Kenya won the toss and elected to bat first on a pitch which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of runs. However, the New Zealanders started very well, restricting the Kenyans for runs {{throughout}} the first 6 overs. The pressure paid off as Tim Southee trapped Alex Obanda in front with the score at 16 after 7 overs. Fellow opener Seren Waters and Collins Obuya tried to rebuild but Hamish Bennett came into the attack and got Waters lbw to make the score 40/2. Bennett then ripped through the Kenyan batting and got 3 more wickets in double-quick time to reduce the Kenyans to 49/5. The shattered Kenyans then folded, with only Rakep Patel offering resistance with 16 not out as Southee and Jacob Oram finished off the tail to get Kenya all out for 69 in 23.5 overs.|$|E
25|$|However, the arguable {{climax of}} the season {{occurred}} during the season's final doubleheader at the Highlanders’ home stadium, Hilltop Park. In order to win the pennant, New York needed to take both games from Boston. With Jack Chesbro, the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, New York <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good chance of winning the first game. However, {{in the top of}} the ninth inning with the score tied 2–2 with a man on third {{in the top of the}} ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro allowing Boston's Lou Criger to score the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history. Unfortunately the NL champion New York Giants had previously declined to play any postseason series, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led to the two leagues immediately turning the World Series into a permanent championship, starting in 1905.|$|E
