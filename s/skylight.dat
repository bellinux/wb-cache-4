It won the 2014 Evening Standard Theatre Award for Revival of the Year and was nominated for the 2014 Olivier Award for Best Revival She returned to Broadway when <b>Skylight</b> transferred in April 2015. Her performance as Kyra Hollis was received with critical acclaim and she has received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.|$|E
5|$|Later in the evening, at {{approximately}} 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred {{the roof of}} the embassy. They discovered a <b>skylight,</b> and succeeded in unlocking it for potential use as an access point, should they later be required to storm the building. They also attached ropes to the chimneys to allow soldiers to abseil down the building and gain access through the windows if necessary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skylighting</b> types include roof windows, unit <b>skylights,</b> tubular {{daylighting}} devices (TDDs), sloped glazing, {{and custom}} <b>skylights.</b> Uses include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Open <b>skylights</b> {{were used}} in Ancient Roman architecture, such as the oculus of the Pantheon. Glazed 'closed' <b>skylights</b> have been in use since the Industrial Revolution made {{advances}} in glass production manufacturing. Mass production units since the mid-20th century have brought <b>skylights</b> to many uses and contexts. Energy conservation has brought new motivation, design innovation, transmission options, and efficiency rating systems for <b>skylights</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Only {{three of}} the seven <b>skylights</b> are {{accessible}} by boat on the underground river: <b>Skylights</b> I, II, and III. <b>Skylights</b> IV and V are accessible by diving through the river a distance of 50 m and 70 m, respectively.|$|R
5|$|The {{first use}} of CS gas on the UK {{mainland}} that {{was not part of}} military training was carried out in 1944 during a hostage siege at a north London address. Soldiers were asked to throw CS grenades through the <b>skylight</b> in hope of bringing the incident to a speedy conclusion, but the hostage-taker had brought his civilian-issue gas mask with him, negating the effect.|$|E
5|$|Remy is {{an idealistic}} and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly {{developed}} senses of taste and smell. Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams {{of becoming a}} cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's colony in her house and attempts to exterminate them, {{they are forced to}} flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a <b>skylight</b> overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a <b>skylight.</b> During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
50|$|The {{waiting room}} is flooded with natural light from <b>skylights.</b> These <b>skylights</b> were {{blackened}} during the Second World War, but restored for the 2012 re-opening.|$|R
50|$|Plastics used in <b>skylights</b> are UV {{stabilized}} and may feature {{other advances}} to improve thermal properties. Lack of accepted standards for measuring light transmittance is a disadvantage for comparing and choosing <b>skylights</b> with plastic glazing.|$|R
2500|$|At the time, {{the station}} was also called [...] "City Hall Loop." [...] Unlike {{the rest of the}} subway line, the City Hall station had tall tile arches, brass fixtures, chandeliers, <b>skylights,</b> polychrome tile, and elegant curves that ran along the platform. It was lit by wrought iron chandeliers and the three <b>skylights</b> of cut {{amethyst}} glass that allowed sunshine onto parts of the platform. During World War II, the <b>skylights</b> were blacked out with tar for safety.|$|R
5|$|The two Amtrak tracks {{share an}} island platform; the RTA tracks {{do not have}} any platforms. The {{structure}} has a porte-cochère, which protects passengers from inclement weather. The interior was built with a similar design to that of the exterior, and features a central <b>skylight.</b> Shadows from its exposed trusses create different patterns on the brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the trusses, as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend to recede and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area.|$|E
5|$|After being {{vacated by}} the Keys, the {{building}} was purchased by 's Bank. Not long after acquiring the building, the bank removed the ceiling from the chamber, and added a large <b>skylight</b> to create a grand banking hall. The building was repainted in an expensive shade of blue which was fashionable at the time. In 1900, when 's Bank collapsed, {{the building was}} taken over by Parr's Bank. The render was stripped off the outside of the building sometime during the 1910s or 1920s, revealing the limestone underneath. In 1918, the bank became part of Westminster Bank. In the 1960s, the upper floor of the chamber was replaced. The building was presented to the Castletown Commissioners in 1973 by the National Westminster Bank on the condition that it serve the town. It was used as the Town Hall until the opening of the Town Hall and Civic Centre in 1989, and then as the Castletown Rural Library.|$|E
5|$|Brick Bank (set number 10251) is the {{eleventh}} {{set in the}} Modular Building line and the fourth corner building. It was released on January 1, 2016. This set contains 2380 pieces. The Brick Bank features a bank, secretary’s office, bank manager’s office, laundromat and a detailed façade and sidewalk. The bank features an atrium foyer with wide, arched entrance, triangular-patterned floor tiling, ornate chandelier, oxidized-copper colored <b>skylight,</b> transaction counter with hidden alarm buttons and security glass, and a bank vault with safe deposit boxes and a large round door. The laundromat features a printed window, tiled floor and 4 laundry machines. The secretary’s office features a wall clock, desk, typewriter, cabinet with opening drawers, fireplace and an espresso machine. The bank manager’s office features a large desk with banker’s lamp and approval stamp, leather-look chair, printed portrait, statue and a cabinet. It includes 5 minifigures.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{signature}} of Wright's designs {{is a large}} amount of windows, and the design for Massaro House included 26 <b>skylights.</b> The <b>skylights</b> chosen and installed in the home are domed, while Wright designed <b>skylights</b> that were flat panels. Massaro pointed out that flat panels are shown to leak, which Storrer argued is a known issue with Wright designs; also pointing out that solutions exist that would have allowed Massaro to stay true to [...] "Wrightian" [...] design principles.|$|R
50|$|The equator-facing {{side of a}} {{building}} is south in the northern hemisphere, and north in the southern hemisphere. <b>Skylights</b> on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination, except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator {{side of the building}} (at some latitudes). <b>Skylights</b> on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning. West-facing <b>skylights</b> provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day.|$|R
50|$|Plastic glazing infill is {{commonly}} used in many <b>skylights</b> and TDDs. These assemblies typically contain thermally formed domes, but molded shapes are not uncommon. Domed <b>skylights</b> are typically used on low slope roofs. The dome shape allows for shedding of water and burning embers.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non-structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a wall on the second storey, and {{could be used as}} an exhibition hall. A four-storey high waterfall was built {{at the back of the}} building, which has a new three-storey extension. A stained glass <b>skylight</b> was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres (39,800 to 49,500 square feet), with 4,650 square metres (50,000 square feet) of retail space created for use by the store.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the <b>skylight.</b> The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass <b>skylight</b> ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E
50|$|An {{interior}} court originally featured three <b>skylights</b> {{which provided}} natural {{light to the}} first floor postal workroom below. These have been removed and the openings infilled with a flat roof slab. These <b>skylights</b> were originally designed to provide natural light {{to the first floor}} postal workroom.|$|R

5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre {{were told that the}} new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and {{sent a letter to the}} editor printed in The Times in October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, died at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a <b>skylight</b> while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.|$|E
5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a <b>skylight</b> supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in the cages and a <b>skylight</b> dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1981 the {{building}} was renovated {{with much of the}} courtroom refurbished with Italian silk paneling, hand-painted carpet, and new furniture built by inmates. This refurbishing was completed in 2002 when the State of Oregon Law Library’s renovations were completed. During this time in 1989, {{the building}} was added to Salem’s Historic Properties List as a local historic landmark. Funds for the renovations came from private donors. The stained-glass <b>skylight</b> located above the courtroom that has a design of the Oregon State Seal was reinforced at this time and a protective clear <b>skylight</b> was built over the decorative <b>skylight</b> installed in 1914.|$|E
