5|$|Fortune {{published}} many {{articles in}} Inner Light magazine, {{a number of}} which were collected together and published in books. In 1930, the first such collection was published as Mystical Meditations upon the Collects, in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments. In 1931 a number of her Inner Light articles on Spiritualism appeared as Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. <b>She</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and 'cosmic mediums' such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that {{the spirits of the}} dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu. In 1934, she assembled a number of her Inner Light articles on Glastonbury as Avalon of the Heart, while further Inner Light articles were assembled as Practical Occultism in Daily Life, a book aimed at a general reader.|$|E
25|$|Another {{version is}} Thomas Hardy's The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse, a one-act play which was {{published}} in 1923. Hardy and his first wife visited Tintagel on various occasions: <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> sketch of the inside of the church as it was about 1867. Robert Stephen Hawker's poem about the bells of Forrabury refers also to those of Tintagel, but more notable is his one on the Quest for the Sangraal (first published at Exeter in 1864).|$|E
25|$|An {{immediate}} controversy arose {{about an}} article regarding the Dawson shootings by journalist Jan Wong, of the Toronto-based Globe and Mail. Three {{days after the}} event, Wong, who {{was born and raised}} in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled Get under the desk, in which <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of the Quebec society and its protective language laws.|$|E

500|$|Later <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> {{distinction}} between their methods, arguing that Quimby's involved one mind healing another, while hers depended on {{a connection with}} Divine Mind. In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before she met him. She wrote later: [...] "We caught some of his thoughts, and he caught some of ours; and both of us were pleased to say this to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray {{stated that}} she had {{restricted}} her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England. <b>She</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> division between what she termed [...] "Operative Witchcraft", which referred {{to the performance of}} charms and spells with any purpose, and [...] "Ritual Witchcraft", by which she meant [...] "the ancient religion of Western Europe", a fertility-based faith that she also termed [...] "the Dianic cult". She claimed that the cult had [...] "very probably" [...] once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a [...] "Mother Goddess" [...] but that [...] "at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female". In her argument, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, [...] "manifest and incarnate", to whom the witches' offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2015, Black {{expanded}} on {{her views}} in a talk to Investors In People. When outlining the common causes of sickness absence, she said: [...] "Very often what the GP will write on a medical certificate...isn't really the truth. When I did the independent review on sickness absence for the government, I talked {{to lots of}} people who were collecting their sicknotes and what they said is: 'I hate my line manager. I'm never going back to that job'. But no GP I've ever known writes anything other than a 'medical' diagnosis; the closest they get is 'stress' or 'anxiety' - often not the truth at all". At the same time <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> sharp distinction between what she called [...] "real" [...] illnesses such as [...] "cancer", [...] "diabetes" [...] and [...] "endogenous depression", and other phenomena such as [...] "stress, anxiety, and mild depression", which she claimed were characterised by [...] "little or no objective disease or impairment" [...] and were [...] "not serious illnesses". They were, she said, usually just a normal human response to something like an unhealthy workplace or a poor line manager and should be handled accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|Hadid studied {{mathematics}} at the American University of Beirut before moving, in 1972, to London {{to study}} at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi. [...] Her former professor, Koolhaas, described her at graduation as [...] "a planet in her own orbit." [...] Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught. ‘We called her {{the inventor of the}} 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees. She had spectacular vision. All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces." [...] He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases. [...] "The way <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling. She couldn’t care about tiny details. Her mind was on the broader pictures—when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later. She was right.’ Her fourth-year student project was a painting of a hotel {{in the form of a}} bridge, inspired by the works of the Russian suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich.|$|E

2500|$|On December 15, 2016, Hillary Clinton gave a {{gratitude}} {{speech to}} her campaign donors {{in which she}} reflected on Putin's motivations for the covert operation. She partially attributed her loss in the 2016 election to Russian meddling organized by Putin. Clinton said Putin had a personal grudge against her, and linked his feelings to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election, adding that he felt she was responsible for fomenting the 2011–13 Russian protests. <b>She</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> specific connection from her 2011 assertions as U.S. Secretary of State that Putin rigged the elections that year, to his actions in the 2016 U.S. elections. During the third debate, Clinton stated that Putin favored Trump, [...] "because he'd rather have a puppet {{as president of the}} United States". Clinton said that by personally attacking her through meddling in the election, Putin additionally took a strike at the American democratic system. She said the cyber attacks were a larger issue than the effect on her own candidacy and called them an attempt to attack the national security of the United States. Clinton noted she was unsuccessful in sufficiently publicizing to the media the cyber attacks against her campaign {{in the months leading up}} to the election. She voiced her support for a proposal put forth by U.S. Senators from both parties, to set up an investigative panel to look into the matter akin to the 9/11 Commission.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but {{trying to get me to}} kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E
