40|$|Abstract. Real-time {{statistics}} on smart meter consumption data must preserve consumer privacy and tolerate smart meter failures. Existing protocols for this private distributed aggregation model suffer from various drawbacks that disqualify them for application in the <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>grid.</b> Either {{they are not}} fault-tolerant or if they are, then they require bidirectional communication or their accuracy decreases with {{an increasing number of}} failures. In this paper, we provide a protocol that fixes these problems and furthermore, supports a wider range of exchangeable statistical functions and requires no group key management. A key-managing authority ensures the secure evaluation of authorized functions on fresh data items using logical time and a custom zero-knowledge proof providing differential privacy for an unbounded number of statistics calculations.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{strategy}} framework for coordinating decentralized autonomous agents is presented and applied within a <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>grid.</b> The framework brings together {{the concept of}} policy-based computing and market-based coordination. In this context, agents {{can be seen as}} self-interested entities that are governed by their local policies. Efficient coordination between these self-interested agents is realized through a market mechanism that incentivizes the agents to reveal their policies to the market. By knowing the agent’s policies, an efficient solution for the overall system can be determined. Leveraging a declarative, policy-based approach facilities the specification of highly customizable strategies that can be easily adapted to various resources and markets. As an example for a realworld application, the framework is used for efficient balancing of decentralized energy supply (e. g. photovoltaic, wind power, CHP) and demand (e. g. households, businesses) in a power grid. ...|$|E

This is caused by the expected societal benefits of exchanging more information between parties connected on the energy grid: more efficiency though balancing of supply and demand, which in turn makes energy less scarce and avoids unnecessary ‘heat pollution’. However, the sharing of information could introduce imbalances in ‘societal’ power between governments, companies and consumers.

On the other hand, high-speed, reliable and scalable data communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of WAMS. Universal mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), the 3 G standard for mobile communication networks, was developed to provide high speed data transmission with reliable service performance for mobile users. Therefore, UMTS is considered a promising solution for providing a communication infrastructure for WAMS. 3 G based EWAMS (Egyptian wide area Monitoring System) is designed and implemented in Egypt through deployment a number of frequency disturbance recorders (FDRs) devices on a live 220 kV/ 500 kV Egyptian grid in cooperation with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). The developed EWAMS can gather information from 11 FDRs devices which are geographically dispersed throughout the boundary of the Egyptian power grid and to a remote data management center located at Helwan University. The communication performance for the developed EWAMS in terms of communication time delay, throughput, and percentage of wasted bandwidth are studied in this paper.

40|$|Large scale, distributed, digital environments offer vast potential. Within these environments, {{software}} {{systems will}} provide unprecedented support for daily life. Offering access to {{vast amounts of}} knowledge and resources, these systems will enable wider participation of society, at large. An example is the <b>Smart</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Grid</b> that increases sustainability and decreases reliance on fossil fuels. Such systems require technology {{that is capable of}} negotiating Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and providers. Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is one such technology that offers a straightforward analog for complex systems of autonomous parties. MAS is based on the notion of autonomous agents that represent human actors (i. e. owners) and are capable of negotiating SLAs and coordinating processes with other agents. They know their owner’s preferences and needs. They are capable of negotiating price, Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics and penalties. They also monitor provisioning of services to detect and penalize service violations. This dissertation presents a MAS framework for automated negotiation and monitoring of SLAs in open environments. In this context, an open environment is a large-scale, distributed environment that is also dynamic and untrusted. This framework enables secure discovery, negotiation and access to distributed resources. Through a process of exchanging messages (e. g. offers, counter-offers), agents together search for a mutually acceptable agreement (e. g. service, price, quality). A negotiation protocol defines the negotiation objects (i. e. offers), language and rules governing interaction. This dissertation presents the WS-Agreement Negotiation protocol with extensions for open environments. This protocol is experimentally validated in the AgentScape middleware. Open environments also present challenges regarding security, trust and privacy. No single authority has complete control over an open environment and no single authority governs the actions of all participants (i. e. agents). Therefore, additional mechanisms are required to ensure security, privacy and promote trust between participants. Automated monitoring mechanisms using a Trusted Third Party (TTP) address issues of security and thus support negotiation in open environments. This dissertation presents a self-adaptive monitoring approach that (1) offers monitoring assurance that agreements are honored, (2) builds a secure audit log of agreement compliance, (3) performs measurements while safeguarding privacy of (sensitive) data, (4) dynamically reacts to changes in risk and (5) enables trust-building between consumers and providers. This monitoring approach is experimentally validated in the AgentScape middleware. Automation of complex tasks, such as negotiation, can increase efficiency. To illustrate these benefits, the framework is applied to two complex systems, including the <b>Smart</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Grid.</b> In this case, the looming complexity crisis of intermittent generation, real-time pricing and consumer demand shifting requires immediate attention. This domain presents not only technical (e. g. smart-meters) but also social challenges (e. g. user acceptance). The MAS automation framework presented in this dissertation addresses technical challenges by reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. Automation even enables higher utilization of green resources and reduction of waste (e. g. produced, but unconsumed energy). Transparent, trusted monitoring mechanisms address social challenges by ensuring privacy of (sensitive) data and encouraging user acceptance.

40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>grid</b> is an {{emerging}} area for new applications of machine learning in a non-stationary environment. Such a non-stationary environment emerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to external disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution networks {{lie at the}} edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external disruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn non-stationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects. First, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of failure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geo-location based multivariate non-stationary GI(t) /G(t) /Infinity queues. Third, the non-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network is exact on failures and recoveries. The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where aggregated data is used for inferring failure and recovery processes at one of the impacted areas. Model parameters are learned using real data. Two findings emerge as results of learning: (a) Failure rates behave similarly at the two different provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the geographical regions. (b) Both rapid- and slow-recovery are present for Hurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional distribution network from Hurricane Sandy.

Achieving an efficient matching of energy demand and supply needs, introducing a market mechanism for the allocation and pricing of energy resources especially take the specific requirements of energy producers and consumers into account. Moreover, many other actors ought to be taken into considerations; among these for certain all world population and future generations. It seems that energy is a socio-economic topic that needs to be approached with network and complexity theories due to the number of interested parties and the numerous perspectives with which it can be viewed and analyzed.

40|$|Communication {{privacy is}} the {{property}} of a communication system that enables two or more distrusting participants to exchange information without compromising their privacy, with respect to internal and external adversaries. It encompasses aspects of anonymous communication as well as data privacy. A real-world example {{of the need for}} communication privacy is the <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>grid,</b> in which networked smart meters frequently measure energy consumption and communicate with grid operators. Privacy concerns arise from the possible inference of sensitive information from these measurements. Using smart grid communication privacy as a case study, this thesis introduces the concept of the Trustworthy Remote Entity (TRE). The TRE is an intermediary between distrusting participants that performs privacy-enhancing computations on the exchanged information. Unlike cryptographic secure multiparty computation protocols, this approach does not increase participants' computational or communication complexity. In contrast to a trusted third party, this trustworthy entity uses trusted computing and remote attestation to establish attestation-based trust relationships. As a single-function system, the TRE requires only a minimal software Trusted Computing Base, thus minimizing its attack surface and making it an ideal candidate for security audits. Two research hypotheses are investigated: firstly that the TRE can be realized and used to enhance consumers' privacy in the smart grid, and secondly that the TRE concept can be formalized and used in other application domains. This thesis confirms both hypotheses and, in doing so, presents five main contributions. Firstly, it proposes a new methodology for modelling and analysing communication privacy terms of unlinkability and undetectability, which is implemented in the CSP process algebra and used to enhance the Casper/FDR analysis tool. Secondly, it presents and analyses a new TRE-based smart grid communication architecture. Thirdly, it compares different TRE system architectures and evaluates a fully functional TRE prototype. Fourthly, it defines a new highly-scalable remote attestation protocol for establishing the TRE's trustworthiness. Finally, it formalizes the fundamental characteristics of the TRE concept and demonstrates how the TRE can be used to enhance communication privacy in location-based services and wireless network roaming. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{electricity}} {{power system}} is shifting {{from a high}} reliance on centralized large power plants towards {{a system in which}} distributed generation units, like solar panels, are penetrating into the lower parts of the power grid. As a result, the consumers are becoming active prosumers who in addition to consuming can also autonomously generate, store, import or export power. Secondly, the introduction of new electronic devices, such as: electrical vehicles and heat pumps resulting in increased energy demand. The capacity of the current energy grid is insufficient to facilitate the future needs. To solve this problem without constructing a complete new power grid the smart grid is devised. A smart grid is able to use the assets of the legacy power grid in a more efficient way; in order to facilitate the future power needs without installing a complete new grid. The “smart” in “smart grid” heavily relies on the use of telecommunication and ICT. A <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>grid</b> holds the promise of increased reliability, since there is no longer one single point of failure, increased energy sustainability, through the use of different types of environmentally friendly energy sources, and an increased efficiency, due to less loss in transporting energy over large distances. However, the smart grid, with its intermittent distributed energy sources also presents various challenges. Firstly, the traditional grid topology is designed for uni-directional top-down power flow, which {{might not be able to}} optimally include local bi-directional power exchange. Specifically, the low-voltage and the medium-voltage network segments, where most of the local power exchanges is going to take place, needs to be updated. Secondly, the intermittent production behaviour of the distributed sources as well as the autonomy of the prosumers to manage their own energy demand likely lead to different (and possibly more volatile) load profiles. Control of the resources in a smart grid is therefore important. To build and control a smart grid, a large network of smart devices must be created, these smart devices must be able to communicate with each other. Since smart grids are not commonly in use, and still much under development, acquiring data on the actual telecommunications requirements is an utopia. Nonetheless, since ICT forms a crucial element of a smart grid, the aim of this research is to estimate which parts of a smart grid would have the biggest telecommunications demands. Subsequently, based on our knowledge of the Dutch energy grid of Alliander and various simulations, we take a cautious step at guestimating the actual telecommunications need in the foreseeable future of the smart grid. We take a bottom-up approach starting at the end nodes in the low-voltage energy grid. Network Architectures and ServicesElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

The well-known PowerMatcher is a promising approach that integrates demand and supply exibility {{in the operation}} of the electricity system through dynamic pricing and a hierarchical bidding coordination scheme.

40|$|Biogas {{can be seen}} as a {{flexible}} and storable energy carrier, capable of absorbing intermittent energy production and demand. However, the sustainability and efficiency of biogas production as {{a flexible}} energy provider is not fully understood. This research will focus on simulating biogas production within decentralised energy systems. Within these system several factors need to be taken into account, including, biomass availability, energy demand, energy production from other decentralised energy sources and factors influencing the biogas production process. The main goal of this PhD. research is to design and develop a method capable of integrating biomass availability, energy demand, biogas production, in a realistic dynamic geographical model, such that conclusions can be drawn on mainly the sustainability, and additionally on the efficiency, flexibility and economy of biogas production in the near and far future (2012 to 2050), within local decentralised <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>grids.</b> Furthermore. This research can help determining the best use of biogas in the near and far future...|$|R
