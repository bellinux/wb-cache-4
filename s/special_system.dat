These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a <b>special</b> <b>system</b> using {{the water from the}} moat, but the system {{does not appear to have}} worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E
5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the <b>S.P.E.C.I.A.L.</b> <b>system</b> – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series of question, or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E

40|$|A newly {{discovered}} approach to extending General Systems Theory {{as defined by}} George Klir {{through a set of}} <b>Special</b> <b>Systems</b> is described. General Systems Theory is distinguished from the theory of Meta-systems. Then, a hinge of three <b>special</b> <b>systems</b> is identified between systems and meta-systems. These <b>special</b> <b>systems</b> are defined by algebraic analogies. Anomalous physical phenomena are specified that exemplify the structures defined by the algebraic analogies. The extraordinary efficacious properties of these <b>special</b> <b>systems</b> are explained. These include ultra-efficiency and ultra-effectiveness. These three <b>special</b> <b>systems</b> are called dissipative, autopoietic, and reflexive. They are anomalous within general systems theory and provide a bridge between the theory of systems and the theory of recursive meta-systems. This extension of Systems Theory allows us to move step by step through a series of emergent levels up to a comprehensive Meta-systems Theory. In that theory the different <b>special</b> <b>systems</b> fit together to produce the inverse of General Systems Theory which is called Emergent Meta-systems Theory. Emergent Meta-systems are composed of the meta-operations which appear at eac...|$|R

25|$|Various {{solutions}} {{were investigated}} for the realisation {{of the ban}} on passenger and freight trains operating through tunnels {{at the same time}} and a <b>special</b> <b>system</b> was conceived, which transmits permissions at the entrance gateways to tunnels, as long as certain criteria are met. For this purpose, configuration data (e.g. tunnel areas) and rules for permissible and impermissible adjustments as well as train categories, which have different characteristics (e.g. axle pattern and ETCS train category), have been developed. A corresponding system was in the final phase of development in the middle of 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, for {{the first}} time, Kecskemét took on a {{significant}} political administrative role, as it was made seat of the country's largest county, Bács-Kiskun.

The architect József Kerényi (1900–1975) adapted and renovated several historic buildings for other uses, helping keep the varied historical character of the city alive. For instance, in the early 1970s, he renovated the early eighteenth-century Franciscan monastery for use as the Zoltán Kodály Conservatory; it opened for classes in 1975.|$|E

The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured {{that at least some of}} the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number. If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist. The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984.|$|E

500|$|From the start, Uprising {{was meant}} to be {{distinct}} from the original Kid Icarus: while Kid Icarus was a platformer featuring horizontal and vertical movement from a side-scrolling perspective, Uprising shifted to being a fully 3D third-person shooter broken between airborne and ground-based segments in each chapter. Much of the game's depth and scale came from Sakurai's own game design philosophy, along with the inclusion of various weapon types that opened up different strategic options. The number of weapons available in-game was decided from an early stage, as Sakurai wanted solid goals for the development team so development would go smoothly. The original Kid Icarus was notorious for its high difficulty, but this was an aspect Sakurai wanted to tone down so that casual gamers could enjoy Uprising. For this reason, the Fiend's Cauldron was created as a user-controlled means of both setting difficulty and allowing players to challenge themselves by placing bets against their performances. The Fiend's Cauldron tied into the game's overall theme of [...] "challenge". The game's difficulty was one of the three key elements decided upon by Sakurai, alongside the music and light-hearted storyline. The addition of the AR Card game was based on Sakurai's wish to fully utilize the 3DS' planned features, and was inspired by the trophy viewing option from Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Due to the volume of cards produced, the team needed to create a <b>special</b> <b>system</b> based on a colorbit, an ID recognition code along the bottom edge of a card. After consideration, it was decided to have the [...] "Idol" [...] displays able to fight each other, with battles revolving around a stat-based rock-paper-scissors mechanic. It also provided a means for players to measure the strength of characters without directly connecting their consoles.|$|E
