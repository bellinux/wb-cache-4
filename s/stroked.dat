The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia’s second innings of 197. England made the 95 needed for victory, and the eight-wicket loss was Australia's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II, ending a streak of 25 Tests without defeat. Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in, but despite the success on the field, the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25% from the corresponding tour four years earlier, mainly due {{to the absence of}} Bradman to spark public interest.|$|E

He put on an opening stand of 79 with Sid Barnes, before adding 186 for the second wicket with Bradman. Australia declared at 8/462 before completing an innings victory. Morris and Bradman's scoring matched one another during their partnership and both were close to being the first Australian century-maker on the tour. The former was on 95 and took three runs to move to 98, before Bradman hit consecutive fours to progress from 91 to 99. The Australian captain failed to score {{for the rest of}} the over, so Morris took the strike in the next over and reached his century before Bradman followed suit. After reaching triple figures, Morris added his last 38 runs in 50 minutes.

Most <b>stroke</b> units are either acute or rehabilitation, but comprehensive (combined acute and rehabilitation) model (comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit) is less common. Aim: To examine different levels of evidence of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit compared to other organized inpatient <b>stroke</b> care and share local experience of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units. Methods: Cochrane Library and Medline (1980 to December 2010) review of English language articles comparing <b>stroke</b> units to alternative forms of <b>stroke</b> care delivery, different types of <b>stroke</b> unit models, and differences in processes of care within different <b>stroke</b> unit models. Different levels of comparative evidence of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units to other models of <b>stroke</b> units are collected. Results: There are no randomized controlled trials directly comparing comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units to other <b>stroke</b> unit models (either acute or rehabilitation). Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units are associated with reduced length of stay and greatest reduction in combined death and dependency in a meta-analysis study {{when compared to other}} <b>stroke</b> unit models. Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units also have better length of stay and functional outcome when compared to acute or rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> unit models in a cross-sectional study, and better length of stay in a ‘before-and-after’ comparative study.

As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Previous {{studies show}} better {{outcomes}} {{for patients with}} <b>stroke</b> receiving care in <b>stroke</b> units, but many different <b>stroke</b> unit criteria have been published. In this study, we explored whether <b>stroke</b> centers fulfilling standardized Brain Attack Coalition criteria produce better patient outcomes than hospitals without <b>stroke</b> centers. Methods—We did an observational register–linkage study of all patients with ischemic <b>stroke</b> treated in Finland between 1999 and 2006. After exclusion of recurrent <b>strokes</b> and nonanalyzable patients, we included 61 685 consecutive patients treated in 333 hospitals classified in national audits either as Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> Centers, Primary <b>Stroke</b> Centers, or General Hospitals according to Brain Attack Coalition criteria. Primary outcome measures were case-fatality and being in institutional care 1 year after <b>stroke.</b> Results—Care in <b>stroke</b> centers was associated with lower 1 -year case-fatality and reduced institutional care compared with General Hospitals. The number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 death or institutional care at 1 year was 29 for Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> Centers and 40 for Primary <b>Stroke</b> Centers versus General Hospitals. Patients treated in <b>stroke</b> centers had lower mortality during the entire follow-up of up to 9 years and their median survival was increased by 1 year.

Data from the Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive {{have been used}} to test hypotheses and inform trial design. We sought to expand Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive into a broader <b>stroke</b> resource with new opportunities for research and international collaboration. Methods: Using procedures initially developed for an acute <b>stroke</b> trial archive, we invited trialists to lodge data on rehabilitation, secondary prevention, intracerebral haemorrhage, imaging, and observational <b>stroke</b> studies. Results: We have extended Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive into six subsections: Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Acute (n[*]=[*] 28 [*] 190 patients’ data), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Rehab (n[*]=[*] 10 [*] 194), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-intracerebral haemorrhage (n[*]=[*] 1829), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Prevention, Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Imaging (n[*]=[*] 1300), and Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Plus (n[*]=[*] 6573). Enrollment continues, with commitments for the contribution of six further trials to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Prevention, 13 trials to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Rehab, and one registry to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Plus. Data on age, type of <b>stroke,</b> medical history, outcomes by modified Rankin scale and Barthel Index (BI), mortality, and adverse events are available for analyses. The Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive network encourages the development of young investigators and provides opportunities for international peer review and collaboration.
