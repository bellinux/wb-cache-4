50|$|Cast {{steel shot}} or <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> {{is used to}} clean and prepare the surface before coating. Shot {{blasting}} recycles the media and is environmentally friendly. This method of preparation is highly efficient on steel parts such as I-beams, angles, pipes, tubes and large fabricated pieces. Different powder coating applications can require alternative methods of preparation such as abrasive blasting prior to coating. The online consumer market typically offers media blasting services coupled with their coating services at additional costs.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to remove grease or oil contamination prior to blast cleaning. Solvent cleaning, burn-off, etc., are commonly used for this purpose. In the blast cleaning process, compressed air (90 to 110 psi/610 to 760 kPa) is used to force dan abrasive onto the surface to be cleaned. Aluminum oxide, <b>steel</b> <b>grit,</b> steel shot, garnet, coal slag, etc., are the frequently used abrasives. Another method of blast cleaning is centrifugal blast cleaning, which is especially used in cleaning the exterior of pipe. In this method, abrasive is thrown to the rotating pipe body, using a specially designed wheel, which is rotated at high speed, while the abrasive is fed from {{the centre of the}} wheel.|$|E

By using anti-slip strip the roughness of floor can be increased, the COF will be increased and the risk of slips and falls will be reduced at the same time. This study wanted to find out the effects of slip-resistance under different particle sizes of <b>steel</b> <b>grit,</b> different floor contamination conditions and different inclined angles while using the emery anti-slip strip. The results demonstrated that the particle size of <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> used on the emery anti-slip strip has significant influence on the COF. When footwear had no groove under the shoe sole or the groove had been abraded badly, the particle size had to be big enough to perform the function of the anti-slip especially under the floor contamination of glycerol and water. Therefore, the study suggested that the particle size of <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> used on the emery anti-slip strip should be larger than 500 µm to provide fine anti-slip effects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of a steel-concrete joint using an epoxy adhesive interlayer, push-out tests were carried out. The test samples consisted of two sandblasted steel plates and a self-compacting concrete sample, with the epoxy layer applied on the <b>steel</b> plates and <b>gritted</b> with granulates.

The most dangerous locations are evaluated from a generalized linear elastic fracture mechanics point of view.

40|$|Issue: Processed {{recycled}} glass {{has been sold}} as an abrasive blasting medium under several brand names {{in different parts of}} the United States. However, limited public information is available regarding the performance of finely sized crushed glass in abrasive applications because manufacturers have developed their own proprietary data. Historically, the predominant material used for abrasive blasting was silica sand, hence the common reference to “sandblasting. ” Other media include garnet, staurolite and industrial by-products such as coal slag, copper slag, nickel slag and <b>steel</b> <b>grit.</b> Even walnut shells and plastic beads have been used for abrasive blasting. Individual abrasive media performance depends on hardness, shape, size, weight, and other characteristics. Health- considerations are sometimes significant in evaluating blasting abrasives. For example, concerns about silicosis due to the presence of crystalline silica have resulted in very little silica sand now being used in abrasive blasting. Best Practice: While silica sand is a raw material used in the production of glass (see Chemical Composition of Container Glass Best Practice), the manufacturing process converts the crystalline structure to an amorphous state. Tests have shown that recycled container glass contains less than 1 % crystalline silica (see Analysis of Glass Dusts Best Practice). Lower health risk represents a potential competitive market advantage for {{recycled glass}}, which can be processed to physical characteristics simila...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} samples have been {{characterized}} by 3 D image analysis (using X-Ray microtomography). The samples consist of blends of metallic particles: steel shot abrasives (“balls”), steel fibres and angular <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> particles. The blends were systematically prepared in different proportions of the raw products. Various shape and size parameters were measured on the particles: equivalent volume diameter (dV), maximum inscribed sphere diameter (dIN), particle length (maximum Feret diameter), particle elongation (El), particle flatness (Fl) etc. The results are expressed as statistical shape and size parameters, expressed both as volume and number weighted distributions. The blends have been tested for compaction using a cylindrical container which experiences a series of 500 free falls over a height of 3 mm. The compaction dynamics was monitored using a sensor that measures {{the evolution of the}} solid volume fraction {{as a function of the}} tap number. From the obtained compaction curve, the Hausner ratio and a flowability index were extracted. The same blends have also been analysed using a rotating drum at different rotation speeds to analyze the evolution of the flowing angle. As the system is based on the analysis of a time sequence of 50 images (separated by 0. 5 sec) it is possible to measure the intermittent character of the powder flow. The resulting measure is a cohesive index of the powder. The results obtained from physical testing were systematically plotted as a function of various statistical indices of the shape and size distributions in order to reveal correlations between particle shape properties and physical behaviour. Some clear trends appeared, demonstrating the influence of particle shape on powder physical properties...|$|E
50|$|Cleaning {{operations}} using {{abrasive blasting}} can present risks for workers' health and safety, specifically in portable air blasting or blast room (booth) applications. There {{is a large}} amount of dust created through abrasive blasting from the substrate and abrasive. Although many abrasives used in blasting rooms are not hazardous in themselves, (<b>steel</b> shot and <b>grit,</b> cast iron, aluminum oxide, garnet, plastic abrasive and glass bead), other abrasives (silica sand, copper slag, nickel slag, and staurolite) have varying degrees of hazard (typically free silica or heavy metals). However, in all cases their use can present serious danger to operators, such as burns due to projections (with skin or eye lesions), falls due to walking on round shot scattered on the ground, exposure to hazardous dusts, heat exhaustion, creation of an explosive atmosphere, and exposure to excessive noise. Blasting rooms and portable blaster's equipment have been adapted to these dangers. Blasting lead-based paint can fill the air with lead particles which can be harmful to the nervous system.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of measurement of the thickness of uniform thin films on solid substrates by null ellipsometry is severely limited when the substrate is rough. It is impossible to separate these two effects experimentally with the null ellipsometer, {{and there is no}} theoretical basis or generally used model available to separate these effects. Thus, a dual rotating‐compensator Mueller matrix ellipsometer has been constructed to carry out film thickness measurements on rough substrates. Measurements were made on a set of specially prepared specimens of 8630 <b>steel,</b> roughened by <b>grit</b> blasting with aluminum oxide. Grit sizes and blasting pressures were varied to produce 11 different roughness values ranging from 0. 01 to 1. 295 μm Ra, as measured with a stylus tracer device. Upon each of the 11 roughness groups, films of magnesium fluoride were overlaid to thicknesses of 89, 180, 254, and 315 nm. One set of specimens was left uncoated. Experimental results for film thickness measurements on rough surfaces matched the ideal (for smooth surfaces) form well for roughnesses up to 0. 13 μm Ra, at most angles of incidence. For rougher specimens, significant deviations in results were observed for all but the largest angles of incidence. The nonideal data were attributed to the cross‐polarization effects of surface geometry, and apparent depolarization. The resolution of thickness measurements was 1 nm for polished specimens, and decreased continuously to 10 nm for the roughest specimens examined. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr cermet, of approximately 200 μm thick, deposited by HVOF thermal spraying. Particular emphasis {{has been paid to the}} influence of the substrate roughness prior to HVOF deposition, as a mean of improving the mechanical bonding of the coating, on the fatigue life of the coated system. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1), employing samples with different surface roughness, including as-polished, fine-grinding with abrasive paper grit 400 and coated and grit blasted with alumina particles of two different sizes (< 1 and < 3 mm, respectively) and coated. For comparative purposes, tests were also carried out on as-grit blasted specimens employing alumina particles of 3 mm in size. Fatigue tests were carried out at maximum alternating stresses in the range of 358 – 588 MPa, depending on the condition of the material, in order that the number of cycles to fracture varied in the range of 105 to 106. Selected samples tested at different applied stresses were analyzed after fracture by SEM techniques, which allowed the determination of the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the presence of the cermet coating gives rise to a delay in the initiation of fatigue cracks at deep notches and alumina particles embedded at the <b>steel</b> substrate after <b>grit</b> blasting, leading to an insignificant fatigue strength debit of the coated specimens, in comparison with the as-polished ones. Fine-grinding, on the other hand, impairs the mechanical bonding of the coating, giving rise to its delamination from the substrate at elevated maximum alternating stresses...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy or vinyl ester resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or <b>steel),</b> <b>grit</b> application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Steel-concrete joints {{are often}} {{provided}} with welded shear studs. However, stress concentrations are induced {{in the structure}} due to the welding. Moreover, a reduction in toughness and ductility of the steel and a decreased fatigue endurance of the construction is observed. In this paper the shear bond strength between steel and ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) without mechanical shear connectors is evaluated through push-out tests. The test samples consist of two sandblasted steel plates with a thickness of 10 mm and a concrete core. The connection between steel and concrete is obtained by a 2 -component epoxy resin. Test samples with a smooth adhesive layer are compared with those with an epoxy layer, which is applied with a toothed paddle and/or gritted with small aggregates. In this research, specimens prepared with river gravel, crushed stone, and <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> are compared and also two different epoxy resins are used. During the tests, the ultimate shear force is recorded {{as well as the}} slip between steel and concrete. All test specimens exhibited a concrete-adhesive or concrete failure. Furthermore, test results show that the use of a more fluid epoxy resin improves the anchorage of the gritted aggregates in the adhesive layer, resulting in higher shear bond stresses. No significant difference is found between specimens, gritted with river gravel or crushed stone. Applying the adhesive layer with the toothed paddle in horizontal direction slightly improves the bond behaviour. Finally, the experimental results of the test members with a smooth epoxy layer without gritted aggregates, provide test data for a fracture mechanics approach, which uses a 2 D numerical model of the test specimen, composed of steel, epoxy resin, and concrete...|$|E
40|$|Heavyweight {{concretes}} are {{an attractive}} alternative when heavyweight elements need to fill reduced spaces, because they present high densities {{and are able}} to take different forms according to the container where they are casted. The intended application for the heavyweight concrete referred to in this work is a power converter, which is a floating system that generates power through the waves of the sea. The design of this converter considers the use of elements of high mass at both ends of a metallic oval structure. Therefore, a heavyweight concrete with density of 4, 000 and 4, 500 kg/m 3 was developed. For heavyweight concrete production with densities as high as the ones needed, it is necessary to use artificial aggregates of <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> or corundum. Natural heavyweight aggregates such as hematite, magnetite or barite allow achieving maximum densities around 3, 800 kg/m 3, being unsuitable for the required application. For this reason, grit coarse aggregate 6 - 8 mm was used and a portion of the sand was replaced by a corundum fine aggregate 0. 5 - 1. 5 mm, being these materials out of the standard applications. In addition to the density requirements, consistency of the fresh concrete is also important as the use of heavyweight aggregates, whose density differs from the density of the mortar or paste, may lead to segregation of the mix. Due to the particularities of the concrete, the mix-design process was oriented to the specific application and quantitative and qualitative requirements were evaluated such as concepts related to the availability of the component materials, accessibility to the production area and casting. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present the considerations made during the mix-design process as well as the characterization of the heavyweight concretes produced, which showed results in agreement with the pre-established requirements.

40|$|NUKEM Technologies was {{contracted}} to supply a dry, automated drum belt (tumbling) Abrasive Blasting Unit (ABU) to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Ispra, Italy. The ABU {{was installed in}} the centralised radioactive waste management area of the JRC-Ispra site in Italy. The unit is to be employed for the decontamination to clearance levels of slightly contaminated metal components and, where practical, concrete or heavy concrete (density ~ 3200 kg/m³) blocks arising from the dismantling of nuclear facilities. The presentation {{is based on the}} successful construction and installation of the ABU at the JRC Ispra site. Among the several possibilities of adapting conventional abrasive units to nuclear applications, an automatic tumbling machine was preferred, due to the larger output and (mainly) for the ease of operation, with minimum direct handling of contaminated material by operators, thus satisfying the ALARA principle. Consideration was also given to Belgoprocess' successful experience with a predecessor, similar unit. After adequate size reduction batches of up to about 800 kg of material to be decontaminated are automatically introduced into the blasting chamber. Pieces between 100 mm and 800 mm long, between 100 mm and 500 mm wide and between 5 mm and 300 mm high can be effectively treated in the unit, the maximum weight of a single piece being limited to 100 kg. Pipes less than 300 mm long and with an internal diameter larger than 40 mm and other components with hard-to-reach surfaces may be included. The content of the chamber is tumbled by two bladed drums, while sharp <b>steel</b> <b>grit</b> is sprayed onto the contaminated components, thus removing the surface layer including any contamination. From experience, 30 minutes of treatment is sufficient to remove contamination to levels below expected clearance levels for most materials. The decontaminated components are removed from the blasting chamber automatically and collected in skips. Dust and grit are led to a series of separators; the grit gets recycled to the blasting chamber, cleaned off contaminants such as paint are fed to collection bins, and the dust is bagged into waste drums. Airflow through the whole system cleans the decontaminated components, transports the dust to the collecting area, and acts as a dynamic barrier to limit risks of contamination of the surrounding areas. Prior to release back into the room, the air is filtered in a series of automatically cleaned filters, followed by HEPA filters. The whole facility is operated in an automatic mode: the operators are only required to place drums or pallets of contaminated material onto the feeder, and remove skips of decontaminated material and drums of secondary waste such as dust. The presentation will describe the system and potential applications in the nuclear industry in detail. JRC. C. 1 -Nuclear Decommissionin...|$|E
