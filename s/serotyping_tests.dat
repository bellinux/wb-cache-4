40|$|Listeria spp. {{isolated}} from different food products and collected from 12 Brazilian states {{were sent to}} the Laboratory of Bacterial Zoonoses (Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Brazil) for identification. The aims of this study were to characterize these isolates, from 1990 to 2012, by using biochemical, morphological, and <b>serotyping</b> <b>tests,</b> and to analyze the distribution of L. monocytogenes serotypes on different food products and geographical locations. Serotyping was performed using polyclonal somatic and flagellar antisera. Of 5953 isolates, 5770 were identified as Listeria spp., from which 3429 (59. 4 %) were L. innocua, 2248 (38. 9 %) were L. monocytogenes, and 93 (1. 6 %) were other Listeria spp. L. innocua was predominantly {{isolated from}} 1990 to 2000, while L. monocytogenes was from 2001 to 2012. Regarding the serotype distribution in the foods, serotypes 1 / 2 a and 4 b were most common in processed meat and ready-to-eat products, respectively; serotypes 1 / 2 a, 1 / 2 b, and 4 b were the most common in nonprocessed meat. The results above confirm the presence of the main serotypes of L. monocytogenes {{in different parts of the}} food chain from three regions of the country and emphasize the importance of improving the control measures, as tolerance zero policy and microbiological surveillance in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 / non-O 139 serogroups {{have been}} {{reported}} to cause sporadic diarrhoea in humans. Cholera toxins have been mostly implicated for hypersecretion of ions and water into the small intestine. Though most of the V. cholerae non-O 1 / non-O 139 strains lack these cholera toxins, several other innate virulence factors contribute towards their pathogenicity. The environmental isolates may thus act as reservoirs for potential spreading of these virulence genes in the natural environment which may cause the emergence of epidemic-causing organisms. The environmental isolates of vibrios were obtained from water samples, zooplanktons and phytoplanktons, from a village pond in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. They were confirmed as Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 / non-O 139 using standard biochemical and <b>serotyping</b> <b>tests.</b> PCR experiments revealed that the isolates lacked ctxA, ctxB, tcpA, zot and ace genes whereas other pathogenicity genes like toxR, rtxC, hlyA, hapA and prtV were detected in these isolates. Compared with epidemic strain V. cholerae O 1 El Tor N 16961, culture supernatants from most of these isolates caused higher cytotoxicity to HT 29 cells and higher hemolytic, hemagglutinin and protease activities. In rabbit ileal loop assays, the environmental isolates showed only 2 - 4 folds lesser fluid accumulation in comparison to N 16961 and a V. cholerae clinical isolate IDH 02365 of 2009. Pulsed Field Gel electrophoresis and Random amplification of Polymorphic DNA indicated that these isolates showed considerable diversity and did not share the same clonal lineage even though they were derived from the same water source. All the isolates showed resistance to one or more antibiotics. Though these environmental isolates lacked the cholera toxins, they seem to have adopted other survival strategies by optimally utilising a diverse array of several other toxins. The current findings indicate the possibility that these isolates could cause some gastroenteric inflammation when ingested and may serve as progenitors for overt disease-causing organisms...|$|E

This study reports the FMD serological profile extracted from samples (n[*]=[*] 696) collected from wildlife of West and Central Africa between 1999 and 2003. An overall prevalence of FMDV NSP reactive sera of 31. 0 % (216 / 696) was estimated, where a significant difference in seropositivity (p[*]=[*] 0. 000) was reported for buffalo (64. 8 %) as opposed to other wild animal species tested (17. 8 %). Different levels of exposure to the FMDV resulted for each of the buffalo subspecies sampled (p = 0. 031) : 68. 4 %, 50. 0 % and 0 % for Nile Buffalo, West African Buffalo and African Forest Buffalo, respectively. The characterisation of the FMDV <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested</b> for buffalo found presence of antibodies against all the six FMDV <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested,</b> although high estimates for type O and SAT 3 were reported for Central Africa. Different patterns of reaction to the six FMDV <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested</b> were recorded, from sera only positive for a single serotype to multiple reactivities. The results confirmed that FMDV circulates in wild ruminants populating both West and Central Africa rangelands and in particular in buffalo, also suggesting that multiple FMDV serotypes might be involved with type O, SAT 2 and SAT 1 being dominant. Differences in serotype and spill-over risk between wildlife and livestock likely reflect regional geography, historical circulation and differing trade and livestock systems. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the capsular {{polysaccharide}} synthesis (cps) locus of the type 19 F Streptococcus pneumoniae strain SSZ was closely linked to a copy of the insertion sequence IS 1202 (J. K. Morona, A. Guidolin, R. Morona, D. Hansman, and J. C. Paton, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 4437 - 4443, 1994). In the present study, we used plasmid insertion and rescue and inverse PCR to clone 6, 322 bp of flanking DNA upstream of IS 1202. Sequence analysis indicated that this region contains six complete open reading frames (ORFs) and one partial ORF that are arranged as a single transcriptional unit. Chromosomal disruption of any of these ORFs in a smooth-type 19 F strain leads to a rough (unencapsulated) phenotype, indicating that this operon is essential for capsule production. The ORFs have therefore been designated cps 19 fA to cps 19 fG, where cps 19 fA is the first gene of the type 19 F cps locus. Furthermore, many of the gene products from this incomplete operon exhibit strong similarities to proteins known to be involved in the production of capsular polysaccharide, exopolysaccharide, teichoic acid, enterobacterial common antigen, and lipopolysaccharide from numerous other bacterial species. This has allowed us to propose functions for many of the type 19 F cps gene products. Southern hybridization studies reveal that cps 19 fA and cps 19 fB are conserved among all 12 pneumococcal <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested,</b> whereas genes downstream of cps 19 fB are conserved among some, but not all, of the <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{sequence}} of two enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O 157 :H 7 strains reveals {{the possession of}} at least 16 fimbrial gene clusters, many of the chaperone/usher class. The {{first part of this}} study examined the distribution of these clusters in a selection of EHEC/EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli) serotypes to determine if any were likely to be unique to E. coli O 157 :H 7. Six of the clusters, as determined by the presence of amplified main subunit or usher gene sequences, were detected only in the E. coli O 157 and O 145 <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested.</b> With the exception of one serotype O 103 strain that contained an lpf 2 cluster, lpf sequences were only detected in E. coli O 157 of the <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested.</b> Expression from each cluster was measured by the construction of chromosomally integrated lacZ promoter fusions and plasmid-based eGFP fusions in E. coli O 157 :H 7. This analysis demonstrated that the majority (11 / 15) of main fimbrial subunit genes were not expressed under the majority of conditions tested in vitro. One of the clusters showing promoter activity, loc 8, has a temperature expression optimum indicating a possible role outside the host. From the presence of pseudogenes in three of the clusters, the lack of FimH-like minor adhesins in the clusters and their limited expression in vitro, it would appear that E. coli O 157 :H 7 has a limited repertoire of expressed functional fimbriae. This restricted selection of fimbriae may be important in bringing about the tropism E. coli O 157 :H 7 demonstrates for the terminal rectum of cattle...|$|R

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{bacterial}} pathogen that is typically transmitted to humans through consumption of contaminated foods. Infection with this organism {{can lead to}} a severe and life-threatening illness referred to as listeriosis. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with high specificity and affinity to proteins found on the surface of all strains of L. monocytogenes while not cross-reacting with non-pathogenic Listeria spp. or other major bacterial pathogens commonly found in foods. A literature search was conducted to identify ten candidate surface proteins involved or putatively involved in the virulence of L. monocytogenes. Bioinformatics analyses using BLAST on the NCBI website showed that five of the ten candidate proteins were potentially present in L. monocytogenes strains but absent from strains of other Listeria spp. Genes encoding for these five proteins, ActA, InlA, InlC 2, InlJ and LapB, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. MAbs were raised against recombinant LapB, InlJ and InlC 2 proteins using hybridoma technology. A total of 48 anti-LapB, 33 anti-InlJ and 37 anti-InlC 2 MAbs were developed. Based on the comparison of IFM signal of each MAb against L. monocytogenes cells, seven anti-LapB MAbs and six anti-InlC 2 MAbs were selected for further characterization. All of the anti-InlJ MAbs showed weak IFM signals and negative reactivity in ELISA against L. monocytogenes cells. The selected anti-LapB and anti-InlC 2 MAbs were further characterized by assessing their ability to bind to cells of 51 strains representing 11 L. monocytogenes serotypes using ELISA. Six anti-LapB MAbs (M 3484, M 3495, M 3500, M 3509, M 3517, M 3519) reacted strongly with 44 of 51 strains representing 9 of the 11 L. monocytogenes <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested.</b> Five anti-InlC 2 MAbs (M 3607, M 3618, M 3630, M 3633, M 3636) reacted strongly with 47 strains representing 10 of the 11 L. monocytogenes <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested.</b> These results indicate that anti-LapB and anti-InlC 2 MAbs could potentially be used as diagnostic reagents for isolation and detection of almost all L. monocytogenes strains in contaminated foods...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the association between the concentration of anti-polysaccharide pneumococcal capsule-specific (anti-PS) immunoglobulin G and the killing activity, in serum, in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) events and response to 23 -valent polysaccharide vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected Ugandans. Case patients with IPD had lower concentrations of anti-PS IgG before and after vaccination and before the IPD event (P <. 01 for 5 [i. e., 4, 9 V, 14, 18 C, and 19 F] of 6 serotypes assessed). After vaccination, case patients were less likely than were control subjects to develop detectable serum killing activity against the 2 <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested</b> - for 19 F, this activity was detected in 16 % of case patients versus 37 % of control subjects (P =. 08); for 23 F, it was detected in 11 % of case patients versus 40 % of control subjects (P =. 02). Thus, absolute concentration of anti-PS IgG and an attenuated response to polysaccharide are associated with risk of IPD in HIV-infected adults...|$|R
40|$|Two systems, {{inoculation}} of bovine endothelial {{cells and}} of embryonated chicken eggs, were compared for detection of bluetongue virus (BTV) in blood specimens from experimentally inoculated sheep. For all BTV <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested,</b> embryonated chicken eggs detected {{longer periods of}} viremia than did bovine endothelial cells, primarily by detecting BTV in samples containing lower virus concentrations. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an orbivirus that causes eco-nomic losses to domestic livestock producers (14). BTV {{can be difficult to}} isolate from animal specimens; intravascular inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) is the rec-ommended procedure (5, 9). ECE inoculation is labor inten-sive for trained personnel, requires large numbers of chicken embryos that can be difficult to obtain, and utilizes equip-ment not used in cell culture. Since cell culture assays are used routinely in diagnostic laboratories, different cell lines have been tested for the ability to detect BTV (2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15). Recently, a cattle pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{and functional}} characteristics of natural antibody from the preimmune repertoire {{have not been}} explored in detail in man. We describe seven human IgM monoclonal antibodies {{selected on the basis}} of pneumococcal polysaccharide binding that share both molecular and functional characteristics with natural antibody, suggesting a common B cell lineage origin. Unlike class-switched antibodies, which are serotype-specific, the antibodies were polyreactive and bound all pneumococcal polysaccharide capsular <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested.</b> Some bound endogenous antigens, including blood group antigens and intermediate filament proteins. All the antibodies used unmutated heavy chain V (IGHV) that are expressed at an increased frequency in the elderly and in the preimmune repertoire. The CDR 3 was characterized by long length (mean aa 18 · 4 (± 4 · 2) and selective use of IGHD 6 (P < 0 · 001) and IGHJ 6 (P < 0 · 01) family genes. The clones expressing IGHV 1 - 69 and IGHV 3 - 21 provided significant passive protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of a monoclonal antibody (1 G 9 /C 9) with specificity for the {{epizootic haemorrhagic disease}} (EHD) serogroup has enabled {{the development of a}} highly sensitive and specific blocking ELISA (B-ELISA) for the detection of serum antibodies to EHD viruses. The assay was sensitive to blocking antibodies present in hyperimmune reference antisera to all six EHD <b>serotypes</b> <b>tested</b> but was unaffected by reference antisera to 19 South African and eight Australian serotypes of the related orbivirus bluetongue virus (BTV). The sensitivity of the EHD B-ELISA exceeded that of an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for EHD-specific antibody detection. Serum antibody titres to BTV and EHD in experimental and field sera, including a sentinel herd from which virus isolations were made, were examined in both the BTV and EHD B-ELISA tests. These results showed the B-ELISA was only sensitive to antibodies specific for the homologous serogroup in each case, even where sequential and mixed infections with each virus type occurred...|$|R
