5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and <b>streptavidin</b> proteins.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the strongest}} non-covalent interactions, the binding of biotin to <b>streptavidin</b> is {{commonly}} used as the target molecular interaction in the research of biosensors and cell sorting.|$|E
25|$|ELISAs {{often make}} use of {{biotinylated}} detection antibodies against the antigen of interest, followed by a detection step using <b>streptavidin</b> conjugated to a reporter molecule, such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase.|$|E
25|$|Biotin binds {{tightly to}} the tetrameric protein avidin (also <b>streptavidin</b> and neutravidin), with a {{dissociation}} constant Kd {{on the order}} of 10−15 M, {{which is one of the}} strongest known protein-ligand interactions. This is often used in different biotechnological applications. Until 2005, very harsh conditions were thought to be required to break the biotin-streptavidin bond.|$|E
25|$|A third {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or <b>Streptavidin</b> with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|E
25|$|Proteins with {{different}} numbers of polyhistidine tags elute differently from nickel-affinity resin. For proteins {{with a single}} hexahistidine tag, 75 mM imidazole enables elution from Ni-NTA, whereas for proteins with two hexahistidine tags, 100 mM imidazole is required for elution. This step-wise elution {{may be used to}} isolate specific protein assemblies from a mixture, such as defined heteromultimers (e.g. an AB heterodimer from a mixture including AA and BB homodimers, if only subunit B has a polyhistidine tag). Such an approach was used in isolation of monovalent <b>streptavidin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled <b>streptavidin.</b> The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E

500|$|A non-covalent {{hosting scheme}} using Dervan {{polyamides}} on a DX array {{was used to}} arrange <b>streptavidin</b> proteins in a specific pattern on a DX array. Carbon nanotubes have been hosted on DNA arrays in a pattern allowing the assembly {{to act as a}} molecular electronic device, a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor. [...] In addition, there are nucleic acid metallization methods, in which the nucleic acid is replaced by a metal which assumes the general shape of the original nucleic acid structure, and schemes for using nucleic acid nanostructures as lithography masks, transferring their pattern into a solid surface.|$|E
2500|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of protein expression in Dictyostelium has been hampered by large {{shifts in the}} protein expression profile between different developmental stages and {{a general lack of}} commercially available antibodies for Dictyostelium antigens. [...] In 2013, a group at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre reported an antibody-free protein visualization standard for immunoblotting based on detection of MCCC1 using <b>streptavidin</b> conjugates.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein {{will most likely be}} unaffected. This process is called biotinylation. Because both <b>streptavidin</b> and avidin bind biotin with high affinity (Kd of [...] 10−14mol/l to 10−15mol/l) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. [...] The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest. [...] Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away. [...] However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6M guanidine HCl at pH1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest. [...] To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10−8mol/l, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.|$|E
2500|$|The pool {{is first}} {{subjected}} to a selection step, during which the catalytic strands are separated from the non-catalytic strands. The exact separation method {{will depend on the}} reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes affinity chromatography, in which a biological tag attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a biotin tag with a <b>streptavidin</b> affinity column. Gel electrophoresis based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel. After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4–10 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity, though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions. After a sufficient number of rounds, the final pool is sequenced and the individual strands are tested for their catalytic activity. The dynamics of the pool can be described through mathematical modeling ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Streptavidin</b> is a tetramer {{and each}} subunit binds biotin with equal affinity. Multivalency is an {{advantage}} in some applications, for example where avidity effects improve the ability of molecules attached to <b>streptavidin</b> to detect specific T cells. In other cases, {{such as the use}} of <b>streptavidin</b> for imaging specific proteins on cells, multivalency can perturb the function of the protein of interest. Monovalent <b>streptavidin</b> is an engineered recombinant form of <b>streptavidin</b> which is a tetramer but only one of the four binding sites is functional. This single binding site has 10−14 mol/L affinity and cannot cause cross-linking. Applications of monovalent <b>streptavidin</b> have included fluorescent tracking of cell surface receptors, decorating DNA origami, and acting as a pointer to identify specific regions for cryo-electron microscopy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Streptavidin</b> is not {{the only}} protein capable of binding to biotin with high affinity. Avidin is the other most notable biotin-binding protein. Originally {{isolated}} from egg yolk, avidin only has 30% sequence identity to <b>streptavidin,</b> but almost identical secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. It has a higher affinity for biotin (Kd ~ 10−15M) but in contrast to <b>streptavidin,</b> it is glycosylated, positively charged, has pseudo-catalytic activity (it can enhance the alkaline hydrolysis of an ester linkage between biotin and a nitrophenyl group) and has a higher tendency for aggregation. Also, <b>streptavidin</b> is the better biotin-conjugate binder; avidin has a lower binding affinity than <b>streptavidin</b> when biotin is conjugated to another molecule, despite avidin having the higher affinity for free, unconjugated biotin. Because <b>streptavidin</b> lacks any carbohydrate modification and has a near-neutral pI, it has the advantage of much lower nonspecific binding than avidin. Deglycosylated avidin (NeutrAvidin) is more comparable to the size, pI, and nonspecific binding of <b>streptavidin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Monomeric <b>streptavidin</b> is a {{recombinant}} form of <b>streptavidin</b> with mutations {{to break}} the tetramer into a monomer and to enhance the solubility of the resultant isolated subunit. Monomeric <b>streptavidin</b> versions have an affinity for biotin of 10−7mol/L 10−8mol/L and so are not ideal for labeling applications but are useful for purification, where reversibility is desirable.|$|E
50|$|Extent of {{biotinylation}} {{can also}} be measured by <b>streptavidin</b> gel-shift, since <b>streptavidin</b> remains bound to biotin during agarose gel electrophoresis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proportion of target biotinylated can be measured via the change in band intensity of the target with or without excess <b>streptavidin,</b> seen quickly and quantitatively for biotinylated proteins by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Streptavidin</b> [...] is a 52.8 kDa protein {{purified}} {{from the}} bacterium Streptomyces avidinii. <b>Streptavidin</b> homo-tetramers have an extraordinarily high affinity for biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H). With a dissociation constant (Kd) {{on the order}} of ≈10−14 mol/L, the binding of biotin to <b>streptavidin</b> is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known in nature. <b>Streptavidin</b> is used extensively in molecular biology and bionanotechnology due to the streptavidin-biotin complex's resistance to organic solvents, denaturants (e.g. guanidinium chloride), detergents (e.g. SDS, Triton), proteolytic enzymes, and extremes of temperature and pH.|$|E
50|$|A <b>streptavidin</b> with {{exactly two}} biotin binding sites per tetramer can be {{produced}} by mixing subunits with and without a functional biotin binding site and purification by ion-exchange chromatography. The functional binding sites here have the same biotin binding stability as wild-type <b>streptavidin.</b> Divalent <b>streptavidin</b> with the two biotin binding sites together (cis-divalent) or apart (trans-divalent) can be separately purified.|$|E
50|$|The SBP-Tag {{will also}} bind to <b>streptavidin</b> or <b>streptavidin</b> {{reagents}} in solution. Applications of these engineered associations include the visualization of specific proteins within living cells, {{monitoring of the}} kinetics of the translation of individual proteins in an in vitro translation system, control of the integration of a multi-spanning membrane protein into the endoplasmic reticulum by fusing the SBP-Tag to the N-terminal translocation sequence and then halting integration with <b>streptavidin</b> and restarting integration with biotin. Fluorescent <b>streptavidin</b> reagents (e.g. streptavidin-HRP) {{can be used to}} visualize the SBP-tag by immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE. Additionally, antibodies to the SBP-tag are available commercially.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Streptavidin</b> is a tetrameric protein {{expressed}} in Streptomyces avidinii. Because {{of its high}} affinity for the vitamin h-biotin, <b>Streptavidin</b> is commonly used {{in the fields of}} molecular biology and biotechnology. The Strep-tag was originally selected from a genetic library to specifically bind to a proteolytically truncated [...] "core" [...] version of <b>streptavidin.</b> Over the years, the Strep-tag was systemically optimized, to permit a greater flexibility in the choice of attachment site. Further, its interaction partner, <b>Streptavidin</b> was also optimized to increase peptide-binding capacity, which resulted in the development of Strep-Tactin. The binding affinity of Strep-tag to Strep-Tactin is nearly 100 times higher than to <b>Streptavidin.</b> The so called Strep-tag system, consisting of Strep-tag and Strep-Tactin, has proven particularly useful for the functional isolation and analysis of protein complexes in proteome research.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the most}} common uses are the {{purification}} or detection of various biomolecules. The strong streptavidin-biotin bond {{can be used to}} attach various biomolecules to one another or onto a solid support. Harsh conditions are needed to break the streptavidin-biotin interaction, which often denatures the protein of interest being purified. However, {{it has been shown that}} a short incubation in water above 70 °C will reversibly break the interaction (at least for biotinylated DNA) without denaturing <b>streptavidin,</b> allowing re-use of the <b>streptavidin</b> solid support. [...] A further application of <b>streptavidin</b> is for purification and detection of proteins genetically modified with the Strep-tag peptide. <b>Streptavidin</b> is widely used in Western blotting and immunoassays conjugated to some reporter molecule, such as horseradish peroxidase.Streptavidin has also been used in the developing field of Nanobiotechnology, the use of biological molecules such as proteins or lipids to create nanoscale devices/structures. In this context <b>streptavidin</b> can be used as a building block to link biotinylated DNA molecules to create single walled carbon nanotube scaffolds or even complex DNA polyhedra.The tetrameric <b>streptavidin</b> has also been used as a hub around which other proteins may be arranged, either by an affinity tag such as Strep-tag or Avitag or by genetic fusion to SpyTag. Fusion to SpyTag allowed generation of assemblies with 8 or 20 <b>streptavidin</b> subunits. As well as a molecular force probe for atomic force microscopy studies, novel materials such as 3D crystalline lattices have also been created. <b>Streptavidin</b> has a mildly acidic isoelectric point (pI) of ~5, but a recombinant form of <b>streptavidin</b> with a near-neutral pI is also commercially available.|$|E
