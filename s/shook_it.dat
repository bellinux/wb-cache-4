2500|$|During his National Service, he was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Horse Guards {{and served in}} Cyprus, where he was almost killed in a machine gun accident. Annoyed by a fault in the machine gun on his armoured car which he drove frequently, he seized {{the end of the}} barrel and <b>shook</b> <b>it,</b> accidentally triggering the mechanism so that the gun fired several bullets through his chest. As a result of his injuries, he lost his spleen, one lung, several ribs, and a finger, and suffered from pain and recurring infections {{for the rest of his}} life. While lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance he said to his platoon sergeant: [...] "Kiss me, Chudleigh." [...] He later recalled that [...] "Chudleigh did not recognise the allusion and from then on treated me with extreme caution." [...] He was first treated for his injuries at Nicosia General Hospital. While recuperating from the accident in Italy, he began his first novel, The Foxglove Saga.|$|E

The king's friends seeing this, {{forced him to}} mount his horse and take to flight; but Henry, his valiant son, not heeding what he saw being done by his men, but solely intent on glory and valour, while the rest were taking to flight, most bravely charged the enemy's line, and <b>shook</b> <b>it</b> by the wondrous vigour of his onset. For his troop {{was the only one}} mounted on horseback, and consisted of English and Normans, who formed a part of his father's household. His horsemen, however, were not able long to continue their attacks against soldiers on foot, cased in mail, and standing immoveable in close and dense ranks; but, with their lances broken and their horses wounded, were compelled to take to flight." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to one side}} towards his right shoulder, and <b>shook</b> <b>it</b> in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{walked toward}} the bookcases {{between the west and}} center section of tables in the library.

Klebold walked through the main area, past the first set of bookcases, the central desk area and a second set of bookcases into the east area.

He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired with the TEC-9, killing 18-year-old Lauren Townsend. At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, [...] "Oh my God, oh my God!" [...] In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold simply asked [...] "Why?" [...] before walking from the table.|$|E
