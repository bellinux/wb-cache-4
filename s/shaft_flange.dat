5000|$|A {{block is}} a pulley {{used to support}} and direct lift and {{operating}} lines. A block consists of a grooved wheel, known as a sheave (pronounced [...] "shiv"), steel side plates, spacers, <b>shaft,</b> <b>flange</b> bearings, mounting angles and clips, etc. Blocks are sized based on anticipated live loads, operating speeds, line type and other factors. Sheaves were traditionally fabricated of cast iron, but steel and nylon sheaves are now common.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{variations}} of the gearbox. There is a version for the cast-iron 4-cylinder engines of the 940 (redblock), the all aluminum 6-cylinder of the 960 (whiteblock), and the version for the Volkswagen 6-cylinder diesel engine D24TIC. The differences are the bell housing bolt pattern and the output <b>shaft</b> <b>flange</b> with a 3-bolt flange for the redblock/diesel engines and a 4 bolt flange for whiteblock engines.The variant for the 6-cylinder Volvo engine will fit on all 4/5/6 all-aluminum Volvo N/RN-series engines.|$|E
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle <b>shaft</b> <b>flange</b> is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|E

40|$|Because {{customers}} are requiring front-loaded washing machine to handle big capacity laundry and have faster rotation speed to increase drying ability, there are being {{a lot of}} studies for achievement of high speed dehydration, high-strength and lightweight of washing machine in the latest washing machine business. It is essential that strength of Drum Assembly which is composed of spin drum, <b>shaft,</b> <b>flange</b> is improved to attain that target. In term of spin drum, {{it is difficult to}} realize joint strength required at high speed operation because joint strength of mechanical press-joining method is low remarkably in comparison with welding. Also in case of shaft system, stress from bending and twisting are complexly loaded onto the shaft supporting the horizontal drum, causing problems in fracture strength and fatigue life. The results of this study show optimal joining condition for mechanical press-joining by performing lots of tensile joining strength test with various specimen under multi-change of important design factor such as seaming width, bead area and bead depth etc. and the optimal design of shafting system for big capacity, high-rotation drying through strength analysis, experiment and evaluation...|$|E

Studies of the narrow-edged metal seals show that high tightness {{can be obtained}} with a minimum width of the contact. Under the high pressure of working fluid on the cylindrical surface, the compact wedge-profiled seals sag and completely adhere to the cones of seats, with ends slipping across the flat surfaces with no loss of integrity. The hollow portion available in the elastic characteristic enables us to reduce the contact stress (pressure) when compact wedge-profiled seals are used in movable joints, reducing friction and their wear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Residual {{stresses}} play a {{key role}} in thermo-mechanically coupled forming processes for industrial mass production. They are an unavoidable consequence of the alternating inhomogeneous fields of temperature and mechanical stress developing in tools and components dependent on the process parameters applied. Because of their influence on the behavior of the components produced, a great interest exists to get reliable information about origin and distribution of the relevant residual stress fields and to understand the basic principles of their formation. In this paper the development of residual stress in tools (steel AISI H 11) used for the thermo-mechanical forming operation of cylindrical <b>flange</b> <b>shafts</b> (steel SAE 6150) is outlined. The loading situation of the tool is simulated by thermal fatigue tests, providing information about cyclic stress and plastic deformation during the manufacturing process. Furthermore the residual stress states of the <b>flange</b> <b>shafts</b> manufactured are presented and discussed. Chip forming manufacturing operations are challenging tasks and tensile residual stresses can be avoided using adapted process parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} on the original solution of a <b>flange</b> <b>shaft</b> {{as part of the}} root area of a 5 kW wind turbine blade. There were analyzed the causes that led to the shaft breakage under wind loadings in extreme weather conditions, and consequently technical solutions have been searched in order to improve the shaft design making it more reliable as mechanical strength at extreme wind loadings. The <b>flange</b> <b>shaft</b> is a welded subassembly that keeps the blades attached to the rotor hub. The first part of the paper consists in an analysis referring the loading status, the materials used for blade manufacturing, the identification of critical areas where the breaking was initiated and also the causes for which the materials assumed and specified in the technical design and manufacturing technology failed under loading at wind gusts of about 30 m/sec. Based on this preliminary analysis, {{the second part of the}} paper presents the technical solutions which were considered in reference to the materials and the improved design concept aiming to provide the right mechanical strength necessary to withstand specific wind loadings in extreme weather conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The engine gave {{maximum power}} at 7,500 rpm (the rotors turning at only 2,500rpm), but a 2.96:1 {{reduction}} gearbox (closely {{based on that}} in the Hewland AE75 engine) gave a maximum propeller rotation of an efficient 2,500 rpm. [...] Unlike the Hewland's gearbox, where the output <b>shaft</b> and propellor <b>flange</b> was below the crankshaft, the MidWest's gearbox had its output shaft higher than the eccentric shaft. This feature allowed a larger propeller and better prop clearance, while raising {{the height of the}} engine's thrust line, and reducing downward visibility over the nose very slightly.|$|R
40|$|A {{torque meter}} {{comprising}} hollow-keyed, {{input and output}} female shafts adapted to receive the male shafts of the power source and machine respectively. Each shaft has a circular flange whose face is perpendicular to the center line of the <b>shafts.</b> Each <b>flange</b> has a plurality of equally spaced cylindrical recesses machined into the inside face thereto adapted to receive conical inserts therein. Balls are contained by the conical inserts and transmit the rotational movement from the input to the output shaft. A stationary housing extends around the input and output shaft and has a transducer shell secured thereto. When {{force is applied to}} the input shaft to cause movement, the balls encounter torsional resistance which causes the balls to roll up the ramps of the conical seat inserts to separate the two torque flanges. The force transmitted through the balls causes rotation to the output shaft and produces tension to the stationary transducer shell.

40|$|Volvo Construction Equipment’s {{driveline}} {{development department}} initiated this thesis work. It {{was calculated for}} two students working for 20 week period of time, which equals 30 hp each. The reason for Volvo CE to start the cooperation was {{the large number of}} variance of companion <b>flanges</b> and propeller <b>shafts</b> generating additional work for several departments within Volvo. The problem statement consisted of questions, which should result in information about the number of variants and combinations of propeller <b>shafts</b> and companion <b>flanges</b> used; the reason for the quantity of variants and what factors are affecting the choice of propeller <b>shafts</b> and companion <b>flanges.</b> They should also give answers to how article reduction can be implemented and what recommendations can be given to Volvo for the future. Using a Gantt chart as a planning tool helped the working process to progress in a structured way. Different methods of data collection were done to secure the problem understanding. Tools such as a literature review, function diagrams, and interviews were used to complete the data collection. Co-workers from the purchasing department and the part number reduction team were interviewed. Besides the in-house contact an opportunity was given to interview the suppliers during visits at their factories. Computer software was used as a resource of confirming information and mapping currently used components. The mapping process resulted in interesting findings, which were further researched. Together with the information from the interviews, reasons for the variety of used components were clarified. To deepen the problem understanding a more detailed variation mapping was made, showing what driveline components were generating most variants of companion flanges. The findings made and the recommendations received from the suppliers were unitized in a best case scenario. The questions from the problem statement were analyzed and answered. The recommendations given regarding to Volvo Construction Equipment’s propeller shaft program included guidelines for modularization. The success of modularization is based on among other factors, on particular documentation, continuous communication and close cooperation with the suppliers. This report can be defined as the first step towards a modularized propeller shaft program for Volvo CE’s haulers and wheel loaders...|$|R
40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) {{requested}} {{the design of}} a two-axis gimbal device for the shipboard support of a sensor payload. Previous design efforts presented a low-mass two-axis (pan and tilt) machine. Vibration and shock testing induced failure in the interface between the payload and the tilt shaft, through which the control cabling connected to the sensors, taking the system out of service and creating a hazard for Sailors. This thesis proposes a tapered, hollowed <b>shaft</b> and <b>flange</b> interface connected by an interference fit that is preloaded and retained by a single hollowed bolt for ease of maintenance at sea. This simplified design is a departure from existing rotary tapered interfaces, such as seen in machine tooling, and focuses on connecting massive payloads to their actuators when subjected to severe loading. This design is uniquely suited to withstand large bending moments and loading as demanded by military standards for shock. A custom rig was designed and constructed to subject reduced-scale designs to military standard environmental testing for shock in the laboratory. These test results were analyzed using moving average filtering to develop confidence intervals to validate the design mathematics. A full-scale prototype was manufactured and subjected to shock testing and analysis. The design exceeded all requirements and is ready for immediate integration into the gimbal. This research also revealed the potential for tapered interfaces to connect massive payloads to their actuators in industry. by Michael John Beautyman, Jr. Thesis: Nav.

50|$|Open-die forging is {{also known}} as smith forging. In open-die forging, a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece, which is placed on a {{stationary}} anvil. Open-die forging gets its name {{from the fact that the}} dies (the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece) do not enclose the workpiece, allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies. The operator therefore needs to orient and position the workpiece to get the desired shape. The dies are usually flat in shape, but some have a specially shaped surface for specialized operations. For example, a die may have a round, concave, or convex surface or be a tool to form holes or be a cut-off tool.Open-die forgings can be worked into shapes which include discs, hubs, blocks, shafts (including step <b>shafts</b> or with <b>flanges),</b> sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes.Open-die forging lends itself to short runs and is appropriate for art smithing and custom work. In some cases, open-die forging may be employed to rough-shape ingots to prepare them for subsequent operations. Open-die forging may also orient the grain to increase strength in the required direction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} protect the global environment, {{especially}} on the point of the greenhouse effect, carbon dioxide should be used as a natural refrigerant. Because new compressors with CO 2 are going to be operated under the high pressure, the interaction between sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially rotary type, the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces were very important. In this paper, the surface interactions between a <b>shaft</b> and a <b>flange,</b> which were one of the contacting parts in compressor, were evaluated. The frictional forces and wear amounts in boundary lubricated sliding condition were measured using the pin-on-disk tester. Two types of refrigerants were used, namely R 410 A and CO 2 to compare the tribological characteristics of conventionally used one with new natural refrigerant. It was found that CO 2 lead to a bad lubricity as compared with R 410 A or pure oil due to the formation of relatively thin protective layer on the sliding surface. Smooth surface of shaft produced lower values of friction and wear than rough surfaces. The smooth surfaces represented much more spheroidal graphite, which had very favorable tribological characteristics, on the sliding surfaces...|$|R
