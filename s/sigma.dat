5|$|Akane {{explains}} that <b>Sigma,</b> after his abduction in 2028, had his consciousness transported into his elder self's body in 2074, while his elder self's consciousness was transported into the younger Sigma's body in 2028. The {{goal of the}} AB project was to enable the elder <b>Sigma</b> to prevent the Radical-6 outbreak in 2028 with his future knowledge; Dio sought to stop the project. Akane makes Phi and Sigma's consciousnesses jump to 2029, after the outbreak. <b>Sigma,</b> as Zero Sr., spends the next 45 years developing the AB project together with Akane, while Phi is kept in cold sleep. <b>Sigma</b> creates Kyle as a spare, in case his own body gets damaged. When they again arrive at 2074, <b>Sigma</b> and Phi jump back to 2028 to infiltrate the Mars mission test site.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{technique is}} used to compute zeta(2), the key three-point microstructural parameter which arises in three-point conductivity bounds on the effective conductivity <b>sigma(e)</b> of isotropic two-phase composites. Using the new algorithm, the zeta(2) parameter is computed for dispersions of hard spheres by Monte Carlo simulation, {{and the results are}} compared with those of several analytical calculations of zeta(2). The simulation data on zeta(2) are then used to compute three-point bounds on the conductivity <b>sigma(e)</b> and Torquato's (1985) approximation for <b>sigma(e)</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, <b>Sigma</b> defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As <b>Sigma,</b> Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train <b>Sigma</b> and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each participant was infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so <b>Sigma</b> and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they learn in each one. <b>Sigma</b> and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sigma(s)</b> subunit of RNA {{polymerase}} (encoded by the rpoS gene) is {{a master}} regulator in a complex regulatory network that governs the expression of many stationary-phase-induced and osmotically regulated genes in Escherichia coli. rpoS expression is itself osmotically regulated by a mechanism that operates at the posttranscriptional level. Cells growing at high osmolarity already exhibit increased levels of <b>sigma(s)</b> during the exponential phase of growth. Osmotic induction of rpoS can be triggered by addition of NaCl or sucrose and is alleviated by glycine betaine. Stimulation of rpoS translation and {{a change in the}} half-life of <b>sigma(s)</b> from 3 to 50 min both contribute to osmotic induction. Experiments with lacZ fusions inserted at different positions within the rpoS gene indicate that an element required for <b>sigma(s)</b> degradation is encoded between nucleotides 379 and 742 of the rpoS coding sequence...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new multicountry open economy SDGE model named "SIGMA" {{that we have}} developed as a quantitative tool for policy analysis. We compare <b>SIGMA's</b> implications to those of an estimated large-scale econometric policy model (the FRB/Global model) for an array of shocks that are often examined in policy simulations. We show that <b>SIGMA's</b> implications for the near-term responses of key variables are generally {{similar to those of}} FRB/Global. Nevertheless, some quantitative disparities between the two models remain due to certain restrictive aspects of <b>SIGMA's</b> optimization-based framework. We conclude by using long-term simulations to illustrate some areas of comparative advantage of our SDGE modeling framework. ...|$|R
