40|$|Type I interferons (IFNs) are {{a family}} of cytokines {{specialized}} to coordinate immunity to viruses and other intracellular infections. In the past several years, many of the receptors and signaling pathways that link pathogen detection to induction of type I IFNs have been identified and characterized. An integrated picture has emerged in which type I IFNs have essential functions in several seemingly disparate processes: they restrict viral <b>spread</b> by engaging <b>machinery</b> that ultimately cripples and kills infected cells, yet they are also positively linked to the activation and expansion of lymphocytes that are important for control of intracellular infections. These advances highlight the context-specific actions of type I IFNs and clarify the multiple points at which they are integrated into both innate and adaptive immunity...|$|R
40|$|Abrasive water jets {{have become}} a recent tool for {{applications}} in mechanical machining. With its great advantages of geometrical and material flexibility and its ability of cutting hard-to-machine materials the technology is <b>spreading</b> throughout the <b>machinery</b> industry. To achieve a high quality output, especially in three-dimensional machining, thorough understanding of the relevant processes and modelling of the geometrical outcome is essential. Suitable process models need to be implemented in appropriate waterjet specific Computer Aided Manufacturing systems (CAM). In this paper {{a new approach to}} geometric modelling is presented. The spatial effect of the abrasive jet within the workpiece is described. With this modelling feature, future systems can be equipped so that precision, as well as three-dimensional machining, can be utilised at maximum performance in a wide scope of applications...|$|R
40|$|T he {{concept of}} a {{learning}} curve for individuals has been in widespread use in the psychology literature {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Ebbinghaus (1885) famously demonstrated the fi rst learning curve by memorizing ever-longer strings of nonsense syllables; Bryan and Harter (1899) studied learning curves exhibited by telegraph operators sending and receiving Morse code; and Book (1908) studied a learning curve in typing skills. The idea that a phenomenon analogous to the learning curve might also apply at the level of the organization took longer to emerge, but it had begun to fi gure prominently in military procurement and scheduling at least a decade before Wright’s (1936) classic paper providing evidence that the cost of producing an airframe declined as cumulative output increased. Wright (1936), who was careful not to describe his empirical results as a learning curve, proposed three explanations for the relationships between cost and cumulative quantity produced that he observed. The fi rst was the “improvement in profi ciency of a workman with practice ” (p. 124), characterized by the individual learning curve. The others were “the ability to use less skilled labor as more and more tooling and standardization of procedure is introduced, ” and “the greater <b>spread</b> of <b>machinery</b> and fi xture set up time in large quantity production ” (p. 124). Only the fi rst of these is what we would unambiguously identify as a source of orga-nizational learning; the others are consistent with organizational learning but also with standard static economies of scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} crop-share lease {{is meant}} to reflect how income, expenses, and risk are shared between the tenant farmer and the landlord. The sharing levels are determined by each party’s contributions to the business. As agricultural technology and production practices change over time, shared leases should be reviewed by both parties to see that income continues to be distributed according to contributions. Most share leases are based upon customary methods of sharing production and expenses in a community. More than 75 % of share leases in Ohio are 50 - 50. About 15 % of tenant farmers receive from 60 % to 75 % of income/production in a 2 / 3 - 1 / 3 type arrangement. A smaller number keep more than 75 % of income. As a general rule, tenants receive {{a greater share of}} the value of crop production on poorer-quality soils and a lesser share on better soils. Advantages of Shared Leasing • The landlord and tenant share risk in both good and bad years alike. • Both parties can share benefits of improved technology. • The landlord will benefit from increased yields, prices, or government program payments. •Joint management may result in more profitable decisions. • It is easier for the landlord to document material participation for maintaining Social Security base and for estate tax special use valuation. • Shared leasing is an efficient financing alternative for farmers as it reduces cash outlay per acre and <b>spreads</b> fixed <b>machinery</b> cost over more land. • The farmer’s rental obligation to the landlord varies directly with the farm’s crop returns. Disadvantages of Shared Leasing •Share agreements are more complex, so landowners with limited agricultural knowledge or time may prefer cash renting...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{of the impact of}} the development of machinery on the economy and in particular on the relationship between capital and labour was a major issue in England in the first half of the nineteenth century. The introduction of machinery raised profound questions for politicians and political economists, and provoked strong reactions by workers from as early as the 1790 s and this was particularly prevalent in the 1820 s and 1830 s as the use of <b>machinery</b> <b>spread.</b> Harriet Martineau was perhaps the most successful popularizer of Classical political economy. Writing in the late 1820 s and early 1830 s she outsold Dickens for a while. In her work she concerned herself with the {{question of}} machinery and in particular the hostility to it by workers. This is apparent in the early work ‘The Rioters’ written in 1827, and in the tales 'The Hill and the Valley' and ‘The Manchester Strike’ from her Illustrations of Political Economy 1832 - 4. In 1834 two plays were put on in London, not only influenced by these two tales but also by another from the Illustrations, ‘Life in the Wild’. This paper examines Martineau’s contributions to the debate concerning machinery and looks at the theoretical underpinnings, the natures and implications of her fictional accounts and how these in turn influenced the two London dramas. ...|$|R
40|$|Cyclostationary {{models for}} the {{diagnostic}} signals measured on faulty rotating machineries {{have proved to be}} successful in many laboratory tests and industrial applications. The squared envelope spectrum has been pointed out as the most efficient indicator for the assessment of second order cyclostationary symptoms of damages, which are typical, for instance, of rolling element bearing faults. In an attempt to foster the <b>spread</b> of rotating <b>machinery</b> diagnostics, the current trend in the field is to reach higher levels of automation of the condition monitoring systems. For this purpose, statistical tests for the presence of cyclostationarity have been proposed during the last years. The statistical thresholds proposed in the past for the identification of cyclostationary components have been obtained under the hypothesis of having a white noise signal when the component is healthy. This need, coupled with the non-white nature of the real signals implies the necessity of pre-whitening or filtering the signal in optimal narrow-bands, increasing the complexity of the algorithm and the risk of losing diagnostic information or introducing biases on the result. In this paper, the authors introduce an original analytical derivation of the statistical tests for cyclostationarity in the squared envelope spectrum, dropping the hypothesis of white noise from the beginning. The effect of first order and second order cyclostationary components on the distribution of the squared envelope spectrum will be quantified and the effectiveness of the newly proposed threshold verified, providing a sound theoretical basis and a practical starting point for efficient automated diagnostics of machine components such as rolling element bearings. The analytical results will be verified by means of numerical simulations and by using experimental vibration data of rolling element bearings...|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{have evolved}} sophisticated secretion machineries specialized for the secretion of macromolecules important for their life cycles. The Type VI secretion system (T 6 SS) {{is the most}} widely <b>spread</b> bacterial secretion <b>machinery</b> and is encoded by large, variable gene clusters, often found to be essential for virulence. The latter {{is true for the}} atypical T 6 SS encoded by the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) of the highly pathogenic, intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis. We here undertook a comprehensive analysis of the intramacrophage secretion of the 17 FPI proteins of the live vaccine strain, LVS, of F. tularensis. All were expressed as fusions to the TEM beta-lactamase and cleavage of the fluorescent substrate CCF 2 -AM, a direct consequence of the delivery of the proteins into the macrophage cytosol, was followed over time. The FPI proteins IglE, IglC, VgrG, IglI, PdpE, PdpA, IglJ and IglF were all secreted, which was dependent on the core components DotU, VgrG, and IglC, as well as IglG. In contrast, the method was not directly applicable on F. novicida U 112, since it showed very intense native beta-lactamase secretion due to FTN_ 1072. Its role was proven by ectopic expression in trans in LVS. We did not observe secretion of any of the LVS substrates VgrG, IglJ, IglF or IglI, when tested in a FTN_ 1072 deficient strain of F. novicida, whereas IglE, IglC, PdpA and even more so PdpE were all secreted. This suggests that there may be fundamental differences in the T 6 S mechanism among the Francisella subspecies. The findings further corroborate the unusual nature of the T 6 SS of F. tularensis since almost all of the identified substrates are unique to the species...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Heath was asked to issue a {{scientific}} opinion on the pest risk assessment made by Lithuania on Ambrosia spp., requested by Lithuania to be inserted as a harmful organism in point c of section II, part A of Annex I to the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The Lithuanian risk assessment relates to three species of the genus Ambrosia: A. artemisiifolia L. (common ragweed), A. trifida L. (giant ragweed) and A. psilostachya DC (perennial ragweed). These plants are native to North America and are considered invasive both in their native area and {{in other parts of}} the world, including several countries in Europe. Ambrosia spp. are of particular public concern due to the allergenic properties of their pollen. The Panel examined in detail the three documents provided by Lithuania. The review evaluated the accuracy and relevance of data, the information provided for pest risk assessment purposes, the quality and quantity of data considered, and the quality of methods applied to conduct the risk assessment. The review was based on the principles and terminology of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 : Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO IPPC, 2006). With regard to the criteria of a quarantine pest, the Panel on Plant Health concludes that the Lithuanian documents do not provide sufficient evidence to assess on a scientifically sound basis whether Ambrosia spp. qualify as quarantine pests for Lithuania. The most important shortcomings are:* The pest of phytosanitary concern for Lithuania has been identified at a genus level. The genus Ambrosia includes too many species to be considered together, even if only three species A. artemisiifolia, A. trifida and A. psilostachya are deemed to pose a threat. Biological and ecological data clearly indicate that each of the three species would require its own or a better structured pest risk assessment clearly discriminating among the species of concern. * The documents clearly state that A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida are present in Lithuania. A. psilostachya is not reported. A table showing the number of plants of A. artemisiifolia in several sites and years is provided. Two maps showing sites infested with A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida in Lithuania are provided but without any date. Detailed information on the abundance of A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida over the years is necessary. Moreover, more specific details are needed on their habitats and their status (established or not). * Data on the different introduction pathways need to be revised. The current distribution for each of the three species outside Lithuania, especially in countries that are important trading partners of Lithuania, should be added to identify in more detail the risk for further introduction. More accurate data are required on the assessed pathways of the three species; alternative pathways (via bird seed, <b>spreading</b> by soil, <b>machinery</b> and tyres) should also be considered. * The impacts on crop yields and on human health are discussed in two documents provided by Lithuania, but it is not possible to conclude from these documents that Ambrosia spp. would be of potential economic importance for Lithuania, i. e. through direct or indirect effects on cultivated plants in agriculture, uncultivated/unmanaged plants, wild flora, habitats or ecosystem. Impacts on human health are also not given sufficient attention. * The endangered area is not defined. However, there is scientific evidence both in the provided document and the existing literature that Ambrosia spp. can cause detrimental impacts on human health due to their allergenic properties. The control of Ambrosia spp. is difficult in certain crops and in non cultivated areas. The Panel on Plant Health therefore recommends that the pest risk assessment should be revised and updated. As stated above, it should be undertaken for each of the species of concern. In order to assess the risks related to each Ambrosia spp., additional information and amendments would be needed regarding the following aspects:* current distribution and abundance in Lithuania of the species already present A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida (providing references and/or official surveys data), including listing of habitats and the status (established or not);* current distribution of Ambrosia spp. outside Lithuania, to identify in more detail the risk of further introduction into the country;* more accurate data on the pathways already assessed; consideration of alternative pathways (bird seed, <b>spreading</b> by soil, <b>machinery</b> and tyres);* more accurate assessment of the potential for establishment in Lithuania (including photoperiod and climatic conditions, and other abiotic factors);* update on the efficacy of control measures;* effects on crop yield for the main crops. This is important as the levels of infestation with Ambrosia spp. and the efficiency of the methods of control are not the same for all crops;* more accurate assessment of potential economic importance (including impacts on human health and other social impacts);* identification of the endangered area;* discussion of uncertainties on all aspects of the pest risk assessment...|$|R
