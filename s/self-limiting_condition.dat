2500|$|Transient {{synovitis}} {{of the hip}} (also called toxic synovitis; {{see below}} for more synonyms) is a <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition</b> {{in which there is}} an inflammation of the inner lining (the synovium) of the capsule of the hip joint. The term irritable hip refers to the syndrome of acute hip pain, joint stiffness, limp or non-weightbearing, indicative of an underlying condition such as transient synovitis or orthopedic infections (like septic arthritis or osteomyelitis). In everyday clinical practice however, irritable hip is commonly used as a synonym for transient synovitis. [...] It {{should not be confused with}} sciatica, a condition describing hip and lower back pain much more common to adults than transient synovitis but with similar signs and symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Often, {{treatment}} is not necessary, because episcleritis is a <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition.</b> Artificial tears {{may be used}} to help with irritation and discomfort. More severe cases can be treated with either topical corticosteroids or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
50|$|Overtreatment, in {{the strict}} sense, may refer to {{unnecessary}} medical interventions, including {{treatment of a}} <b>self-limited</b> <b>condition</b> (overdiagnosis) or to extensive treatment for a condition that requires only limited treatment.|$|R
50|$|Infantile {{cortical}} hyperostosis is a <b>self-limited</b> <b>condition,</b> {{meaning that}} the disease resolves on its own without treatment, usually within 6-9 months. Long-term deformities of the involved bones, including bony fusions and limb-length inequalities, are possible but rare.|$|R
30|$|Microsporidia keratoconjunctivitis is {{generally}} a <b>self-limited</b> <b>condition,</b> especially in immune competent persons. A variety of drugs {{have been used}} as treatments, including fumagillin, propamidine, isethionate, and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), or with antifungal agents such as natamycin with or without systemic therapy with albendazole or itracanozole [8, 9].|$|R
50|$|A {{subconjunctival}} hemorrhage {{is typically}} a <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition</b> that requires no {{treatment in the}} absence of infection or significant trauma. The elective use of aspirin and NSAIDs is typically discouraged. Artificial tears may be applied four to six times a day.|$|E
50|$|Gianotti-Crosti {{disease is}} a {{harmless}} and <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition,</b> so no treatment may be required. Treatment is mainly focused on controlling itching, symptomatic relief and to avoid any further complications. For symptomatic relief from itching, oral antihistamines or any soothing lotions like calamine lotion or zinc oxide may be used. If there are any associated conditions like streptococcal infections, antibiotics may be required.|$|E
5000|$|Episcleritis is a benign, <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition,</b> meaning {{patients}} recover {{without any}} treatment. Most cases of episcleritis resolve within 7-10 days. [...] The nodular type is more aggressive and takes longer to resolve. [...] Although rare, some cases may progress to scleritis. [...] However, in general, episcleritis {{does not cause}} complications in the eye. [...] Smoking tobacco delays the response to treatment in patients with episcleritis.|$|E
50|$|Since AOP is {{fundamentally}} {{a problem of}} the immaturity of the physiological systems of the premature infant, it is a <b>self-limited</b> <b>condition</b> that will resolve when these systems mature.

50|$|One study {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that 17% of adolescents with anterior knee pain (a common but benign <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition)</b> report that their pain is associated with cold weather. The same study indicated that the main activities associated with anterior knee pain are sporting, stair climbing and walking, but also sitting. Some people with anterior knee pain tend to have generally colder knees, and such people also trend towards having to wear extra tights/long johns in the winter.|$|E
50|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} vertigo {{of childhood}} is an uncommon disorder which presents with recurrent episodes of dizziness. The presentation is usually {{between the ages}} of 2 years and 7 years of age and is characterised by short episodes of vertigo of sudden onset when the child appears distressed and unwell. He or she may cling to something or someone for support. The episode lasts only minutes and resolves suddenly and completely. It is a <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition</b> and usually resolves after about eighteen months although many go on to experience migrainous vertigo (or vertiginous migraine) when older.|$|E

50|$|Bronchitis {{describes}} the swelling or {{inflammation of the}} bronchial tubes. Additionally, bronchitis is described as either acute or chronic depending on its presentation and is also further described by the causative agent. Acute bronchitis {{can be defined as}} acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease. It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea. Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals. Viral bronchitis can sometimes be treated using antiviral medications depending on the virus causing the infection, and medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and expectorants can help mitigate the symptoms. Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and vomiting), increased resistance, and cost of treatment in a <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition.</b> Beta2 agonists are sometimes used to relieve the cough associated with acute bronchitis. In a recent systematic review it was found there was no evidence to support their use.|$|E
40|$|Loose anagen {{syndrome}} (LAS) is a benign, <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition</b> where anagen hairs {{are easily}} and painlessly extracted. It is mainly reported in childhood; however, it may variably present in adulthood as well. The presence of anagen hair devoid of its sheath and with ‘floppy sock appearance’ is a characteristic feature of loose anagen hair (LAH) on trichogram. LAH {{can be seen}} in normal population and in alopecia areata. The percentage of LAH in LAS is more than 50 %. The histopathological findings show clefting between the layers of hair and are very useful in differentiating LAS from alopecia areata. Here, a review on the diagnostic criteria and practical guidelines are discussed so as to enable the trichologist in managing this benign, <b>self-limiting</b> <b>condition</b> and differentiating it from the other causes of non-scarring alopecias...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact of {{increased}} prescription drug copayments on the therapeutic classes of drugs received and health status of the elderly. HYPOTHESES TESTED: Increased prescription drug copayments will reduce the relative exposure to, annual days use of, and prescription drug costs for drugs used in <b>self-limiting</b> <b>conditions,</b> but will not affect drugs used in progressive chronic conditions and will not reduce health status. STUDY DESIGN: Each year over a three-year period, {{one or the other of}} two well-insured Medicare risk groups in an HMO setting had their copayments per dispensing increased. Sample sizes ranged from 6, 704 to 7, 962. DATA SOURCES/DATA COLLECTION: Automated administrative data systems of the HMO were used to determine HMO eligibility, prescription drug utilization, and health status. ANALYSIS DESIGN: Analysis of variance or covariance was employed to measure change in dependent variables. FINDINGS: Relative exposure, annual days of use, and prescription drug costs for drugs used in <b>self-limiting</b> <b>conditions</b> and in progressive chronic conditions were not affected in a consistent manner across years by increases in prescription drug copayment. Health status may have been adversely affected. Larger increases in copayments appeared to generate more changes. CONCLUSIONS: Small changes in copayments did not appear to substantially affect outcomes. Large changes in copayments need further examination...|$|R
