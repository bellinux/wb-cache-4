40|$|Previous work on {{assessing}} the {{errors in the}} Australian Height Datum (AHD) across Western Australia used fewer and older global positioning system (GPS) data and a global quasigeoid model. A larger and improved State-wide set of 243 GPS-derived ellipsoidal heights and a regional gravimetric quasigeoid model are now available. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} re-evaluate the north-south tilt in the AHD and look for regional systematic distortions with some more confidence in Western Australia. This new analysis shows an apparent north-south tilt of ~ 0. 27 mm/km in the existing AHD over the whole of the State, but which increases to ~ 0. 6 mm/km over smaller regions, showing regional systematic distortions. When mean sea-level constraints are removed from the AHD by a minimally constrained least-squares adjustment of the <b>spirit-levelling</b> observations that is less prone to the effect of sea-surface topography, the north-south tilt reduces to ~ 0. 18 mm/km, but the regional distortions remain, showing that errors are present in the <b>spirit-levelling</b> observations...|$|R

This paper describes {{the transfer of}} vertical control into areas that have sparse existing geodetic control using only a single GPS receiver. The GPS data were processed using the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group's (AUSLIG's) AUSPOS on-line GPS processing facility (www. auslig. gov. au/geodesy/sgc/ wwwgps/wwwgps. htm). These GPS-estimated ellipsoidal heights were transformed to the Australian Height Datum (AHD) using AUSGeoid 98.

40|$|This paper reviews (without equations) {{the various}} {{definitions}} of height systems and vertical geodetic datum surfaces, {{together with their}} practical realisation for users in Australia. Excluding geopotential numbers, a height system is a one-dimensional coordinate system used to express the metric distance (height) of a point from some reference surface. Its definition varies according to the reference surface chosen and the path along which the height is measured. A vertical geodetic datum is the practical realisation of a height system and its reference surface for users, nominally tied to mean sea level. In Australia, the normal-orthometric height system is used, which {{is embedded in the}} Australian Height Datum (AHD). The AHD was realised by the adjustment of ~ 195, 000 km of <b>spirit-levelling</b> observations fixed to limited-term observations of mean sea level at multiple tide-gauges. The paper ends by giving some explanation of the problems with the AHD and {{of the differences between the}} AHD and the national geoid model, pointing out that it is preferable to recompute the AHD...|$|R
60|$|One morning, {{not long}} after that {{interview}} between Mr. Farebrother and Mary Garth, in which she confessed to him her feeling for Fred Vincy, it happened that her father had some business which took him to Yoddrell's farm in the direction of Frick: it was to measure and value an outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb expected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea (it must be confessed that his bias was towards getting the best possible terms from railroad companies). He put up his gig at Yoddrell's, and in walking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his work, he encountered the party of the company's agents, who were adjusting their <b>spirit-level.</b> After a little chat he left them, observing that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going to measure.

6000|$|The scent {{would have}} been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along the lanes on horseback, if his mind had not been worried by {{unsuccessful}} efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on one side expecting him straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on the other threatening to forsake him if he did enter it, and with the working-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman without capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred's disposition because his father, satisfied {{that he was no}} longer rebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this pleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on what he should do, there would be the task of telling his father. But it must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the more difficult task:--what secular avocation on earth was there for a young man (whose friends could not get him an [...] "appointment") which was at once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special knowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and slackening his pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go round by Lowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges from one field to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and {{on the far side of}} a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in smock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach towards the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth and his assistant were hastening across the field to join the threatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find the gate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock-frocks, whose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing after swallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats before them with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth's assistant, a lad of seventeen, who had snatched up the <b>spirit-level</b> at Caleb's order, had been knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men had the advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in front of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw their chase into confusion.

[...] "I'll swear to every one of you before the magistrate. You've knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I know.

On the whole, the best position for getting the angle of [...] the beds accurately, is the top of the Tapia, a little below the [...] junction there of the granite and gneiss (see notice of this [...] junction in Appendix 2); a point from which the summit of the [...] Aiguille du Gouté bears 11° south of west, and that of the Aiguille [...] Bouchard 17° north of east, the Aiguille Dru 5½° or 6° north of [...] east, the peak of it appearing behind the Petit Charmoz.

40|$|In {{regions where}} additional, {{spatially}} dense gravity and terrain information {{are available to}} augment existing data, a gravimetric determination of the geoid can be improved by incorporating these new data.

A digital terrain model is also used during the geoid computations, which is derived from gravity station elevations and spot heights in the area. Using 21 <b>spirit-levelled</b> Australian Height Datum (AHD) heights in conjunction with Global Positioning System (GPS) ellipsoidal heights as control data, the standard deviation of the new gravimetric geoid is k 0. 0824 m. This represents a 31 % improvement over the existing AUSGEOID 93 gravimetric geoid and a 48 % improvement over the OSU 9 lA global geopotential model.

40|$|The AUSGeoid 98 geoid {{model is}} used in {{conjunction}} with nation-wide GPS networks and <b>spirit-levelled</b> Australian Height Datum (AHD) heights at 1013 points, and subsets thereof, to estimate the vertical offset between the AHD as realised on the Australian mainland [AHD(Mainland) ] and in Tasmania [AHD(Tas) ]. It appears that the AHD(Tas) is offset below the AHD(Mainland) somewhere between (26 ± 33) cm and (12 ± 12) cm, which is in broad agreement with previous estimates made by Rapp (1994) and Rizos et al. (1991), as well as with long-wavelength sea-surface topography models. However, the estimates of the vertical datum difference are heavily influenced by the spatial distribution of the GPS-AHD control points used, with different offsets being computed according to latitude and proximity to the coast. This is most probably due to the effect of fixing of multiple tide gauges to mean sea level in the adjustment of the AHD. This has implications for any future unification of the AHD(Mainland) and AHD(Tas) into a single, global vertical datum, where the appropriate datum connection points must first be chosen.

The computed Helmert orthometric correction reaches - 4. 8 mm between the end-points of the traverse, whereas the normal orthometric correction only reaches 0. 1 mm. However, computing the corrections over each bay in the traverse gives totals over the entire traverse of - 0. 8 mm for the Helmert orthometric corrections and 0. 2 mm for the normal orthometric corrections.

40|$|The main aims of {{physical}} geodesy are {{to study the}} shape of the Earth, its gravity field and the geoid which is an equipotential surface closest to the mean sea level. Precise geoid determination has been an important research topic in geodesy and geophysics in the past two decades. Scientists and government agencies all around the world have made great efforts on the development of high-accuracy geoid models. These geoid models are developed not only for scientific applications, but also for other purposes such as serving for a reference surface for mapping, sea level monitoring and natural resources exploitation and management. A geoid model is required to define a national height or vertical datum. Precise geoid models have experienced an unprecedented demand due to the rapid development of GPS/GNSS technologies. Geoid models allow transforming ellipsoidal heights, which are relatively easily determined from GPS/GNSS observations, into physical heights, which are associated to the Earth&rsquo;s gravity field, without the need for expensive and time-consuming <b>spirit-levelling.</b> Physical heights are used for mapping, engineering and civil engineering infrastructure since they indicate the flow direction of fluids, {{due to the fact that}} fluids are attracted by the gravity of the Earth rather than geometric height differences. Moreover, vertical datums have been historically based on a local mean sea level surface determined by averaging tide gauge readings over a certain period of time. However, due to the sea surface topography effect, which is mainly caused by the sea dynamics and other meteorological processes, observations from different tide gauges do not commonly coincide. Therefore, when vertical datums are separated by oceans or other bodies of water, direct methods such as spirit levelling and gravity measurements are not applicable. In this case, geoid models can be used for unifying two or more vertical datums together. This research aims to develop a new and optimal precise geoid for Argentina using all available measurements from the most state of the art technologies and the latest global geopotential models (GGMs), along with detailed digital terrain models (DTMs). The remove-compute-restore technique and the combination of an optimal GGM with 658, 111 land and marine gravity observations were used for the new model determination. Several GGMs (e. g. EGM 2008, GOCO 05 S and EIGEN- 6 C 4) were evaluated to investigate the best GGM that fits Argentinian regional gravity field. Terrain corrections were calculated using a combination of the SRTM_v 4. 1 and SRTM 30 _Plus v 10 DTMs for all gravity observations. For the regions that lacked gravity observations, the DTU 13 world gravity model was utilised for filling-in the gravity voids. The residual gravity anomalies were gridded by the Kriging method and the resultant grid was applied in the Stokes&rsquo; integral using the spherical multi-band FFT approach and the deterministic kernel modification proposed by Wong and Gore in 1969. The accuracy of the new geoid was assessed by comparing its geoidal undulations over 1, 904 benchmarks, which have both orthometric and ellipsoidal heights.

40|$|One goal {{of modern}} geodesy is the global {{unification}} of vertical datums so that height data from {{them can be}} properly integrated. This thesis studies the unification of the 13 disparate levelling- and tide-gauge-based vertical datums in New Zealand (NZ). It proposes a new NZ-wide single vertical datum based on a gravimetric quasigeoid model to unify the existing local vertical datums. This will also include methods to transform height data {{in terms of the}} existing datums to the new datum and vice versa. After defining and comparing the main types of height system and vertical datum used around to world, the system of heights used in NZ was shown to be normal-orthometric. Consequently, datum unification was achieved using a quasigeoid model, as opposed to a geoid model. The quasigeoid was computed by combining the GRACE-based GGM 02 and EGM 96 global geopotential models with land gravity data (40, 737 observations) and a 56 -m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Marine gravity data came from a least-squares collocation combination of 1, 300, 266 crossover-adjusted ship track observations and gravity anomalies derived from multi-mission satellite altimetry. To ensure that the best quasigeoid was computed for the NZ datasets, a number of computation processes were compared and contrasted. The Hammer chart, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and prism integration methods of computing terrain corrections (TCs) were compared. This showed that the prism integration TC is the most realistic in NZ. The mean Helmert gravity anomalies, required for numerical integration of Stokes’s formula, were computed via refined Bouguer anomalies with the prism TCs, and reconstruction with heights from the DEM used to ‘reconstruct’ more representative mean anomalies. In addition, five deterministic modifications to Stokes’s formula were compared. There was little difference between three of them, so the Featherstone et al. (1998) modification (0 y = 1. 5 °, M = 40) was chosen because it is theoretically better than its predecessors. The global geopotential, gravimetric geoid, sea surface topography and geodetic boundary-value problem approaches to vertical datum unification were then contrasted. As none was likely to be effective in NZ, a new iterative quasigeoid approach was adopted. This procedure computes an initial quasigeoid from existing data on the various local vertical datums to estimate the vertical datum offsets from co-located GPS-levelling data. These offsets were then subsequently applied to the gravity observations by way of additional reductions to the initially computed quasigeoid to reduce gravity anomaly biases caused by the vertically offset datums. These adjusted gravity anomalies were then used to compute a new quasigeoid model, and the process repeated until the computed offsets between the local vertical datums (or equivalently two quasigeoid solutions) converged, which took only two iterations. The computed offsets were then compared with <b>spirit-levelled</b> height differences among adjoining datums, where these were available, giving an average agreement of 7 cm. Since the local vertical datums are effectively unified, the new national vertical datum for NZ will comprise the iteratively computed gravimetric quasigeoid model, accompanied by local vertical datums. This approach is implemented to give a new national vertical datum for NZ. When used with the appropriate offset, this enables the transformation of heights in terms of the national vertical datum to the 13 precise-levelling datums and the ellipsoidal national geodetic datum, NZ Geodetic Datum 2000...|$|R
