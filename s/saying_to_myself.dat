[...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E
500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms motioned for Taylor to run a long pattern and after 30–40yards threw him the pass. Taylor later said the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass {{all the way back to}} Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm going to be able to stay in that stadium'."

When I had gone fifteen minutes I <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> there's more'n a mile behind me, and {{everything}} quiet. Another five minutes and I says there's considerable more land behind me now, and there's a man back there that's begun to wonder what's the trouble. Another five and I <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> he's getting real uneasy--he's walking the floor now. Another five, and I <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> there's two {{mile and a half}} behind me, and he's AWFUL uneasy--beginning to cuss, I reckon. Pretty soon I <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> forty minutes gone--he KNOWS there's something up! Fifty minutes--the truth's a-busting on him now! he is reckoning I found the di'monds whilst we was searching, and shoved them in my pocket and never let on--yes, and he's starting out to hunt for me. He'll hunt for new tracks in the dust, and they'll as likely send him down the river as up.|$|R

2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E
