40|$|The authors {{review the}} {{research}} {{pertaining to the}} selection of three different schedules of training trials sequencing. The effects of massed, distributed, and spaced trials sequencing on the learning of handicapped and nonhandicapped individuals for both cognitive and motor tasks Is discussed. Implications {{for the application of}} the research findings to the classroom for the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> individual are presented. The increasing awareness that how an individual learns a skill {{is just as important as}} what is learned has drawn attention to different arrange ments of training trials. The question addressed in this article is whether the technique of separating and spreading training trials for a particular skill across the entire school day should be incorporated into our teaching technology, along with the practice of massing all the trials for a skill into relatively short training sessions. The question grows out of a concern that the procedures for teaching <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> students are not always maximizing instructional time, nor are these procedures attending to the particular learning characteristics that separate <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> stu dents from other, less <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> learners.

3000|$|In fact, {{almost one}} million people who are officially {{classified}} as <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> work full time in Germany (Bundesagentur für Arbeit 2014). This outcome may be related, at least partly, to a quota system. It mandates employers with more than 19 full-time employees to employ at least 5 [*]% <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> employees. Employers not complying with the quota must pay a monthly penalty (Ausgleichsabgabe) of € 290 per unoccupied workplace. This effectively means that a small business with 20 full-time employees has to hire one <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> worker or pay an annual penalty of $ 4500.

The five factors were receptivity in the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> children, cooperation with other, life of family caregivers, a state of mind, and social support in family caregivers for the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> children. Comparing the worst condition with the supreme condition in temporal progress of family care the difference of five factors in family caregivers of both was longitudinal examined. The data for this study were obtained from 93 family caregivers （ 45. 3 ± 4. 34 ） for the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> children using questionnaire and interview survey in 1995 - 2000. As the main results, as compared with the five factors that prescribes the stability of the care between the worst condition and supreme condition in family care, it was recognized that there was a significant difference in five factors （receptivity in the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> children, cooperation with other, life of family caregivers, a state of mind, and social support）.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{a teacher}} training and supervision program {{for increasing the}} involvement of <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> adolescents and adults in functional educational tasks. The program, consisting of a brief in-service followed by supervisory prompts and feedback, was accompanied by large increases in functional tasks in three classrooms. In addition, generalized increases occurred during nontargeted times {{in the classroom and}} the changes during both the targeted and nontargeted times were maintained over a 44 - 45 week period. In two subsequent experiments, surveys provided social validation for the criteria for functional versus nonfunctional tasks in that: (a) relevant individuals reliably categorized functional tasks as representing typical living, work, social, and leisure situations and (b) experienced clinicians consistently rated tasks previously categorized as functional as being more useful for <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> persons than tasks categorized as nonfunctional.

40|$|The Data Based Gymnasium Model, a {{systematic}} approach {{to physical education}} for the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped,</b> is described in this newsletter issue. The model was developed through a cooperative effort between Oregon State University and the Teaching Research Infant and Child Center. The "Game, Exercise, and Leisure Sport Curriculum for the <b>Severely</b> <b>Handicapped</b> " is divided into four major domains: movement concepts; basic game skills, physical fitness, and leisure movement. Skills, or programs, are task analyzed and systematically presented in teaching steps commensurate with the learning needs of the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped.</b> The Data Based Gymnasium Model incorporates the basic component framework of the Teaching Research Data Based Classroom Model with adaptations {{for the needs of}} the physical education setting. The model employs a behavioral approach to instruction and conducts learning programs in both individual one-to-one settings and group settinas.

40|$|Providing {{educational}} {{services to the}} <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> individual is a new venture, and therefore we find ourselves standing {{on the threshold of}} making a number of decisions that will affect the field today and, in my opinion, for yoars to come. Further, as tv!cDowe) t and Sontag (1977) sug-gest, the trends and strategies deveaoped for the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> have the potential for affect-ing, or serving as a catalytic agent for improving, the {{educational services}} to all handicapped children. Because the decisions made today in the field of the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> will affect the future of special education, we have a significant respon-sibility to thoughtfully consider and explore viable intervention approaches. We simply cannot afford to develop systems which may ultimately interfere with and reduce our ability to provide effective educational programs to all children within the pur-view of public education. The intent {{of this paper is to}} discuss four major topics of concern in the education of the <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped.</b> These topics include (a) a definition of the target population, (b) personnel preparation issues, (c) parameters of appropriate education, and (d) the how and what of a service delivery system. Each of these topics or areas of educational con-cern have associated philosophical and/or imple-mentation dilemmas. The resolutions of these dilemmas will have a significant impact on the field of special education and will set the boundaries for the inclusiveness and quality of the services delivered to <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> people-The present format imposes limitations that make a detailed, in-depth discussion of the four topics of concern or dilemmas impossible; there-fore, the following remarks will suggest which prob-lems, in my opinion, most urgently need the thoughtful attention of the field. The review presented below can only highlight problem areas. This highlighting may serve to direct the attention of concerned individuals so that further analysis lead-ing to workable solutions can emerge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{available}} placements for <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> students in rural and urban areas. More specifically, this study investigated the relationship of percentage of urban population to the type of placement. The data for this study were collected by a questionnaire distributed throughout the United States by a telecommunication system for special education, SpecialNet, and by direct mail. One hundred and ninety school districts from 46 states comprised the sample. As the school district names were recorded, demographic data from the National Bureau of Census were developed. The data were adjusted to identify the "percentage urban " population. Findings of the study are that <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> rural students are more often placed in resource rooms while their peers from more urban districts are placed in special schools. Educational implications and suggestions for further research are presented. The education of <b>severely</b> <b>handicapped</b> students in both rural and urban areas has changed dramatically since the advent of P. L. 94 - 142 in 1975. Under the requirements P.
