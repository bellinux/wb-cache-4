40|$|At {{building}} site of motorway tunnel Viòové-Dubná skala, the priority {{is given to}} driving of exploration galley that secures in detail: geologic, engineering geology, hydrogeology and geotechnics research. This research is based on gathering information for a supposed use of the full profile <b>driving</b> <b>machine</b> that would drive the motorway tunnel. From {{a part of the}} exploration gallery which is driven by the TBM method, a fulfilling information is gathered about the parameters of the driving process, those are gathered by a computer monitoring system. The system is mounted on a <b>driving</b> <b>machine.</b> This monitoring system is based on the industrial computer PC 104. It records 4 basic values of the driving process: the electromotor performance of the <b>driving</b> <b>machine</b> Voest-Alpine ATB 35 HA, the speed of driving advance, the rotation speed of the disintegrating head TBM and the total head pressure. The pressure force is evaluated from the pressure in the hydraulic cylinders of the machine. Out of these values, the strength of rock mass, the angle of inner friction, etc. are mathematically calculated. These values characterize rock mass properties as their changes. To define the effectivity of the driving process, the value of specific energy and the working ability of driving head is used. The article defines the methodics of computing the gathered monitoring information, that is prepared for the <b>driving</b> <b>machine</b> Voest  Alpine ATB 35 H at the Institute of Geotechnics SAS. It describes the input forms (protocols) of the developed method created by an EXCEL program and shows selected samples of the graphical elaboration of the first monitoring results obtained from exploratory gallery driving process in the Viòové  Dubná skala motorway tunnel...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{interactions}} between the ground, the <b>driving</b> <b>machine,</b> the lining tube and the built environment, the accurate assignment of in-situ system parameters for numerical simulation in mechanized tunneling is always subject to tremendous difficulties. However, the more accurate these parameters are, the more applicable the responses gained from computations will be.

50|$|Simple machines, such as {{the club}} and oar (examples of the lever), are prehistoric. More complex engines using human power, animal power, water power, wind power and even steam power date back to antiquity. Human power was focused {{by the use of}} simple engines, {{such as the}} capstan, {{windlass}} or treadmill, and with ropes, pulleys, and block and tackle arrangements; this power was transmitted usually with the forces multiplied and the speed reduced. These were used in cranes and aboard ships in Ancient Greece, as well as in mines, water pumps and siege engines in Ancient Rome. The writers of those times, including Vitruvius, Frontinus and Pliny the Elder, treat these engines as commonplace, so their invention may be more ancient. By the 1st century AD, cattle and horses were used in mills, <b>driving</b> <b>machines</b> similar to those powered by humans in earlier times.|$|R
50|$|He {{published}} a book of rules for roller skate Polo, as well as 16 rules for skating with your sweetheart. With a high quality product and great promotions, the space in the stable was extended 5 times. In 1880 he purchased the house at 201 N 14th Street, and doubled his shop space by including the carriage house there. His nephew suggested using ball bearings in the wheels which they patented in 1884. Product demand went wild; so he built a large two story factory on N 16th Street, which occupied most of a city block, and the Henley Bicycle Works was born. All three buildings are still standing in 2017. Under the leadership of Henley, the workers at Henley Bicycle Works manufactured bicycles; roller skates; scooters; lawn furniture and lawn swings; iron working machinery; tools; boring, milling and screw <b>driving</b> <b>machines</b> used in wood manufacturing; gas meters; fence machines and lawn mowers.
