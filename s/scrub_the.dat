5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage <b>scrub,</b> <b>the</b> increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Infantry Battalion {{arrived at}} ANZAC Cove {{on the evening}} of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915.

Moving in the dark through the thick scrub of the Razorback, the 15th found in the <b>scrub</b> <b>the</b> empty positions that it was sent to fill. The 15th Infantry Battalion was soon switched to Quinn's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the Anzac perimeter, with Cannan becoming post commander.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} found in central, southern, and western Tasmania and is absent from warmer, dryer areas. It grows on moist acidic soils in wet sclerophyll forest or subalpine scrub at altitudes of 600 to 1200m (2000–4000ft). It is an {{understory}} component of subalpine forest stands of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and alpine yellow gum (E. subcrenulata), as well as Athrotaxis selaginoides–Nothofagus gunnii short rainforest, Athrotaxis selaginoides rainforest, Leptospermum-with-rainforest <b>scrub,</b> <b>the</b> tall Nothofagus–Atherosperma rainforest and Nothofagus–Phyllocladus short rainforest. It is occasionally found in the Leptospermum scoparium–Acacia mucronata forest community of western Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Link can {{transform}} at will into different creatures: the Deku Mask transforms Link into a Deku <b>Scrub,</b> <b>the</b> Goron Mask into a Goron, and the Zora Mask into a Zora. Each form features unique abilities: Deku Link can perform a spin attack, shoot bubbles from his mouth, skip on water, and fly {{for a short}} time by launching from Deku Flowers; Goron Link can roll at high speeds (and grow spikes at higher speeds), punch with deadly force, stomp the ground with his massive, rock-like body, walk in lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim rapidly, throw boomerang-like fins from his arms, generate a force field, and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water. Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to <b>scrub</b> <b>the</b> doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E

5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense <b>scrub,</b> <b>the</b> tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut their way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E

25|$|In {{their native}} arid and {{semi-arid}} climates, donkeys {{spend more than}} half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality <b>scrub.</b> <b>The</b> donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine. While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight, approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter, compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse. Donkeys are also less prone to colic. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the very}} few lowland heaths in Cheshire, Sound Heath is a {{valuable}} habitat for heathland plants and animals, although its heathland character is currently under threat from the spread of trees and <b>scrub.</b> <b>The</b> common's ponds form {{one of the most important}} sites in the county for freshwater invertebrates. Three nationally rare or endangered species have been found within the area: the mud snail (which is now one of the UK's most endangered freshwater creatures, having been recently recategorised as near threatened across Europe in the new IUCN European Red List of Non-marine Molluscs), great raft spider and the Enochrus isotae species of water scavenger beetle, as well as the nationally scarce beautiful snout moth. The first sightings of the migrant hawker dragonfly in Cheshire were at Sound Heath, and many other locally rare species have been recorded here. The site is also an important breeding site for birds.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of an immediate Japanese counterattack by air units, the assault was planned to ensure a smooth landing, that would allow the transports to withdraw quickly. Some difficulty was experienced in landing east of the cape, while the three northern beaches were found to be completely unsuitable for landing craft to get ashore. Nevertheless, the initial assault wave, which consisted of 7,500 Marines, proceeded relatively smoothly and landed successfully by 07:30 hours. These troops pushed ashore through small dry corridors of land and began clearing defenders from the dense <b>scrub.</b> <b>The</b> 2nd Marine Raider Battalion used search dogs to locate Japanese troops hiding in the undergrowth, and by 11:00 hours, the Marines had seized the lightly defended area. Some resistance continued until nightfall, by which time the beachhead was firmly secured, coming at a cost of 78 killed in action while virtually annihilating the 270 troops of the Japanese that were defending the area around the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|In October 1944, Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig), a Jewish–Hungarian {{prisoner}} in the German extermination camp Auschwitz, {{works as a}} Sonderkommando member. Amongst other duties, he must salvage valuables from the clothing of the dead, drag their bodies from the gas chambers and <b>scrub</b> <b>the</b> floors immediately afterwards. He performs these daily tasks with a stoic, impassive expression, seemingly having been numbed by the daily horrors. One day, following the gassing, he comes upon {{the body of a}} boy who is somehow still breathing after having been gassed. From a distance, Saul witnesses a Nazi physician methodically suffocate the boy to ensure his death then call for an autopsy. Saul impulsively comes forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Miklós (Sándor Zsótér), who he learns is a fellow prisoner and Hungarian. He is able to convince Miklós to not perform the autopsy as he intends to give the boy a proper Jewish burial, for which he needs a rabbi. He goes to Rabbi Frankel (Jerzy Walczak), who refuses and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.|$|E
