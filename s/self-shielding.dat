5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a {{detector}} of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through <b>self-shielding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, <b>self-shielding</b> or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} {{developed}} for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E

25|$|PELs for {{short-term}} and career astronaut exposure to space radiation {{have been approved}} by the NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer. The PELs set requirements and standards for mission design and crew selection as recommended in NASA-STD-3001, Volume 1. NASA has used dose limits for cancer risks and the non-cancer risks to the BFOs, skin, and lens since 1970. For Exploration mission planning, preliminary dose limits for the CNS risks are based largely on experimental results with animal models. Further research is needed to validate and quantify these risks, however, and to refine the values for dose limits. The CNS PELs, which correspond to the doses at the region of the brain called the hippocampus, are set for time periods of 30 days or 1 year, or for a career with values of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mGy-Eq, respectively. Although the unit mGy-Eq is used, the RBE for CNS effects is largely unknown; therefore, the use of the quality factor function for cancer risk estimates is advocated. For particles with charge Z>10, an addition PEL requirement limits the physical dose (mGy) for 1 year and the career to 100 and 250 mGy, respectively. NASA uses computerized anatomical geometry models to estimate the body <b>self-shielding</b> at the hippocampus.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Gadolinium is an {{important}} element to the Nuclear Fuel Industry. Two of the seven naturally occurring isotopes of gadolinium have very large absorption cross sections for thermal neutrons. The isotopes of ¹⁵⁵ Gd and ¹⁵⁷ Gd readily absorb thermal neutrons and transmute to ¹⁵⁶ Gd and ¹⁵⁸ Gd which are poor thermal neutron absorbers. Because of this property, gadolinium is termed a burnable neutron poison. At sufficient concentrations, gadolinia becomes a <b>self-shielded</b> absorber in that the neutron absorption event occurs very near the absorbing surface and the internal volume of the absorber sees little or no thermal neutron flux. The study of <b>self-shielded</b> burnable absorbers is not new to the Nuclear industry. However, most of the previous {{work in this area}} has concentrated on uniform mixtures of the gadolinium with the uranium in the fuel pellets. The present work employs simplified transport theory methods to calculate the depletion of gadolinia when small dense spherical particles are included along with the traditional uniform mixture.

40|$|We use a {{high-resolution}} cosmological simulation {{to predict}} the distribution of H I Lyα emission from the lowredshift (z � 0. 5) intergalactic medium (IGM). Our simulation {{can be used to}} reliably compute the emission from optically thin regions of the IGM but not that of <b>self-shielded</b> gas. We therefore consider several models that bracket the expected emission from <b>self-shielded</b> regions. Most galaxies are surrounded by extended (� 10 2 kpc) “coronae ” of optically thin gas with Lyα surface brightness close to the expected background. Most of these regions contain smaller cores of dense, cool gas. Unless <b>self-shielded</b> gas is able to cool to T < 10 4. 1 K, these cores are much brighter than the background. The Lyα coronae represent “cooling flows ” of IGM gas accreting onto galaxies. We also estimate the number of Lyα photons produced through the reprocessing of stellar ionizing radiation in the interstellar medium of galaxies; while this mechanism is responsible for the brightest Lyα emission, it occurs on small physical scales and can be separated using high-resolution observations. In all cases, we find that Lyα emitters are numerous (with a space density ∼ 0. 1 h 3 Mpc − 3) and closely trace the filamentary structure of the IGM, providing a new way to map gas inside the cosmic web...|$|R

5000|$|The SER is the {{measured}} emission rate from the source, and is related, but different {{to the source}} activity. This relationship {{is affected by the}} type of radiation being emitted and the physical nature of the radioactive source. Sources with [...] emissions will nearly always have a lower SER than the Bq activity due to <b>self-shielding</b> within the active layer of the source. Sources with [...] emissions suffer from <b>self-shielding</b> or backscatter, so the SER is variable, and individually can be greater than or less than 50% of the Bq activity, depending on construction and the particle types being measured. Backscatter will reflect particles off the backing plate of the active layer and will increase the rate; beta particle plate sources usually have a significant backscatter, whereas alpha plate sources usually have no backscatter. However alpha particles are easily attenuated if the active layer is made too thick. The SER is established by measurement using calibrated equipment, normally traceable to a national standard source of radiation.|$|E

This process was evaluated under preheating conditions, with an uniform and steady hear input. All joints were welded in flat position (IG), with the pipe turning and the torch still. Tube dimensions were 762 mm in external diameter and 16 mm in thickness. Welds were applied on single V-groove, with six weld beads, along with three levels of preheating temperatures (room temperature, 100 degreesC, 160 degreesC).

40|$|Infrared stellar {{photometry}} from 2 MASS and {{spectral line}} imaging observations of 12 CO and 13 CO J = 1 - 0 line emission from the FCRAO 14 m telescope are analysed {{to assess the}} variation of the CO abundance with physical conditions throughout the Orion A and Orion B molecular clouds. Three distinct Av regimes are identified in which the ratio between the 13 CO column density and visual extinction changes corresponding to the photon dominated envelope, the strongly <b>self-shielded</b> interior, and the cold, dense volumes of the clouds. Within the strongly <b>self-shielded</b> interior of the Orion A cloud, the 13 CO abundance varies by 100 % with a peak value located near regions of enhanced star formation activity. The effect of CO depletion onto the ice mantles of dust grains is limited to regions with AV > 10 mag and gas temperatures less than 20 K as predicted by chemical models that consider thermal-evaporation to desorb molecules from grain surfaces. Values of the molecular mass of each cloud are independently derived from the distributions of Av and 13 CO column densities with a constant 13 CO-to-H 2 abundance over various extinction ranges. Within the strongly <b>self-shielded</b> interior of the cloud (Av > 3 mag), 13 CO provides a reliable tracer of H 2 mass {{with the exception of}} the cold, dense volumes where depletion is important. However, owing to its reduced abundance, 13 CO does not trace the H 2 mass that resides in the extended cloud envelope, which comprises 40 - 50 % of the molecular mass of each cloud. The implied CO luminosity to mass ratios, M/L_{CO}, are 3. 2 and 2. 9 for Orion A and Orion B respectively, which are comparable to the value (2. 9), derived from gamma-ray observations of the Orion region. Our results emphasize the need to consider local conditions when applying CO observations to derive H 2 column densities. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 21 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
