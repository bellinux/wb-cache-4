Several pre-war KJRM ships and transferred vessels which survived the war continued their service with the post-war Yugoslav Navy. The post-war Yugoslav Navy drew its insignia and traditions from the Partisan naval forces that evolved from armed fishing vessels operated along the Adriatic coast from late 1942, <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the traditions of the KJRM were carried over to the post-war navy.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{said that}} he learned what he needed as a {{foundation}} for his writing from the style sheet for The Kansas City Star, where he worked as cub reporter. [...] The critic John Aldridge says that the minimalist style resulted from Hemingway's belief that to write authentically, each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight. Aldridge writes that Hemingway's style [...] "of a minimum of simple words that seemed to be squeezed onto the page against a great compulsion to be silent, creates the impression that those words—if only because there are <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them—are sacramental." [...] In Paris Hemingway had been experimenting with the prosody of the King James Bible, reading aloud with his friend John Dos Passos. From the style of the biblical text, he learned to build his prose incrementally; the action in the novel builds sentence by sentence, scene by scene and chapter by chapter.|$|E

Travelers Indemnity case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which reduced the $6.6 million attorneys’ fee request by $2 million, with the class members receiving $4.8 million instead of $2.8 million. In February 2010, CCAF successfully objected to a coupon settlement in a Central District of California class action alleging consumer fraud {{in the sale of}} Honda Civic Hybrids; the settlement would have provided $2.95 million in attorneys' fees, but only coupons to the class. Frank was reported to have said [...] "coupons are nearly worthless because <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the intended beneficiaries will find it worthwhile to fill in all the necessary paperwork." [...] The CCAF has also been involved in the case surrounding the allegations of email spamming by Ameritrade in 2009. The case brought Frank before Northern District of California Chief Judge Vaughn Walker, where he challenged the fairness of a TD Ameritrade settlement, which consists of coupons for antivirus software.

500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she would see her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In [...] "Free", Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan (Hailee Denham) the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|Wright's {{purchases}} {{concentrated in}} the fields of literature and social sciences, particularly the works of British learned societies. Books on general sciences and natural history were (and still remain) scarce, books on medicine and technology nonexistent. In 1920 the library purchased the Allan collection of books on Biblical studies and Reformation, including some incunabula. In the late 1920s Wright disposed of what was then perceived as [...] "minor 19th-century fiction". T. S. Eliot, who was elected President of the library twelve years after Wright's death, said: [...] "I do not believe that there is another library of this size which contains so many books which I might want, and <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the books which I cannot imagine anyone wanting." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|E
2500|$|Normally during alpha–beta, the subtrees are {{temporarily}} {{dominated by}} either a first player advantage (when many first player moves are good, and at each search depth {{the first move}} checked by the first player is adequate, but all second player responses are required {{to try to find}} a refutation), or vice versa. This advantage can switch sides many times during the search if the move ordering is incorrect, each time leading to inefficiency. As the number of positions searched decreases exponentially each move nearer the current position, it is worth spending considerable effort on sorting early moves. An improved sort at any depth will exponentially reduce the total number of positions searched, but sorting all positions at depths near the root node is relatively cheap as there are <b>so</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them. [...] In practice, the move ordering is often determined by the results of earlier, smaller searches, such as through iterative deepening.|$|E
