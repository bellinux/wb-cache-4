25|$|The second 1953 {{international}} was {{an official}} match for both teams: England {{playing with a}} stronger line-up involving Alf Ramsey, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney; Argentina <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same line-up used in the first match. The game, however, was abandoned after 36 minutes due to torrential rain, with a 0–0 scoreline. The teams next met in the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, where England's 3–1 victory in the group stage led to Argentina's exit from the tournament. Argentina's first victory over England in a full international occurred in a 1–0 win in June 1964, during the Taça de Nações friendly tournament in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} several years Jones {{cemented}} his spot in both the Warriors and Kiwis, <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Warriors despite the lack of success on and off the field. Between 1995 and 1999 he played over 100 consecutive first grade games for the Warriors. In 1999 he broke his arm playing for the Kiwis against Tonga, and as a result missed {{the first half of the}} 2000 NRL season, breaking his consecutive streak. At the end of 2000 the Warriors were bankrupt and were sold for the second time in their short history. Jones was the first signing by the new franchise owned by current owner Eric Watson and it was his signing that convinced many other players to re-sign with the club.|$|E
25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault {{found himself in}} the proverbial hot seat to {{engineer}} a deep run. But an absence of urgency was reflected in the team's free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. <b>Sticking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> status quo meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning core bolted to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with the Fever in what was the team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. In the series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|E

With QPR down to ten men they went on to lose the match 2–1. When Warnock was replaced as manager by Mark Hughes in January 2012, Hughes confirmed that Barton would remain captain. Barton's performance in QPR's 3–2 home victory against Liverpool saw him booed by the QPR fans, who promptly cheered when he was substituted just after the hour mark. Barton admitted that his performance was [...] "awful" [...] and the [...] "worst I've ever played in my career" [...] but also criticised the QPR fans for not <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team in their battle against relegation. After being dropped for the club's next match, an away defeat to Sunderland, he returned to the line-up for the home match against Arsenal. Barton led QPR to a 2–1 victory and he was cheered by the supporters and praised by Hughes, who described his performance as [...] "top-class".

[...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] is frequently performed at Pearl Jam concerts, generally as the last song of the concert. The freeform nature of the song allows Pearl Jam to improvise and change the song around when performing it live. During performances, McCready often plays the main riff quite differently than on the record and uses overdrive {{as opposed to the}} previous clean channel. He also lengthens the outro, sometimes incorporating various songs which have influenced his playing style, such as [...] "Little Wing". Similarly, Vedder almost always changes the lyrics around, <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same rhythm as the original recording. Live performances of [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{can be found on the}} [...] "Daughter" [...] single, the Tibetan Freedom Concert compilation box set, various official bootlegs, the live album Live at Benaroya Hall, and the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set.

Regaining one's perpendicular after a fall in deep snow, when the feet are encumbered by a pair of long snow-shoes, is by no means an easy thing to accomplish, in consequence of the impossibility of getting hold of anything solid on which to rest the hands. The depth is so great that the outstretched arms cannot find bottom, and every successive struggle only sinks the unhappy victim deeper down. Should no assistance be near, he will soon beat the snow to a solidity that will enable him to rise, but not in a very enviable or comfortable condition.|$|E
