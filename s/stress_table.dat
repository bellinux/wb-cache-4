The grain yield advantage over Swarna and Swarna-Sub 1 under RS drought stress and submergence, of those NILs possessing earlier identified major and consistent-effect QTLs, qDTY 1.1 (Vikram et al. 2011; Ghimire et al. 2012; Sandhu et al. 2014), qDTY 2.1 (Venuprasad et al. 2009; Sandhu et al. 2014), qDTY 3.1 (Dixit et al. 2014; Venuprasad et al. 2009) and Sub 1 (Neeraja et al. 2007) {{in the current}} marker-assisted backcrossing breeding programs indicates the suitability of these loci in improving drought-submergence tolerance in the Swarna background. In addition, the selected NILs showed significant grain yield advantage under NS as the selection for grain yield under both NS and RS was made across generation advancement. IR 96322 - 34 - 223 -B- 1 - 1 - 1 showed grain yield advantage of 2 to 54 % under NS (Table 3) and 1 to 17 % under moderate to severe drought <b>stress</b> (<b>Table</b> 4) over the combined mean across seasons and locations. IR 94391 - 131 - 358 - 19 -B- 1 - 1 - 1 showed grain yield advantage of 5 to 19 % under NS (Table 3) and 8 to 24 % under moderate to severe drought <b>stress</b> (<b>Table</b> 4) over the combined mean across seasons and locations. Similarly, IR 94391 - 131 - 358 - 19 -B- 1 - 1 - 1 showed grain yield improvement of 3 to 48 % under NS (Table 3) and 4 to 38 % under moderate to severe drought <b>stress</b> (<b>Table</b> 4) over the combined means across seasons and locations.

The developed NILs were previously shown to perform well across different severity/intensity of drought and in regions with different conditions/ soil types (Singh et al. 2017). Some of the selected NILs showed early days to flowering than Swarna under NS (data not shown) and this may have resulted from the linkages of the qDTYs with earliness (Vikram et al. 2016). The plant height of most of the selected NILs were similar to the PHT of Swarna under NS but higher under RS (data not shown), this may be due to their increased ability to produce more biomass under RS. The linkage has been successfully broken and semi-dwarf, medium duration NILs in Swarna background have been developed.|$|E
30|$|The {{expression}} of genes involved {{directly or indirectly}} in Zn transport increases under Zn deficiency. Moreover, the genes involved in starch synthesis and transport were up-regulated by Zn deficiency. Both Zn-deficient roots and shoots accumulated starch (Figure 1), {{in line with the}} gene expression pattern (Table 2). Starch may be used as a carbon source; therefore, it is assumed that Zn-deficient plants synthesize starch to withstand temporary abiotic stress. However, {{it is also possible that}} disruption of glycolysis by Zn deficiency causes an over-accumulation of soluble sugar, which ultimately results in starch accumulation. It is already reported that the activity of FBP aldolase in the glycolysis pathway decreased under Zn-deficiency in the leaves of oat and clover, and suggested that one of the reasons for a growth defect in plants grown under Zn-deficient conditions is the breakdown of normal carbohydrate metabolism (Quinlan-Watson [1951]). The concentration of soluble sugar and starch increase in Zn-deficient bean shoots (Marschner & Cakmak [1989]). An increase in soluble sugar would cause osmotic stress. We speculate that the starch might be synthesized to avoid osmotic stress due to increased soluble sugar in cells under Zn deficiency. Up-regulation of the genes that encode soluble sugar transporters due to Zn-deficiency suggests that sugar transporters help distribute sugar to avoid osmotic <b>stress</b> (<b>Table</b> 2).|$|E

40|$|Little of the {{literature}} on Marathi phonology addresses stress, and none of it systematically. The tentative accounts that do exist are contradictory in their descriptions (Pandharipande 1997, Dhongde & Wali 2009). To address this gap in Marathi phonology, this study investigates word-level stress and duration contrasts of high vowels (/i/, /u/, /iː/, /uː/) in Modern Standard Marathi. Since weight criteria vary across languages (Hayes 1995, Gordon 2004), the main goals are to determine what constitutes heavy syllables in Marathi, whether high vowels have a duration contrast and whether they behave like vowels with one (µ) and two (µµ) moras. Four main hypotheses are tested: H 1) stress is weight-sensitive, H 2) Marathi follows the Latin weight system (Gordon 2002) with CVX heavy, H 3) when syllables have the same weight the left-most syllable bears stress and finally, H 4) short high vowels have one mora and long high vowels have two moras. The study tests these hypotheses using auditory and spectrographic analyses of two word-list recordings from two native Marathi speakers. Results from the first experiment (Table 1) confirm H 1, H 2, and H 3 : open syllables with short vowels are light and closed syllables are heavy, stress is weight-sensitive, and when syllable weight is equal the first syllable is stressed. Results from the second experiment confirm H 4 : there is a duration distinction between the high vowels; /i, u / = µ while /iː, uː / = µµ. These findings were tested on a new set of 41 disyllabic and 17 trisyllabic wordlist tokens. In the disyllabic words 92 - 100 % of the predicted syllables were stressed, depending on the token, and in the trisyllabic words 100 % of the predicted syllables were <b>stressed</b> (<b>Table</b> 2). <b>Table</b> 1. <b>Stress</b> patterns in disyllabic words with schwa Syllable type % of predicted stres...|$|R

Under high-temperature (30 °– 34 °C) and moisture <b>stress</b> (water <b>table</b> 0. 16 – 0. 23 m below the surface and vapor pressure deficit 2. 2 – 3. 0 kPa) conditions, midday P was reduced to about 0. 03 – 0. 06 mg m− 2 s− 1. There was a high degree of consistency in the values of P under similar conditions in the two seasons. Seasonally integrated values of the daily net ecosystem CO 2 exchange indicated that the study site was a source of atmospheric CO 2, releasing about 71 g C m− 2 over a 145 -day period (May-October) in 1991. Over a similar period in 1992, however, this ecosystem was a sink for atmospheric CO 2 with a net accumulation of about 32 g C m− 2. These results are consistent with previous investigations on CO 2 exchange in other northern wetland sites during wet and dry periods...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES This study {{assessed}} the heart variability response to orthostatic <b>stress</b> during tilt <b>table</b> testing {{before and after}} normal saline administration. BACKGROUND The efficacy of sodium chloride and mineralocortoid {{in the treatment of}} neurally mediated cardiac syncope is attributed to intravascular volume expansion; however, their modulation of autonomic nervous system activity has not been evaluated. METHODS Heart rate variability analysis was performed on 12 adolescents with a history of syncope or presyncope (mean age 15. 2 6 0. 7 years) during tilt table testing. Subjects were upright 80 ° for 30 min or until syncope. After normal saline administration, the patient was returned upright for 30 min. Heart rate variability analysis data were analyzed by an autoregression model (Burg method). RESULTS All subjects reproducibly developed syncope during control tilt table testing; median time to syncope was 9. 4 6 2. 1 min. After normal saline infusion, none of the subjects developed syncope after 30 min upright. In the control tilt, there was an initial increase followed by a progressive decrease in low frequency power until syncope. Repeat tilt after normal saline administration demonstrates that low frequency power increased but the magnitude of initia...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The program system Pro/MECHANICA is a {{specific}} software product designed for solving {{of different kinds of}} technical problems in general engineering. We were looking for usage not only in the engineering but also in the terramechanical area. We realized a simulation loading of the soil with a rigid circular table and after the loading we calculated deformations and <b>stresses</b> under the <b>table</b> using FEM (Finite Element Method). This article shows {{a specific}} exploitation program Pro/MECHANICA in an unconventional area {{as well as in the}} agricultural area. Keywords: program product; FEM (Finite Element Method); Pro/MECHANICA; deformation and stress of soil; modelling Soil properties require exact measuring methods making use of computing methods for investigation of deformation strength, establishment of applied progressive mathematical theory and model. The progressive mathematical theory and model lead on verification results or identification parameters, which require difficult systems. One of the difficult system is investigation of stress in the soil, which we analyzed. We investigated a transmission force between tyres and soil. The methods is determinate with a computers and software equipment. In this article the possibility software product Pro/MECHANICA of the software packet Pro...|$|R
30|$|Gene {{sequence}} {{information of}} the NU varieties {{is useful to}} explore divergent traits and their origin. Here we introduce one example each for biotic and abiotic <b>stress</b> tolerance (<b>Table</b> 5). OsSWEET 14 is a susceptibility gene to bacterial leaf blight in wild rice (Hutin et al. 2015). The corresponding locus in the graphical genotype showed that NU 1, 2, and 5 had the CG 14 alleles (Additional file  14 : Figure S 4 b). Association analysis of those alleles and resistance to bacterial blight may lead to discover differences of NU varieties. Notably, Séré et al. (2005) reported the different susceptibility of NU 1 (with OsSWEET 14 from CG 14) and NU 4 (without OsSWEET 14 from CG 14).One of salt tolerance determinant gene OsHKT 1; 5 (Platten et al. 2013), which encodes a Na+ transporter, exhibited variation in the NU varieties. Namely, NU 3 and NU 4 were identical to WAB 56 – 104, but other NU varieties contained non-parental segments in this gene region. This observation {{is consistent with the}} concept that salt tolerance in NU 4 is derived from WAB 56 – 104 as reported previously (Awala et al. 2010). Interestingly, Yamamoto et al. (2011) reported the similar physiological response of NU 3 and NU 4 to salt stress compared to other five NU varieties, while NU 3 and NU 4 exhibited different profiles of total amino acids and polyamine. At the same time, Yamamoto et al. (2011) reported salt stress susceptibility of NU 2 among the NU varieties. Those differences of NU varieties in salt stress response imply that multiple genetic components for salt stress adaptation are combined differently in their genomes. Platten et al. (2013) reported some O. glaberrima seem to have another salt exclusion mechanism that is independent on OsHKT 1; 5. Other seven Na+ transporter genes (Platten et al. 2006) exhibited no difference in the chromosomal segments in NU 3 and NU 4 (Additional file  15 : Table S 11). Further investigation is required to specify the reason.|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 101 rice accessions, which include 43 Thai accessions, 57 {{germplasm}} {{obtained from the}} International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), and Nipponbare were {{used in this study}} (Table 1). The Thai accessions included 27 commercial cultivars, 11 landraces, and 5 other Oryza species. The commercial cultivars were cultivars grown in all rice ecologies through out the country such as irrigated area, rain fed low land, up land, and deep water. These commercial cultivars were 11 improved and 16 local breeding lines. The improved lines were cultivars with high yielding and/or cultivars with agronomic desirable traits. The improved cultivars were classified by their development through crossing among local cultivars and/or with other genetic sources, and their recent pedigrees were known (Table 1). The local breeding cultivars had not been bred through modern breeding procedures and their precise pedigrees were unknown. The landraces were local lines, which have not been planted for commercialization, but they have different special traits (Table 1). The other Oryza species included O.glaberrimma, African cultivated rice, and four species of wild rice: O. rufipogon, O.branchyantha, O. latifolia, and O. officcinalis. The rice accessions obtained from IRRI were groups of germplasm having agronomic desirable traits, including temperature-sensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS), new plant type, early flowering, and biotic and abiotic <b>stress</b> resistances (<b>Table</b> 1). Two accessions, KDML 105 (the premium jasmine rice) and Nipponbare, which are well known Indica and Japonica rice respectively, were used as controls for genetic diversity analysis and as references for control of allele sizing variation between electrophoresis runs. Nipponbare was not included in genetic diversity and pairwise analysis aimed to compare Thai and IRRI germplasm. Genetic structure of the Thai accessions is very limited, but most of them were classified by morphology as Indica rice. Young leaves from 3 – 5 mature plants of each accession grown in greenhouse were collected for DNA isolation using the CTAB method (Murray and Tompson [1980]).|$|R
40|$|Soil {{salinity}} and waterlogging are {{two major}} environmental problems in estuarine wetlands. To prevent the typical wetland plants from degradation by soil salinization and salt waterlogging and more effectively use the plants to provide wetland ecosystem services, we examined the ecological adaptability of Phragmites australis, a characteristic plant species in the Yellow River Delta, to {{the interactive effects of}} water level and salt stress. The results showed that P. australis adapts to salt and water <b>table</b> <b>stressed</b> environments through slowing down the growth rate, maintaining the tiller number, and adjusting the biomass allocation of different organs. The highest plant height and the largest leaf area were at 0 cm water table treatment; the 0. 5 % NaCl treatment increased the aboveground biomass; higher water table increased the fibrous root biomass allocation, but largely decreased the leaf biomass. The exclusion of toxic inorganic ions such as Na+ and Cl- and the accumulation of organic solutes are also important mechanisms to aid survival in saline wetlands. On average 35. 1 % of Cl- and 53. 9 % of Na+ accumulated in belowground organs. The study could provide fundamental guidance for wetland restoration projects and wetland sustainable use in coastal zones such as the Yellow River Delta...|$|R
