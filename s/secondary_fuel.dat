40|$|Coal based power {{generation}} {{is a significant}} source of mercury emissions to the atmosphere and this has attracted huge attention in the past decade. Recently, the concerns regarding global warming and need for new energy resources introduced the concept of cofiring of biomass and waste as <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> in the power industry. The addition of a variety of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> will change the behaviour of mercury in the combustor which will then affect the design of emission control technology. This PhD thesis primarily focused on the impact of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> and the combustion conditions on mercury speciation in pulverized <b>fuel</b> co-combustion of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> with coal. The experimental work of this thesis mainly involves bench scale studies to investigate the speciation of mercury in pulverized fuel co-combustion under air-staging and at different combustor temperatures (1000 and 1300 ÂºC). A new model is developed to predict different forms of mercury in the post-combustion zone upstream of a particulate control device. The model incorporates reactions of mercury with flue gas species and simultaneous adsorption of oxidized mercury (HgCl 2) on fly ash particles in cooling of flue gases. Additional work is concentrated on understanding the mercury speciation under gasification conditions. In gasification processes, most of the mercury is exist in elemental form. A kinetic model has been developed to predict speciation of mercury in gasification product gas. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> derived from urban and industrial wastes is a well-established opportunity for containing {{the climate change}} impacts associated with conventional fossil fuels consumption in the cement industry. Large substitution of heat input required by clinker production with several different types of these fuels is extensively adopted, with air emissions inventories demonstrating significant greenhouse gases reductions arising from fossil fuels savings. However, the stack release of some trace pollutants of toxic concern, mainly heavy metals and dioxins, is not equally well documented, due to the more extensive ensemble of factors that, merely beyond fuel type and characteristics, might affect their air emissions. Present paper reports the main results of a study addressed to the analysis and comparative evaluation of real world emissions of toxic trace compounds arising from non conventional fuels utilisation in several full-scale cement plants operated in Italy. Data considered cover a relatively wide range of fuel types and substitution rates in different technological configurations of the clinker furnace and of the emissions control system, including most recent designs considered as BAT references in the cement sector. Main results demonstrate any appreciable variation in the stack emissions of trace metals and dioxins (PCDD/F) during coincineration of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> with respect to full conventional fossil fuels utilization, either for all {{the various types of}} alternative fuels burned than within the different clinker plant designs. For dioxins and furans, the results further indicate in dry kilns with cyclonic preheater and precalciner the most affordable designs for utilizing high levels of fuel cocombustion ratios without any risk of increasing stack emissions assets...|$|R

40|$|Utility {{operation}} with frequent fuel switching {{is a common}} practice, forced by cheaper coal availability in the international market. Additionally, a substitution of coal by cheaper local <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels,</b> ranging from forest wood to sewage sludge and industrial or domestic residues, is gaining importance. Switching between different fuels, even if these do not differ much from the design coal, enhances operational problems arising from ash deposition. In order to prevent operational problems, through comprehension of the phenomena taking place within the furnace, appropriate sampling and characterization of the deposits are necessary. Methods commonly used for analysis of ash deposits and their characterization are summarized in this paper. The goals of the experimental work at the Institute of Process Engineering and Power Plant Technology (IVD) are then summarized.

50|$|Energetic {{material}} pyrotechnic compositions, especially {{solid rocket}} propellants and smokeless powders for guns, often employ plasticizers to improve physical {{properties of the}} propellant binder or of the overall propellant, to provide a <b>secondary</b> <b>fuel,</b> and ideally, to improve specific energy yield (e.g. specific impulse, energy yield per gram of propellant, or similar indices) of the propellant. An energetic plasticizer improves the physical properties of an energetic material while also increasing its specific energy yield. Energetic plasticizers are usually preferred to non-energetic plasticizers, especially for solid rocket propellants. Energetic plasticizers reduce the required mass of propellant, enabling a rocket vehicle to carry more payload or reach higher velocities than would otherwise be the case. However, safety or cost considerations may demand that non-energetic plasticizers be used, even in rocket propellants. The solid rocket propellant used to fuel the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster employs HTPB, a synthetic rubber, as a non-energetic <b>secondary</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{enormous}} {{growth in}} industries and increase in population {{are the main}} reason for heavy depletion of fossil fuel. In recent years, the desire of energy independence, foreseen depletion of non-renewable fuel sources, fluctuating petroleum fuel costs, the necessity of stimulating agriculture based economy, and the reality of climate change have created an interest in the development of biofuels. Though large amount of biomass is available they are not properly utilized for the energy conversion. Keeping this in mind the trapping of energy from various biomass sources is essential. Biogas technology is one which can be adopted for heat and power generation.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> in practical plants (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification) requires a detailed characterization, mainly in severe thermal conditions, to provide optimized parameters for design and modeling purposes.

It consists of a preliminary characterization followed by further investigation (TG-FTIR analysis, kinetic abstraction, analysis on solid residue) {{to shed light on}} the effects of different operating conditions. The volatile matter released is found to strongly depend on the conditions used during the thermal treatment.

40|$|Aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of the use of <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels,</b> <b>secondary</b> raw materials and blending agents on trace element concentrations in cement and concrete. Furthermore, the aim was to investigate under which conditions and to which extent the incorporated trace elements can be released into the environment. Additionally, it should be proofed, whether regulations, standards, directives, etc. for the production of cement and corresponding construction products contain specific requirements for pollutant loads. The study has shown, that presently used secondary raw materials and fuels result in some cases in a slight increase in trace element concentrations in cement. However, a general assessment of the use of wastes in cement production and of its impact on trace element input can not be performed. Furthermore, future developments can hardly be estimated. The release of trace elements from concrete elements is negligible small during the phase of use. An increased release of trace elements is possible under special assumptions after demolition. However, the present knowledge is not sufficient for a definite assessment. Existing regulations concerning the production and use of cement do not presently contain defaults for allowed concentrations of pollutants. However, changes can be expected in future due to demands which are presently worked out for the EU. (orig.)

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} ignition (above 1100 K) of propane and air mixtures is {{studied in}} this work. The initial detailed mechanism consists of 177 elementary reactions with 40 species, which reproduces the ignition time of propane under {{a wide range}} in the parametric space (initial temperature, equivalence ratio, pressure). Through a systematic reduction strategy, using the classical normalized sensitivity analysis, the minimal set of elementary chemical reactions {{can be reduced to}} 43 with 27 species, reproducing the ignition conditions. Basically, the ignition delay time corresponds to the depletion time of the propane fuel, attacked by radicals, which produces <b>secondary</b> <b>fuels</b> such as ethylene (C 2 H 4), ethane (C 2 H 6), and acetylene (C 2 H 2), among others, which are consumed in times much shorter than the consumption time of the primary fuel.
