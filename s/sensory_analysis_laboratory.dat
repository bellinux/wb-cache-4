Tasks of study: to select and instruct assessors group {{to work by}} LST ISO 8586 – 1 : 1997. Sensory analysis. General guidance of the selection, training and monitoring of assessors. Part 1 : Selected assessors. To do descriptive analysis of dairy product (cheese) by LST ISO 4121 : 2004. Sensory analysis. Methodology. Evaluation of food products by method using scales. To make sensory profile of dairy product (cheese). Material and methods: the study’s was done at Food Safety and Animal Hygiene department in LVA and at <b>Sensory</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>Laboratory</b> in KTU Food Institute. There were analysed 4 cheeses sensory analyses, done each of cheese comparable analysis and made profile. The assessors group were made from 7 students of LVA. This group selected in 2004 at KTU Food Institute and trained, but they didn’t have sensory analysis skills. At assessors screening was using these methods: ageusia, matching and ranking tests. At first assessors group was rating general cheeses appearance, odour and taste, consistency in 5 scoring. Then assessors group analysed the cheeses by earlier chosen and discussed attributes, used scales those attributes intensity to rate. From receive information were made sensory profile. To know consumers’ opinion about cheeses was used acceptability test. Results: the sensory analyses methods review showed, that sensory analyses methods are widely usable for different food products group attributes and theirs difference characterize. To do sensory analyses without special documentation concrete test we must to have selected assessors group. The assessors done sensory profile of 4 cheeses, analysis showed, that by rating attributes cheeses were very different. Quantitatively most intensive odour and taste attribute had 4 and 3 cheeses, which were most acceptability for consumers in 100 mm scale rank their acceptability. The best cheese was 3, but consumers by acceptability ranked 4 cheese. These different we can to explain methods differences: then assessors ranking 3 attributes, their ranking appearances and consistency (third ranking), and acceptability test made assessors more attention intend for odour...|$|E

Inicialmente delineou-se o perfil dos consumidores de cafÃ frequentadores de cafeterias no municÃpio de Fortaleza, CearÃ - Brasil. Em seguida, para a definiÃÃo do blends de cafÃ espresso utilizou-se o planejamento {{experimental}} de misturas simplex centrÃide aumentado resultando em 10 tratamentos para 3 componentes. Os dez tratamentos foram submetidos a testes de aceitaÃÃo com provadores nÃo treinados, consumidores de cafÃ que avaliaram as amostras com relaÃÃo aos parametros aroma, cor, sabor, corpo e impressÃo global. As formulaÃÃes de blends para a bebida de cafÃ espresso selecionadas foram submetidas a testes de avaliaÃÃo da expectativa dos consumidores. Para a anÃlise dos dados sensoriais obtidos nas trÃs sessÃes empregaram-se tÃcnicas estatÃsticas descritivas, AnÃlise de VariÃncia Univariada (ANOVA) para a comparaÃÃo de mÃdias. Os resultados de aceitaÃÃo dos 10 tratamentos foram analisados atravÃs de superficie de resposta e Mapa Interno de PreferÃncia. O blend composto por grÃos de cafÃ de classificaÃÃo 100 % arÃbica tipo mole (amostra A) foi selecionado devido Ã possibilidade desse tipo de designaÃÃo gerar uma expectativas no consumidor de produto de boa qualidade. A seleÃÃo dos outros dois blends baseou-se nos critÃrios alto desempenho e baixo desempenho nos testes de aceitaÃÃo, respectivamente. A avaliaÃÃo da percepÃÃo sensorial e expectativa dos consumidores ocorreu em trÃs sessÃes: teste cego, avaliaÃÃo da expectativa atravÃs da embalagem e avaliaÃÃo informada. Cem consumidores de cafÃ participaram dessas avaliaÃÃes onde a aceitabilidade das amostras foi medida atravÃs de escala hedÃnica estruturada de nove pontos. Os testes foram aplicados no LaboratÃrio de AnÃlise Sensorial da Universidade Federal do CearÃ. Os resultados mostraram que a informaÃÃo 100 % arÃbica tipo mole influenciou na aceitaÃÃo. Com relaÃÃo aos blends de cafÃ arÃbica 50 % mole, 25 % duro, 25 % rio e cafÃ arÃbica 58 % mole, 34 % duro e 8 % rio, que alcanÃaram aos mais altos valores mÃdios de aceitaÃÃo no teste cego, nÃo conseguiram manter este resultado nas sessÃes de exposiÃÃo das suas embalagens e avaliaÃÃo informada. Portanto, a informaÃÃo na embalagem influenciou na desconfirmaÃÃo negativa da expectativa do consumidor com relaÃÃo Ã amostra 100 % arÃbica tipo mole. Dessa forma, as escolhas dos consumidores baseadas na aceitaÃÃo foram influenciadas nÃo somente pelas caracteristicas sensoriais intrÃnsecas das bebidas de cafÃ, mas tambÃm por suas caracterÃsticas extrÃnsecas, tais como as informaÃÃes composicionais fornecidas ao consumidor final e a embalagem do produto. The {{objective of}} this study was to develop different blends of Arabica coffee of types soft, hard and rio to espresso coffee and evaluate the sensory perception and expectation of the final consumer. The experimental planning of mixtures used was the simplex centroid for definition of the blends resulting in ten treatments. For soft coffee type the maximum and minimum limits were respectively 100 and 50 %, for hard and rio types the limits were 50 and 0 %. The ten treatments were tested for acceptance with untrained assessors who evaluated the samples with relation to aroma, color, flavor, body and overall impression. The formulations selected were submitted to the evaluation of expectation. The results of acceptance were analyzed using response surface and Internal Preference Mapping, resulting in the selection of three blends for the measurement of consumer expectations. The blend that consists of coffee from 100 % soft classification (sample A) was selected due to this type of designation generates an expectation in the consumer of product of good quality. The criteria used in selecting the other two blends were high performance and low performance in acceptance tests, respectively. The evaluation of the perception and expectation occurred in three sessions: blind test, evaluation of the expectation of the product with the exposure of the package and informed assessment (package + sample). One hundred coffee consumers participated in this assessment where the acceptability of the sample was measured with the hedonic scale of nine points. The tests occurred at the <b>Sensory</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of the Federal University of CearÃ. The analysis of the information of the three sessions occurred with the frequency histogram of averages, ANOVA and Tukey test at 5 % significance level. The results indicated that the information 100 % soft for the sample affected your acceptance. In the samples B (50 % soft, 25 % hard, 25 % rio) and C (58 % soft, 34 % hard, 8 % rio), which achieved higher averages in the blind test, could not maintain the results after the presentation of their packaging. Therefore, the information on the package influenced on the negative disconfirmation of consumer expectations with respect to sample A. Thus, the acceptance and choice of a product are influenced not only by their sensory characteristics (intrinsic), but also by its extrinsic characteristics (information and packaging, for example) ...|$|E

The aims were to define their optimal picking time and storage aptitude, therefore marketing advices could be given to growers. Methodological aspects have been investigated on different <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> parameters adapted to fresh fruits e. g. panel selection and formation, choice of descriptors. <b>Sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> was applied just after picking and periodically during the storage period. For each fruit sample, different characteristics were measured (brix, pH and flesh firmness) with the objective to calculate the correlation between <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> data and analytical data. The results show that for the Jonagold cv., there is a very high correlation between ""crunchiness"", ""flesh firmness"" and ""juiciness"" sensory evaluated data.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the use of saline water on morphophysiological responses and <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> of ‘Boa noite’ plants (Catharanthus roseus) in soil fertilized with bovine biofertilizer. A completely randomized design was used in the split plot arrangement, the plots being formed by the five irrigation water salinity levels (0. 5, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 dS m- 1), and the subplots by two frequencies of application of the 150 mL pot- 1 of liquid bovine biofertilizer (divided into one and five times), with five replicates. The analysed variables were: leaf gas exchange relative chlorophyll index, biometry, dry matter (leaf, stems, flowers and roots) and <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> (general appearance and buyers’ preference). Quantitative (growth and physiological) and qualitative (<b>sensory</b> <b>analysis)</b> responses show that Catharanthus roseus plants can be produced using saline water at the level of 2. 5 dS m- 1, and the plants of this treatment were preferred by the judges in <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis.</b> Biofertilizer application frequency did not attenuate the effects of salinity.

However, <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is the best way}} to precisely describe food eating quality, since it is able to define, measure, and explain what is really perceivable by human senses and using a language that closely reflects the consumers’ perception. On the basis of such observations, we developed a detailed protocol for apple sensory profiling by descriptive <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> and instrumental measurements. The collected sensory data were validated by applying rigorous scientific criteria for <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis.</b> The method was then applied for studying sensory properties of apples and their changes in relation to different pre- and post-harvest factors affecting fruit quality, and demonstrated to be able to discriminate fruit varieties and to highlight differences in terms of sensory properties. The instrumental measurements confirmed such results. Moreover, the correlation between sensory and instrumental data was studied, and a new effective approach was defined for the reliable prediction of sensory properties by instrumental characterisation. It is therefore possible to propose the application of this sensory-instrumental tool to all the stakeholders involved in apple production and marketing, to have a reliable description of apple fruit quality...|$|R
