40|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>stud</b> is {{used for}} joining the {{mechanical}} elements of a ball joint in the steering or suspension system of automobiles. Process sequence design for the manufacturing of a <b>ball</b> <b>stud,</b> highly dependent on experience-based trial and error, limits the productivity and competitiveness of the product in meeting {{the demands of the}} current market. In this study, an expert system for the process sequence design of a <b>ball</b> <b>stud</b> was developed based on the Windows environment on an IBM personal computer (PC) as part of building a computer integrated design system. The developed system was composed of the main design expert system, a database system, and a computer aided design (CAD) system. The design rules were extracted from the drawings from interviews with production and design experts, and from the literature. Initial standard process sequence design was determined by looking into the characteristics and constraints of each process in forming a product. Then this design sequence was modified by applying redesigning rules to accommodate the machine capacities, such as limiting sequencing number and:or the limiting load of the forming machine selected. The input and output modules for a graphical display were implemented in the developed system. The database system was separately formulated from the main design expert system to enable data sharing among the work places and to assist the engineers with the <b>ball</b> <b>stud</b> process design by checking the feasibility of re-using existing dies and drawings. The re-designed process data were saved in. dxf files for transferring the data to a commercial CAD system such as AutoCAD, from which the drawing can be obtained. The developed system was found to be useful in generating the process sequence of a ball stu...|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a rocker arm, finger, or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use rocker arms. Rocker arms are actuated by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual <b>ball</b> <b>studs</b> in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1800s}} {{techniques}} were {{developed for the}} mass production of iron nails. Following this technological improvement, boxwood <b>balls</b> <b>studded</b> with nails (boules clout√©es) were introduced {{in an effort to}} improve the durability of the balls. This eventually lead to the development of balls that were completely covered in nails, creating a ball that appeared almost to be made of metal.|$|R
50|$|Historically in the Indian Subcontinent, nose piercings {{are done}} by women only. However {{the spread of}} this fashion has {{resulted}} in {{both men and women}} having nostril piercings in the wider world. Several different types of nostril rings are found. Among the most popular are the loop, the stud with an L-bar closure, the <b>stud</b> with a <b>ball</b> closure, and the stud with a flat backing.|$|R
50|$|Cole's design {{borrowed}} the valve train design {{scheduled to be}} used {{at the time in}} the Pontiac V8. Internal GM rules at that time were that once an automotive division had introduced a technological innovation no other GM division could use it for a period of two years. The <b>stud</b> mounted independent <b>ball</b> rocker arm design patented by Pontiac engineer Clayton Leach was scheduled for introduction in the Pontiac 1955 V8. GM forced the Pontiac division to share its valve train design in Chevrolet's new 265 V8 in 1955, so that in the end both engines were introduced the same year with the same valve train design.|$|R
50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple valve assembly, consisting of two flow valves and a three-way valve. The triple valve assembly connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank. The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation <b>stud</b> includes a <b>ball</b> cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent. Both T-Stoff tanks are fitted with an inspection window.|$|R
40|$|Flip chip or {{wire bonding}} on highly {{sensitive}} low-k and ultra-low-k (ULK) BEoL-structures {{is an important}} issue concerning the thermo-mechanical integrity. To assess the thermo-mechanical stress situation in BEoL structures under the loading conditions of wire bonding and pull testing using Finite-element-analyses (FEA), a suitable approach is necessary. In particular, the phenomenon of friction at the bonding surfaces, the heat sources of friction and shock and vibrations have to be considered. These simulations together with experimental findings deliver essential insights into the stress situation within low-k and ULK BEoL structures during bonding and pull tests and, as it is a well described physical model, give basic measurable knowledge on the major factors influencing the thermo-mechanical reliability. Copper instead of Gold wire bonding is introducing much higher mechanical impact to underlying Back-end of line (BeoL) structures and actives like low-k and ultra low-k materials for (BEoL) layers of advanced CMOS technologies because of the higher stiffness and lower ductility of Copper compared to Gold. Increasing stiffness is also an issue for Copper <b>studs</b> replacing solder <b>ball</b> interconnects in the case of flip chip mounting whereby BEoL loading is increasing...|$|R
6000|$|The chapel {{having been}} founded, as stated above, in 1303, Giotto {{appears to have}} been summoned to {{decorate}} its interior walls about the year 1306,--summoned, as being at that time the acknowledged master of painting in Italy. By what steps he had risen to this unquestioned eminence it is difficult to trace; for the records of his life, strictly examined, and freed from the verbiage and conjecture of artistical history, nearly reduce themselves to a list of the cities of Italy where he painted, and to a few anecdotes, of little meaning in themselves, and doubly pointless in the fact of most of them being inheritances of the whole race of painters, and related successively of all in whose biographies the public have deigned to take an interest. There is even question as to the date of his birth; Vasari stating him to have been born in 1276, while Baldinucci, on the internal evidence derived from Vasari's own narrative, throws the date back ten years.[3] I believe, however, that Vasari is most probably accurate in his first main statement; and that his errors, always numerous, are in the subsequent and minor particulars. It is at least undoubted truth that Giotto was born, and passed the years of childhood, at Vespignano, about fourteen miles north of Florence, on the road to Bologna. Few travellers can forget the peculiar landscape of that district of the Apennine. As they ascend the hill which rises from Florence to the lowest break in the ridge of Fiesole, they pass continually beneath the walls of villas bright in perfect luxury, and beside cypress-hedges, enclosing fair terraced gardens, where the masses of oleander and magnolia, motionless as leaves in a picture, inlay alternately upon the blue sky their branching lightness of pale rose-colour, and deep green breadth of shade, <b>studded</b> with <b>balls</b> of budding silver, and showing at intervals through their framework of rich leaf and rubied flower, the far-away bends of the Arno beneath its slopes of olive, and the purple peaks of the Carrara mountains, tossing themselves against the western distance, where the streaks of motionless cloud burn above the Pisan sea. The traveller passes the Fiesolan ridge, and all is changed. The country is on a sudden lonely. Here and there indeed are seen the scattered houses of a farm grouped gracefully upon the hill-sides,--here and there a fragment of tower upon a distant rock; but neither gardens, nor flowers, nor glittering palace-walls, only a grey extent of mountain-ground, tufted irregularly with ilex and olive: a scene not sublime, for its forms are subdued and low; not desolate, for its valleys are full of sown fields and tended pastures; not rich nor lovely, but sunburnt and sorrowful; becoming wilder every instant as the road winds into its recesses, ascending still, until the higher woods, now partly oak and partly pine, drooping back from the central crest of the Apennine, leave a pastoral wilderness of scathed rock and arid grass, withered away here by frost, and there by strange lambent tongues of earth-fed fire.[4] Giotto passed the first ten years of his life, a shepherd-boy, among these hills; was found by Cimabue near his native village, drawing one of his sheep upon a smooth stone; was yielded up by his father, [...] "a simple person, a labourer of the earth," [...] to the guardianship of the painter, who, by his own work, had already made the streets of Florence ring with joy; attended him to Florence, and became his disciple.|$|R
