25|$|The <b>spokeshave,</b> is held {{horizontally}} by two symmetrical handles in {{line with}} the cutting edge of the iron. It has a very short sole, either flat, concave, or convex and is used for smoothing curved surfaces such as wagon spokes or tool handles.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawknife}} {{is commonly}} used to remove large slices of wood for flat faceted work, to debark trees, or to create roughly rounded or cylindrical billets for further work on a lathe, or it can shave like a <b>spokeshave</b> plane, where finer finishing is less of concern than a rapid result. The thin blade lends itself to create complex concave or convex curves.|$|E
50|$|There were 70 {{thin and}} bifacially worked blades, {{which had no}} cutting edges nor notches and stems. Choppers were heavier, cruder, and bifacially flaked with cutting edges. 82 {{coarsely}} flaked unifaces and bifaces were found, discarded or aborted roughouts or blanks. 147 scrapers which had one or more flaked chipped edges that created blunt working edges. Only two presented special preparation for hafting. 2 <b>spokeshaves</b> and 21 drills were also found. The drills looked more like artifaces than the <b>spokeshaves,</b> {{which seemed to be}} nondescript notches pieces of stone. The drills were found uniformly in all deposits.|$|R
50|$|Paleoindians in Florida used a large {{variety of}} stone tools besides {{projectile}} points. These tools include blades, scrapers of various kinds, <b>spokeshaves,</b> gravers, gouges, and bola stones. Some of the tools, {{such as the}} Hendrix scraper of the early Paleoindian period, and the Edgefield scraper of the late Paleoindian period, are distinctive enough to aid in dating deposits.|$|R
50|$|Removed flakes exhibit {{features}} {{characteristic of}} conchoidal fracturing, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures (small secondary flakes {{detached from the}} flake's bulb of force). Flakes are often quite sharp, with distal edges only a few molecules thick {{when they have a}} feather termination. These flakes can be used directly as tools or modified into other utilitarian implements, such as <b>spokeshaves</b> and scrapers.|$|R
25|$|The {{operator}} applies minimal, then most, then least {{force on}} the handles from centre toward the end grain. The work stock is reversed and same method repeated this time commencing a tiny distance away from centre so as to leave a coarse raised section. The coarse raised section where the two concave curves meet can be finished with a rasp, file, <b>spokeshave</b> or other tool.|$|E
2500|$|One {{works from}} {{the centre of the}} piece to the end, not the entire length all at once. The {{operator}} then reverses the piece in the shaving horse or vise and works from near centre to trim the [...] "fatter" [...] end to match the centre and just finished original [...] "skinny" [...] end. Final work can be done by <b>spokeshave,</b> sanding block or lathe.|$|E
2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the bandsaw, I use a Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool does about the same job as a <b>spokeshave</b> -- it can take {{off a lot of}} wood very quickly -- but I can use it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E
50|$|Today, the Lie-Nielsen Toolworks {{products}} {{compete with}} mass-produced tools from {{companies such as}} Stanley and Record, with sales {{in the order of}} 20,000 tools a year. The acquisition of the Independence Tool Co. in 1998 added hand saws to the product line, which has further expanded over the years to include over 50 different models of planes, in addition to <b>spokeshaves,</b> socket chisels, screwdrivers, marking and measuring devices and workbench hardware.|$|R
40|$|Amongst {{the various}} and {{more or less}} {{well-defined}} types of Tasmanian stone implements which have been engaging the attention of students for some time past, there are two distinct and decidedly specialised forms which stand out conspicuously from all the others as having been fabricated for certain definite purposes. In the following notes they will be termed respectively <b>Spokeshaves</b> and Borees, and it is proposed {{with the help of}} two or three plates to give a short description of several series which are fairly representative of the types...|$|R
60|$|Captain Guy was {{a gentleman}} of great urbanity of manner, and of {{considerable}} experience in the southern traffic, {{to which he had}} devoted a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however, in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite. He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand. He had on board, as usual in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, <b>spokeshaves,</b> rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread, crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.|$|R
60|$|Shavings of Wood.--Eight pounds' {{weight of}} {{shavings}} make an excellent bed, and I find I can cut {{them with a}} common <b>spokeshave,</b> in 3 1/2 hours, out of a log of deal. It is practicable to make an efficient <b>spokeshave,</b> by tying a large clasp-knife on a common stick which has been cut into a proper shape to receive it.|$|E
50|$|A convex, wooden, {{variant of}} the <b>spokeshave</b> is called a travisher.|$|E

5000|$|The lithical {{artefacts}} unconvered {{are very}} similar in character to those found at El Abra and Tequendama and consist of tools mainly made of chert from the Guadalupe Group. The tools comprise various kinds of scrapers, knives, perforating tools, burins, <b>spokeshaves,</b> maceheads and round mortars and flat milling stones. Most of the artefacts originate from the nearby chert, with some tools made from shales of the Villeta Formation and more allochtonous basalt tools, coming from farther west, around the Magdalena River, provenance of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. Apart from tools, Aguazuque is characterised by {{a large percentage of}} flakes resulting from the lithic reduction; the process of elaboration of the tools; in total 3868 samples, between 60 and 70 % of the lithic fragments found were of this type.|$|R
60|$|The interim {{closed up}} its {{perspective}} surely and silently. Whenever Grace had any doubts of her position, {{the sense of}} contracting time was like a shortening chamber: at other moments she was comparatively blithe. Day after day waxed and waned; {{the one or two}} woodmen who sawed, shaped, <b>spokeshaved</b> on her father's premises at this inactive season of the year, regularly came and unlocked the doors in the morning, locked them in the evening, supped, leaned over their garden-gates for a whiff of evening air, and to catch any last and farthest throb of news from the outer world, which entered and expired at Little Hintock like the exhausted swell of a wave in some innermost cavern of some innermost creek of an embayed sea; yet no news interfered with the nuptial purpose at their neighbor's house. The sappy green twig-tips of the season's growth would not, she thought, be appreciably woodier on the day she became a wife, so near was the time; the tints of the foliage would hardly have changed. Everything was so much as usual that no itinerant stranger would have supposed a woman's fate to be hanging in the balance at that summer's decline.|$|R
50|$|Shaving {{green wood}} with the {{drawknife}} or <b>spokeshave</b> {{along the grain}} is far quicker and easier work than turning across it. Skilled operators can produce very fine results with a drawknife and shavehorse, requiring minimal lathe finishing.|$|E

50|$|A <b>spokeshave</b> {{is a tool}} used {{to shape}} and smooth wooden rods and shafts - often for use as wheel spokes, chair legs (particularly complex shapes such as the cabriole leg), self bows, and arrows. It {{can also be used}} to carve canoe or kayak paddles.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the name}} [...] "horse" [...] suggests, the worker sits astride the shaving horse. The clamp is {{operated}} by the operator pressing their feet onto a treadle bar below.A foot-actuated clamp holds the work piece securely against pulling forces, especially as when shaped with a drawknife or <b>spokeshave.</b>|$|E

5000|$|McCaleb {{works out}} of a {{farmhouse}} in New Hampshire using a band saw, two-handled drawknife, and two-handled <b>spokeshave</b> to shape the fish, before filing, sanding and rasping them. A five layer paint takes six weeks, {{and there is a}} 12-month order backlog for the sculptures that start at $110 per inch and were described in Forbes as being so beautiful [...] "that your descendants will be gaffing one another to inherit them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prehistoric spokeshaves {{were made}} of stone. In archaeology, the term <b>spokeshave</b> is used to {{describe}} a tool, usually a uniface, that {{has at least one}} retouched lunate notch in one edge. In a sense, the term is a descriptive [...] "catch-all" [...] category, since {{it is difficult to determine}} if this was actually the way in which such a tool was used; the categorization is based entirely on the appearance of the tool.|$|E
50|$|A spoke {{is one of}} some {{number of}} rods {{radiating}} {{from the center of}} a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface. The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. A <b>spokeshave</b> is a tool originally developed for this purpose. Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials used.|$|E

50|$|Spokeshaves can be {{made from}} flat-bottom, concave, or convex soles, {{depending}} on the type of job to be performed. Spokeshaves can include one or more sharpened notches along which the wooden shaft is pulled in order to shave it down to the proper diameter. Historically, <b>spokeshave</b> blades were made of metal, whilst the body and handles were wood. An early design consisted of a metal blade with a pair of tangs to which the wooden handles were attached, as with a drawknife. Unlike a drawknife, but like a plane, spokeshaves typically have a sole plate that fixes the angle of the blade relative to the surface being worked. By the twentieth century metal handles and detachable blades had become the most common.|$|E
50|$|The National Archives Site is an archeological site at the National Archives {{facility}} in College Park, Prince George's County, Maryland. The site contains archeological remains from prehistoric settlements during the Late Archaic period, c. 4000-1500 B.C. Stone artifacts recovered through archeological testing {{indicate that this}} camp served {{as a place of}} stone tool manufacture and probably as a staging point for hunting and foraging. Physical integrity of the prehistoric component is high, with little plow disturbance or admixture with artifacts from other periods. The presence of a small number of other artifacts, including the projectile points, a <b>spokeshave,</b> and utilized flakes, indicates that the site also served in other hunting and foraging pursuits. It is one of a relatively small percentage of known prehistoric properties in Maryland with undisturbed archeological deposits.|$|E
5000|$|In current {{times the}} cabriole leg {{continues}} in use and more modern manufacturing techniques {{are applied to}} form this complex shape. In any case, the initial step is preparation of a template drawn on hardboard or cardboard. Structurally, the cabriole leg is weaker as the [...] "S" [...] shape is more accentuated or [...] "bowed"; in any case the cabriole leg must be fashioned out of a solid piece of wood, rather than laminate. Some of the initial rough turning is sometimes carried out using a lathe, but eventually a bandsaw is required due to the complex arc formations of the design. The next steps include application of a <b>spokeshave,</b> rasp and scraper. The bottom of the leg may terminate in a bun, ball or [...] "ball and claw" [...] rendition; Queen Anne style furniture characteristically uses the bun foot (also called pad foot). The small brackets are constructed from a separate piece of wood and either affixed by dowels or screws.|$|E
5000|$|Schnitzelbank {{literally}} means [...] "scrap bench" [...] or [...] "chip bench" [...] (from Schnitzel [...] "scraps / clips / cuttings (from carving)" [...] or the colloquial verb schnitzeln [...] "to make scraps" [...] or [...] "to carve" [...] and Bank [...] "bench"); {{like the}} Bank, it is feminine {{and takes the}} article [...] "die". It is a woodworking tool used in Germany prior to the industrial revolution. It was in regular use in colonial New England, and in the Appalachian region until early in the 20th century; it is still in use by specialist artisans today. In America it {{is known as a}} shaving horse. It uses the mechanical advantage of a foot-operated lever to securely clamp the object to be carved. The shaving horse is used in combination with the drawknife or <b>spokeshave</b> to cut down green or seasoned wood, to accomplish jobs such as handling an ax; creating wooden rakes, hay forks, walking sticks, etc. The shaving horse was used by various trades, from farmer to basketmaker and wheelwright.|$|E
