5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides.

5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} showed that many neurons in the adult rat brain possessed a perineuronal sulfated {{proteoglycan}} <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which reacted to cationic iron colloid and aldehyde fuchsin.

The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was usually expressed together with a nerve cell surface glycoprotein net detectable with lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin. These findings indicate that the perineuronal proteoglycan <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> is identical to Cajal's superficial reticulum and contains some collagenous elements.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} fine structure of the microvilli on jejunal and colonic epithelial cells of the mouse intestine has been made. The microvilli in these two locations demonstrate a remarkably similar fine structure {{with respect to the}} thickness of the plasma membrane, the extent of the filament-free zone, and the characteristics of the microfilaments situated within the microvillous core. Some of the core microfilaments appear to continue across the plasma membrane limiting the tip of the microvillus. The main difference between the microvilli of small intestine and colon is in the extent and organization of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat.</b> In the small intestine, in addition to the commonly observed thin surface "fuzz," occasional areas of the jejunal villus show a more conspicuous <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> covering the tips of the microvilli. Evidence has been put forward which indicates that the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> {{is an integral part of}} the epithelial cells. In contrast to the jejunal epithelium, the colonic epithelium is endowed with a thicker <b>surface</b> <b>coat.</b> Variations in the organization of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> at different levels of the colonic crypts have also been noted.

40|$|Neurons of {{cerebellar}} nuclei in the rat brain had {{a marked}} <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which was stained with cationic iron colloid or aldehyde fuchsin. Neurons {{with a similar}} <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> were also noted in the retrosplenial cortex. The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was stained doubly with cationic iron colloid and aldehyde fuchsin.

Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections revealed that the iron particles were deposited in the perineuronal tissue spaces. These findings indicate that the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> consists of sulfated proteoglycans which occupy, as the extracellular matrix, the perineuronal tissue spaces. Many neurons in the retrosplenial cortex were labeled with lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin. Double staining revealed that these lectin-labeled neurons are usually reactive to cationic iron colloid.

40|$|Giardia lamblia {{undergoes}} surface antigenic variation. The ultrastructural {{location of}} antigens on four different variants was studied by label fracture and immunocytochemistry with four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), {{each of which}} recognized the predominant variant in a particular clone. Each Giardia clone and its reacting MAb showed similar findings. The entire surface of the organism was covered by a <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which contained the variant surface protein.

25|$|B-72 is a {{thermoplastic}} resin {{that was created}} by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.|$|E
25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling <b>surface</b> <b>coating,</b> typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E
25|$|The species Trypanosoma brucei, {{which causes}} the disease, {{has often been}} {{subdivided}} into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Strains that infected humans {{were divided into two}} subspecies based on their different virulences: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense was thought to have a slower onset and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic, so the elucidation of the strains of T. brucei infective to humans requires a more complex explanation. Procyclins are proteins developed in the <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector.|$|E

25|$|SAMs are an {{inexpensive}} and versatile <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> for applications including control of wetting and adhesion, chemical resistance, bio compatibility, sensitization, and molecular recognition for sensors and nano fabrication. Areas of application for SAMs include biology, electrochemistry and electronics, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and everyday household goods. SAMs {{can serve as}} models for studying membrane properties of cells and organelles and cell attachment on surfaces. SAMs {{can also be used}} to modify the surface properties of electrodes for electrochemistry, general electronics, and various NEMS and MEMS. For example, the properties of SAMs can be used to control electron transfer in electrochemistry. They can serve to protect metals from harsh chemicals and etchants. SAMs can also reduce sticking of NEMS and MEMS components in humid environments. In the same way, SAMs can alter the properties of glass. A common household product, Rain-X, utilizes SAMs to create a hydrophobic monolayer on car windshields to keep them clear of rain. Another application is an anti-adhesion coating on nanoimprint lithography (NIL) tools and stamps. One can also coat injection molding tools for polymer replication with a Perfluordecyltrichlorosilane SAM.|$|E

A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by electroplating techniques.

If wear-resistant surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. Both methods normally use acidic chromate or dichromate solutions.
