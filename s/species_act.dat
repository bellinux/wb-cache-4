5|$|The {{birth of}} wolf pups {{so close to}} the state border raised the {{probability}} of a future long-term wolf population in California. In June 2014, the California Fish and Game Commission voted 3–1 to protect those wolves under the state Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Twenty-six {{amphibian}} {{species are}} found in Michigan, one of the fifty United States. These species include twelve species of frog, twelve species of salamander and two species of toad, {{all members of the}} class Amphibia. Blanchard's cricket frog, a subspecies of northern cricket frog, is considered to be threatened and two species, the marbled salamander and small-mouth salamander, are considered endangered; these are protected under the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of the State of Michigan. Two more species, the boreal chorus frog and lesser siren, are considered to be of special concern, although they are not protected under the act. There are no amphibians native to Michigan that are included in the federal Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as a focal point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> protections for orca. Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have had a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{great white}} sharks {{were added to}} California's Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b> From data collected, the {{population}} of great whites in the North Pacific {{was estimated to be}} fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism to be studied, commonly called the Brusselator, {{is an example}} of an autocatalytic, oscillating chemical reaction.

5|$|The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has 15 {{identified}} distinct population segments (DPS)s, in Washington, Oregon, and California. Eleven {{of these}} DPSs are listed under the U.S. Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act,</b> ten as threatened and one as endangered. One DPS on the Oregon Coast is designated a U.S. Species of Concern.|$|E
5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected by}} the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where manatees exist.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E

5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
5|$|Conservation and {{recovery}} plans for A. brownii {{have been proposed}} by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which administers the island of Nihoa {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. In 1996, the plant was listed by the FWS as an endangered species. In 2003, the FWS designated the island of Nihoa as a critical habitat for the plant and it was classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The plant is one of 51 endangered or threatened plants in the Hawaiian Islands listed under the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act,</b> and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the United States {{government}} {{listed the}} southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b> This community comprises three pods which live {{mostly in the}} Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in {{the population in the}} past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.|$|E
