40|$|Based on a {{critical}} ethnography {{of an urban}} high school that exemplifies the many changes of post-apartheid South Africa, this paper presents data about two teachers who propose opposing perspectives and practices of knowing students. The analysis of the teachers' narratives shows that they came to know their students through <b>solicited,</b> <b>unsolicited</b> and professional knowing processes. A surprise finding for successful teaching, {{in what may be}} considered difficult yet not uncommon conditions of schooling in South Africa, is that knowing about students can be dangerous, and that not knowing students can be useful for teachers.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{practices}} of international rating agencies and develop a framework based on the auditor independence model to understand the various rating agency methodologies. Rating agencies methodologies are classified as <b>solicited.</b> <b>unsolicited</b> or cooperative depending upon: (1) whether the rating has been requested; (2) whether the rating agency receives a payment; and (3) what information source the agency uses to form its opinion. These different methodologies will affect the level of independence the agency has informing an unbiased and objective opinion, and ultimately this will affect the acceptability of the rating. The unsolicited and co-operative rating methods allow for independence to be maintained because independence is largely driven by agency remuneration. Ultimately, the most acceptable rating methodology is the co-operative rating method because of the greater reliability of the information source that is used informing the rating opinion. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that the {{unsolicited}} ratings of S&P and Fitch are lower than the solicited ratings assigned by these two agencies. The unsolicited ratings of S&P and Fitch are based on publicly available information for a firm. However, no previous study has examined the unsolicited ratings of Moody's because Moody's does not disclose whether its ratings are <b>solicited</b> or <b>unsolicited.</b> Using Moody's <b>solicited</b> and <b>unsolicited</b> ratings collected from a survey of Japanese firms, we find that unsolicited credit ratings are still lower than solicited ratings even though firms with unsolicited ratings provide Moody's with some degree of inside information. We also compare the unsolicited ratings of S&P with those of Moody's and find that Moody's ratings are no different than those assigned by S&P although S&P's unsolicited ratings are based on public information. Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of the rating agency, unsolicited ratings are lower than solicited ratings because firms with unsolicited ratings provide incomplete private information to rating agencies.

40|$|A new reduced-dose tetanus–diphtheria (Td) vaccine was {{developed}} in Korea, and phase I and II clinical trials were successfully undertaken. We conducted this double-blind, randomized, multicenter phase III clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the new Td vaccine. Methods: Healthy adolescents 11 – 12  years of age were enrolled and randomized to receive the new Td vaccine (study group) or a commercially available Td vaccine (control group). Blood samples were collected prior to and 4  weeks after the vaccination. Between the study and control groups, seroprotection rate, booster response, and geometric mean titer of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus toxoids were compared after the vaccination. All <b>solicited</b> and <b>unsolicited</b> adverse events and serious adverse events during the 6 -week study period were monitored. Results: A total of 164 adolescents received vaccination, and 156 of them were evaluated to assess immunogenicity. The seroprotection rate and geometric mean titer for antibodies against diphtheria were significantly higher in the study group, whereas those against tetanus were significantly higher in the control group. However, all seroprotection rates against diphtheria and tetanus {{in the study and}} control groups were high: 100 % against diphtheria and tetanus in the study group, and 98. 7 % against diphtheria and 100 % against tetanus in the control group. No significant differences in the frequency of <b>solicited</b> and <b>unsolicited</b> adverse events were observed between the two vaccine groups.

AEs were recorded based on <b>solicited</b> and <b>unsolicited</b> questioning during a four-day period after vaccination. A total of 2541 questionnaires could be evaluated (95. 0 % return rate). Solicited self-reporting resulted in significantly higher (p> 0. 0001) rates of subjects with AEs than unsolicited reporting, both at baseline (18. 9 % solicited versus 2. 1 % unsolicited systemic AEs) and following immunization (29. 6 % versus 19. 3 % local AEs; 33. 8 % versus 18. 2 % systemic AEs). This could indicate that actual reporting rates of AEs with Epaxal((R)) may be substantially lower than described in the package insert. The distribution of AEs differed significantly between the applied methods of collecting AEs. The most common AEs listed in the package insert were reported almost exclusively with solicited questioning. The reporting of local AEs was more likely than that of systemic AEs to be influenced by subjects' sex, age and study centre. Women reported higher rates of AEs than men.
