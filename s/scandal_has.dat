25|$|Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the <b>scandal</b> <b>has</b> mostly overshadowed {{his legacy}} as a {{pioneering}} comedian. Following the trials, his films were banned {{and he was}} publicly ostracized. Although the ban on his films was lifted within a year, Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. He later worked as a film director under the alias William Goodrich. He {{was finally able to}} return to acting, making short two-reel comedies in 1932 for Warner Bros.|$|E

50|$|When {{patients}} {{are not at}} the centre of healthcare, when institutional procedures and targets eclipse local concerns, then patient neglect is possible. Scandals in the UK, such as the Stafford Hospital scandal and the Winterbourne View hospital abuse <b>scandal,</b> <b>have</b> shown the dangers of silencing the voice of patients. Investigations into these, and similar <b>scandals,</b> <b>have</b> recommended that the health service put patient experience {{at the heart of}} what it does, and especially, that the voice of patients is heard loud and clear within the health services.|$|R

2500|$|The scandal arguably {{affected}} the 2000 U.S. {{presidential election in}} two contradictory ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting vice president Al Gore said that Clinton's <b>scandal</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "a drag" [...] that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, and {{had the effect of}} reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said that the <b>scandal</b> <b>had</b> made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore's needed electoral votes regardless {{of the effects of the}} Florida recount controversy.|$|R

2500|$|The much-anticipated New York Times {{article on}} the Bogdanov <b>scandal</b> <b>has</b> appeared. Alas, it suffers from the usual journalistic conceit that a proper {{newspaper}} article must cover a [...] "controversy". There must be two sides to the controversy, and the reporter's job is to elicit quotes from both parties and present them side-by-side. Almost inevitably, this [...] "balanced" [...] approach sheds no light on the matter, and leaves the reader shaking his head, [...] "There they go again..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>scandal</b> <b>has</b> {{shocked the}} general public and ignited debate about sexual morality. The blanket {{coverage}} of the local press, their reporting style, and the appearance of photographs has also been met with public complaints to TELA. TELA suspected that at least two journals violated the Obscene Articles Ordinance, and sent copies of issue No. 936 of Next Magazine and issue No. 531 of the Oriental Sunday magazine to the OAT for classification. The Tribunal returned an interim classification of [...] "Class I", meaning the magazines were [...] "neither obscene nor indecent", and TELA demanded a full public hearing to review its decision. The OAT, the method of selecting its adjudicators, and the Obscene Articles Ordinance, came under fire. It reportedly classified Michelangelo's [...] "David" [...] as [...] "indecent" [...] by adhering rigidly to a definition.|$|E
2500|$|Environment: US {{authorities}} {{announce that}} German vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen had fraudulently installed ECU software designed to circumvent environmental regulations on emissions of NOx. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Volkswagen had {{for almost a}} year been denying that it deliberately gamed emissions testing, by suggesting that the discrepancies were caused by [...] "technical" [...] reasons. Questions have been raised about methods and accuracy of emission controls within the European Union and also if other European car-manufacturers had resorted to similar malpractice. Richard Corey, the executive officer of California Air Resources Board, revealed how they detected the scam: [...] "We conducted a series of tests that allowed us to expose the defeat device. There were some testing outfits in Europe that had conducted some tests that got our attention." [...] The <b>scandal</b> <b>has</b> been disastrous for Germany's image in export markets and comes {{in the run-up to the}} 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference scheduled to be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies do}} not provide a univocal answer {{about the effects of}} {{corruption}} on political attitudes and behaviour. Focusing on the relationship between corruption and political trust, in this article we explore whether real-world corruption <b>scandals</b> <b>have</b> a negative causal effect on trust in politicians; whether the impact of scandals decays over time; and whether corruption <b>scandals</b> <b>have</b> a weaker impact among the supporters of the party involved in the scandal. We address these questions through a natural experiment generated by the coincidence of the uncovering of a corruption scandal in Spain (the Bárcenas scandal) and the fieldwork of the European Social Survey. Given that the day at which survey interviews were conducted is as-if random, the uncovering of the scandal represents a unique opportunity to assess the causal effect of corruption on individuals’ trust in politicians. The results indicate that: (i) the corruption <b>scandal</b> <b>had</b> a substantial negative effect on trust in politicians; (ii) the effect of the scandal was stronger in the days following its disclosure; (iii) the effect of the scandal was independent from individuals’ partisan preferences...|$|R
