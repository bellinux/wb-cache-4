500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{there are}} thirty-five verses which mention salt. One of these {{mentions}} Lot's wife, who {{was turned into}} a pillar of salt when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem, he is said to have [...] "sown salt on it," [...] probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. [...] "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" [...] (Job 6:6). In the New Testament, six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus referred to his followers as the [...] "salt of the earth". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to [...] "let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" [...] (Colossians 4:6). Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary" [...] in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.|$|E

50|$|After some prodding, Alexei {{admits that}} he is in love with an English girl, a friend of de Croissant, Evangeline. Madame Arthur {{promises}} to introduce Alexei to Evangeline. Clarissa Parks, a cocotte, sees the Count and Alexei and tries to join the group. She is rebuffed by Madame Arthur, much to the chagrin of Count Mantalini.

60|$|Mercy started, {{and looked}} at Julian. He was still {{watching}} the slightest changes in her face. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> Horace.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{me quite}} distressed. Tears rose at once {{into her eyes}} with true Celtic suddenness.|$|E

[...] <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> WELLWYN, as if to draw his eyes to her, but he [...] is gazing at the picture; then, {{catching}} old TIMSON'S sour [...] glance, she grimaces at him, kicking up her feet with a little [...] squeal. But when WELLWYN turns to the sound, she is demurely [...] passing through the doorway.] ...|$|R
50|$|Teenager Kevin Khatchadourian is {{in prison}} after {{committing}} a massacre at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful travel writer, lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency in a town near the prison, where she visits Kevin. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her memories of him growing up {{as she tries to}} cope with the anger and hostility of her neighbors, who know she is Kevin's mother.|$|R
60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, {{after he had}} said that. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> at her mother, and sighed. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> Mr. Godfrey, and went on.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Godfrey, {{with what}} {{appeared}} to be a sudden pity for him. She went the length--the very unladylike length--of taking him by the hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> us {{from the}} door, and I had a last {{impression}} of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.|$|E

5000|$|The {{video was}} filmed in the UK, {{directed}} by Paul McGuigan who later directed the video for [...] "Signal Fire". The music video uses a split screen technique showing the couple very close together {{but at the}} same time far away from each other. Gary Lightbody is shown in a white interrogation room.

50|$|Grandma Conolly has her new {{television}} installed. Later, the woman {{sits down in}} front of it, and strange red lightning reaches out from the television towards her. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the screen, the lightning retracts back into the set and dances on the screen. The Grandma presumes that the set is broken, so she proceeds to hit it with her hands. The lightning shoots towards her face and she shouts for help. The television then shows a trailer for the upcoming coronation of Queen Elizabeth II...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> June, no {{smile on}} her lips; and with those great dark eyes {{fastened}} on her, the girl, for all her startled anger, felt something of the old spell.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Nairn {{gathered}} up {{one or two}} articles she had brought {{into the room with}} her and moved towards the door, but before she reached it <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Emmeline said something." [...] That accusation, as to [...] "encouragement," [...] so rankled in her heart, {{that when}} <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her grievances among the Tringles that always loomed the largest.|$|E
50|$|The {{next morning}} the {{authorities}} take Charlotte away, presumably to an insane asylum or possibly to a new home for herself. Many neighbors and locals gather at the Hollis home to watch the proceedings, believing that crazy Charlotte has murdered again. But some are very complimentary and sympathetic towards her.

The note contains Jewel's confession to the murder of her husband. As the authorities drive Charlotte away, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her beloved plantation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see a {{lot more}} than that. You don't know what an {{advantage}} it is to be as I am, rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible--negligible, that is the exact word--to them. YOU can't look at a woman for five minutes without losing sight of her in a mist of imaginative excitement. Because <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> you. I have the privilege of the negligible--which is a cool head. Miss Grammont has a startled and matured mind, an original mind. Yes. And there is something more to be said. Her intelligence is better than her character." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{trip was}} a fact now; no chance could rob her of it. <b>She</b> had <b>looked</b> forward twenty-three years toward it, and now <b>she</b> could <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it accomplished. <b>She</b> took up her burden again, never more {{thinking}} to lay it down.|$|R
6000|$|Rufus {{took her}} hand, {{and pressed it}} in silence. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him {{as she opened the}} door of her room. [...] "Don't {{distress}} Amelius," [...] she said; [...] "I can bear anything but that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Gudrun with dark, vacant eyes. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{him as if}} full of gratitude. These phrases of a dying man were so {{complete}} and natural, coming like echoes through his dead mouth.|$|E
60|$|She {{picked up}} her skirts and ran, ran so lightly and swiftly that Cecil, who was taken by surprise, had no chance of {{catching}} her. From the hall door <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him, panting behind.|$|E
5000|$|Rayna {{must make}} a {{decision}} whom to marry - Luke or Deacon. She goes through old letters Deacon wrote to her, albums and starts playing their song, [...] "Postcard from Mexico".

She also remembers a time that Luke was there for her. Rayna then goes to Deacon and tells him that she chooses Luke {{because they have a}} clean slate and that he is the safe choice.

60|$|Without {{a word in}} reply, {{without the}} {{slightest}} movement in her from head to foot, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. The blank stillness of horror was in her face. The deadly cold of horror was in her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} would,' thought Mary to herself, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him: 'what a {{quantity}} of kind, right feeling there in under that odd, dry manner, that strives to appear to love nothing but a joke.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{him from}} the corner of the Square, a straight, impassive figure in a little halo of soft light. There was a catch in her heart. Her companion's words were surely spoken in some foreign tongue.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{dared not}} <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her rescuer. Her head was bent, {{and her lips}} were murmuring half-audible words as she went.|$|R
60|$|Lightning {{sometimes}} fails in its effect, but the <b>look</b> <b>she</b> flashed <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{him from}} under her blue lashes seldom misses.|$|R
