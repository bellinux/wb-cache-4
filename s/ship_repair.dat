5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and <b>ship</b> <b>repair</b> businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk <b>Ship</b> <b>Repair,</b> General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, racial, political, and {{personal}} tensions led to Singapore seceding from Malaysia and becoming an independent country. With {{the end of}} the confrontation, the last Vbombers were withdrawn in 1966. The following year, the British government announced its intention to withdraw its forces from East of Suez. The Singapore Naval Base was handed over to the government of Singapore on 8 December 1968, and Sembawang Shipyard subsequently became the basis of a successful <b>ship</b> <b>repair</b> industry. The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 Galveston Island was {{claimed by}} the pirate Louis-Michel Aury as a base of {{operations}} to support Mexico's rebellion against Spain. Aury was succeeded as leader by Jean Lafitte, the famed Louisiana pirate and American hero of the War of 1812. Lafitte, at the time serving as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, transformed Galveston Island and the bay into a pirate kingdom he called Campeche. He established bases for smuggling and <b>ship</b> <b>repair</b> on the Trinity River near the bay and at Eagle Point (modern San Leon). His gang also created a hide-out {{on the shores of}} Clear Lake. As late as 1965, treasure from this era was discovered at Kemah.Kearney (2008), p. 177 In response to the piracy, the United States Navy ousted Lafitte from the island in 1821 and the colony was abandoned. Some settlers in the region remained such as Anson Taylor who had supplied produce and game from the Clear Lake area for Campeche.|$|E
5|$|Research done in {{the early}} 1960s by Norwegian {{explorer}} Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified a Norse settlement located at {{the northern tip of}} Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as L'Anse aux Meadows, is Leif's settlement of Leifsbúðir. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Later archaeological evidence suggests that Vinland may have been the areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was a <b>ship</b> <b>repair</b> station and waypoint for voyages there. That does not necessarily contradict the identification of L'Anse aux Meadows with Leifsbúðir since the two sagas appear to describe Vinland as a wider region which included several settlements. The Saga of Erik the Red mentions two other settlements in Vinland: a settlement called Straumfjǫrðr, which lay beyond Kjalarnes promontory and the Wonderstrands, and one called Hóp, which was located even farther south.|$|E
