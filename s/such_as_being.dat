5|$|An {{official}} {{remake of}} Metroid II, titled , was revealed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS at E3 2017. The game features 2.5D graphics, {{along with several}} gameplay improvements, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> able to aim in any direction and new abilities. The game was developed by MercurySteam, and was released on September 15, 2017.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of Force powers; light, dark and neutral. Light Force powers provide nonviolent {{advantages}} <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> able to restore health or persuade enemies to ignore the player. Dark Force powers are violent and give the ability to throw objects or choke enemies. Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> able to jump higher or run faster. There are fourteen powers in total, four of each type and a bonus power in each light and dark if the Jedi stays true to that path. Players earn stars to allocate toward Force powers by completing specific levels. By finding all the secrets in a level, players can also gain one bonus star to use. Between levels, the player can choose which Force powers to enhance by allocating stars to that power. Stars cannot be reclaimed from powers later on.|$|E
5|$|A version called High Five Netball is {{promoted}} by the All England Netball Association. It is aimed at 9- to 11-year-old girls and includes only five positions. The players swap positions during the game. When a player {{is not on the}} court, she is expected to help the game in some other way, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the timekeeper or scorekeeper. High Five Netball has four six-minute quarters.|$|E

5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E
5|$|Blood-C was {{designed}} to share only thematic similarities with earlier Blood projects. CLAMP was brought on board to both design the characters and help create the scenario. It featured several new elements to the Blood franchise, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> primarily set within a high school environment. The Elder Bairns were inspired by the Great Old Ones from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and modeled after traditional Japanese monsters. Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China. The series has received mixed to positive reviews from journalists.|$|E

5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Clementine cake is {{prepared}} {{with the primary}} ingredients of clementine fruit, ground almonds or almond meal, flour, sugar, butter and eggs. Additional ingredients can be used, such as orange juice, orange muscat, milk, white dessert wine, or Riesling wine, orange oil or tangerine oil (or both), almond extract and vanilla extract. Some variations exist, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> prepared {{without the use of}} flour. It can also be prepared as an upside-down cake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rounds}} before the final, the venue of each match is {{determined}} when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is named {{the home team}} and chooses the venue for the match, usually its own home ground. The venue may be switched {{to that of the}} away team or changed to a neutral venue for security reasons <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> unable to host a club with a large travelling fan base or the venue being unavailable.|$|E

5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from clogging up with snow.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not {{if he or she is}} merely under some other form of restriction <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> out on bail.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
5|$|These {{properties}} make it {{relatively easy}} to distinguish a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of the}} characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead have some of the characteristics of light metals, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cause}} is not clear, the {{underlying}} mechanism {{is thought to be}} either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> triggered by a viral infection. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.|$|E

5|$|While {{the music}} {{industry}} has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are {{much less likely to}} have positions of authority, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.|$|E
5|$|Aasiya Noreen {{was born}} and raised in Ittan Wali, a small, rural village in the Sheikhupura District of Punjab, Pakistan, thirty miles outside of Lahore. Christians in the district, and {{elsewhere}} in Pakistan, usually have lower class occupations <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> cleaners and sweepers. Noreen, who is a Roman Catholic, worked as a farmhand in Sheikhupura to support her family. She married Ashiq Masih, a brick laborer who had three children from a previous marriage, and had two more children with him. Noreen and her family were the only Christians in the village. Before her incarceration, she had been repeatedly urged by her fellow workers to convert to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E
