On those truly British occasions, the smugglers, if any, made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley, while this somebody pretended to do his something; and made a reality of walking out again {{as soon as he}} hadn't done it—neatly epitomizing the administration of most of the public affairs, in our right little, tight little island.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if <b>somebody</b> <b>came</b> and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the extent}} that Ignition were {{willing to go to}} control access to the album {{generated}} more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: [...] "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." [...] BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he {{received a phone call from}} Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, [...] "I had to go on the air the next night and say, 'Sorry, but we're not getting any more tracks.' It was just absurd." [...] According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, [...] " [...] made people despise Oasis within Creation. You had this Oasis camp that was like 'I'm sorry, you're not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You're not allowed mention the word Oasis.' It was like a fascist state." [...] One employee recalled an incident [...] "when <b>somebody</b> <b>came</b> round to check our phones because they thought The Sun had tapped them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23, 2002, McCain said that [...] "no American leader should be {{expected}} to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool." [...] During the 2006 Lebanon War, McCain said, regarding Israel's role in the conflict with Lebanon and Hezbollah, [...] "What would we do if <b>somebody</b> <b>came</b> across our borders and killed our soldiers and captured our soldiers? Do you think we would be exercising total restraint?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution (1999), {{journalist}} Susan Brownmiller quotes the Cornell activists who in 1975 {{thought they had}} coined the term sexual harassment: [...] "Eight of us were sitting in an office ... brainstorming about {{what we were going}} to write on posters for our speak-out. We were referring to it as 'sexual intimidation,' 'sexual coercion,' 'sexual exploitation on the job.' None of those names seemed quite right. We wanted something that embraced a whole range of subtle and un-subtle persistent behaviors. <b>Somebody</b> <b>came</b> up with 'harassment.' 'Sexual harassment!' Instantly we agreed.

She told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I didn't {{want to be the}} girl who posed in Playboy and then—by the way—made some music.

2500|$|On 16 April 2012, the {{day after}} the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos were {{released}} showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by Robert Ballard during an expedition led by NOAA in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to Titanics stern which experts called [...] "compelling evidence" [...] that it is the spot where <b>somebody</b> <b>came</b> to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them. The wreck of the Titanic falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the Titanic, and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.|$|E
