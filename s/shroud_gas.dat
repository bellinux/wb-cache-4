50|$|In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a {{high-power}} laser {{is used to}} melt {{metal powder}} supplied to {{the focus of the}} laser beam. The laser beam typically travels {{through the center of the}} deposition head and is focused to a small spot by one or more lenses. The build occurs on a X-Y table which is driven by a tool path created from a digital model to fabricate an object layer by layer. The deposition head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Metal powder is delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head or can be split by an internal manifold and delivered through nozzles arranged in various configurations around the deposition head. A hermetically sealed chamber filled with inert gas or a local inert <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> is often used to shield the melt pool from atmospheric oxygen for better control of material properties. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. The process supports a wide range of materials including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and other specialty materials as well as composites and functionally graded material. The process can not only fully build new metal parts but can also add material to existing parts for example for coatings, repair, and hybrid manufacturing applications. LENS (Laser Engineered Net Shaping), which was developed by Sandia National Labs, is one example of the Powder Fed - Directed Energy Deposition process for 3D printing or restoring metal parts.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{model of}} a methane-air counter-flow, non-premixed flame with a global reaction step for methane oxidation was developed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. A specific computational domain, and relevant thermodynamic and transport data calculated by the chemical kinetic code CHEMKIN, were incorporated into the model. The model was validated by comparing predictions with the spontaneous Raman scattered profiles of major combustion species reported in the literature. The model was employed to carefully examine the self-similarity assumptions normally invoked in simulating counter-flow non-premixed flames. It was found that while most assumptions were strictly satisfied within the jet region for the case of plug flow boundary conditions (B. C.) along the central axis, for the quadratic boundary condition case (corresponding to uniform plug-flow), assumptions were only approximately valid within the jet region. Also, the influence of <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> was examined by setting the surrounding gas as air and increasing the <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> through widening the <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> gap while maintaining a constant <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> velocity. Calculations revealed that, the resulting flames for <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> gaps greater {{than half of the}} jet radius, were totally insulated from mixing with the ambient air. The effect of buoyancy on the flame structures was also studied by comparing contours of the combustion products, temperature and turbulent properties...|$|E

Electrodes with dual-layer coating for alkaline water electrolysis were deposited on Ni-coated perforated substrates. Microstructure and morphology were studied by SEM.

Two different computational domains were used to avoid the difficulties that arise from the simultaneous solution of compressible gas phase and incompressible liquid phase.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Ultrasonic Consolidation (UC) is a {{manufacturing}} technique {{based on the}} ultrasonic metal welding of a sequence of metal foils which are bonded {{to one another in}} a layer by layer manner. It combines the ability of additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques to create complex three-dimensional shapes. Due to moderate applied pressures and the relatively low temperatures experienced by a sample during manufacture, UC operates as a solid-state process. UC could potentially enable the fabrication of smart structures via integration of sensor, actuator and reinforcement fibres within a single metal matrix. Previous issues with the optimal placement of fibres directly between foils during UC have been identified. Also, different types of integrated fibres require different UC process conditions and thus present complications when integrating them in combination. To truly exploit the full potential of UC for smart structure capabilities it is envisioned that a high volume fraction of dissimilar fibres are required to be integrated together within a single metal matrix structure. Research on a new method to consolidate fibres securely and more accurately during UC is presented. Channels created prior to UC within metal matrix composites are investigated as a method to aid the embedding of high volume fractions of different fibres in unison without damage. Initial research using a 200 W fibre laser as an enabling tool to create channels of specific geometry onto a previously UC processed surface is detailed. The research verifies that controlled channelling on a UC surface is possible and that channel geometry is dependent on: laser traverse speed, laser beam power, and <b>shroud</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate. © (2010) by the International Conference on Adaptive Structures and Technologies (ICAST) ...|$|E

Morphological and microstructural characteristics are presented. The basic mechanisms of marking/engraving and characteristics of the beam absorption are described. The effects of material texture, colour and laser processing parameters are reported. The work shows that engraving depths of over 2 mm (0. 75 mm for a single pass) can be achieved on marble substrates by thermal disintegration of CaCO 3 into loose CaO powder and CO 2 gas. Uniform amorphous glazed lines (1 - 3 mm line width) of a colour different from the untreated materials can be generated on clay tiles, ceramic tiles, roof tiles, clay bricks and OPC by solidification phase formation after laser melting of these materials.

40|$|About {{four years}} ago, work was {{completed}} on a 36 inch diameter gas to gas carbon ring seal used to buffer low pressure turbine {{air at the}} rim of the forward outer flowpath on the GE 36 unducted fan (UDF) engine. At about the same time, we were developing a long life counter-rotating intershaft air-oil seal of approximately 7. 6 inch diameter for operation at 800 fps, 800 F, and 50 psid. Although we were successful in meeting most program goals with a split ring seal of the axial bushing type, the seal with the greatest payoff in life and air leakage rates, bearing many features in common with the GE 36 seal, could not be successfully tested because of the structural weakness of the primary seal ring carbon material. This was a split ring seal using a hybrid combination of orifice compensated hydrostatic and <b>shrouded</b> hydrodynamic <b>gas</b> bearings. We are presently working to develop this design in conjunction with high strength materials being developed by Pure Carbon Co. In the area of engine secondary gas flow path-sealing for performance improvement, we are currently working with carbon and all metal face seals. A 15 inch diameter all metal 'aspirating' face seal, using self-acting hydrostatic bearings, was successfully tested to 700 fps, 100 psid, and 1000 F, demonstrating long life at flow reduction of 86 percent compared to a 'best' labyrinth. This seal will be developed through 1400 F, 900 fps, and 350 psid. The seal 'aspirates' closed at about idle speed pressure during engine start and reopens at engine shutdown. A hydraulic thrust balance seal, currently using orifice compensated hydrostatics, is under development. Other aspects of these projects are briefly covered...|$|R
