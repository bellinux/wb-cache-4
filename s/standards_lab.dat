50|$|Heath was {{incorporated}} as {{a village in}} 1952, with Direnth Morth being named the first mayor. Over the next decade Heath grew quickly, going from a population of 2,426 in 1960 to 6,066 in 1965, when it was chartered as the 196th city in Ohio. In 1986 it became {{the home of the}} first and only indoor shopping mall in Licking County, Indian Mound Mall. By this time population growth had slowed, to a total of 7,231 by 1990. Despite the large population growth on the western edge of Licking County, Heath remains the third largest municipality in the county, and one of only three cities. Heath was host to Newark Air Force Base, the seat of United States Air Force metrology.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows the}} use of optimal filter {{estimation}} for real-time data processing to automatically detect dynamic transient effects in phasor data produced in a synchrophasor vector processing systems. The optimal filters are estimated {{on the basis of}} phasor data where no disturbances are present and the estimation problem is formulated as a least squares optimization. Event detection bounds are computed from variance estimates and events are detected by formulating conditions on the number of consecutive samples for which the filtered phasor signals are outside of the bounds. Event detection is illustrated on the phasor data obtained from a microPMU system developed by Power <b>Standards</b> <b>Lab...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} reducing the X-ray diffraction data collection time, while maintaining high data quality, suitable for Rietveld refinement. The approach taken here is that phases in general show peak broadening {{as well as a}} loss of intensity with increasing 2 -theta. Thus, by splitting the full analyzed 2 -theta range into regions and adjusting the step-size and counting time to an appropriate level for each 2 -theta range (i. e., small step-size and lower counting time at the lower angles, and larger step-size and larger counting time at higher angles) the total analysis time can be substantially shortened. In these combined refinements, refineable parameters should be coupled across the data sets. The use of this method is illustrated based on analyses of two NIST <b>standards</b> (<b>LaB</b> 6 SRM 660 and Si SRM 640 c), and a laboratory synthesized cuspidine (Ca 4 Si 2 O 7 F 2) representing a more complicated phase. The proposed method cannot cut down the analysis time, to levels as those promised by never equipments, but it will reduce the time to half or less...|$|E
40|$|Primary air-kerma {{standards}} for 60 Co beams {{are based on}} graphite-walled cavity ion chambers. Most national air-kerma standards remained the same since the late eighties when they changed by about 1 % due {{to changes in the}} internationally agreed underlying physical data. During the nineties there was concern expressed that the measurement/extrapolation method used to determine Kwall, the correction for attenuation and scatter in the walls of the ion chamber, was wrong. The present consensus at the international level is that Monte Carlo calculations of Kwall for the graphite-walled cavity-ionization chambers are more accurate than the linear extrapolation technique that was used in establishing the existing standard [...] With the advent of clear experimental evidence from the PTB in 2001 that the measurement/extrapolation method was incorrect, many standards labs are re-considering their correction factors. Re-evaluations at NIST indicate that their 60 Co air-kerma standard will increase by about 0. 9 %, which they plan to implement during the year 2003. At NRCC, corrections resulting from calculated values of Kwall were already implemented. A change of air-kerma standard by NIST affects the calibration chain from the Primary <b>standards</b> <b>lab</b> through the Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratories (ADCLs) to the user. This is because the ADCLs maintain high-quality secondary standards that have NIST traceable calibration coefficients. They use these secondary standards to establish air-kerma standards in their own beams. If the NIST standard for air-kerma rate increases, then the secondary standards of the ADCLs will also increase. This in turn will increase the air-kerma calibration coefficient of the user’s ionization chamber by about 0. 9 %. If absorbed dose is determined using the TG- 21 protocol then an increase of NK by about 0. 9 % will increase the absorbed dos...|$|E
