40|$|South Sudan’s {{administrative}} boundaries {{stem from}} the colonial period. Since it gained independence in 2011, subsequent rounds of reshuffling of the political system, internal borders, and power relations have {{been a source of}} confusion, elite manipulation, and conflict throughout the country. This paper explores the impact of this confusion by focusing on multiple <b>shifting</b> <b>linkages</b> between administrative boundaries and identities and shows how the mobilization of ethnic identities has become central to territorial claims and creating territorial borders. We use three local conflicts in Central Equatoria State to illustrate how claims of belonging and entitlement are being used by elites for economic, political, and socio-cultural gains. The three cases also show how such manipulation increases the likelihood of ethnic division and conflict. Following the decision by the government in 2015 {{to increase the number of}} states from 10 to 28 in October 2015, further manipulation of borders and identities is likely to occur and could result in more violence, ethnic-based conflict, and human suffering...|$|R

40|$|Human geneticists are {{increasingly}} turning to study designs based on very large sample sizes to overcome difficulties in studying complex disorders. This in turn almost always requires multi-site {{data collection and}} processing of data through centralized repositories. While such repositories offer many advantages, including the ability to return to previously collected data to apply new analytic techniques, they also have some limitations. To illustrate, we reviewed data from seven older schizophrenia studies available from the NIMH-funded Center for Collaborative Genomic Studies on Mental Disorders, {{also known as the}} Human Genetics Initiative (HGI), and assessed the impact of data cleaning and regularization on linkage analyses. Extensive data regularization protocols were developed and applied to both genotypic and phenotypic data. Genome-wide nonparametric linkage (NPL) statistics were computed for each study, over various stages of data processing. To assess the impact of data processing on aggregate results, Genome-Scan Meta-Analysis (GSMA) was performed. Examples of increased, reduced and <b>shifted</b> <b>linkage</b> peaks were found when comparing linkage results based on original HGI data to results using post-processed data within the same set of pedigrees. Interestingly, reducing the number of affected individuals tended to increase rather than decrease linkage peaks. But most importantly, while the effects of data regularization within individual data sets were small, GSMA applied to the data in aggregate yielded a substantially different picture after data regularization. These results have implications for analyses based on other types of data (e. g., case-control GWAS or sequencing data) as well as data obtained from other repositories...|$|R

50|$|Mechanically, the carburetors were re-jetted in {{an effort}} to improve {{throttle}} response, especially in the low end, {{all the way up to}} the bike's 11,750 rpm redline. The redesigned camshafts were lightened and used internal oil ways to lubricate journals that, when combined with reduced tappet clearance, provided less friction and created less engine noise. The gearbox received a taller first gear, a hollow chrome-moly shift-shaft with an additional bearing and a completely redesigned <b>shift</b> <b>linkage</b> and foot pedal. These changes were aimed at eliminating problems with the transmission in earlier models, and to help to seamlessly transfer the bike's power to the road.|$|E
50|$|For 1966, the twin-cable {{shift and}} park control {{mechanism}} (a holdover from the push-button operation) {{was replaced by}} a solid <b>shift</b> control <b>linkage</b> consisting of a series of pushrods, rotating rods and levers. The rear pump was eliminated, which simplified and cost-reduced the transmission but rendered push-starting impossible; Chrysler engineers reasoned that improved electrical and fuel systems reduced the need to push-start vehicles, and safety concerns weighed against doing so. The gated shift quadrants also permitted the deletion of the reverse safety blocker valve which, in TorqueFlites made through 1965, had shifted the transmission harmlessly into Neutral if the Reverse position were selected with the vehicle moving forward above approximately 3 mph.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{analyzed}} 143 pedigrees (364 nuclear families) in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) {{data provided}} to {{the participants in the}} Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 (GAW 14) with the goal of comparing results obtained from genome linkage analysis using microsatellite and with results obtained using SNP markers for two measures of alcoholism (maximum number of drinks -MAXDRINK and an electrophysiological measure from EEG -TTTH 1). First, we constructed haplotype blocks by using the entire set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in chromosomes 1, 4, and 7. These chromosomes have shown linkage signals for MAXDRINK or EEG-TTTH 1 in previous reports. Second, we randomly selected one, two, three, four, and five SNPs from each block (referred to as Rep 1 – Rep 5, respectively) to conduct linkage analysis using variance component approach. Finally, results of all SNP analyses were compared with those obtained using microsatellite markers. Results The LOD scores obtained from SNPs were slightly higher but the curves were not radically different from those obtained from microsatellite analyses. The peaks of linkage regions from SNP sets were slightly shifted to the left when compared to those from microsatellite markers. The reduced sets of SNPs provide signals in the same linkage regions but with a smaller LOD score suggesting a significant impact of the decrease in information content on linkage results. The widths of 1 LOD support interval of linkage regions from SNP sets were smaller when compared to those of microsatellite markers. However, two linkage regions obtained from the microsatellite linkage analysis on chromosome 7 for LOG of TTTH 1 were not detected in the SNP based analyses. Conclusion The linkage results from SNPs showed narrower linkage regions and slightly higher LOD scores when compared to those of microsatellite markers. The different builds of the genetic maps used in microsatellite and SNPs markers or/and errors in genotyping may account for the microsatellite linkage signals on chromosome 7 that were not identified using SNPs. Also, unresolved map issues between SNPs and microsatellite markers may be partly responsible for the <b>shifted</b> <b>linkage</b> peaks when comparing the two types of markers. </p...|$|R

The upper cowl stay went from steel to aluminum, and the {{cylinder head cover}} went from aluminum to magnesium. The styling of the bike also became more aggressive: The independent dual lights became irregular-shaped multi-reflector lights known as [...] "fox eyes" [...] and the bike had fewer of the RR's unique fairing holes.

50|$|The {{popularity}} {{and performance of}} muscle cars grew in the early 1960s, as Mopar (Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler) and Ford battled for supremacy in drag racing. The 1962 Dodge Dart 413 CID L Max Wedge, for example, could run a 13-second 1/4-mile dragstrip at over 100 mph. In 1961 Chevrolet introduced the SS package on the Impala for $53.80, with included an optional 409 cu in v8 with 425 hp and upgraded brakes, tires, and suspension. By 1964, General Motors' lineup boasted Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, and Pontiac muscle cars, and Buick fielded a muscle car entry a year later. For 1964 and 1965, Ford had its 427 CID L Thunderbolts, and Mopar unveiled the 426 CID L Hemi engine. The Pontiac GTO was an option package that included Pontiac's 389 CID L V8 engine, floor-shifted transmission with Hurst <b>shift</b> <b>linkage,</b> and special trim. In 1966 the GTO became a model in its own right. The project, led by Pontiac division president John DeLorean, technically violated GM's policy, limiting its smaller cars to 330 CID L displacement, but the new model proved more popular than expected, and inspired GM and its competitors to produce numerous imitators.|$|E

40|$|It is {{essential}} to understand effects of existing and emerging anthropogenic stressors {{on the structure of}} aquatic food webs in more natural settings, to obtain realistic predictions on how they can affect major ecosystem properties and functioning. We therefore examined whether (1) realistic concentrations of key agricultural pesticides and nutrients induce <b>shifts</b> in trophic <b>linkages</b> (2) observed changes in trophic linkages are qualitatively different between the green (algal-based) and brown (detritus-based) part of the food web. To this end, we exposed a simplified, yet realistic freshwater invertebrate community to environmentally relevant concentrations of three anthropogenic pressures (eutrophication; the herbicide terbuthylazine; and the insecticide imidacloprid) in a full factorial mesocosm design. Trophic linkages and the changes therein were assessed measuring stable isotopes of natural carbon and nitrogen. Results show that the green and brown part of the food web react qualitatively different to interacting pressures. Whereas, herbivorous species react mainly to the nutrients and herbicides and the synergistic interaction between these, species in the detritivore part of the food web were affected by insecticide applications and interactions with nutrients. These results suggest that agricultural pressures can induce <b>shifts</b> in trophic <b>linkages,</b> but that they can have contrasting effects on the different parts of the food web. Such antagonistic and synergistic interactions can provide powerful explanations for observed responses of ecosystems to interacting stressors. These findings may have important implications for our understanding on interactions of agricultural stressors and their propagation in aquatic food webs...|$|R

40|$|How do {{countries}} {{respond to}} shocks from their major trading partners? This paper addresses {{the question in}} the context of the observed <b>shifts</b> in trade <b>linkages</b> between the Baltic countries and their major trading partners. Vector autoregression (VAR) models were used to examine the magnitude and sources of growth spillovers to the Baltics from key trading partners, as well as shocks from the real effective exchange rate (REER). Our results show there are significant cross-country spillovers to the Baltics, with spillovers from the EU outweighing those from Russia. Shocks to the REER generally depress growth in the Baltics, and this effect rises over time. We also find that financial and trade linkages are the dominant transmission channels of spillovers to the region, which explains the current realization of downside risks to the Baltics from the global slowdown. In general, therefore, these results suggest that the Baltics are susceptible to shocks from their key trading partners. spillovers, Baltics, vector autoregression, financial and trade linkages...|$|R
