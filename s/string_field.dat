40|$|Abstract: We {{extend the}} {{classical}} equivalence between the cubic and the non-polynomial open superstring field theories to the Ramond sector. To that end we find mappings between the <b>string</b> <b>fields</b> (NS and Ramond, including Chan-Paton factors {{and the various}} GSO sectors) of the two theories that send solutions to solutions {{in a way that}} respects the gauge symmetries in both sides and keeps the action of the solutions invariant. The perturbative spectrum around equivalent solutions is also isomorphic. We show that the gauge symmetry of the Ramond sector of the modified cubic theory suffers from collisions of picture changing operators. Our mapping works {{at the level of the}} linearized gauge transformation, which is well-defined. Nonetheless, the familiar form of the cubic theory is inconsistent and should be modified. Hence, at this level, our equivalence is only formal, since it relates a consistent theory to an inconsistent one. At the non-polynomial theory the Ramond sector is described using two constrained <b>string</b> <b>fields.</b> We introduce a cubic theory with two Ramond <b>string</b> <b>fields.</b> Without constraining these two <b>string</b> <b>fields,</b> the cubic theory has a regular gauge transformation, i. e., no collisions of picture changing operators occur. Moreover, it is classically equivalent to the nonpolynomia...|$|R

His current research is on the [...] "Planck Aether Hypothesis", [...] "a novel theory that explains both quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity as asymptotic low energy approximations, and gives a spectrum of particles greatly resembling the standard model. Einstein's gravitational and Maxwell's electromagnetic equations are unified by the symmetric and antisymmetric wave mode of a vortex sponge, Dirac spinors result from gravitationally interacting bound positive-negative mass vortices, which explains why the mass of an electron is so much smaller than the Planck mass. The phenomenon of charge is for the first time explained to result from the zero point oscillations of Planck mass particles bound in vortex filaments." [...] The theory proposes that the only free parameters in the fundamental equations of physics are the Planck length, mass, and time, and shows why R3 is the natural space, as SU2 is treated as the fundamental group isomorphic to SO3 [...] an alternative to <b>string</b> <b>field</b> theories in R10 and M theory in R11.

In {{addition to the}} usual bulk (closed <b>string)</b> <b>fields</b> and brane (open <b>string)</b> <b>fields</b> in the Type I string picture, there are closed <b>string</b> <b>fields,</b> namely, twisted modes, which are not confined on the branes but nonetheless are localized in the extra compactified dimensions. While the coupling of the Standard Model (brane) fields with a bulk mode (such as the graviton) is suppressed by powers of the Planck mass, their coupling to a twisted mode is suppressed only by powers of the string scale M S, which can be as low as a few TeV. This means these localized twisted fields can have important observable effects in the TeV range, including resonances in dijet invariant mass distributions in p̄p, pp→ jets + X. Given the current lower bound on the fundamental higher-dimensional Planck scale, the experimental effects of these twisted fields {{may turn out to}} be larger than the effects of virtual and real KK gravity modes.
