6000|$|The Englishmen treated {{this as a}} {{piece of}} genuine American humour, and {{returned}} to the charge with unabated courage. They owned now, that a person interested with them had been out to look at the property, and that they were satisfied with the appearance of things. They developed further {{the fact that they were}} not acting solely, or even principally, in their own behalf, but were the agents of people in England who had projected the colonisation of a sort of community on the spot, somewhat after the plan of other English dreamers, and that they were satisfied, from a careful inspection, that the resources and facilities were those best calculated to develop the energy and enterprise of the proposed community. They were prepared to meet Mr. Lapham--Colonel, they begged his pardon, at the instance of Rogers--at any reasonable figure, and were quite willing to assume the risks he had pointed out. Something in the eyes of these men, something that lurked at an infinite depth below their speech, and was not really in their eyes when Lapham looked again, had flashed through him a sense of treachery in them. He had thought them the dupes of Rogers; but in that brief instant he had seen them--or thought he had seen them--his accomplices, ready to betray the interests of which they went on to speak with a certain comfortable jocosity, and a certain incredulous slight of his show of integrity. It was a deeper game than Lapham was used to, and he sat looking with a sort of admiration from one Englishman to the other, and then to Rogers, who maintained an exterior of modest neutrality, and whose air said, [...] "I have brought you gentlemen together as the friend of all parties, and I now leave you to settle it among yourselves. I ask nothing, and expect nothing, except the small sum which <b>shall</b> <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> me after the discharge of my obligations to Colonel Lapham." ...|$|E

5000|$|The two {{assets in}} {{question}} were loans of equal amounts, which had an unusual condition: Ramsay Ltd. was entitled, once, {{to reduce the}} rate of interest on one loan, provided {{that the rate of}} interest on the other loan increased by the same amount. Ramsay Ltd. exercised this right, such that one loan became worth far more than its original value, and the other far less. The loan that had gained in value was disposed of {{in such a way that}} it was intended to be exempt from tax as [...] "debt" [...] (sec. 251 2 TCGA 1992: Where a person incurs a debt to another, whether in sterling or in some other currency, no chargeable gain <b>shall</b> <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> that is the original creditor or his personal representative or legatee on a disposal of the debt, except in the case of the debt on a security defined in section 132), while the loan that had fallen in value was disposed of in such a way that it was intended to be a deductible capital loss. Funding for the entire transaction was provided by a finance house, on terms such that the money would inevitably pass round in a circle, and back into their hands again, within a few days, with interest.|$|E

Given this, the study investigated the comfortability of the administrative officers working with inadequate fringe benefits. It also investigated factors that make administrative officers prone to voluntary turnover and gender composition of the affected personnel. The questionnaire was used to collect information from respondents (N= 231). Drawing from data retrieved from records, the study came out with 14 fringe benefits <b>accrued</b> <b>to</b> the administrative staff and 14 fringe benefits not <b>accrued</b> <b>to</b> them.

Recent changes to Section 8-8-10, Code of Alabama 1975, changed the rate of interest charged on judgments. As of September 1, 2011, the interest rate charged on past due child support arrears will be 7.5% per year. Child Support arrearage judgments that occurred between November 13, 1981 and August 31, 2011 <b>shall</b> <b>accrue</b> interest at the rate of 12%.
