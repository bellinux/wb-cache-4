40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Hume’s essay, ‘Of Eloquence’, {{should be read}} {{as part of a}} Scottish Enlightenment attempt to {{accommodate}} the sublime to commercial modernity. Hume inherits the sublime of ancient oratory not as a matter for narrow stylistic regulation - to be rejected in a new age of politeness, as <b>some</b> have <b>argued</b> <b>-</b> but as a moral problem at the heart of modern subjectivity. Hume looks to taste to regulate and contain the sublime, but it is Adam Smith who solves the problem of the sublime by recouping its excess as a mark of the possibilities for virtue in the modern age...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{research}} conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy. In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that <b>-</b> as <b>some</b> theorists <b>argue</b> <b>-</b> human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings. Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.|$|R
40|$|Surveillance {{for human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) in low- and middle-income countries started in the 1980 s. However, the questions of whether the results of HIV tests {{should be given to}} participants, and if so how, has still not been resolved. In the absence of effective treatment, it was considered acceptable to withhold results from HIV-positive participants. However, when antiretroviral treatment is available, <b>some</b> <b>argue</b> for beneficence <b>–</b> that it is the researcher’s duty to return the test results to all those who provide samples for surveillance. The corollary is that only participants who wish to receive their test results would be eligible to participate in surveys. Others <b>argue</b> for autonomy <b>–</b> that to obtain a more representative result for the general population, surveys should not exclude participants who do not wish to receive their test results. This round table discussion takes a closer look at those two arguments. We believe that the global community should work towards routine feedback of HIV surveillance while ensuring that participants receive and understand their test results...|$|R
40|$|The most general charge laid against Kant {{for many}} years was that of inconsistency. The aim of this thesis {{is to show that}} some of the {{greatest}} difficulties in Kant’s Ethics are due to his attempt to be too consistent - to his attempt to expound his moral theory in the metaphysical terms of the First Critique. That this attempt fails and that, nevertheless, the greater part of Kant’s moral philosophy is not thereby invalidated, is proof of the worth and strength of the latter. How far grounds for the rejection of Kant’s metaphysical system are provided by the incompatibility of this system with the most important field of man’s experience, is not here discussed. It must however be emphasised that far from Kant’s moral theory being dependent on the existence or reality of certain metaphysical entities, as <b>some</b> have <b>argued</b> <b>-</b> for example, G. E. Moore in “Principia Ethica” - Kant’s very attempt to establish the reality of his metaphysical world on moral grounds is one which can only be held a failure. But it is a failure to be contrasted with the success of his analysis of moral obligation and the authority of the moral imperative, which analysis does not require the phenomenal-noumenal distinction according to this thesis.

25|$|Fear {{of adverse}} Chinese, Soviet and public {{reaction}} also caused US policymakers to put numerous restrictions on American forces until comparatively {{late in the}} war. Plans drawn up by the military Joint Chief of Staff, US MACV commander General Westmoreland, and naval chief Admiral Sharp proposed bolder strategic action. This included airborne-amphibious landings north of the DMZ, corps-sized thrusts to liquidate enemy sanctuaries in the DMZ, Laos and Cambodia, a shutdown of incoming war material by mining the vital Haiphong harbor and more bombing of key targets in the Hanoi/Haiphong zone. All of these were rejected by civilian policymakers, {{with one or two}} implemented very late in the American War. By that time, the focus was on withdrawal of US forces. <b>Some</b> critics have <b>argued</b> that the Joint Chiefs in particular should have been more forceful in standing up to civilian leadership about their misgivings, but whether this would have made any difference is unknown. All of the more ambitious plans above had their own technical and political difficulties, <b>some</b> historians <b>argue</b> <b>–</b> including the threat of Chinese intervention, a repeat of the guerrilla warfare in the North as the Viet Minh did with the French, or other countermeasures by the North Vietnamese, who, in conjunction with allies such as the Pathet Lao, could have simply widened the war in Cambodia, Laos and even into Thailand as a reaction to American moves elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|With China's {{share in}} global trade {{increasing}} rapidly, <b>some</b> <b>argued</b> in 2002 <b>-</b> 2003 that China was exporting deflation {{to other countries}} as it was dumping cheap goods in mature markets. Later, others argued that China was causing sharp increases in global prices. This paper uses several econometric techniques to assess {{the extent of the}} link between inflation rates between China and the USA and Japan. Only limited empirical evidence at the aggregate level is found for consumer price inflation in China leading to price changes in the USA and Japan. However, {{there is some evidence that}} inflation in the USA has an impact on Chinese inflation. The results seem consistent with the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan being concerned about inflation and, hence, adjusting policy such that inflation shocks have no significant effect on overall inflation. Recent Chinese price rises are unlikely to have a material effect on the USA or Japan. Copyright (c) 2008 The International Monetary Fund.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Critical Social Policy and the definitive published version is available at [URL] is more than 25 years since the critical dialogue on young carers was {{played out in the}} pages of this journal (see Morris and Keith, 1995; Aldridge and Becker, 1996). Since that time, research evidence has given us a clearer picture of the extent of young caring in the UK and its consequences for children and families, including two new national studies that focus on the prevalence and impact of young caring in England. The introduction of the Care Act, 2014 and the Children and Families Act, 2014 also places new duties on professionals to identify and support young carers and their families. However, this increased focus, not only in policy and practice but also in terms of public awareness, has created a number of dilemmas and challenges for health and social care professionals, whose duty it is to identify and support young carers. These challenges, to a large extent, both mirror and advance issues raised in the original dialogue on young carers in the mid- 1990 s. They centre on the drive to generate data on the numbers of young carers to support policy directives and service delivery and, <b>some</b> have <b>argued</b> <b>–</b> in the current climate of serious fiscal retrenchment and cuts to youth services – on promoting the needs of one group of vulnerable children and young people over other groups of children in need. This article considers some of these challenges and dilemmas...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years an {{impressive}} quantity of studies have in fact focused on commercial companies and on mercantile trade. Using a range of approaches and forms of inspiration, these studies have identified these companies as the main agents in the globalisation process and, <b>some</b> have also <b>argued</b> <b>–</b> sometimes using a teleological method – in birth of capitalism itself, turning such companies into the forerunners of current multinationals and harbingers of present day economic developments. The book’s goal is to contribute to such debates {{through the use of a}} ‘Mediterranean standpoint’ also projecting into global spaces. The attention it pays to all practices, including breaking and avoidance of the law, players’ strategies, even within those aspects considered marginal and residual, conflicts, failures and opaque relationships between players and institutions, places this book within a Mediterranean world which was often described using the categories of delay and backwardness in the context of the triumphant, objective and impersonal economic categories. The hypothesis of the book is rather that such typically Mediterranean factors are central to globalisation processes and commercial developments in the modern world too. This is the book’s aim. The Mediterranean standpoint can reveal unseen and unexpected scenarios and act as an analytical tool for ocean-related events and comparisons between them...|$|R

Later, others argued that China was sucking in commodities and thus causing sharp increases in global prices. The theoretical literature so far has provided mixed conclusions regarding the strength of international transmission of inflation. This paper uses a number of econometric techniques to assess {{the extent of the}} link between inflation rates between China and the United States and Japan. It finds only limited empirical evidence at the aggregate level for consumer price inflation in China leading to price changes in the United States and Japan. However, it finds some evidence that inflation in the United States has an impact on Chinese inflation, consistent with the literature that argues that inflation is propagated from the reserve currency economy to other economies. In either case, the impact is short lived. At a more disaggregate level, there appears to be stronger sector-specific linkages between prices in China and in the United States and Japan, both for food and at the household level for manufactured goods.
