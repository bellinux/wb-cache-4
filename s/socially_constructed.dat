5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. That model considers production as a <b>socially</b> <b>constructed</b> human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is <b>socially</b> <b>constructed,</b> though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 How do {{organizational}} members <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> {{the shared}} {{meaning of a}} mandated change in the external environment? The opportunity {{to address this question}} presented itself when President Barack Obama set forth a goal for American community colleges {{to increase the number of}} students completing certificates and degrees by 5 million by the year 2020. As an external mandate, the explicit prioritization of completion is a relatively recent phenomena. This interpretive qualitative study explored the ways in which organizational members <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> the shared meaning of a change in the external environment by examining how community college faculty, as organizational members, construct the concept of completion. Phenomenology was employed as a guiding theoretical and methodological framework. Using saturation sampling, the self-reported perceptions of community college faculty were collected via audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcript data was subjected to a six-step process of inductive, constant comparison analysis, which yielded ten categories, or subthemes. These categories were further subjected to constant comparison, which yielded four major themes: external dictate, legitimacy, ownership, and enactment. External dictate confirmed member cognizance of changes in the external environment, and indicated that members are aware of the potential impact of those changes. Legitimacy and ownership confirmed the process of meaning making and provided insight into how that meaning is constructed. Enactment confirmed, as posited by Living Systems Theory, that system members act upon meaning in self-sustaining ways. The interdependent functioning of the four themes suggests that shared vision is system-generated as members, not only <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> changes in the environment, but also <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> the vision that ultimately constitutes the organization's transformation. These findings serve to inform our understanding of the role of shared vision in advancing organizational transformation. Leaders must acknowledge that system members <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> the meaning of change in the external environment. Furthermore, rather than attempt to establish a vision, astute leaders will <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> the vision in consort with system members...|$|R

40|$|This study {{adopts a}} {{qualitative}} approach to deconstruct the meaning of followership. Interviews were conducted with employees in various industries to examine how individuals <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> their roles as followers and to explore followership schemas and contextual influences that relate to these constructions. Results suggest that while some individuals <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> definitions around passivity, deference and obedience, others {{emphasize the importance of}} constructively questioning and challenging their leaders. With regard to personal qualities that are thought to make followers effective, major themes such as obedience, expressing opinions, and taking initiative were found to be most disparate across different groups of followers. Results also revealed that contextual factors may affect both followership constructions and behavior in the follower role. These findings have important implications regarding a need to examine the construct of followership in leadership research, as well as raise interesting possibilities for advancing an “expanded” view of leadership in organizations...|$|R
40|$|At {{the heart}} of this thesis is a desire to {{understand}} the evolving and situated relationship between humans and computers. Looking to a specific kind of computer at a specific moment in history, I analyze the ways in which advertising played a role in <b>socially</b> <b>constructing</b> an individual's relationship to the personal computer in the home. Based an analysis of over 500 advertisements in widely circulated magazines during 1984 - 1987, this thesis examines through emblematic examples how advertisements during this period positioned the personal computer as a domestic machine. In observing the means of <b>socially</b> <b>constructing</b> the personal computer in the mid - 1980 s, we come to understand the role and potential implications of advertising in <b>socially</b> <b>constructing</b> meaning, as well as gain a deep perspective on how the personal computer was constituted {{in the early years of}} its introduction into the home. Taken together, these advertisements present a portrait of a technology's evolution and begin to reveal how personal computers took on the meaning and place that they now occupy in contemporary life. Once embodiments of military and corporate de-humanizing control, computers are now accepted as evocative, social extensions of individual selves that represent individual freedom and power. With personal computers as our contemporary companions, at home, at work and in our laps, this thesis tells a history of how our relationship began. by Madeleine Clare Elish. Thesis (S. M.)

25|$|Multiple {{alternatives}} have advocates. The contrary constructivist position {{holds that}} human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by <b>socially</b> <b>constructed</b> and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is idealist, {{which holds that}} human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is essentialist, which holds that essential differences may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is relativist (Cultural relativism), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor {{more or less in}} accord with external reality.|$|E

Marketers have long been aware of the influence of peers on attitudes and this is a particularly important concept for subcultures which are socially oriented and experienced based.

25|$|Postmodernism {{describes}} a broad movement that {{developed in the}} mid- to late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture and criticism which marked a departure from modernism. While encompassing {{a broad range of}} ideas, postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality. Instead, it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or <b>socially</b> <b>constructed.</b> Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality.|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the multinational}} oil-company Shell’s decision in 1997 to establish Shell International Renewables. Theoretically the analysis contributes to developing {{the garbage can}} decision-making model developed originally by Cohen, March and Olsen (1972) by adding the production of organisational identities to the model. Within the scientific field of business and the environment the article contributes to {{a new understanding of}} the relationship between decision-making, green organisational identities and the process of social construction of business opportunities. This relationship can be of a sort, where the corporations’ greener organisational identities are the product of random organisational garbage can decision-making processes. In such processes the rationale that the protection of the natural environment {{can be viewed as a}} business opportunity gets into focus not before, but after the decision has happened. Thus, in the process of accounting for their decision the corporations are not just accounting for a particular decision, but also in a general sense contributing to <b>socially</b> <b>constructing</b> anew what can be considered a business opportunity – also for other corporations. In this process of <b>socially</b> <b>constructing</b> new business opportunities the corporations are drawing on cultural sources not just from the field of rhetoric of economics, but also from other cultural sources within the business sector and the society as such...|$|R

25|$|The 1894 Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act {{introduced}} {{regulations that}} severely limited {{the ability of}} the Cree, Dene, and Inuit peoples to access wildlife on their traditional territories. By the 1920s, Aboriginals were excluded from hunting and trapping grounds contained in Wood Buffalo National Park. The establishment of a game warden service in the park allowed for direct surveillance and supervisory control over Aboriginal hunters. As a result, the most basic elements of the Aboriginal subsistence cycle, including seasonal movements, fur trapping, and the gathering of food, were redefined as criminal activities through federal game regulations. According to historian John Sandlos, attitudes towards Cree, Dene, and Inuit hunters were <b>socially</b> <b>constructed</b> and flawed due to observer bias, racial stereotyping, and inaccurate reporting by park officials. Furthermore, Sandlos emphasizes that incidents of wildlife overkill does not undermine the right or ability of Aboriginal hunters to manage local bison populations in partnership with government experts.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of knowledge is}} the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the {{sociology of}} knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare <b>socially</b> <b>constructed</b> reality). The [...] "archaeological" [...] and [...] "genealogical" [...] studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploratory}} study {{of ways of}} talking about mental health. Drawing upon data collected from mental health service users in the Republic of Ireland, it employs discourse analysis within a case study approach to embellish three 'types' of service user identified in the sociology literature. Rather than being seen as specific types it is proposed that patient, consumer and survivor {{be regarded as a}} discursive typology which function as discursive resources for service users. The re-conceptualisation of these types, as discourses, allows the researcher to gain thicker descriptions {{of the ways in which}} service users <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> their own perspectives on mental illness. Through a process of discourse analysis, discourses of patients, consumers and survivors are extrapolated out from interview talk with members of mental health social movement organisations or groups. The identified discourses contain intrinsically different ways of talking about mental illness and allude to different conceptions of agency on the part of the service user. It is argued that they offer an insight into bottom-up social constructions of mental illness. It is proposed that these discourses suggest that notions of patients, consumers and survivors have entered the service users' discursive canon and that they are actively utilised by service users to <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> their perspectives on mental health. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Place is {{a setting}} for {{everyday}} life. Through processes of meaning making that {{are rooted in}} experience and interaction, places become meaningful and structure much of everyday life. Place is simultaneously a physical construction that gives it material form. Place is an object that is envisioned, designed, organized, redesigned, and reorganized. Often, the (re) creation of places is entrusted to professional placemakers, a population with decision making power over processes of physical construction. This research broadly identifies professional placemakers as a population whose professional work can affect change onto the built environment. The literature of place attachment provides strong testimony to the meaningful relationships {{that people have to}} built environments and physical forms. For example, the meanings and emotions that residents and stakeholders attach to their homes, neighborhoods, cities, and communities. Professional placemakers hold a degree of power over the built environment and can drastically transform the attachments that people have to place. This research explores the interaction of the social and physical construction of place by considering how placemakers <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> places in their professional work of physically constructing sites. I ask: how do professional placemakers form emotional bonds to the places they work to (re) create? And, what do those places mean to them? Primary data analysis of eight in-depth interviews with professional placemakers reveal that placemakers <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> places they work to (re) create in different ways. The data revealed two interacting themes – ‘for the people’ and pride. Further analysis concluded that some professional placemakers see place as a social territory that is unique with history, people, and problems; while others see place as a piece of the built environment that is the successful product of their professional work. While this research underscores the saliency of place attachment across populations by addressing a gap in the literature, these findings have implications for the professional field of placemaking in general. If placemakers are varied in the ways they <b>socially</b> <b>construct</b> the places they are charged to (re) create, what are the consequences for the places on which they work and the people who will live, work, or play in those places...|$|R

500|$|The novel {{creates a}} number of {{binaries}} between men and women. Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), portrays a fundamental binary between {{the male and female}} characters: the female characters act as an elite set of [...] "creators" [...] or [...] "educated, visionary, and predominantly female" [...] characters who provide the facilitation for evolution [...] "in existential terms" [...] of the male [...] "'collectors', whose traits are present in all of Fowles's flawed male protagonists." [...] Though acknowledging such binaries {{in the role of the}} characters, critic Alice Ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements. Rather, the binaries demonstrate what she calls a gendered [...] "scopic politics", or a politics created by a gaze (not dissimilar from the [...] "male gaze" [...] noticed in cinema studies), that constructs an artificial gender binary within Fowle's early novels (as opposed to a multiplicity of <b>socially</b> <b>constructed</b> genders). For Ferrebe, this binary creates a tension, especially with Sarah, who becomes a violently fetishised and objectified [...] "other", differentiated from the male characters like Charles.|$|E
