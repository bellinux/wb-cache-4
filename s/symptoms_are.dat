5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> present.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|Four motor <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} cardinal in PD: tremor, slowness {{of movement}} (bradykinesia), rigidity, and postural instability.|$|E
25|$|In one patient, the POIS <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> so severe, that {{he decided}} to undergo {{castration}} in order to relieve them. The POIS <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> cured by the castration.|$|R
40|$|The {{presenting}} {{symptoms of}} 167 patients with {{carcinoma of the}} rectum, sigmoid, and rectosigmoid were reviewed. The earliest <b>symptom</b> <b>was</b> a change in bowel habits and the most frequent <b>symptom</b> <b>was</b> visible blood in the stool followed by a change in bowel habits. The duration of <b>symptoms</b> <b>was</b> not related to survival or the stage of tumor found during surgery...|$|R
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> severe; and scores of 6 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R
5|$|Many people {{infected}} with HSV-2 display no physical symptoms—individuals with no <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> described as asymptomatic or as having subclinical herpes.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>are</b> normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
25|$|Carrying C. difficile without <b>symptoms</b> <b>is</b> common. Treatment {{in those}} without <b>symptoms</b> <b>is</b> controversial. In general, mild cases {{do not require}} {{specific}} treatment. Oral rehydration therapy is useful in treating dehydration associated with the diarrhea.|$|R
30|$|Treatment {{effectiveness}} {{was derived}} from the two objective and seven subjective symptoms, with the change from visit 1 to visit 2. Objectively assessed <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> mucosal hyperemia and swelling of the tonsils, which were assessed by a physician. Subjectively assessed <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> achiness/fatigue, loss of appetite, sore throat, cough, headache, hoarseness, and pain in the extremities which were assessed by the parent(s)/patient. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>were</b> rated using the categories “none”, “mild”, “moderate”, “severe” and “very severe”.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{hypothesized}} {{that exposure to}} contaminants would <b>be</b> associated with <b>symptoms</b> reported by office workers. METHODS: In two mechanically ventilated office buildings in. Montreal, the outdoor air supply was manipulated for 6 weeks, while <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> reported and environmental parameters were measured at multiple sites. RESULTS: Contaminant concentrations varied considerably, in part related to experimental changes in outdoor air supply. Eye <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> reported with higher dust and with higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. Mucosal <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> increased with higher TVOCs, higher nitrogen dioxide, and higher total contaminant load. Systemic <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> associated with higher dust levels. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms reported by the workers were associated with increased concentrations of several contaminants and a summary measure of all contaminants...|$|R
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
5|$|Some advise {{to avoid}} {{physical}} exercise {{if there are}} symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Symptoms</b> <b>are</b> {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>are</b> also {{dependent on}} the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
30|$|Depressive <b>symptom</b> among {{adolescent}} <b>is</b> prevalent but {{advisory service}} for this <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> limited, particularly in university.|$|R
30|$|Considering the covariates, {{gender and}} {{depressive}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> associated with quality of life. The male students presented better physical health than females. As expected, {{the increase of}} depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>was</b> related to the worsening of psychological, social, and environmental domains (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|Depending {{upon the}} genotype, ion {{toxicity}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> first visible in leaves 7 – 15 DAS. Initially, salt-induced <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> always {{restricted to the}} older leaves but increased progressively in severity and extent until only the most recently emerged leaves were unaffected (data not shown).|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of the <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently}} {{lacking in}} the elderly. The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a change in mental status, or fatigue as the only symptoms, while some present to a health care provider with sepsis, an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms. Diagnosis can be {{complicated by the fact}} that many elderly people have preexisting incontinence or dementia.|$|E
30|$|King [20] {{suggested}} that PCSS and PTSD symptoms {{can and do}} co-occur in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury. Results from our study indicated that PC and HC athlete’s scores of PC-TS 0 S and PTSD <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> significantly different between the groups. PC-TSS symptom scores of concussed athletes within 13  days of injury {{were found to be}} high (M[*]=[*] 19.52, SD[*]=[*] 19.51) [15]. Furthermore PTSD <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> present and significantly higher in the PC group post injury when compared to HC. Additionally the pre and post injury PC group’s TSS and PTSD <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> significantly different. Finally, The PC TSS clusters (migraine, cognitive, sleep and neuropsy) and PTSD <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> all found to be statistically higher at post injury.|$|R
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} susceptibilities of 78 {{strains of}} Clostridium difficile isolated from patients {{with and without}} gastrointestinal <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> determined and compared. Strains from patients with <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> more likely to show resistance to antibiotics. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains {{were found to be}} similar...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} 18 {{patients}} presenting with ocular psychosomatic <b>symptoms</b> <b>is</b> reviewed 10 to 18 months after presentation. All the patients had been discharged after the examination and reassurance {{given at the}} initial interview. In 8 patients symptoms had completely ceased, but 10 patients retained their symptoms. Transitory, self-limiting <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> more commonly associated with anxiety and occurred in the younger patients. Persistent <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> more commonly associated with depression and occurred in the older patients. Pain of the eyes, face, and head is conspicuous in both groups...|$|R
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>are</b> mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) {{at an average}} loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> {{abnormal}} weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E

40|$|Depressive <b>symptoms</b> have <b>been</b> {{associated}} to the Metabolic Syndrome. Nevertheless, {{only a few}} studies have evaluated anxiety and depression concomitantly. The objective of the research was to evaluate the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with Metabolic Syndrome and their relation to demographic variables. A unicenter, transversal study was carried out. A social demographic questionnaire <b>was</b> used. Depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> measured with Beck Depression Inventory and anxiety <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> measured with Hamilton Anxiety Scale Rate. A total of 103 ambulatory patients, 60 of them men, with mean age 55. 4 years (± 7, 6) with a diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome were included in the study. Anxiety symptoms of very severe intensity were present in 51. 5 % (n= 53) while severe depressive symptoms in only 5. 8 % (n= 6). Anxiety and depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> significantly associated. In this sample, anxiety predominated in relation to the depressive symptoms. The anxiety <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> more intense in women and that had low level of education...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E
5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> not often {{recognized}} {{as signs of}} HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.|$|E
