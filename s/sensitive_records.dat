40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} privacy-preserving data sharing, wherein only {{a subset of the}} records in a {{database}} are sensitive, possibly based on predefined privacy policies. Existing solutions, viz, differential privacy (DP), are over-pessimistic and treat all information as sensitive. Alternatively, techniques, like access control and personalized differential privacy, reveal all non-sensitive records truthfully, and they indirectly leak information about <b>sensitive</b> <b>records</b> through exclusion attacks. Motivated by the limitations of prior work, we introduce the notion of one-sided differential privacy (OSDP). We formalize the exclusion attack and we show how OSDP protects against it. OSDP offers differential privacy like guarantees, but only to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>records.</b> OSDP allows the truthful release of a subset of the non-sensitive records. The sample can be used to support applications that must output true data, and is well suited for publishing complex types of data, e. g. trajectories. Though some non-sensitive records are suppressed to avoid exclusion attacks, our experiments show that the suppression results in a small loss in utility in most cases. Additionally, we present a recipe for turning DP mechanisms for answering counting queries into OSDP techniques for the same task. Our OSDP algorithms leverage the presence of non-sensitive records and are able to offer up to a 25 x improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art DP-solutions...|$|E

40|$|We report <b>sensitive</b> <b>recording</b> of {{membrane}} potential in single dendritic spines in cortical neurons within a brain slice using two-photon excitation and a new, fluorinated, intracellularly loaded organic dye, di- 2 -AN(F) EPPTEA. With a two-photon excitation wavelength of 1060  nm, we achieve voltage sensitivity of > 16 % change in fluorescence per 100  mV. By targeting single spines in single-voxel recordings, we attain excellent single/noise quality, with back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) visible in single sweeps while recording at 10 kHz. This recording rate {{allows us to}} reliably assess fast bAP dynamics on single sweeps including bAP rise times of 0. 5  ms. The amplitude and propagation delays of the bAPs are similar among different spines located within the same dendritic region, and this is true despite large differences in spine size.

40|$|To date {{most studies}} of {{long-term}} tropical cyclone records from beach ridge plains (coral, shell and sand) {{have suggested that}} there has been little variation in the intensity of these events over the late Holocene. This study, of a sand beach ridge plain in northeast Queensland, Australia, using sedimentary analysis and luminescence chronology, suggests there has been considerable variation in both the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones here since the mid-Holocene. Most of the previous beach ridge studies have been of relatively uniform elevation coral shingle, shell and sand beach ridges within the plain. Here, at Rockingham Bay the sediments are composed of coarse-grained sand and there is considerable variation in ridge height and the number of ridges emplaced over different time intervals. It may be that pure sand ridges provide a more <b>sensitive</b> <b>record</b> of variations in long-term tropical cyclone climatology which in turn may contribute to a considerably improved understanding of the behaviour of this natural hazard...|$|R
40|$|The rock {{magnetic}} {{properties of the}} Chinese loess and paleosols constitute a unique and <b>sensitive</b> <b>record</b> of East Asian paleoclimate through the Quaternary Period. Systematic variations in the concentration and grain size of the magnetic minerals in these sediments have produced systematic variations in the magnetic susceptibility signal, which can be easily and rapidly measured at many sites across the Loess Plateau. Variations in many other rock {{magnetic properties}} {{can be used to}} identify the key shifts in ferrimagnetic grain size, but magnetic susceptibility alone is sufficiently <b>sensitive</b> to <b>record</b> stadial and interstadial climate stages, as well as glaciations and interglaciations. Past changes in rainfall and monsoon activity for this region are reconstructed from the susceptibility variations. The susceptibility record is calibrated using the modern relationship between rainfall and pedogenic susceptibility on the Loess Plateau. Our rainfall reconstructions identify enhanced summer monsoonal activity in the Chinese Loess Plateau region in the early Holocene and the last interglaciation. In the presently semiarid western area of the plateau, annual precipitation in interglacial times was up to 80 % higher than at present; in the more humid southern and eastern areas, values were up to 20 % higher than today's levels. During the last glaciation, precipitation decreased across the entire plateau, typically by 25 %. The relationship between pedogenic susceptibility, climate, and weathering age was examined over the Northern Hemisphere temperate zone and the observed positive correlation between rainfall and susceptibility indicates that climate, rather than soil age, is the predominant factor that controls pedogenic susceptibility enhancement in loess soils...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the near}} future, brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) applications for non-disabled users will require multimodal interaction and tolerance to dynamic environment. However, this {{conflicts with the}} highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>recording</b> techniques used for BCIs, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques are required to decorrelate desired brain signals from the rest. This paper proposes a signal processing pipeline and two classification methods suitable for multiclass EEG analysis. The methods were tested in an experiment on separating left/right hand imagery in presence/absence of speech. The analyses showed {{that the presence of}} speech during motor imagery did not affect the classification accuracy significantly and regardless of the presence of speech, the proposed methods were able to separate left and right hand imagery with an accuracy of 60 %. The best overall accuracy achieved for the 5 -class separation of all the tasks was 47 % and both proposed methods performed equally well. In addition, the analysis of event-related spectral power changes revealed characteristics related to motor imagery and speech. I...|$|R
