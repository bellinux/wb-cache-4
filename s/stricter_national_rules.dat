40|$|The book {{approaches}} the substantive provisions on {{the abuse of}} dominance by undertakings, the relevant economic and historically rooted approaches, including EU competition policy goals after Lisbon, based on the German and Romanian legal context, competition enforcement and experience. It analyses the relevance of <b>stricter</b> <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> especially of non-dominant undertakings based on traders’ performance as a distinct field of law focused on the exploitative abuse as unfair methods of competition. It highlights how the Commission’s Guidance Paper included an incipient model of more effects-based competition law that departs from the static market structure focus on exclusionary abuse and focuses on harm and efficiencies. It also covers recent cases on the misuse of {{intellectual and industrial property}} rights, including unified standards and smaller businesses, and explains the thin borderline between free and fair competition based on open markets and public policy, with innovation balancing respectively. The book gradually advances new interpretations of Article 102 TFEU to include dynamic competition and concludes with a developing Union trading law in need of a Regulation governing aspects of fair competition and relevant administrative criteria...|$|E
40|$|The Concrete Canoe {{competition}} {{began in}} the United States in the 1960 s, when a few ASCE student chapters began racing concrete canoes in small intramural races. It has since grown into a national event that draws more than 280 student chapters each year. Each canoe must be in compliance with very <b>strict</b> <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations, and is then scored based on four major criteria: Final Product (25 %), Races (25 %), Technical Paper (25 %), and Oral Presentation (25 %). This year, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Student Chapter at IPFW compiled {{the knowledge and skills}} of its members to complete a 20 foot long, buoyant canoe made of lightweight concrete. The canoe will be taken to the Regional 2011 ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition in Milwaukee, WI to compete against 15 other regional universities that have been participating in this conference for many years...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} signals that fiscal {{policies}} and institutional reforms give about underlying preferences for policy conduct in Germany and France. Results {{for a wide}} range of indicators mostly- but not always- confirm a first intuition that preferences are tilted towards rules in Germany, and towards discretion in France. At the same time, our case study also suggests that preferences are not fixed, and that fiscal policies and institutions may change as a result. In recent years, ongoing unsustainable debt developments seem to have inspired the introduction of <b>stricter</b> <b>national</b> fiscal <b>rules</b> both in Germany and France. It remains to be seen how constraining recent innovations in <b>national</b> fiscal <b>rules</b> will turn out to be in the course of the fiscal exit.

50|$|There {{must be in}} {{addition}} an appreciable restriction of competition for the rules to be applied. Otherwise, certain restrictions of competition may be permitted {{in accordance with the}} “de minimis“ Notice, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions in the Notice. The European Commission and the ESA give a definition of what is an appreciable restriction of competition in the Notice. The R&D agreements are horizontal agreements of minor importance. Due to this reason, they are not considered to appreciably restrict the competition when the parties' market share on the relevant market affected by the R&D agreement is under 15%. When the parties are actual or potential competitors, this rate is reduced to 10%. Nevertheless, there might be more <b>strict</b> <b>national</b> competition <b>rules</b> applied.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a number}} of economic and legal {{issues raised by the}} Appellate Body Report in the Thai – Cigarettes case. The paper suggests two improvements that could be made to panel procedures; supports the Appellate Body’s interpretation of Article XX(d) in the present case, which seems to discard an earlier mistaken approach to Article XX; and examines in some detail whether the Appellate Body’s application of the ‘less favourable treatment ” component of GATT Article III: 4 in this and other cases is consistent with its jurisprudence under GATT Article III: 2 and TBT Article 2. 1. From an economics perspective the case is straightforward on its face. However, the Appellate Body’s rigorous application of the “less favourable treatment ” principle might not survive a fuller market analysis in terms of policy impacts on conditions of competition. Further, while we agree with the rejection of Thailand’s Article XX claim we raise the question of whether a <b>strict</b> <b>national</b> treatment <b>rule</b> may be an unwarranted constraint on policy where there is a clear trade-related external cost to address...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an ecological}} Europeanization framework {{that provides the}} opportunity to determine the actual size of European and <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> stocks as objective measures of potential sources of external red tape drivers. We illustrate our ecological framework with the case of Dutch competition law for the period running from 1962 to 2010. Applying our framework, we infer the share of European rules in the entire <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> population, thus revealing {{what part of the}} <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> stock is Europeanized. We find that all rule stocks in our sample have increased drastically over time. Moreover, European rules have different effects at the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> stock level, depending on rule type. European rules serve as weak substitutes for Dutch formal laws, and as complements for Dutch secondary rules. We discuss how the ecological method of measuring external law evolution may inform future organizational red tape research specifically, and studies into formalization generally...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{quantitative}} {{assessments of}} the evolution of <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> have only rarely been conducted, leaving many questions ill-understood and unaddressed, particularly as to the features of rule stock evolution patterns. Can such patterns be traced, and if so, can the underlying causal mechanisms be identified? This article will address these questions. The premise is that forces endogenous to the rule system, inherent to any population of <b>national</b> <b>rules,</b> together with the demographic characteristics of rule makers, and the institutional features of the rule-making bodies jointly determine the birth rates of <b>national</b> <b>rules.</b> Given this key assumption, we offer a three-fold contribution. First, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates ecological with demographic and institutional theories {{of the evolution of}} law. Second, we describe longitudinal quantitative data concerning rule (birth) events within the domain of postwar Dutch higher education legislation. Third, we apply negative binomial regression techniques in order to estimate a comprehensive theory-driven model specification of the underlying drivers of <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> birth...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} case for harmonising some <b>national</b> <b>rules,</b> relating {{to the law of}} damages and civil procedure, which are applied to national proceedings for compensation of losses resulting from breach of Articles 101 and/or 102 TFEU. Before answering whether such rules should be harmonised, the dissertation examines the broad policy rationale behind private enforcement of competition law, its goals and limits. The findings are that private enforcement plays a positive role both to compensate antitrust victims and deter undertakings from breaching competition law. This provides a sound policy for harmonisation of private enforcement rules. Subsequently, the dissertation examines the main arguments against and for harmonisation. It is argued that {{the case for}} harmonisation is more convincing than the case against. Then, the arguments for harmonisation are tested in respect of some <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> that play a pivotal role in national competition law proceedings. Although few antitrust actions are brought, it is suggested that some <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> might not comply with the EU principle of effectiveness. In addition, even if such <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> did comply with this principle, the risk of forum shopping and the problem of excessive disparity of the level playing field are likely to materialise. Thus,harmonisation of private enforcement rules is desirable. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{interfaces}} between {{national and}} international law have significantly evolved due to subject-matter overlap between {{national and international}} law. The restriction of governmental authority by the ‘rule of law’ is no exception in this regard. International scholarship has so far largely examined the national reception of the international rule of law. Much less recognised is the international perspective: namely, {{as to how the}} international rule of law understands, accepts, or resists the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> of law. This paper examines the international reception of <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> of law practices within a specific regulatory context of UN targeted sanctions. Member states’ exercise of authority and the UN Security Council’s listing decisions bear resemblance to each other, which creates the conditions for the interfaces between the <b>national</b> and international <b>rule</b> of law.
