Suddenly, they found a <b>screen</b> <b>line</b> of Iraqi APCs straight ahead, barely [...] to the east.

5000|$|By abbreviating keywords, it was {{possible}} to fit more code on a single line (line lengths were usually limited to 2 or 4 <b>screen</b> <b>lines,</b> depending on the specific machine). This allowed for a slight saving on the overhead to store otherwise necessary extra program lines, but nothing more. All BASIC commands were tokenized and took up 1 byte (or two, in the case of several commands of BASIC 7 or BASIC 10) in memory no matter which way they were entered. And, such long lines could be difficult to edit. The [...] command displayed the entire command keyword - extending the program line beyond the 2 or 4 <b>screen</b> <b>lines</b> which could be entered into program memory.|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, {{establishment}} of cordon and <b>screen</b> <b>lines</b> for traffic volume studies is purely subjective, relying {{much on the}} political jurisdictions, natural boundaries or man-made barriers. Two conflict objectives are generally kept in mind in setting cordon and screen lines: obtaining as much and representative traffic information as possible and saving subsequent manpower requirement in data collection. This paper makes a first attempt to develop a systematic way for selecting cordon and <b>screen</b> <b>lines</b> for a given study area and road network. Two integer programming models are developed: one is to choose the optimal locations of a given number of survey stations to separate as many origin-destination pairs as possible {{and the other is}} to determine the minimum number of survey stations to separate all origin-destination pairs. Both models are solved by a genetic algorithm and illustrated with a numerical example...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Gravure {{printing}} {{has been}} applied widely in flexible packaging, building materials and other fields, and amount of ink transfer {{is an important factor}} to affect the printing quality and depends largely on the volume of the gravure cell. The volume of cell is affected by gravure process parameters such as <b>screen</b> <b>lines,</b> cell angle and engraving needle angle, so the volume of cell is calculated difficulty, and it is difficulty for the optimization of the gravure plate-making process. This paper presents a computing model calculating the volume of gravure cell. The cells for three kind of dot coverage rate are carved with 70 LPC <b>screening</b> <b>lines</b> and 120 ° needle angle, their opening length, width and depth are measured by cell measuring instrument, their relation is been found by MATLAB and the computing model is built to calculate the cell volume model. The results show that the computing model is suitable for different cell angle, and the cell volume depends the screening rules, cell angle, needle angle and the cell depth. If the depth for different dot coverage rate is measured the cell volume will be calculated...|$|R

The first experiment showed that the absolute value of time errors decreased as line length discriminability increased. Time errors depended on the length of the second comparison line. The second experiment showed that the important length was this one relative to the range of comparison line lengths rather than relative to the size of the display screen...|$|R

Layers of translucent oil paint are slowly built up. Oil can create fine glazes, transparent and slow to dry. As each layer builds up, they create effects of light and texture not possible with other painting techniques. This glazing technique is very {{similar to that of the}} artists of the Italian Renaissance, giving the paint a luminous quality.|$|R
