5|$|The ancient oracles of the prophets, {{delivered}} {{to us in}} the Scripture, declare this; the lives of pious men, who shone in old time with every virtue, bear witness to posterity of the same; and our own days prove it to be true, wherein Constantine, who alone of all that ever wielded the Roman power was the friend of God the Sovereign of all, has appeared to all mankind <b>so</b> <b>clear</b> an example of a godly life.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not <b>so</b> <b>clear</b> how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

25|$|While some U.S. policymakers, {{including}} Condoleezza Rice, {{have linked}} democracy promotion to achieving peace and security, the relationship {{may not be}} <b>so</b> <b>clear,</b> some scholars maintain, given that a level of instability {{is inherent in the}} democratization process in the short-run, even if a politically reformed Middle East in the long-term could be an asset for international security.|$|E

500|$|The Russians' own minefields were {{larger than}} had been expected, and <b>so</b> <b>clearing</b> them took longer than the Germans had planned. This delay was {{compounded}} by stiff resistance from the Russian navy; Deutschland was ultimately unable to lay her mines. Reports of Allied submarine activity in the area prompted {{the withdrawal of the}} German naval force on the morning of 20 August. Indeed, the battlecruiser Moltke had been torpedoed by the British submarine [...] the day before, though only minor damage was sustained.|$|R

25|$|The few {{expeditions to}} {{penetrate}} much beyond the Arctic Circle {{in this era}} added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not <b>so</b> <b>clear.</b> The makers of navigational charts, more conservative {{than some of the}} more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontiers of}} the empire were {{sometimes}} well known and therefore easy to mark, such as the dykes constructed between the royal demesne of the King of France and the Duchy of Normandy. In other places these borders were not <b>so</b> <b>clear,</b> particularly the eastern border of Aquitaine, where there was often {{a difference between the}} frontier Henry II, and later Richard I, claimed, and the frontier where their effective power ended.|$|E

The lintel of the Portland stone surround of the portico was inscribed 'Lending Library'. It was opened to the public in April 1902.

25|$|In the {{afternoon}} a variety concert, 'Pop goes Australia', featured musicians Normie Rowe, Bobby Limb, Rolf Harris and The Seekers. The entire 10-hour program was televised live and {{several hundred thousand}} people across Australia sat up through the night to watch it.

25|$|No further {{constitutional}} {{reform was}} proposed until Labour returned {{to power in}} a landslide electoral victory in 1997, when a second Scottish devolution referendum was held; as Labour's 1997 manifesto had promised to do <b>so.</b> <b>Clear</b> majorities expressed support for both a devolved Scottish Parliament and that Parliament having the power to vary the basic rate of income tax. The Scotland Act 1998 established the new Scottish Parliament, first elected on Thursday 6 May 1999, with power to legislate on unreserved matters within Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Although the Latin {{original}} has {{not come}} down to us, {{we have in the}} Actus B. Francisci et Sociorum Ejus, edited by Paul Sabatier in Collection d’Études (Paris, 1902, IV), an approximation to it which may be considered on the whole as representing the original of the Fioretti. That Ugolino was the principal compiler of the Actus seems certain; how far he may be considered the sole author of the Fioretti is not <b>so</b> <b>clear.</b> His labour, which consisted chiefly in gathering the flowers for his bouquet from written and oral local tradition, appears to have been completed before 1328.|$|E

25|$|Rumelia (or Trakya) {{refers to}} the region of Turkey {{which is part of}} Southeast Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, the {{northern}} part of Çanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). Folk songs from this region share similarities with Balkan, Albanian and Greek folk musics, especially from the ethnic minorities and natives of Thrace. Cypriot folk music also shares folk tunes with this region, e.g. the Çiftetelli dance. These type of folk songs also share close similarities with Ottoman court music, suggesting that the distinction between court and folk music was not always <b>so</b> <b>clear.</b> However, folk songs from Istanbul may have been closely influenced by its locality, which would include Ottoman rakkas and court music.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} layers of {{modeling}} {{are used to}} determine the long-term, or Time Independent, estimates of the magnitude, location, and frequency of potentially damaging earthquakes in California. The Time Dependent model is based on the theory of elastic rebound, that after an earthquake releases tectonic stress there will be some time before sufficient stress accumulates to cause another earthquake. In theory, this should produce some regularity in the earthquakes on a given fault, and knowing the date of the last rupture is a clue to how soon the next one can be expected. In practice this is not <b>so</b> <b>clear,</b> in part because slip rates vary, and also because fault segments influence each other, so a rupture on one segment triggers rupturing on adjacent segments. One of the achievements of UCERF3 is to better handle such multifault ruptures.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of the {{percentage}} of female sexual dysfunction attributable to physical factors have ranged from 30% to 80%. The disorders most likely to result in sexual dysfunction are those that lead to problems in circulatory or neurological function. These factors have been more extensively explored in men than in women. Physical etiologies such as neurological and cardiovascular illnesses have been directly implicated in both premature and retarded ejaculation as well as in erectile disorder, but the contribution of physiological factors to female sexual dysfunction is not <b>so</b> <b>clear.</b> However, recent literature does suggest that there may be an impairment in the arousal phase among diabetic women. Given that diabetic women show a significant variability in their response to this medical disorder, {{it is not surprising that}} the disease’s influence on arousal is also highly variable. In fact, the lack of a clear association between medical disorders and sexual functioning suggests that psychological factors play a significant part in the impact of these disorders on sexual functioning.|$|E

50|$|Class B {{airspace}} {{is generally}} airspace {{from the surface}} to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually tailored, consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once an aircraft enters the airspace. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft {{to operate in the}} area, and all aircraft that are <b>so</b> <b>cleared</b> receive separation services within the airspace.|$|R

25|$|When news began leaking {{that the}} three men were to be {{executed}} and a country-wide curfew would be imposed at 11:00 PM, Paglin was at a movie. After being called out and told the news, he hurried to Begin's safe house, where he was meeting with members of his high command, where doubts were being raised over the feasibility of hanging the sergeants with the British and Haganah on high alert. Paglin, {{who had not been}} allowed to venture into British-controlled areas by the high command for the previous six months, asked to take personal charge of the operation. He was convinced that the sergeants could be hanged inside the plant, and the bodies could be moved to an orange grove and hung there, since attempting to move the two alive would be too great a risk. Since the hangings were meant as a 'lesson for all to see', Irgun wanted the bodies hung up in public. That was <b>so</b> <b>clear</b> that the mayor of Tel Aviv, Yisrael Rokah, feared Irgun would hang them in the city's main square, while in Netanya it was feared that they would be hanged on local lamp posts. Begin approved Paglin's plan. Paglin then slipped {{out of the house and}} drove to Netanya in his car, where he collected four Irgun men; Benjamin Kaplan, Yoel Kimchi, Avraham Rubin, and Yosef Meller. They arrived at the diamond plant in the afternoon.|$|E

500|$|.....I {{began to}} read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be {{shattered}} and battered and splintered at a single stroke. The writings of Bellamy and Blatchford early appealed to me.
