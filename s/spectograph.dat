40|$|The European Space Agency ESA aspires the {{exploration}} of the universe using space-borne infrared telescopes with large aperture operating at cryogenic temperature. The Herschel space telescope is currently returning its first scientific observations orbiting from the Lagrange point L 2 and the foreseen infrared observatory Spica is currently under study. The large diameter of the primary mirrors and the operation at cryogenic temperature require the use of ultra stable materials and wellcharacterised dimensional change of the structure as function of temperature. Dimensional stability and high precision data on the thermal expansion is also relevant for the cryogenic <b>spectographs</b> MIRI and NIRspec on the James Webb Space Telescope JWST, for high-precision laser interferometer LISA and for spacecraft sent to a hot environment such as BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter. Although European industry has proven effective at designing and building thermally stable structures, problems have been encountered in measuring the absolute CTE of stable materials. In one recent mission, the design CTE had to be changed 6 times over a 2 year period and when the telescope was tested in cryogenic conditions, an error was found in the back focal plane of over a centimetre. It is an objective of ESA to determine the CTE of stable materials continuously as function of temperature with an uncertainty of 3 ppb/K down to a temperature of 5 K...|$|R

Photonic spectrographs [...] 4. Experimental methods [...] 5. Free propagation zone studies [...] 6. AWG fabrication [...] 7. Conclusions & future work. This thesis studies {{the feasibility of}} {{femtosecond laser}} written array waveguide gratings (AWG) {{with an interest in}} astronomical applications. AWGs have recently been studied as a new integrated alternative to the current generation of astronomical <b>spectographs.</b> AWGs have the advantage of being small, robust and stable - all important factors sought after in astronomical instrumentation. One setback for the use of AWGs in astronomy is that current fabrication techniques are expensive and hard to prototype, making development of such devices difficult. This feasibility study has explored the possibility of fabricating AWGs using a laser direct write technique that is cheap and allows for fast design prototype. The femtosecond laser direct write technique uses a focused high powered laser to produce a localised refractive index change in a glass substrate which is typically used to form waveguides. To fabricate AWGs using the laser writing technique, the capability to inscribe large smooth planar waveguides that act as a 2 D free propagation zones were evaluated. Once a suitable slab fabrication method was established a laser written AWG proto-type was produced with initial output showing a degree of correlation to the theoretical output at a single wave- length. From this initial proto-type design improvements were made to improve the device, however initial results shows that laser written AWGs are highly susceptible to phase array error which could affect the feasibility of laser written AWGs. This initial study shows that laser written AWGs could have future applications in telecommunications and integrated spectroscopic sensors when phase errors are minimised.

Second, we find a much larger fraction of z~ 2 galaxies with weak metallicity gradients, contrary to the simple picture suggested by earlier studies that well-ordered rotation develops concurrently with established steep metal gradients in all but merging systems.

The H 2 emission shows (1) a bubble-like geometry to the northeast of the star, as briefly reported in the previous paper, and (2) faint emission in the southwest counterflow, which has been revealed through careful analysis. The emission {{on both sides of the}} star show an arc 1. ′ ′ 0 away from the star, exhibiting a bipolar symmetry. Different brightness and morphologies in the northeast and southwest flows are attributed to absorption and obscuration of the latter by a flattened envelope and a circumstellar disk. The H 2 emission shows a remarkably different morphology from the collimated jet seen in [Fe II] emission. The positions of some features coincide with scattering continuum, indicating that these are associated with cavities in the dusty envelope. Such properties are similar to millimeter CO outflows, although the spatial scale of the H 2 outflow in our image (∼ 150 AU) is strikingly smaller than the mm outflows, which often extend over 1000 – 10000 AU scales.

40|$|We {{describe}} an extensive search with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) for ultraviolet coronal (T> 10 6 K) forbidden lines {{in a sample}} of 29 F–M dwarfs, giants, and supergiants. Measuring coronal lines in the 1150 – 1700 A ˚ band with STIS has important advantages of superior velocity resolution and an absolute wavelength calibration compared with using the Chandra or XMM-Newton grating spectrometers to observe permitted transitions of the same ion stages in the kilovolt X-ray region. Fe xii 1242, 1349 (T 2 10 6 K) and Fe xxi 1354 (10 7 K) are well known from solar studies and have been reported in previous stellar work. A search for other coronal forbidden lines in the 1200 – 1600 A ˚ region was largely negative. The few candidate identifications (e. g., Ar xiii 1330 and Ca xv 1375) are too faint to be diagnostically useful.

40|$|Abridged] After many {{attempts}} {{over more}} than a decade, high-resolution spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of molecular absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in molecular bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to disentangle the planet signal from telluric and stellar contaminants. In this paper we apply high resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in the day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We observed HD 189733 b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared <b>spectograph</b> on the Very Large Telescope during three nights. We detect a 5 -sigma absorption signal from CO at a contrast level of ~ 4. 5 e- 4 {{with respect to the}} stellar continuum, revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154 + 4 /- 3 km s- 1. This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for stellar eclipsing binaries, resulting in Ms= 0. 846 + 0. 068 /- 0. 049 Msun and Mp= 1. 162 + 0. 058 /- 0. 039 MJup. No significant absorption is detected from H 2 O, CO 2 or CH 4 and we determined upper limits on their line contrasts here. The detection of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733 b can be made consistent with the haze layer proposed to explain the optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal incidence angles probed by our observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO absorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of CO 2 at 2. 0 micron is not inconsistent with the deep CO 2 absorption from low resolution NICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the absorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in this wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.

However, these abiotic planetary mechanisms modify the environment in potentially identifiable ways. Here we briefly discuss two of the most detectable spectral discriminants for abiotic O 2 /O 3 : CO and O 4. We produce the first explicit self-consistent simulations of these spectral discriminants as they may be seen by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). If JWST-NIRISS (Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph) and/or NIRSpec (Near InfraRed <b>Spectograph)</b> observe CO (2. 35, 4. 6 micrometers) in conjunction with CO 2 (1. 6, 2. 0, 4. 3 micrometers) in the transmission spectrum of a terrestrial planet it could indicate robust CO 2 photolysis and suggest that a future detection of O 2 or O 3 might not be biogenic. Strong O 4 bands seen in transmission at 1. 06 and 1. 27 micrometers could be diagnostic of a post-runaway O 2 -dominated atmosphere from massive H-escape. We find that for these false positive scenarios, CO at 2. 35 micrometers, CO 2 at 2. 0 and 4. 3 micrometers, and O 4 at 1. 27 micrometers are all stronger features in transmission than O 2 /O 3 and could be detected with sigal to noise ratios greater than or approximately 3 for an Earth-size planet orbiting a nearby M dwarf star with as few as 10 transits, assuming photon-limited noise.
