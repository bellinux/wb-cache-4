With a single {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) chip, mass data storage management, transmission, and synchronization of each part in real-time were implemented. To store a massive amount of data and transmit data with high bandwidth, a <b>serial</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>attachment</b> (SATA) intellectual property (IP) was developed on Xilinx Virtex- 6 FPGA. In addition, control of laser beam power, collection of status read back data of the lithography laser through an analog-to-digital converter, and synchronization of the positioning signal were implemented on the same FPGA. A data structure for each unit with a unique exposure dose and other necessary information was established. Results showed that the maximum read bandwidth (240 [*]MB/s) and maximum write bandwidth (200 [*]MB/s) of a single solid-state drive conform to the data transmission requirement. The total amount of data meets the requirement of a large-area diffractive element approximately 102 [*]cm 2. The throughput has been greatly improved at meters per second or square centimeter per second. And test results showed that data transmission meets the requirement of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{technique}} utilizing two-point (TP) modulation for a spread spectrum clock generator (SSCG) for <b>serial</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>attachment</b> {{is presented in}} which the divider ratio is varied by a digital Σ ∆ modulator, and the voltage-controlled os-cillator is modulated analogically. With this technique, the modu-lation bandwidth is enhanced in order that the modulation profile accuracy and jitter performance caused by the Σ ∆ modulator can be improved at the same time. The order of the Σ ∆ modulator and the loop filter {{can be reduced to}} save power and area, while the electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression still satisfies spec-ifications. The dual-path loop filter (DL) reduces the size of the loop capacitor and enables full integration. The proposed TPDL-SSCG has been fabricated in a 0. 18 -µm CMOS process. The size of the chip area is 0. 44 × 0. 48 mm 2. The circuit produces a clock of 1. 5 GHz with a down-modulation ratio of 0. 5 %, 10. 14 dB EMI of reduction, 5. 485 ps rms jitter, and 35 ps peak-to-peak jitter. The power consumption, excluding an output buffer, is only 15. 3 mW. Index Terms—Frequency modulation, phase-locked loops (PLLs), sigma–delta modulation, spread spectrum clock genera-tor (SSCG).

40|$|Speed, {{power and}} {{reliability}} of analogue integrated circuits (IC) exhibit temperature dependency through the modulation of one or several of the following variables: band gap energy of the semiconductor, mobility, carrier diffusion, current density, threshold voltage, interconnect resistance, and variability in passive components. Some of the adverse effects of temperature variations are observed in current and voltage reference circuits, and frequency drift in oscillators. Thermal instability of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is a critical design factor for radio frequency ICs, such as transceiver circuits in communication networks, data link protocols, medical wireless sensor networks and microelectromechanical resonators. For example, frequency drift in a transceiver system results in severe inter-symbol interference in a digital communications system. Minimum transconductance required to sustain oscillation is specified by Barkhausen’s stability criterion. However it is common practice to design oscillators with much more transconductance enabling self-startup. As temperature is increased, several of the variables mentioned induce additional transconductance to the oscillator. This in turn translates to a negative frequency drift. Conventional approaches in temperature compensation involve temperature-insensitive biasing proportional-to-absolute temperature, modifying the control voltage terminal of the VCO using an appropriately generated voltage. Improved frequency stability is reported when compensation voltage closely follows the frequency drift profile of the VCO. However, several published articles link the close association between oscillation amplitude and oscillation frequency. To the knowledge of this author, few published journal articles have focused on amplitude control techniques to reduce frequency drift. This dissertation focuses on reducing the frequency drift resulting from temperature variations based on amplitude control. A corresponding hypothesis is formulated, where the research outcome proposes improved frequency stability in response to temperature variations. In order to validate this principle, a temperature compensated VCO is designed in schematic and in layout, verified using a simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis tool using the corresponding process design kit provided by the foundry, and prototyped using standard {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} technology. Periodic steady state (PSS) analysis is performed using the open loop VCO with temperature as the parametric variable in five equal intervals from 0 – 125 °C. A consistent negative frequency shift is observed in every temperature interval (≈ 11 MHz), with an overall frequency drift of 57 MHz. However similar PSS analysis performed using a VCO in the temperature stabilised loop demonstrates a reduced negative frequency drift of 3. 8 MHz in the first temperature interval. During the remaining temperature intervals the closed loop action of the amplitude control loop overcompensates for the negative frequency drift, resulting in an overall frequency spread of 4. 8 MHz. The negative frequency drift in the first temperature interval of 0 to 25 °C {{is due to the fact}} that amplitude control is not fully effective, as the oscillation amplitude is still building up. Using the temperature stabilised loop, the overall frequency stability has improved to 16 parts per million (ppm) /°C from an uncompensated value of 189 ppm/°C. The results obtained are critically evaluated and conclusions are drawn. Temperature stabilised VCOs are applicable in applications or technologies such as high speed-universal serial bus, <b>serial</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>attachment</b> where frequency stability requirements are less stringent. The implications of this study for the existing body of knowledge are that better temperature compensation can be obtained if any of the conventional compensation schemes is preceded by amplitude control.

30|$|Controller layer. At the {{controller}} layer, {{there are several}} standardized interfaces that permit reading/writing of fixed-sized blocks. Similarly, there are no semantics of file system in this layer, thus {{the controller}} must sanitize every block to achieve secure deletion. To delete the data, sanitize commands and overwrite techniques are widely used in HDDs, e.g., secure erase commands offered by both SCSI (Incits: Scsi storage interfaces 2016) and ATA (Team work systems: <b>Advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>attachment</b> 2017).

50|$|The TI-99/4A {{maintained}} a cult following {{for years after}} its death in the marketplace, {{in part because of}} its eccentricities, and in part because TI had actively supported a network of user groups during the production of the machine. It eventually came to achieve a cult following among retro-computer hobbyists. In 2004 a Universal Serial Bus (USB) card and <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Attachment</b> controller for IDE hard disks for the PEB were released, and there is still an annual Chicago TI Fair where people congregate to celebrate the historic TI-99 family of computers. Third-party devices such as expanded memory cards, improved floppy controllers, and hardware ramdisks are very stable and popular additions to the machine, although there are no current known sources for these devices. In the early 1980s, a bulletin board system (TIBBS), developed by Ralph Fowler of Marietta, Georgia, running on the 99/4A became very popular and brought many users together. Also, a number of emulators for the TI-99 exist today for PC-based systems.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic Peripherals Inc., {{originally}} {{a joint venture}} with Honeywell and Honeywell Bull, became {{a major player in the}} hard disk drive market. It was the worldwide leader in 14 inch disk drive technology in the OEM marketplace in the 1970s and early 1980s especially with its SMD (Storage Module Device) and CMD (Cartridge Module Drive), with its plant at Brynmawr in the South Wales valleys running 24/7 production. The Magnetic Peripherals division in Brynmawr had produced 1 million disks and 3 million magnetic tapes by October 1979. CDC was an early developer of the eight-inch drive technology with products from its MPI Oklahoma City Operation. Its CDC Wren series drives were particularly popular with [...] "high end" [...] users, although it was behind the capacity growth and performance curves of numerous startups such as Micropolis, Atasi, Maxtor, and Quantum. CDC also co-developed the now universal <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Attachment</b> (ATA) interface with Compaq and Western Digital, which was aimed at lowering the cost of adding low-performance drives.|$|R
30|$|Application layer. The {{application}} layer can only interact with file system through a POSIX-compliant interface. A user-level application can securely erase {{all the data}} on the storage medium by invoking a secure erase command (Incits: Scsi storage interfaces 2016; Team work systems: <b>Advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>attachment</b> 2017) in the hardware controller’ interface. A few files overwriting tools, e.g, srm (Jagdmann 2015) and wipe (Durak 2006), {{can be used to}} securely remove files. Gracewipe (Zhao and Mannan 2015), as has been discussed in “PDE for desktop computers” section, can achieve secure and verifiable deletion of encryption keys through a special deletion password by taking advantage of TPM and Intel TXT, thus making the encrypted data permanently inaccessible. In the case of database, there is also a secure deletion interface, which can be used to overwrite data with zeros in the underlying file system. For MySQL, (Stahlberg et al. 2007) proposed an approach to delete entries by overwriting them with zeros, and the transaction log is encrypted and can be securely disposed by deleting the encryption key. For SQLite (SQLite: Pragma statements 2017), there is a compile-time option to enable a secure deletion feature that overwrites deleted records with zeros.|$|R
30|$|The lowest {{layer is}} the {{physical}} medium layer, where data are actually stored, e.g., HDDs or NAND flash. The physical storage medium is always accessed through a controller. The basic {{function of the}} controller is to translate data format on the physical storage medium (e.g., electrical voltage) into another format (e.g., binary values) understandable by upper layers. The controller offers a standardized and well-defined hardware interface, e.g., ATA (Team work systems: <b>Advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>attachment</b> 2017) and SCSI (Incits: Scsi storage interfaces 2016), which allows data to be read from/written to the physical storage medium. The HDD adopts in-place updates, and hence its controller usually consistently maps a logical block address to a certain storage location on the physical storage medium. On the contrary, NAND flash prefers out-of-place updates due to its special features, and is usually managed through FTL or a flash specific file system (“Flash memory” section). Device drivers are to consolidate access to different types of hardware by exposing a common simple interface {{in the form of}} software. The block device driver interface allows reading and writing of blocks in logical addresses. The block device driver can be used on top of an HDD control or NAND flash being encapsulated by FTL. The memory technology device (MTD), another type of device driver, is used to access raw NAND flash memory directly. MTD permits reading and writing, but blocks must be erased before being written, which occurs at a large granularity. Unsorted block images (UBI) is another interface for accessing flash memory, which builds on top of MTD interface and simplifies some aspects of using raw flash memory.|$|R
