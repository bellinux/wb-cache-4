25|$|Alex's {{death on}} 6 September 2007, at age 31, {{came as a}} surprise, as the average life span for African grey parrots is sixty years. His last words ("You be good, <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> I love you") were the same words that he would say every night when Pepperberg left the lab.|$|E
2500|$|During postseason telecasts, Joe {{has often}} paid homage {{to his father}} by signing off with [...] "We'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night!" [...] When the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series, Joe quoted his father again saying, [...] "For {{the first time since}} , St. Louis has a World Series winner!", {{referencing}} Jack's line when the Cards won in 1982, [...] "And that's a winner! That's a winner! A World Series winner for the Cardinals!". During the 2011 Series, Joe punctuated David Freese's 11th inning walk-off homer for the Cardinals in Game 6 with [...] "We will see you...tomorrow night!", near similar to the 1991 Puckett home run description, a call he said he did to celebrate Jack, but would never repeat the same situation. When the Cardinals won Game 7, he did not quote his father.|$|E
2500|$|Going into Game 6, the Twins trailed {{three games}} to two with each team winning their {{respective}} home games. Puckett gave the Twins an early lead by driving in Chuck Knoblauch with a triple {{in the first}} inning. Puckett then made a leaping catch {{in front of the}} Plexiglass wall in left field to rob Ron Gant of an extra-base hit in the third. The game went into extra innings, and in the first at-bat of the bottom of the 11th, Puckett hit a dramatic game-winning home run on a 2–1 count off of Charlie Leibrandt to send the Series to Game 7. This dramatic game has been widely remembered as the high point in Puckett's career. The images of Puckett rounding the bases, arms raised in triumph (often punctuated by CBS television broadcaster Jack Buck saying [...] "And we'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night!"), are always included in video highlights of his career. [...] After Game 6, the Twins replaced the blue seat back and bottom where the walk off home run ball was caught with a gold colored set. [...] Both of these sets remain in the Twins' archives. The original home run seat armrests and hardware, as well as the replacement blue seat back and bottom, are now in a private collection of Puckett memorabilia in Minnesota after the Metrodome was torn down. [...] The Twins then went on to win Game 7 1-0, with Jack Morris throwing a 10-inning complete game, and claimed their second World Series crown in five years.|$|E

5000|$|Swedish {{literary}} critic Victor Malm (Sydsvenskan) wrote of <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Attack From All Sides: “Renberg's novels are of international excellence ... <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is a wild, compassionate, first-rate thriller ... The second volume, Attack From All Sides, {{has also been}} published in Norwegian, {{and it is just}} as good ... The penmanship, the personification and the abundantly idiomatic dialogue make <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Attack From All Sides brilliantly realistic prose, not just within Scandinavia, but among the international elite.” Expressen (Sweden) wrote “Tore Renberg is one of this year's most brightly shining stars ... It is an incredibly good novel … <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is an achievement of technical power. In vital, maximalist prose, the characters' perspectives change in a weaving movement, slowly taking us to an amazing crescendo. The tone feels new, fresh and heartfelt.” Stephanie Boland (The Quietus) wrote of See You Tomorrow: “aspects of the novel seem utterly ordinary, but taken in its behemoth whole, it dazzles ... <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is as boundary crossing as its author: defying easy genre designations, it centres around a crime story, but tempers its grit with romance, humour and a generous dose of pop culture.” In Denmark, Kristeligt Dagblad called <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>tomorrow</b> a “wonderful novel” - and you devour it in huge, greedy gulps.”, and The Danish Information wrote “It is wild, but also wildly funny... It is fantastic! ... Realistic? Probably not, but insanely fun, and insanely well executed”. Jyllands-Posten awarded the novel five out of six stars and wrote “Renberg takes charge on the continent with <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> A book that involves both bursts of laughter and compassion… a joyful display of literary expression.” ...|$|E
