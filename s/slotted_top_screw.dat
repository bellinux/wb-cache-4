40|$|<b>Top</b> <b>screw</b> pullout {{occurs when}} the screw is under too much axial force to remain secure in the {{vertebral}} body. In vitro biomechanical pullout tests are commonly done to find the maximum fixation strength of anterior vertebral body screws. Typically, pullout tests are done instantaneously where the screw is inserted and then pulled out immediately after insertion. However, bone is a viscoelastic material so it shows a time dependent stress and strain response. Because of this property, it was hypothesised that creep occurs in the vertebral trabecular bone due to the stress caused by the screw. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to determine whether the axial pullout strength of anterior vertebral body screws used for scoliosis correction surgery changes with time after insertion. This study found that there is a possible relationship between pullout strength and time; however more testing is required as the sample numbers were quite small. The design of the screw is made with the knowledge of the strength it must obtain. This is important to prevent such occurrences as <b>top</b> <b>screw</b> pullout. If the pullout strength is indeed decreased due to creep, the design of the screw may need to be changed to withstand greater forces...|$|R

50|$|In the pictured {{single-stage}} regulator, a {{force balance}} {{is used on}} the diaphragm to control a poppet valve in order to regulate pressure. With no inlet pressure, the spring above the diaphragm pushes {{it down on the}} poppet valve, holding it open. Once inlet pressure is introduced, the open poppet allows flow to the diaphragm and pressure in the upper chamber increases, until the diaphragm is pushed upward against the spring, causing the poppet to reduce flow, finally stopping further increase of pressure. By adjusting the <b>top</b> <b>screw,</b> the downward pressure on the diaphragm can be increased, requiring more pressure in the upper chamber to maintain equilibrium. In this way, the outlet pressure of the regulator is controlled.|$|R
40|$|Background: Different {{factors such}} as {{impression}} techniques and materials can affect the passive fit between the superstructure and implant. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of different impression materials and techniques on the dimensional accuracy of implant definitive casts. Materials and Methods: Four internal hex implants (Biohorizons Ψ 4 mm) were placed on a metal maxillary model perpendicular to the horizontal plane in maxillary lateral incisors, right canine and left first premolar areas. Three impression techniques including open tray, closed tray using ball <b>top</b> <b>screw</b> abutments and closed tray using short impression copings and two impression materials (polyether and polyvinyl siloxane) were evaluated (n = 60). The changes in distances between implant analogues in mediolateral (x) and anteroposterior (y) directions and analogue angles in x/z and y/z directions in the horizontal plane on the definitive casts were measured by coordinate measuring machine. The data were analyzed by multivariate two-way analysis of variance and one sample t-test (α = 0. 05). Results: No statistical significant differences were observed between different impression techniques and materials. However, deviation and distortion of definitive casts had a significant difference with the master model when short impression copings and polyvinyl siloxane impression material were used (P < 0. 05). In open tray technique, there was a significant difference in the rotation of analogs compared with the master model with both impression materials (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: There was no difference between open and closed tray impression techniques; however, less distortion and deviation were observed in the open tray technique. In the closed tray impression technique, ball <b>top</b> <b>screw</b> was more accurate than short impression copings...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} fourwall interference {{assessment method}} has been described, {{and a computer}} program developed to facilitate correction of the airfoil data obtained in the Langley 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT).

The sidewall boundary-layer corrected data are then {{used to calculate the}} top and bottom wall interference effects by the method of Capallier, Chevallier and Bouinol, using the measured wall pressure distribution and the model force coefficients. The interference corrections obtained by the present method have been compared with other methods and found to give good agreement for the experimental data obtained in the TCT with <b>slotted</b> <b>top</b> and bottom walls...|$|R

The test section had separate top and bottom plenums which were divided into streamwise and cross-stream compartments. An iterative procedure was demonstrated for measuring wall interference and for adjusting the plenum compartment pressures to eliminate such interference.

Although in all the experiments wall interference was reduced after the plenum pressures were adjusted, interference could not be completely eliminated...|$|R
