25|$|SI prefixes are {{combined}} with the word second to denote subdivisions of the second, e.g., the millisecond (one thousandth of a second), the microsecond (one millionth of a second), and the nanosecond (one billionth of a second). Though SI prefixes may {{also be used to}} form multiples of the second such as kilosecond (one thousand seconds), <b>such</b> <b>units</b> <b>are</b> rarely used in practice. The more common larger non-SI units of time are not formed by powers of ten; instead, the second is multiplied by 60 to form a minute, which is multiplied by 60 to form an hour, which is multiplied by 24 to form a day.|$|E

Single use sharps containers of various sizes are sold throughout the world. Large medical facilities may have their own 'mini' autoclave in which these sharps containers are disposed of with other medical wastes. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel {{and the number of}} people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.|$|E
25|$|The {{station in}} its {{complete}} form has several smaller external components, {{such as the}} six robotic arms, the three External Stowage Platforms (ESPs) and four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs). While these platforms allow experiments (including MISSE, the STP-H3 and the Robotic Refueling Mission) to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally, their primary function is to store spare Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs). ORUs are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life. Examples of ORUs include pumps, storage tanks, antennas and battery units. <b>Such</b> <b>units</b> <b>are</b> replaced either by astronauts during EVA or by robotic arms. Spare parts were routinely transported {{to and from the}} station via Space Shuttle resupply missions, with a heavy emphasis on ORU transport once the NASA Shuttle approached retirement. Several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of ORUs, including STS-129, STS-133 and STS-134. , only one other mode of transportation of ORUs had been utilised – the Japanese cargo vessel HTV-2 – which delivered an FHRC and CTC-2 via its Exposed Pallet (EP).|$|E

25|$|Whether or {{not this}} or indeed any so called 'super-dairy' is ever built, this {{controversy}} {{is likely to have}} a lasting impact on Britain's future dairy policy. Supporters claim large scale farming offers opportunities to meet food security and climate change challenges of the future. Research by opponents counter this hypothesis with an argument that the economics of the system are unsustainable in a report titled: ''; however, the figures used in this report have also been heavily criticised by the industry's leading providers of economics data DairyCo, part of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, saying that the different systems are not being compared on a like for like basis and are ‘astonishingly naïve’. However, there are concerns that any similar proposal, if successful, would set a precedent for the development of large-scale farming systems more commonly associated with the US where <b>such</b> <b>units</b> <b>are</b> known as CAFOs - although with the definition of a dairy CAFO being over 750 cows, , the dairy industry's levy and advisory body, says there are already at least 12 such farms operating successfully and without issues - as proven by the lack of media interest in these farms - in England.|$|E
500|$|Although SI, as {{published}} by the CGPM, should, in theory, meet all the requirements of commerce, science and technology, certain units of measure have acquired such a position within the world community that it is likely they {{will be used for}} many years to come.

Called ballistarii (from ballista = [...] "catapult"), 7 <b>such</b> <b>units</b> <b>are</b> listed in the Notitia, all but one belonging to the comitatus. But a number are denoted pseudocomitatenses, implying that they originally belonged to the border forces. The purpose of independent artillery units was presumably to permit heavy concentration of firepower, especially useful for sieges. However, it is likely that many ordinary regiments continued to possess integral artillery, especially in the border forces.|$|E

The term is pejorative, with the connotation that <b>such</b> <b>units</b> <b>were</b> havens for those with connections who wished to avoid conscription into more dangerous duty while still gaining the prestige afforded in the United States to military service.

2500|$|Non-SI units {{accepted}} for use within SI such as litre, hectare and tonne. The CGPM (the {{guardians of the}} SI) have recognised that numerous units of measure are used sufficiently widely and consistently around the globe that they warrant official recognition. Other <b>such</b> <b>units</b> <b>are</b> [...] "minutes" [...] and [...] "hours". The CGPM have catalogued such units of measure and given them unique symbols {{to ensure that they}} are accorded the same consistency as are SI units. Thus, [...] "kilometres per hour" [...] is always written [...] "km/h" [...] even if the local word for [...] "hour" [...] does not start with an [...] "h"; for example [...] "hour" [...] is written [...] "uur" [...] in Dutch, but Dutch speedometers show [...] "km/h".|$|E
2500|$|The dock piers were code named Whales. These piers {{were the}} {{floating}} roadways that connected the [...] "Spud" [...] pier {{heads to the}} land. Designed by Allan Beckett the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called [...] "Beetles". After the war many of the [...] "Whale" [...] bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. <b>Such</b> <b>units</b> <b>are</b> still visible as a bridge over the Meuse River in Vacherauville (Meuse), as a bridge over the Moselle River on road D56 between Cattenom and Kœnigsmacker (Moselle) and in Vierville-sur-Mer (Calvados) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at Pont-Farcy was saved from destruction in 2008 by Les Amis du Pont Bailey, a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features {{as part of the}} Land Warfare exhibition at Imperial War Museum Duxford.|$|E
