A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a private}} high school in Ontario, in 2027. The player follows a new 11th-grade {{literature}} teacher at the school, John Rook, who has recently had his second divorce and is undergoing, in his words, a [...] "bizarre midlife crisis" [...] that has led him to quit his career in computers and become a teacher. The students in his class are Arianna Belle-Essai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal, Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook and all of the students have school-issued computers, which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages.

500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude".

The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the mistakes that he makes.

In his furious anger and rush to leave, he smashes into the glass office, cutting him and ripping his clothes. He excuses himself, fuming, from the three women, who all then applaud each other.

500|$|Although other spiders {{can also}} jump, salticids {{including}} Portia fimbriata have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat's and 10times more acute than a dragonfly's. Jumping spiders have eight eyes, the two large {{ones in the}} center-and-front position (the anterior-median eyes, also called [...] "principal eyes") housed in tubes {{in the head and}} [...] providing acute vision. The other six are secondary eyes, positioned along the sides of the carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors. In most jumping spiders, the middle pair of secondary eyes are very small and have no known function, but those of Portias are relatively large, and function {{as well as those of}} the other secondary eyes. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately 2centimetres to infinity, and in practice can see up to about 75centimetres. Like all jumping spiders, P. labiata can take in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main eye can <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a circle up to 12millimetres wide at 20centimetres away, or up to 18millimetres wide at 30centimetres away.

I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody for coming to the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, I <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> you who have come to see me, and I'm completely awestruck. Thank you, and I hope you like the movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E

In 2001, The Portland Mercury called the club [...] "a must-visit for any true strip club connoisseur" [...] for {{offering}} [...] "friendliness and sexiness". A reporter found the interior [...] "cozy", with conversational dancers who seemed to enjoy their interaction with guests.

The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits right in with [...] rowdy environment." [...] That year, Willamette Week called the club [...] "the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips" [...] and [...] "a stubbornly degenerate landmark".

While he was organising the assault, Huddleston commanding the Camel Corps company escorting the artillery and machine guns on the right of the square, exceeded his orders and entered the village. Exiting to the south they came under heavy fire from the Fur defenders and were forced to withdraw, pursued by some of the Fur troops. However, when they came within range of the Anglo-Egyptian square, their artillery and machine guns opened fire on their open flank. Seeing this, the remainder of the Fur Army left their trenches and attacked the southern side of the square in strength. The south of the square was manned from left to right by an artillery battery, three infantry companies, another artillery battery, one infantry company and a Maxim section. There was then a gap of around [...] before another infantry company and a Maxim section were positioned facing east. Kelly now reinforced the south of the square with two Maxim sections and a company from the Arab Battalion. The Fur attack lasted around forty minutes, but it eventually failed and the nearest they got to the square was around [...] Kelly ordered an infantry counter-attack, supported by his artillery, with the Maxim guns advancing alongside the infantry. The Fur Army broke and the survivors retreated, leaving 231 dead, ninety-six seriously wounded and another 1,000 less seriously wounded behind, from a force of over 3,600. Anglo-Egyptian casualties were four officers wounded, five other ranks dead and eighteen wounded. At 16:00, Kelly resumed his advance to El Fasher stopping for the night just short of the capital.|$|E
