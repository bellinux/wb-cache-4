The residual {{concentration of the}} dye solute was determined by spectrophotometric method. The factors affecting the preconcentration of Sudan III such as pH, shaking time, sample volume etc. were observed and discussed.

40|$|Synthesis of five {{different}} Sudan-beta -D-glucuronides (I, II, III, IV, and RedB) {{was performed by}} condensation {{of a set of}} red <b>Sudan</b> diazo <b>dyes</b> with methyl (1 -deoxy- 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl- 1 -trichloroadoyl-alpha -D-glucopyran) uronate. After the acid and alcohol groups had been deprotected, the resulting compounds were used for histochemical localization of beta -glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic plants (Petunia hybrida, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Nicotiana tabacum) that contained the GUS reporter system. Because the cleavage of the beta -glucuronide results in the liberation of an insoluble <b>Sudan</b> <b>dye,</b> <b>Sudan</b> substrates gave no diffusion artifacts as described for the commonly used 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta -D-glucuronide (X-gluc). A comparison of assays with different Sudan glucuronides and X-gluc demonstrated that the SudanIV variant is a valuable glucuronide substrate for the precise histochemical localization of GUS activity in transgenic plants. status: publishe...|$|R

Because this azo dyes are cheap, <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes</b> are likeable for food coloring as well. However, due to their carcinogenicity they banned from use as food coloring in many countries. Sudan I and IV are mostly detected in chili and curry products. These products hail often from Russian federation, Turkey, and India.

50|$|In the {{simplest}} {{form of the}} fecal fat test, a random fecal specimen is submitted to the hospital laboratory and examined under a microscope after staining with a Sudan III or <b>Sudan</b> IV <b>dye</b> ("Sudan staining").

50|$|Sudan Black B {{can be used}} {{to stain}} some other {{materials}} than the other <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes,</b> as it is not so specific to lipids.|$|E

50|$|Sudan IV is a fat-soluble dye, {{also used}} for {{staining}} lipids. It has the same melting point as Sudan III and its chemical structure consists of two more methyl groups. All together these <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes</b> mentioned above belong to category 3 carcinogens.|$|E
40|$|Interfacial {{properties}} play a {{major role}} in governing where and how dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) move in the subsurface. Interfacial tension and contact angle measurements were obtained for a simple, single component DNAPL (tetrachloroethene, PCE), complex laboratory DNAPLs (PCE plus <b>Sudan</b> IV <b>dye),</b> and a field DNAPL from the Savannah River Site (SRS) M-Area DNAPL (PCE, trichloroethene [TCE], and maching oils). Interfacial properties for complex DNAPLs were time-dependent, a phenomenon not observed for PCE alone. Drainage capillary pressure-saturation curves are strongly influenced by interfacial properties. Therefore time-dependence will alter the nature of DNAPL migration and penetration. Results indicate that the time-dependence of PCE with relatively high <b>Sudan</b> IV <b>dye</b> concentrations is comparable to that of the field DNAPL. Previous DNAPL mobility experiments in which the DNAPL was dyed should be reviewed to determine whether time-dependent properties influenced the resutls. Dyes appear to make DNAPL more complex, and therefore a more realistic analog for field DNAPLs than single component DNAPLs...|$|R

The fast reaction of the European Commission was it to prohibit the import of chili and hot chili products. Also the BfR (Bundesinstitut fuer Risikobewertung) was asked for their opinion and {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes</b> are principally harmful to the health.

40|$|ABSTRACT Yolks of pigeon and {{guinea fowl}} eggs were {{examined}} {{for the number}} of dichromate-staining rings. Estimates of the time for rapid follicular development using this technique were 5. 1 and 5. 6 days for pigeons and guinea fowl, respectively. Another measure of follicular development based on the incor-poration of <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes</b> into the yolk yielded an estimate of 6. 5 and 8. 3 days for pigeons and guinea fowl, respectively. Using one and two-egg clutches, no differences due to clutch position were observed in either species. There was a significant difference (P=s. 01) between results obtained with the two techniques for measuring the period of rapid yolk deposition. The dichromate technique can give valuable data relative to yolk deposition, especially in species where it is impractical to daily catch and administer <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes.</b> But the tendency to underestimate the period of follicular growth means that caution must be exercised in comparing results obtained with that technique and the more labor-intensive Sudan dye incorporation method. The time from the end of yolk deposition until oviposition is defined as the rest period. This interval was 1. 5 days for pigeons and 1. 7 days for guinea fowl. This is considerably longer than the rest period of Coturnix quail but similar to that found in turkeys and chickens...|$|E
40|$|Gaucher's {{disease is}} a rare {{metabolic}} disorder characterized {{by the lack of}} beta-glucocerebrosidase enzyme. In this case report a 26 -year-old male patient was, first diagnosed as having splenomegaly and a huge haemangioma, therefore managed by total splenectomy. Histologic examination and specific colouring techniques using PAS and Black <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes</b> allowed the diagnosis of Gaucher's disease. Preoperative diagnosis is hence fundamental to establish the correct management procedure, which currently may be surgical or medical and/or combined. In fact, following the diagnosis the second step includes the decision-making about splenectomy. Other therapeutic approaches are enzyme replacement therapy and genic therapy. The first may be combined to partial splenectomy, while the latter still needs further evaluations...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{determination}} of multiple weak chromatographic peaks via stochastic resonance algorithm attracts much attention in recent years. However, the optimization of the parameters is complicated and time consuming, although the single-well potential stochastic resonance algorithm (SSRA) has already {{reduced the number}} of parameters to only one and simplified the process significantly. Even worse, {{it is often difficult to}} keep amplified peaks with beautiful peak shape. Therefore, multiobjective genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the parameter of SSRA for multiple optimization objectives (i. e., S/N and peak shape) and multiple chromatographic peaks. The applicability of the proposed method was evaluated with an experimental data set of <b>Sudan</b> <b>dyes,</b> and the results showed an excellent quantitative relationship between different concentrations and responses...|$|E
