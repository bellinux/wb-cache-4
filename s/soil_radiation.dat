40|$|A dynamic {{nonlinear}} Winkler spring model, {{is developed}} for the seismic response of deep foundations. The model utilizes the phenomenological ""BWGG"" model (outlined in a companion paper), and it can treat the inelastic response of both the soil and the pile. The nonlinear reaction of the soil is modeled realistically by the BWGG interaction springs and dashpots, with due consideration to effects such as: separation (gapping) of the pile or caisson from the <b>soil,</b> <b>radiation</b> damping, and loss of strength due to pore-water pressure development. The modeling of pile inelasticity is also versatile, and can treat from well-reinforced to poorly-reinforced concrete sections. The necessity for the proposed model arises from the difficulty to predict the large-amplitude dynamic response of piles up to failure. The BWGG-Winkler model is validated through the results of in-situ monotonic and dynamic pile load tests. It is further utilized to study the nonlinear soil-pile interaction under lateral monotonic loading. The results of the model are compared with the venerable Broms (1964) theory for pile lateral capacity...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a study of}} the radiation and geochemical background state of soil in the south of Tyumen region. According to the obtained data it was revealed that within the study areas, the power values of gamma radiation exposure dose ranged from 6 to 12. 5 mcR/h, due to the natural gamma background of the area. The research results of the soils radiation status have shown that the main contribution to the radiation activity of soils is made by the natural radionuclide potassium- 40 and man-made strontium- 90. Elevated concentration of strontium- 90 was observed in grey forest soils and amounted to 102 Bq/kg. The study of <b>soil</b> <b>radiation</b> contamination in the “Tavda” explosion epicenter (Nizhnetavdinsky district) revealed the dynamics of migration of radionuclides along the soil profile, which takes place at a considerable depth (80 – 100 cm). The maximum concentration of strontium- 90 was observed in the area “South- 200 ” at the soil layer of 10 – 20 cm depth and was 1680 Bq/kg.

30|$|Several {{improvements}} in current process-based models of soil heating during fires are possible with current technology but, {{as we have}} argued here, {{should be based on}} increasing the observational data base. First, modeling the fire-induced soil heat pulse could probably be improved with more measurements of the <b>soil</b> <b>radiation</b> and conductive heat fluxes during fires (probably using slash-pile and prescribed burns). This should lead to improved parameterizations of model forcing functions and upper boundary conditions. Second, including the dynamic feedback processes between the soil structure and the fire-induced heat pulse should improve simulations of the depth of penetration of fire-associated heat pulse. This will require photomicrographic and other detailed studies of the vertical structure of the soil physical and thermal properties before and after fires. Third, developing and verifying algorithms to describe fire-induced advective flows in soils should improve not only the reliability of the soil heat pulse predictions, but also should improve predictions of the vaporization, transport, and condensation of soil moisture and the formation of the fire-induced hydrophobic layer. Studies of advective transport may require soil tracer releases or studies of soil CO 2 amounts (and possibly isotopes) during slash-pile burns. They could be aided by photomicrographic studies {{of the structure of the}} fire-induced hydrophobic layer as well. Fourth, improved understanding of the physiochemical and transport processes of key soil nutrients should improve the ability to predict and maybe minimize changes in soil nutrient status. Such studies can also be performed using experimental slash-pile and prescribed burns.|$|E

40|$|This work {{seeks to}} analyze the C balance of a Belgian {{grassland}} grazed by the “Blanc Bleu Belge” breed of cattle. The site is located at Dorinne in the Belgian Condroz (50 ° 18 ’ 44 ’’ N; 4 ° 58 ’ 07 ’’ E; 248 m asl.). It is permanent grassland of ca. 4. 2 ha with a moderate slope of 1 to 2 %. Homogeneity and topography criteria are met to ensure high quality turbulent flux measurements. The experimental field was equipped with an eddy covariance system. Flux correction, quality control and data gap filling were performed following standardised procedures. This device was completed by a micrometeorological station that measured temperature and humidity respectively {{in the air and}} within the <b>soil,</b> <b>radiation,</b> atmospheric pressure and precipitations. Carbon exported through mowing (CNBP,export), imported through compost application (CNBP,import) or through complementary feeds for cattle (CNBP,complement) was also measured. In addition, the vegetation development was followed in order to estimate herbage production and dry matter intake by grazing animals. Carbon lost through CH 4 emissions (CNBP,CH 4) was finally estimated, allowing the establishment of a full C budget. After one year of measurements (May 2010 - May 2011), the grassland was a net CO 2 source (Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) = 172 ± 94 g C m- 2 year- 1). Net Biome Productivity (NBP) was calculated from NEE by taking into account imports and export of organic C and losses of carbon as CH 4. Contribution of CNBP,CH 4 to NBP was small as it was 12 ± 1 g C m- 2 year- 1. The balance between CNBP,import and CNBP,export created not such a large departure of NBP from NEE, which is not the case of CNBP,complement. The NBP was finally estimated at 102 ± 95 g C m- 2 year- 1. At this stage, it is premature to conclude about the sink or source behaviour of the plot because the NBP value is very close to its uncertainty. Moreover, this result was obtained under particular climate conditions, characterised by drought during summer 2010 and spring 2011. First year full carbon budget will be discussed in relation with climate conditions and management practices. A second year of measurements will be also presented...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{different}} space {{agencies have}} launched satellite missions that carry passive microwave instruments on-board that can measure surface soil moisture. Three currently operational missions are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission {{developed by the}} European Space Agency (ESA), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR 2) developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) from China’s National Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC). In this study, the quality of surface soil moisture anomalies derived from these passive microwave instruments was sequentially assessed over the mainland of the People’s Republic of China. First, {{the impact of a}} recent update in the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was assessed for MWRI observations. Then, the soil moisture measurements retrieved from the X-band observations of MWRI were compared with those of AMSR 2, followed by an internal comparison of the multiple frequencies of AMSR 2. Finally, SMOS retrievals from two different algorithms were also included in the comparison. For each sequential step, processing and verification chains were specifically designed to isolate the impact of algorithm (version), observation frequency or instrument characteristics. Two verification techniques are used: the statistical Triple Collocation technique is used as the primary verification tool, while the precipitation-based Rvalue technique is used to confirm key results. Our results indicate a consistently better performance throughout the entire study area after the implementation of an update of the LPRM. We also find that passive microwave observations in the AMSR 2 C-band frequency (6. 9 GHz) have an advantage over the AMSR 2 X-band frequency (10. 7 GHz) over moderate to densely vegetated regions. This finding is in line with theoretical expectations as emitted <b>soil</b> <b>radiation</b> will become masked under a dense canopy with stricter thresholds for higher passive microwave frequencies. Both AMSR 2 and MWRI make X-band observations; a direct comparison between them reveals a consistently higher quality obtained by AMSR 2, specifically over semi-arid climate regimes. Unfortunately, Radio Frequency Interference hampers the usefulness of soil moisture products for the SMOS L-band mission, leading to a significantly reduced revisit time over the densely populated eastern part of the country. Nevertheless, our analysis demonstrates that soil moisture products from a number of multi-frequency microwave sensors are credible alternatives for this dedicated L-band mission over the mainland of the People’s Republic of China...|$|E
40|$|Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) {{developed}} an enhanced single-shell tank (SST) integrity project in 2009. An expert panel on SST integrity {{was created to}} provide recommendations supporting {{the development of the}} project. One primary recommendation was to expand the leak assessment reports (substitute report or LD- 1) to include leak causes and locations. The recommendation has been included in the M- 045 - 9 IF Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) as one of four targets relating to SST leak integrity. The 241 -SX Farm (SX Farm) tanks with leak losses were addressed on an individual tank basis as part of LD- 1. Currently, 8 out of 23 SSTs that have been reported to having a liner leak are located in SX Farm. This percentage was the highest compared to other tank farms which is why SX Farm was analyzed first. The SX Farm is comprised of fifteen SSTs built 1953 - 1954. The tanks are arranged in rows of three tanks each, forming a cascade. Each of the SX Farm tanks has a nominal I-million-gal storage capacity. Of the fifteen tanks in SX Farm, an assessment reported leak losses for the following tanks: 241 -SX- 107, 241 -SX- 108, 241 -SX- 109, 241 -SX- 111, 241 -SX- 112, 241 -SX- 113, 241 -SX- 114 and 241 -SX- 115. The method used to identify leak location consisted of reviewing in-tank and ex-tank leak detection information. This provided the basic data identifying where and when the first leaks were detected. In-tank leak detection consisted of liquid level measurement that can be augmented with photographs which can provide an indication of the vertical leak location on the sidewall. Ex-tank leak detection for the leaking tanks consisted of <b>soil</b> <b>radiation</b> data from laterals and drywells near the tank. The in-tank and ex-tank leak detection can provide an indication of the possible leak location radially around and under the tank. Potential leak causes were determined using in-tank and ex-tank information that is not directly related to leak detection. In-tank parameters can include temperature of the supernatant and sludge, types of waste, and chemical determination by either transfer or sample analysis. Ex-tank information can be assembled from many sources including design media, construction conditions, technical specifications, and other sources. Five conditions may have contributed to SX Farm tank liner failure including: tank design, thermal shock, chemistry-corrosion, liner behavior (bulging), and construction temperature. Tank design did not apparently change from tank to tank for the SX Farm tanks; however, there could be many unknown variables present in the quality of materials and quality of construction. Several significant SX Farm tank design changes occurred from previous successful tank farm designs. Tank construction occurred in winter under cold conditions which could have affected the ductile to brittle transition temperature of the tanks. The SX Farm tanks received high temperature boiling waste from REDOX which challenged the tank design with rapid heat up and high temperatures. All eight of the leaking SX Farm tanks had relatively high rate of temperature rise. Supernatant removal with subsequent nitrate leaching was conducted in all but three of the eight leaking tanks prior to leaks being detected. It is possible that no one characteristic of the SX Farm tanks could in isolation from the others have resulted in failure. However, the application of so many stressors - heat up rate, high temperature, loss of corrosion protection, and tank design - working jointly or serially resulted in their failure. Thermal shock coupled with the tank design, construction conditions, and nitrate leaching seem to be the overriding factors that can lead to tank liner failure. The distinction between leaking and sound SX Farm tanks seems to center on the waste types, thermal conditions, and nitrate leaching...|$|E
