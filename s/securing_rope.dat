50|$|Rock Hopping is an {{activity}} involving jumping off rocks. Some variations {{of this activity}} may involve jumping off a cliff into {{a body of water}} such as a river or lake. It is also known as cliff jumping or , since abandoned, water-filled quarry holes are popular for this activity, featuring steep, tall cliff faces and deep water. Rock hopping {{can be used as a}} means of getting from one place to another in combination with scrambling over rocks for the purpose of outdoor activity such as rock climbing. It has also become an extreme sport whereby participants jump over large gaps, sometimes without any form of safety device such as a <b>securing</b> <b>rope</b> to ensure they do not fall and injure themselves or worse. It can also refer to traveling up a boulder-filled stream or brook by jumping from rock to rock, while avoiding falling in.|$|E

50|$|At dawn on 23 April the French advance {{continued}} in a pincer movement toward Ratisbon, with General Louis-Pierre Montbrun {{coming from the}} southwest and Napoleon moving up from the south. Around 9:00 A.M. 10,000 French cavalry, led by General Étienne Nansouty’s two cuirassier divisions, began to engage the Austrian cavalry, who despite poorly coordinated charges were able to hold them for almost three hours to facilitate the army’s escape, before they slipped away. Only then did the French discover the pontoon bridge, but its last defenders were able to hold on and cut the <b>securing</b> <b>ropes</b> to prevent the French from using it.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{maritime}} {{contexts in which}} the term originates, a bollard is either a wooden or iron post found as a deck-fitting on a ship or boat, and used to <b>secure</b> <b>ropes</b> for towing, mooring and other purposes; or its counterpart on land, a short wooden, iron or stone post on a quayside to which craft can be moored. The Sailor's Word-Book of 1867 defines a bollard in a more specific context as [...] "a thick piece of wood {{on the head of}} a whale-boat, round which the harpooner gives the line a turn, in order to veer it steadily, and check the animal's velocity".|$|R
50|$|The Berlin Foundry Cup depicts {{scaffolding}} {{in ancient}} Greece (early 5th century BC).

5|$|With {{no time to}} make {{a coordinated}} plan of attack for the whole army, Khalid decided to storm the East Gate himself. He, Qa'qa ibn Amr, and Mazur ibn Adi climbed the wall hand-by-hand {{from the side of the}} gate. This part of the wall was the strongest, no guard was {{stationed}} at the top. They <b>secured</b> <b>ropes</b> to the wall and dropped them to 100 selected soldiers waiting at the base. Leaving a few men to assist the climbers, Khalid descended into the city, killing the guards at the inside of the East Gate. Khalid and Qa'qa flung the gate open and the remainder of Khalid's men entered the city. An intense battle ensued.|$|R

While he was working from a cradle on the giant mural, a visitor let one of the <b>securing</b> <b>ropes</b> go, plunging the cradle three storeys, and landing {{on the ground with}} Vaughan trapped under the visitor. He appeared unhurt, but suffered an undiagnosed head injury. Instead of taking him to hospital to be examined, his friends gave him some LSD to [...] "calm him down", which in fact flipped his mind. He then spent three years as a down and out, suffering from manic depression, which affected him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|R
50|$|The granny knot is {{a binding}} knot, used to <b>secure</b> a <b>rope</b> or line around an object.

5000|$|A one {{and half}} hour delay in summiting caused by {{bottlenecks}} at the Balcony and Hillary Step, these delays were in themselves caused by delays in <b>securing</b> fixed <b>ropes</b> {{and the sheer}} numbers of people arriving at the bottlenecks at the same time, (34 climbers on 10 May).|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} wall is not {{a uniform}} surface, dissected by ledges, dihedrals, and ramps. The main access route to the summit leads {{through one of the}} ramps to the saddle between the main summit and its western trabant. The passage on the top cone is <b>secured</b> by <b>ropes</b> for unprepared tourists.|$|R
50|$|The stein knot (aka stone knot) is a {{variation}} of the figure-eight knot. It is used to <b>secure</b> a <b>rope</b> that is already passed around a post or through a ring. It is quick and easy to tie and untie. It is a device rigging rather than a true knot.|$|R
50|$|A noose is a loop {{at the end}} of a rope {{in which}} the knot {{tightens}} under load and can be loosened without.The knot can be used to <b>secure</b> a <b>rope</b> to a post or pole, but only where the end is in a position that the loop can be passed over.|$|R
50|$|If two climbers are roped {{together}} for protection, the leader should <b>secure</b> the <b>rope</b> {{both before and}} after a difficult move when traversing. This enables the following climber to remove the anchorage before making the difficult move while still having good security from the anchor point which was placed after the move.|$|R
5000|$|Buckley's father, William Buckley, {{was from}} Manchester, England. He stowed {{away on a}} ship that {{eventually}} arrived in San Francisco. In California, William met Annie Bone. They married, and their son, Richard, was born in Tuolumne, California, in a mountainous region where lumbering was a major industry. [...] As children, Buckley and his sister, Nell, would often perform {{on the streets of}} Tuolumne, singing for change from passersby. [...] When he was a bit older, Buckley got a job in the local lumber camps as a [...] "tree topper", which was considered an especially dangerous position. It involved climbing up to the very top of a tall tree, cutting off the tip and then <b>securing</b> <b>ropes</b> that would guide the rest of the tree as it was felled. Buckley is referred to as an [...] "ex-lumberjack".|$|R
50|$|It {{was agreed}} that Dengate would search {{at ground level}} for another manhole closer to the child to {{facilitate}} a faster rescue. An ambulance officer, Michael Marr, then descended into the drains and remained in the flooded junction area to assist Sparkes. Sparkes <b>secured</b> a <b>rope</b> to himself and, {{with the aid of}} a torch, crawled back up the flooded drain.|$|R
50|$|An entire row of pitons {{left behind}} in the rock {{indicate}} that in the past, when troops of the Mittenwald mountain infantry passed this way, dangerous climbing sections were <b>secured</b> using <b>rope</b> railings. For a long time the route was only marked by cairns and a few posts, and orientation during the descent was difficult. Since 2002 the route has been marked throughout.|$|R

50|$|In 1953, Norgay {{took part}} in John Hunt's {{expedition}}, the latter's seventh expedition to Everest. A {{member of the team}} was Edmund Hillary, who had a near-miss following a fall into a crevasse but was saved from hitting the bottom by Norgay's prompt action in <b>securing</b> the <b>rope</b> using his ice axe, which led Hillary to consider him the climbing partner of choice for any future summit attempt.|$|R
50|$|The tumble hitch is a {{quick-release}} draw loop knot {{used for}} temporarily <b>securing</b> a <b>rope</b> {{such that it}} can be released easily and cleanly. The hitch can be untied with a tug of the working end, even when under tension. The tumble hitch can be tied {{in the middle of a}} rope, and so the working end does not need to be passed around the anchor when tying or releasing.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{training}} {{was involved in}} learning about riggings, how to <b>secure</b> the <b>rope</b> ties, inflation and maintenance of the balloons that includes patching the outer skin when tears or leaks are detected. The entire Squadron 992 also has to be mobile and able {{to set up and}} maintain the balloons, using a converted Crossley lorry that not only carries the balloon but has the winch equipment to raise it to height.|$|R
50|$|Stacy's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:While coaling ship in {{the harbor}} of Cape Haiten, one of {{the crew of the}} Rhode Island fell overboard, and, after catching a rope, had been forced by exhaustion, to relinquish his hold. Although the sea was running high at the time, Stacy, at the peril of his life, jumped overboard, <b>secured</b> the <b>rope</b> around his shipmate, and thus saved him from drowning.|$|R
2500|$|Quick release mooring hooks {{provide an}} {{alternative}} method of <b>securing</b> the <b>rope</b> to the quay: {{such a system}} [...] "greatly reduces the need for port staff to handle heavy mooring ropes … means staff have to spend less time on exposed areas of the dock, and [...] the risk of back injuries from heavy lifting". [...] The Oil Companies International Marine Forum recommend {{the use of such}} hooks in oil and gas terminals.|$|R
60|$|This {{having been}} accomplished, the first beam became {{the means of}} raising the second, and when {{the first and second}} were {{fastened}} at the top, they formed a pair of shears by which the rest were more easily raised to their places. The heads of the beams were then fitted together and <b>secured</b> with <b>ropes</b> in a temporary manner, until the falling of the tide would permit the operations to be resumed.|$|R
50|$|Kaw quickly {{discovers the}} tower room where Eilonwy resides, {{and helps to}} <b>secure</b> a <b>rope</b> for Taran to climb, {{only to find that}} Eilonwy does not know him or any of the names of her former companions.

Taran vainly hopes to halt the alarm and follows her until Magg arrests him.|$|R
5000|$|Ampelographers {{note that}} the root of Versoaln's name in the local dialect of South Tyrol means [...] "to secure with a rope" [...] and could be a {{reference}} to the viticultural practice of trellising where the canopy of the vine is <b>secured</b> by <b>rope</b> or wires to a trellis. Another theory is that the name is derived from verdolen, which means [...] "green" [...] in the local language, and describes the deep green color of the berries before veraison.|$|R
50|$|While {{climbing}} in Monument Valley, siblings Peter (O'Donnell) and Annie Garrett (Tunney) {{lose their}} father, Royce (Stuart Wilson). After two falling amateurs leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter {{to cut him}} loose to save Peter and his sister. Peter has since retired from climbing, becoming a full-time wildlife photographer, and Annie {{has gone on to}} become a renowned mountain climber. Their relationship is strained as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to <b>secure</b> the <b>rope.</b>|$|R
