30|$|As a {{commercial}} product, QLCD had attracted special {{attention in the}} market. For example, in 2015 SINOCES consumer electronics show, a Chinese TV manufacturer released a new product—K 7100 new series ULED. It was the world’s first application of the quantum dot display technology in curved TV, which achieved a major breakthrough in the LCD TV picture quality with a 100 % NTSC. Although the QD glass tube takes {{the advantage of the}} low cost than the QLCF, it could not fit for small display screens, such as mobile and pads, due to the large thickness. Furthermore, there is a <b>sealed</b> <b>edge</b> (ingress edge) for the glass tube which limit its application for super narrow border or no border TV designs. So, QD film turns more and more popular by the customers and the industries also put most of the efforts on making innovations for the low-cost QLCF.|$|E

The <b>sealing</b> <b>edge</b> (42) of the valve aperture is formed, {{so that it}} is longer than that of a <b>sealing</b> <b>edge</b> of a similarly-sized square valve aperture, e. g. twice as long. The <b>sealing</b> <b>edge</b> is meander-shaped and intake and discharge channels (44, 46) with a length and width are formed which determine the length of the <b>sealing</b> <b>edge.</b> The valve body is rigid, and the valve plate is elastically suspended.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined <b>Edge</b> <b>sealing</b> {{is often}} used to assure {{one-dimensional}} moisture flow and a defined exposure area in moisture transport experiments. This paper deals with the performance of a number of <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems including wax-paraffin mix, epoxy adhesive, silicone and different tapes and films. The overall performance of the sealing systems includes vapor permeability and hygroscopicity, workability, thermal durability, flexibility, adhesion and risk of hydrophobation. The moisture-related properties are determined gravimetrically. The other properties are examined visually and qualitatively. Each of the properties of the <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems is rated and the overall performance is an assessment of all the single properties. This comparative study shows that the best overall performance among the studied <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems were seen in the tapes and films, the mixes demonstrate a higher risk of hydrophobation. The advantages as well as the disadvantages of each system are discussed together with some recommendations on usage...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{sensitivity}} of some photovoltaic devices to moisture-induced corrosion, they are packaged using impermeable front- and back-sheets along with an <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> to prevent moisture ingress. Evaluation of <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> materials can be difficult because of the low permeation rates involved and/or non-Fickian behavior. Here, using a Ca film deposited on a glass substrate, we demonstrate the evaluation of <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> materials {{in a manner that}} effectively duplicates their use in a photovoltaic application and compare the results with standard methods for measuring water vapor transport. We demonstrate how moisture permeation data from polymer films can be used to estimate moisture ingress rates and compare the results of these two methods. Encapsulant materials were also evaluated for comparison and to highlight the need for <b>edge</b> <b>seals.</b> Of the materials studied, desiccant filled polyisobutylene materials demonstrate by far the best potential to keep moisture out for a 20 to 30 year lifetime...|$|R

50|$|Another {{widely used}} method to seal through glass with low {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion {{is the use}} of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp. The disadvantage here is that the tip of the edge which is a local point of high tensile stress reaches through the wall of the glass container. This can lead to low gas leakages. In the tube to tube knife <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> the <b>edge</b> is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall.|$|R

40|$|Flaws and {{defects in}} heat seals formed between sheets of {{translucent}} film are identified by optically examining consecutive lateral {{sections of the}} seal along the seal length. Each lateral seal section is illuminated and an optical sensor array detects the intensity of light transmitted through the seal section {{for the purpose of}} detecting and locating edges in the heat seal. A line profile for each consecutive seal section is derived having an amplitude proportional to the change in light intensity across the seal section.

40|$|The {{development}} of vacuum glazing represents a significant advancement {{in the area}} of low heat loss glazing systems with the potential to substantially reduce building heating and cooling loads. Vacuum glazing consists of two or more glass panes hermetically sealed together around the edge with a vacuum gap between the panes. To avoid the glass panes from collapsing and touching each other under the influence of atmospheric pressure an array of support pillars is provided between the glass panes. A high level of thermal insulation is achieved by evacuating the spaces between the glass panes to a very low pressure which greatly reduces conduction and convection within the space; therefore heat transfer through this kind of glazing is significantly lower when compared with conventional insulating glazing. However, vacuum glazing is subject to inherent stresses due to atmospheric pressure and temperature differentials which can lead to fracture of the glass panes and failure of the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> A flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> has been proposed to minimise the impact of these issues. In this paper, vacuum glazing system with rigid and flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seals</b> is theoretically studied and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High-precision {{machining}} {{and large-scale}} tool {{are the most}} primary development trend of current machine tool and hydrostatic products are key technologies of high-precision machining equipments. However, these equipments mostly process miniature components, thus the adopted tools are relatively small and the spindles mainly use are mainly built-in types of HSK 32 to HSK 25 with revolutions speed over 25, 000 rpm. Some processing equipments are even equipped with hydrostatic or gas-static spindles. The study extends the axial oil chamber to radial ones to expand the action area of axial oil pressure and form a closed oil <b>seal</b> <b>edge</b> by combining the radial clearance. Consequently, the axial bearing stiffness can be enhanced to enlarge the application scope of hydrostatic spindle.

40|$|Vacuum glazing {{is a form}} of low-conductance {{double glazing}} using in {{internal}} vacuum between the two glass sheets to eliminate heat transport by gas conduction and convection. An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused solder glass forms the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> Heat transfer through the glazing occurs by radiation across the vacuum gap, conduction through the support pillars, and conduction through the bonded <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>Edge</b> conduction is problematic because it affects stresses in the edge region, leading to possible failure of the glazing; in addition, excessive heat transfer because of thermal bridging in the edge region can lower overall window thermal performance and decrease resistance to condensation. Infrared thermography was used to analyze the thermal performance of prototype vacuum glazings, and, for comparison, atmospheric pressure superwindows. Research focused on mitigating the edge effects of vacuum glazings through the use of insulating trim, recessed edges, and framing materials. Experimentally validated finite-element and finite-difference modeling tools were used for thermal analysis of prototype vacuum glazing units and complete windows. Experimental measurements of edge conduction using infrared imaging were found to be in good agreement with finite-element modeling results for a given set of conditions. Finite-element modeling validates an analytic model developed for edge conduction...|$|R

25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the <b>sealing</b> <b>edge,</b> and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|R

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil <b>seal</b> <b>edges</b> of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil <b>edge</b> <b>sealing,</b> the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the disintegration mechanism of concrete due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the milling <b>edge</b> and fog <b>seal</b> methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little.

40|$|This poster aims at {{presenting}} {{an experimental}} investigations for the fabrication of vacuum glazing using a novel low-temperature <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> material, melts at around 200 C, {{as shown in}} figure 1. To date two materials indium and solder glass have been used for <b>sealing</b> the <b>edges</b> of the glass sheets in a vacuum glazing. Indium is a low temperature sealing material, melts at 157 C, but is very expensive. Solder glass is a high temperature sealing material, melts at around 450 C, but has limitation of using low-e coatings and a tempered glass. One of the main hindrance to the manufacture of vacuum glazing at the industrial level is the cost. In this poster presentation, a vacuum glazing system for production at a laboratory scale using a modified evacuation pump-out sealing technique is presented. A number of samples have been fabricated using a novel cost effective <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> material that achieves an evacuation pressure less than 0. 046 Pa in the cavity of the vacuum glazing samples. An experimental performance verification of samples using new cost effective sealing materials will be executed in a hot box calorimeter to measure thermal transmittance performance of the samples.
