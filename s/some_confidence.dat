5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 there was <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, {{especially}} in batting. England duly {{won the first}} Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E
5|$|Colley Cibber was {{a rather}} {{unsuccessful}} young actor {{at the time of}} the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of The Relapse could be scheduled with <b>some</b> <b>confidence.</b> Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E

25|$|It {{was this}} strong {{performance}} {{that caught the}} attention of the Ottawa Senators. With the help of goaltending coach Phil Myre, Tugnutt worked on the fundamentals, gained <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> and improved his game each season.

25|$|England {{came into}} the First Test with <b>some</b> <b>confidence,</b> having enjoyed a largely {{successful}} series of warm-up matches and winning the first One-day International. Captain Mike Atherton was in particularly good form with the bat {{at the top of}} the order. The England eleven contained four seamers and no specialist spinner, with Alan Igglesden getting the nod for the fourth spot ahead of the injured Angus Fraser (fractured finger) and Steve Watkin (back trouble). For the West Indies, Jimmy Adams came in for the injured Carl Hooper, while Winston and Kenny Benjamin provided the back-up seamer duties.|$|E

25|$|Using both {{written and}} archaeological data, some {{comparisons}} {{can be drawn}} between the food of ancient Israel and its neighbors. Although there is much information about the foods of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the inferences {{that can be made}} are limited due to differences in topography and climate; Israelite agriculture also depended on rainfall rather than the river-based irrigation of these two civilizations, resulting in the preference for different crops. Ugarit and Phoenicia were closer neighbors of ancient Israel, and shared a topography and climate similar to that of ancient Israel. Thus, conclusions about the food and drink in ancient Israel have been made with <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> from this evidence.|$|E
25|$|South Africa named an {{unchanged}} side, {{boosted by}} {{the confidence of}} the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated second time around. Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, but this was the best of a bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> with the bat, having had very little success in his recent county appearances. But overall, it was a disappointing effort from England, but they did respond with 3 wickets before the close of play to leave South Africa on 101/3.|$|E
25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, and we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give to our country <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E

25|$|After {{signing the}} Renville Agreement in 1948, {{many of the}} Republican armed units {{returned}} from zones of conflict. This gave the Indonesian right-wing <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> {{that they would be}} able to counter PKI militarily. Guerrilla units and militias under the influence of PKI were ordered to disband. In Madiun a group PKI militaries refused to go along with the disarmament were killed in September the same year. The killings sparked a violent uprising. This provided a pretext to clamp down on the PKI. It was claimed by army sources that PKI had announced the proclamation of the 'Soviet Republic of Indonesia' on 18 September with Musso as its president and Amir Sjarifuddin as its prime minister. At the same time PKI had denounced the uprising and appealed for calm. The uprising was suppressed by republican troops and PKI passed through yet another period of repression. On 30 September Madiun was taken over by republican troops of the Siliwangi division. Thousands of party cadres were killed and 36 000 were imprisoned. Amongst the executed were several leaders including Musso who was killed on 31 October, allegedly while trying to escape from prison. Aidit and Lukman went into exile in the People's Republic of China. However, PKI was not banned and continued to function. The reconstruction of the party began in 1949.|$|E

50|$|Noticing Octavian watching, Caesar shares <b>some</b> <b>confidences</b> {{with his}} grand-nephew. Like Antony, Octavian is {{initially}} confused by Caesar's release of Quintus, but unlike Antony, he quickly works out the real reason: Caesar's terms of surrender {{will be too}} humiliating for Pompey to accept, but his show of clemency will encourage {{the rest of the}} Senators to abandon Pompey and seek Caesar's mercy. Chuckling, Caesar begins to congratulate Octavian on his acumen—then is struck dumb by an attack of epilepsy. Posca quickly hustles his master into an empty closet to wait out the fit, while rejecting Octavian's offer to call for a doctor—at all costs, Caesar must keep his affliction secret. Once he has recovered, Caesar makes Octavian vow never to speak of his condition. However, one of Atia's servants hears the yelling and groaning from the cupboard and, on seeing Octavian and Caesar emerge, leaves to inform Atia.|$|R

He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, [...] "Billy Oliver, Sasa , Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in this yet, so it was important just to get out there." [...] In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time. He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench. He shot 6-of-11 from the field, and 4-of-5 on three-pointers. Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain. If he starts making perimeter shots, then we're that much better. We've seen him where he can make shots in practice and do pretty well. We just needed to get him <b>some</b> <b>confidence</b> and get him into the flow." [...] The game would remain a season-high for him under the scoring category. Frazier was awarded his first start as a shooting guard on November 22, 2009 against Davidson; he registered 7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. He recorded a season-high 34 minutes. He finished the 2009–10 season averaging 5.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.7 turnovers. He played in all 31 regular season games.|$|E

40|$|Bayesian {{shrinkage}} {{analysis is}} the state-of-the-art method for whole genome analysis of quantitative traits. It can estimate the genetic effects {{for the entire}} genome using a dense marker map. The technique is now called genome selection. A nice property of the shrinkage analysis {{is that it can}} estimate effects of QTL as small as explaining 2 % of the phenotypic variance in a typical sample size of 300 – 500 individuals. In most cases, QTL can be detected with simple visual inspection of the entire genome for the effect because the false positive rate is low. As a Bayesian method, no significance test is needed. However, it is still desirable to put <b>some</b> <b>confidences</b> on the estimated QTL effects. We proposed to use the permutation test to draw empirical thresholds to declare significance of QTL under a predetermined genome wide type I error. With the permutation test, Bayesian shrinkage analysis can be routinely used for QTL detection...|$|R
