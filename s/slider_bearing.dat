40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{roughness}} on the load capacity and friction force of hydrodynamic bearings has received considerable interest from scientists and engineers. Surfaces of most engineered materials are textured {{at some level}} either deliberately to achieve some desired effect or produced by wear and friction of surfaces. This thesis analyses the effect of surface roughness and porosity on the load capacity of hydrodynamic bearings. The surface roughness {{is characterized by a}} single sinusoidal wave function. The implementation of sinusoidal roughness model is verified using a verification problem. Reynolds’ lubrication theory, derived from thin-region approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations, is used as the main tool for this study. The performance of a rough <b>slider</b> <b>bearing</b> is compared with a corresponding smooth <b>slider</b> <b>bearing.</b> The presence of roughness tends to increase the load capacity of a <b>slider</b> <b>bearing</b> at high amplitudes and low wavelengths.

40|$|An {{approach}} is developed that simplifies calculation of the dynamic characteristics of a self-acting, gas-lubricated <b>slider</b> <b>bearing</b> system. This technique avoids a lengthy simultaneous solution of the equations of motion of the slider and the time-dependent Reynolds' equation, while providing additional design information that is otherwise unobtainable. The equilibrium pressure distribution in the gas film is obtained using the BunovGalerkin formulation of the finite element method. By considering small perturbations of the <b>slider</b> <b>bearing</b> system about equilibrium, two coupled, second-order partial differential equations are derived, which define the in-phase and out-of-phase perturbation pressures in the gas film. These perturbation pressures are integrated to obtain the frequency dependent, non-symmetrical stiffness and damping matrices for the <b>slider</b> <b>bearing.</b> Using the stiffness and damping properties of the gas bearing and slider support, the equations of motion for the entire <b>slider</b> <b>bearing</b> system are derived. The frequency dependence of the stiffness and damping matrices renders the eigenvalue problem nonlinear, and the eigensolutions are obtained iteratively using Brent's method. Because of the non-symmetrical stiffness and damping matrices, a similarity transformation based {{on the left and}} right modal matrices is used to decouple the equations of motion. This decoupling is approximate because of the frequency dependence of the stiffness and damping matrices, but the resulting damped natural frequencies are shown to be in excellent agreement with published experimental data. Fractions of critical damping obtained for several slider geometries also successfully predict observed instabilities. The mode shapes of slider oscillation, unobtainable with other methods, permit calculation of the center of rotation for the coupled, pitch-heave modes; this information can be used to determine the optimum location for the magnetic transducer. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the response to disk surface displacement, and for the response to a random force applied to the slider body. These forced-response solutions are useful in identifying the critical parameters of slider design. ...|$|E
