5|$|McGoohan was {{reportedly}} {{very pleased with}} {{his role in the}} episode; when his wife Joan McGoohan, who is a real estate broker, helped staff writer Max Pross buy a house, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that Patrick McGoohan was as proud of the episode as anything in his career.|$|E
5|$|After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who {{requested}} {{an address to}} send condolence gifts, cards, or flowers to were told that, despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee, {{there was no longer}} a post-office box mailing address for her in Newton, Kansas. Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Mrs. March, [...] "if <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> yet," [...] and March {{perceived}} {{that she was}} now suddenly far from the mood of philosophic introspection; {{but he had no}} difficulty in following her.|$|R
60|$|She turned {{round and}} a'most {{ran up the}} road, with Ted follering 'er and begging of 'er {{not to be so}} hasty, and afore they parted <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> that 'er name was. Emma White, and promised to meet 'im there the next night at seven.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{she could}} be sure of Jethro's sympathy, though he could not express it in words. Yet <b>she</b> had not <b>told</b> <b>him</b> for this. <b>She</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> much as the telling had hurt her, because she feared to cut him more deeply by her silence.|$|R
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
60|$|Cornelia {{was left}} to no better counsels than those of Charmian Maybough, and these were {{disabled}} from what {{they might have been}} at their best, by Cornelia's failure to be frank with her. If she was wronging Charmian by making her a half-confidant only, she could not be more open with her than with Ludlow, and she must let her think that <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything until <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything.|$|R
60|$|Frank's {{presence}} of mind had returned to him. He knew all about Rachel and her father. <b>She</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything.|$|R

5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, Beshear {{unveiled}} his promised {{legislation that}} would allow casino gambling in Kentucky. Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state – seven {{at each of the}} state's horse racetracks and five additional free-standing casinos – and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent. After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine. One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to free-standing casinos. A competing measure, drafted by House Majority Whip Rob Wilkey and Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark, would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks. In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives. The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for voting against the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she would vote for the proposals and then voted against them. Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.|$|E

5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The Prince refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private word <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E

60|$|Miss Hartley endeavoured to {{turn the}} conversation, but in vain. In less than ten minutes, with a little skilful prompting, <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all.|$|R

6000|$|... "She {{has known}} him for about two weeks," [...] Cartwright rejoined. [...] "Perhaps it's long enough. Shillito's what Canadians call a looker and Barbara's a romantic fool. I've no doubt he's found out she'll inherit some money; it's {{possible}} <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> Now I come to think about it, she was off somewhere all the afternoon, and {{it looks as if}} she had promised the fellow the evening." ...|$|R

60|$|With {{that she}} {{showed him the}} way, and the prince went and did just as <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> After dinner they lay down to rest.|$|R
