Bacteria and protozoa consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. sugars, fats, and organic short-chain carbon molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form cells of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0°C and 40°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature.

Reduction of processing losses must be considered during the manufacture of the product to obtain the greatest economic returns and to ensure the lowest amount of polluting emuents. Processing plants with low product losses will have a low amount of waste. There is a demand for more and better finished products and also a demand for maintaining and {{improving the quality of}} U. S. public waters. The demand for increased water quality has been instrumental in the formation of a U. S. national policy that demands substantial treatment of processing wastes before they can be discharged to U. S. public waters. The potato-processing industry has developed methods for providing effective removal of <b>settleable</b> and dissolved <b>solids</b> from potato-processing wastes. The types, sizes, layouts, and details of treatment systems must be carefully considered and planned to obtain maximum benefits from the investment. In some cases this portion of a processing plant will be as important as the proper selection of the product process line.

40|$|What is a {{low-pressure}} pipe system? A {{low-pressure pipe}} (LPP) {{system is a}} shallow, pressure-dosed soil absorption system with a network of small diameter perforated pipes placed in narrow trenches. Originating in North Carolina and Wisconsin, LPP systems were developed {{as an alternative to}} conventional soil absorption systems to eliminate problems such as: clogging of the soil from localized overloading, mechanical sealing of the soil trench during construction, anaerobic conditions due to continuous saturation, and a high water table. The LPP system has the following design features that overcome these problems: 1) shallow placement, 2) narrow trenches, 3) continuous trenching, 4) pressure-dosed with uniform distribution of the effluent, 5) design based on areal loading, and 6) resting and reaeration between doses. The main components of an LPP system are: • a septic tank or an aerobic unit; • pumping (dosing) chamber (submersible effluent pump, level controls, high water alarm, and supply manifold); and • small diameter distribution laterals with small perforations (holes). The septic tank is where <b>settleable</b> and floatable <b>solids</b> are removed and primary treatment occurs. Partially clarified effluent then flows by gravity to a pumping chamber where it is stored until it reaches the level of A General Overview the upper float control, which turns the pump on. The level controls are set for a specific pumping sequence of one to two times daily, allowing breaks in between doses for the soil to absorb the wastewater. However, the dosing mechanisms and frequency may vary for different systems. The pump moves the effluent through the supply line and manifold to the distribution laterals under low pressure. The laterals are a network of PVC pipes that have small, drilled holes through which the wastewater is distributed evenly. Th...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{industrial}} organizations {{is one of}} the elemental facets of change in modern industrial societies because of their power and the immense volume of waste, solid and liquid that comes from industrial production. Change is a complex phenomena at all levels of analysis; industrial changes in water use are preceded by general societal changes as to priorities and values regarding economic production as opposed to living quality or a clean physical environment. Numerous agencies and organizations, private and public, now exist {{for the sole purpose of}} changing and regulating private and public water use. The conservation ethic has been part of society for some time but it gained power only in the last decade to the point where fundamental issues related to the organization of industrial production have come the fore. Any study of industrial change, therefore, has to consider the relationship that industrial organizations have to such groups. Under the model of development emphasizing economic growth per se, there was little if any pressure upon industries to consider the affect of their production on external factors like water quality. There is pressure and the pressure can be expected to continue. Water has always been one of man’s most vital resources and its importance has increased as industrial and agricultural development began to accelerate. Water is, at the same time, basic to human health and consumption, a basic ingredient of agriculture, of public recreation, and of course, a principal input to industrial production of all kinds. Industry uses more water as direct and indirect input to production than any other single source. As a result of its many uses and the mutual dependence of various groups upon water but with decidedly different goals and responsibilities, water use has become a focal point of controversy and change. Fundamental change is in the offering in terms of past and current debates about the relative responsibility of industry to clean public water after they use it in vast quantities and usually at rather low economic cost. Certainly, there are now differences among groups calling for changes {{in industrial}} water use and within industry itself as to what kinds of changes are to be made. There is, however, one constant factor. Industry and other groups, private and public, can no longer use water as they have in the past. This study is an attempt to further understand the process by which industrial organizations change the way they dispose of waste. Substantively, the relationship of organizational characteristics to rates of change in waste procedure is of interest. A general model of change is envisioned. The two major forces creating change in industrial organizations are the internal pressures within the organization that result from such factors as the complexity of its division of labor and production technology, and the kinds of pressure the organization faces as the result of powerful and aggressive regulatory agencies and other groups. Finally, the nature of dependence the firm has upon water affects change. To test hypotheses and find answers to questions, a comparative study of firms in different industrial categories w as made. Each category was selected because of its dependence upon water as a production input and by the importance of its operation for water pollution. Industries were studied at two points in time. In the first phase, the primary interest was in measuring the internal characteristics of the organization – how complex their structure was, the nature of their production technology, and the rates of change they had experiences in water use and production over the last ten years. The principal investigator then waited a year in order to measure the degree of change that the company experience in water use and waste procedures for that year. The nature of the relationship of the organization to outside pressures such as regulation was also measured in the second phase. The study, therefore, estimated changes in the company by production managers over a ten year period prior to contact and the changes they report for a single year. One-hundred and twenty-eight organizations were studied in the first phase. They were selected systematically but not randomly. It was, in other words, a purposive rather than a probability sample. One hundred and two organizations were chosen from the original 128 to be included n the second phase of the analysis. Industrial firms selected had high volumes of waste water, high bio-chemical oxygen demand because of their wastes, and produced substantial amounts of <b>settleable</b> and suspended <b>solids.</b> Twenty-eight of the firms studied could be categorized as producing food and kindred products. Eight industries produced paper and allied products. Twenty-nine of the companies could be classified as producers of chemicals or allied products. There were seven petroleum companies and thirty others that could be included among manufacturing categories of machinery and transportation equipment. In the first year of the project, the principal investigator visited several firms of various sizes and problems with water use in order to pre-test the data collection procedures. As a result of this experience a standardized interview schedule and questionnaire was developed and administered to executives in each of the firms studied. These interviews along with company and public records were the study’s primary source of data. The interview schedules were highly standardized using many items modified from other studies of industrial organizations. After searching the literature dealing with industrial organizations in numerous academic fields, visiting firms and speaking with their managers, and with professionals acquainted with industrial organizations, the following categories were used as the basis for measure of change: product design and manufacture; training and qualifications of employees; allocation of capital resources; use of scientific and engineering consultants; waste processing and equipment; and marketing. The model of organizational change developed includes as its primary ingredients the structural attributes of organizations, pressures from the social environment, and use of physical resources. Since natural resources are obviously important to industrial production, changes in the quality and supply of those resources ultimately generate change in the organization that uses them. Conclusions reached as the result of model studies are as follows: Industrial change is a multi-dimensional variable. Changes in waste disposal procedures or pollution abatement methods are related to changes in other dimensions of the organization’s structure. Employee training and development is an important part of pollution abatement as new practices introduced into production or the adoption of new equipment require employees to change work practices or learn how to operate and repair new machines. In many cases, new chemical tests are needed for the detection of harmful chemicals, minerals, or bacteria. The work of biologists, chemists, bacteriologists, chemical engineers, hydraulic engineers, civil engineers, and other professional are basic to adequate industry waste disposal techniques. Professional consultation and scientific knowledge has been a key point in deciding pollution issues and will continue to be so. Product quality control is related to waste disposal programs, as in actual manufacture of the product, product design, and allocation of capital resources. In short, industrial organizations are systems and like all systems the part interdependent to the degree that changes in one dimension produces changes throughout the system. Companies are more receptive to change as they increase in size and structural complexity. The latter refers primarily to the rates of consultation with professionals, how specialized the company is, and the complexity of work procedures. Industry-agency relationship also make a difference. The degree of regulation, pressure and frequency of contact are all associated with rates of general change and change in waste control procedures. The activity of executives in their local communities is also related to change as is the way in which the industry uses water and disposes of waste. Frequency of contact between industries and public agencies emerges as one of the most important variable sin understanding changes in industrial pollution control practices. Although industries may have the resources to reduce their pollution, they are not likely to do so unless there is consistent contact and pressure from public agencies. Industry-agency conflict over environmental regulation is now everyday news. There is no question that State and federal bureaus have grown in power with respect to their ability to establish policy while local governments enforce such policy. Companies need certainty in order to plan for the future and deal with present circumstances. As a result, efforts to control events that would effect their production and profits are to be expected. When policy is formulated at the state or Federal level, there is greater probability that such policy will last than if it were locally legislated. Additionally, competitors in other states or regions will be subject to the same regulations. This was the logical framework upon which executives from large companies based their judgments. Some small companies also felt more secure with state and Federal regulation than local as they expressed concern over the ability of large companies to influence local decision-making. Company participation in local affairs has become even more important since the rise of the environmental movement and public concern about water and air quality. Challenges to local firms that pollute water as a result of their operation has become increasingly commonplace. Furthermore, changes that are suggested by public and private groups effect methods of operation and production. Although local private groups have formed in many instances to challenge firms, the most common strategy of these groups has been to pressure local government, state and Federal bureaus to legislate industry behavior or enforce existent legislation. As a result, government at all levels has become an active participant in environmental management, state and Federal more so than local. Although company executives are active participants in local affairs, they are somewhat dubious about the depth of local support for their company’s position on pollution control. Furthermore, they communicate as much or more with state and Federal officials, other companies, business and trade associations than they do with city and county officials. Finally, local government is given a very minor role in the establishment of policy. Local government is, however, strongly supported by the same executives as enforcers of policy. If past research showing that industries and business generally dominates local decision-making is correct, it is clearly in the interest of local business to have city and county officials be responsible for enforcement as business should be able to influence the judgment of these officials more so than representatives of state and Federal bureaus. Companies want regulatory policy to be consistent over time. Since policy developed at the local level can be overturned by state and Federal agencies, company preference for state, and especially, Federal control in policy-formation is logically understandable. Water use and waste disposal are basic linkages between industries and local communities. Companies get most of their water from community wells and dispose of most of their liquid wastes in city and county sewers. For this reason, it would be expected that companies will work so that their viewpoints will be represented in policy-formation about water systems, sewer systems, tax rates and long-range planning about community water resources.

50|$|Typically fresh {{wastewater}} has a musty odor and is cloudy with a grayish coloration as it {{is fresh}} and untreated. When deprived of oxygen the water becomes black from further with a foul odor. The odor is that of rotten eggs and the water becomes corrosive inviting problems to form in the pipes, so usually treatment workers {{try to keep it}} from getting too oxygen deprived while in pipes. Temperature can be anywhere between 45-75 F, but the temperature of water entering the system usually does not affect the pond, because it is designed to handle a variety of temperatures. The pH of the system is a huge factor in pond water characteristics with the water either being acidic 0.0-7.0 or basic 7.0-14.0. The pH levels are monitored {{to make sure that the}} water does not get too acidic and start to corrode the pipes. It is most desirable for the water to be more basic so as to prevent corrosion from the acid. Another set of characteristics is the contents of the water, like solids, suspended solids and dissolved solids. Dissolved solids are able to pass through most filters whereas suspended solids are just particles suspended in the water column easily caught in strainers or filters. Solids is just a general term for what would remain if all of the water was evaporated from a sample of the wastewater.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{realistic}} values of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), an ultrasonic flow meter and an automatic water sampler were installed at the basin outlet for three Reno tributaries (Bologna Apennine, Italy). The basins have a similar geological setting: in the Sillaro basin, however, clays represent the dominant feature; in the Lavino basin, sandstone and clay marl are widely present; and {{the main part of}} the Savena watershed is characterised by sandrock, pebbly sandstone and clay marls. These differences are recognisable in the particle size distribution of the suspended sediment samples collected in these basins. The aim of this work is to estimate the SSCs of river water samples with two indirect methods, turbidity measurement and free <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> in Imhoff cones, and the relations with suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution. Alongside these investigations, laboratory analyses were performed in order to validate these methods under controlled conditions. The turbidity measurements were highly significant, but their reliability was influenced by the concentration and the particle size distribution. In order to estimate the SSCs, it was necessary to establish specific regression curves for each stream. The estimate of the SSC obtained through a free <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> analysis was not only reliable but also less sensitive to sample characteristics. The measure of the <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> after 1 and 24 h presented a constant relationship in all the samples from the three streams, due to the compaction of the sediment.

40|$|Because of the {{presence}} of significant numbers and types of bacteria, enzymes, yeasts, and other fungi and microorganisms in typical residential and commercial wastewaters, the use of septic system additives containing these or any other ingredi-ents is not recommended. The benefits of consumer products sold as septic system cleaners, degraders, decomposers, deodorizers, organic digesters, or enhancers are not significant or have not been demonstrated conclusively, depending on the product. Some of these products can actually interfere with treatment processes, affect biological decomposition of wastes, contribute to system clogging, and contaminate ground water. The septic tank/soil absorption field system is the most commonly used onsite wastewater treatment system in the United States. It is relatively low in cost, has no moving parts, and requires little maintenance. Septic tanks have a number of important functions, including: • Remove oils, grease and <b>settleable</b> <b>solids.</b> The septic tank is designed to provide quiescent conditions over a sufficient time period to allow <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> to sink {{to the bottom of the}} tank and floatable solids, oils, and grease to rise to the surface. The result is a middle layer of partially clarified effluent that exits the tank to the soil absorption field. • Store settleable and floatable material. Tanks are generously sized according to projected wastewater flow and composition to accumulate sludge and scum at the bottom and top of the tank, respectively. Tanks require pumping at infrequent intervals (e. g., 1 to 7 years), depending on sludge and scum accumulation rates. • Digest/decompose organic matter. In an anaerobic environment, facultative and anaerobic bacteria can reduce retained organic molecules to soluble compounds and gases, including H...|$|E
40|$|Septic system {{additive}} vendors often {{market their}} products as necessities that improve septic system performance or repair failing systems. Rather than address specific products, this publication examines general categories of these additives. This publication also describes the treatment functions of septic {{systems and the}} available scientific data regarding the effectiveness of septic system additives. Treatment Functions of Septic Systems Septic tanks {{have a number of}} important functions, including: • Removal of oils, fats, and <b>settleable</b> <b>solids.</b> Septic tanks are designed to provide quiescent conditions over time to allow <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> to sink {{to the bottom of the}} tank (sludge) and floatable solids (scum — e. g., oils and fats) to rise to the surface (See Figure 1). The result is a middle layer of relatively clarified effluent that exits the tank and enters the soil absorption field. • Storage of settleable and floatable material. Tanks are generously sized according to projected wastewater flow and composition in order to accumulate sludge and scum at the bottom and top of the tank, respectively. Tanks require pumping at infrequent intervals (e. g., 1 to 7 years), depending on sludge and scum accumulation rates. • Digestion/decomposition of organic matter. In an anaerobic environment (without oxygen), bacteria reduce most organic matter to soluble compounds and gasses, including hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), ammonia (NH 3), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), and methane (CH 4). This significantly reduces the volume of sludge that must be stored in the tank. Soil absorption fields also have important functions, including: • Absorption and dispersal of wastewater. In a typical residence, 50 to 90 gallons of wastewater are produced Volatilized gasse...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to a high}} {{population}} growth that has been occurring in Palmas and due to land use changes that are caused by this {{population growth}} and development, {{the goal of this}} paper was to study the behavior of four physical parameters of water quality of the Água Fria watershed. The parameters were turbidity, total suspended solids, <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> and total dissolved solids. Eight gauging stations were established and the water samples were monthly collected from February/ 1998 to February/ 1999. The water bodies of the watershed were generally in good condition concerning these four parameters. However, there were some cases of seasonal irregularity of some parameters, as well as no correlation among some of studied parameters. This might be an indicator of some impacts like accelerated erosion due to a misuse of the lands and misuse of local water resources...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{polishing}} effluent {{produced during}} infrared optics manufacture were analyzed. Their particle size, composition, Zeta potential, {{chemical oxygen demand}} (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> were determined. Feasibility of treatment methods such as ultrafiltration (UF) and coagulation/flocculation was investigated to reduce both COD and TSS. It was found that effluents consisted of a suspension of micro- and nanoparticles. Effluent particle size distribution reflected the removal rate of the originating polishing process. Their composition was primarily germanium and other polished substrates as well as polishing abrasives. The effluent Zeta potential was highly negative and prevented particle settling. COD of all specimens was very high, which prevented sewage discharge. Laboratory-scale trials using UF showed substantial COD abatement of up to 74. 1 %. TSS was reduced to zero after UF. Comparable coagulation/flocculation COD abatement was demonstrated for the highest COD sample...|$|E
