5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automobile body sheets mainly resist {{impact and}} pressure. However, the fatigue {{property}} {{is one of}} the main factors with regard to properties of <b>sheet</b> <b>steels.</b> Continuous vibration happens all over the <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> (especially chassis) while the vehicle is in motion. And the fatigue property becomes particularly important in the condition above. Fatigue tests are conducted to four kinds of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> for automobile in this paper. The fatigue lives of samples from <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> are obtained according to the various stresses. The inferior limits of fatigue life and the inferior limits of fatigue strength under the higher stresses are acquired by the computation of fatigue data. Furthermore, the test results show that there is a certain relationship among the tensile strength, yielding strength and inferior limit of fatigue strength for these <b>sheet</b> <b>steels.</b> This paper is of certain reference significance for other similar test...|$|R

Subsequently, <b>Sheet</b> <b>Steel</b> officers agreed on July 13, 1901 to recognize the union at 18 of the company's 23 nonunion plants. But AA president T.J.

A meeting between Morgan and Shaffer (accompanied by AA secretary John Williams) resulted in an additional wage agreement.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and screwed connections of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. The proposed design equations are suitable for bolted and screwed connections assembled using thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> of thickness ranged from 0. 35 to 3. 20 mm. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

25|$|A fairly recent {{class of}} firearms, purpose-designed {{insurgency}} weapons first appeared during World War II, {{in the form}} of such arms as the FP-45 Liberator and the Sten submachine gun. Designed to be inexpensive, since they were to be airdropped or smuggled behind enemy lines, insurgency weapons were designed for use by guerrilla and insurgent groups. Most insurgency weapons are of simple design, typically made of <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> stampings, which are then folded into shape and welded.

25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted <b>sheet</b> <b>steel,</b> Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel tapering I-beams bolted together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- back facing each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there.
