5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the station {{is at the bottom}} of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office exists within the small concourse. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are footbridges on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative {{entrance to the}} station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> There also exists a subway which provides step-free access to all eight platforms in use at the station and with platform 7, at the south end of which is another entrance serving the <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal - there are metal and glass shelters on each platform, and some seating.

There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A small pay and display car park with 30 spaces is {{to the north of the}} station, as are racks for eight bicycles. CCTV cameras are in operation {{at the station}}.

25|$|In 1974 {{the level}} {{crossing}} {{in the throat}} of the station giving access to Romney Lock was closed and replaced by a footbridge.

Each station {{has at least one}} Passenger Help Point and all <b>stations</b> and <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> have CCTV. All stations on the branch are unstaffed, and at first lacked any ticket issuing facilities; but in late 2009 a Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress self-service ticket machine was installed at each station.|$|R
50|$|The station ruins were fenced off {{and partly}} built {{over by a}} growing Biffa waste {{disposal}} plant by 2010. The plant has been built during the 1990s {{in one of the}} <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> while the buildings of several small enterprises occupy the other side.|$|R
25|$|The {{ticket hall}} for the railway station opens off {{the centre of}} {{eastern side of the}} concourse, and in turn gives access via ticket {{barriers}} to a pedestrian overbridge with stairs and lifts down to the railway platforms. A second concourse opens off the main concourse {{at the southern end of}} its eastern side, and this runs parallel and to the south of the platforms, giving access by stairs, lifts and escalators to the tram stop, the <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> taxi rank, vehicular pick-up and drop-off points and Queen Street. The tram stop spans the station from north to south to the east of the main entrance, at a higher level than the concourse, and to the east of that a second footbridge links the platforms and carries the previously referred to footpath 28.|$|E
25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>park),</b> the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|E

500|$|Blocks O–R of the {{development}} make up Brighton <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> This has two decks, a ground area of [...] and 600 spaces, of which 26 are for disabled drivers. A pick-up and drop-off point with motorcycle parking and a turning circle is situated between the car park and the side entrance to the station. This was {{the first part of}} the New England Quarter to be completed; most of the work was undertaken by the Adenstar Construction Group, based in nearby Portslade. There was a contractual obligation to provide 600 spaces, although the form which this had to take was not specified and various proposals were considered, including a taller multi-storey structure with more floors and a much smaller ground area. During the construction works, a temporary car park was provided on land nearby.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Royal Mail began {{construction}} of the West of England Post Office Rail Depot just {{to the east of}} the station, taking over some of the <b>station</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> to provide a platform and warehouse for postal trains. The [...] building opened in 2002, with the Royal Mail stating it would save [...] of lorry journeys per year on local roads. However, the depot closed only two years later in 2004, when the Post Office ceased to use the rail network. Royal Mail offered the terminal for use by freight companies, but there were no takers. In 2008 it was reopened as a Network Rail maintenance training centre in a £2,500,000 project which saw the construction of a mezzanine floor, a welding workshop and a [...] extension.|$|E

2500|$|... 9 August 1967. A train hauled by {{locomotive}} No 5 Hercules {{driven by}} Jim Brodie over-ran the terminus at Hythe, {{resulting in a}} number of minor injuries.

The driver could not subsequently recall whether his head had struck the stonework of the bridge, or whether he had been hit by an object thrown from the bridge.
