5|$|Beginning {{with the}} torture of a dog {{as a child in}} the First stage of cruelty, Nero {{progresses}} to beating his horse as a man in the Second stage of cruelty, and then to robbery, seduction, and murder in Cruelty in perfection. Finally, in The reward of cruelty, he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the gallows after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by surgeons in the anatomical theatre.|$|E
25|$|The ramp {{entrance}} {{is known as}} one of the most highly regarded traditions among band members, as well as extremely physically demanding. The ramp entrance starts typically around 19:45 on the countdown clock. There is a trailer video shown on the scoreboard prior to the band emerging from the ramp tunnel. At the end of this video, a Diamond Ohio appears on the screen. This is the cue for the percussion section to <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the ramp.|$|E
500|$|Two skeletons to {{the rear}} left and right of the print are {{labelled}} as James Field, a well-known boxer who also featured on a poster in the second plate, and Macleane, an infamous highwayman. Both men were hanged shortly before the print was published (Macleane in 1750 and Field in 1751). The skeletons seemingly point to one another. Field's name above the skeleton on the left {{may have been a}} last minute substitution for [...] "GENTL HARRY" [...] referring to Henry Simms, also known as Young Gentleman Harry. Simms was a robber who was executed in 1747. The motif of the lone [...] "good man" [...] is carried through to this final plate, where one of the academics points at the skeleton of James Field, indicating the inevitable outcome for those who <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the path of cruelty.|$|E

2500|$|Justice White added a {{slippery}} slope warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws: And if respondent's submission {{is limited to the}} voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct [...] while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home. We are unwilling to <b>start</b> <b>down</b> that road.|$|E
2500|$|During the campaign, a {{controversy}} arose when Barbour chose {{to speak at}} the Blackhawk Rally, a fundraiser for the Blackhawk [...] "council school" [...] in Blackhawk, Mississippi. Such [...] "council schools", also referred to in Mississippi lexicon as [...] "academies", were established by the White Citizens' Council movement in reaction to the demands for racial integration by the Civil Rights Movement. The Blackhawk rally was hosted by the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). A photograph of Barbour with CCC members appeared on the CCC webpage, and some commentators and pundits demanded that Barbour ask for his picture to be removed from the site, but Barbour refused. Barbour stated that [...] "Once you <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the slippery slope of saying, 'That person can't be for me,' then where do you stop? ... I don't care who has my picture. My picture's in the public domain." [...] Barbour's Democratic opponent, then-governor Ronnie Musgrove, declined to be critical, stating that he had also attended Blackhawk rallies in the past, and would have done so that year except for a scheduling conflict. Historically, both Democrats and Republicans have participated in Blackhawk rallies.|$|E

60|$|He {{had reached}} the second floor, {{and was about to}} <b>start</b> <b>down</b> for the street when he caught sight of a man {{standing}} on the stone steps below. The man was Jackson Walters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} thought of that," [...] he said. [...] "You and Rignauld will <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the trail and stop any man you come across, though I guess they're back in their tents or in the bush by now." ...|$|E
60|$|The large mysterious man <b>started</b> <b>down</b> {{the path}} toward the glow, and Father and Mother {{followed}} him uncomfortably.|$|R

60|$|The whole river {{seemed to}} pick itself up and <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the stream. With the {{increasing}} motion the ice-wall broke {{in a hundred}} places, and from {{up and down the}} shore came the rending and crashing of uprooted trees.|$|E
60|$|Each bobsled was {{to carry}} six cadets, {{and they were}} to <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the hill side by side, the Blue Moon keeping well {{to the right and}} the Yellow Streak well to the left. The first sled to cross a mark located out on the lake was to be {{declared}} the winner.|$|E
6000|$|... "It might be," [...] {{replied the}} trader. [...] "You've {{got a good}} chance of finding out. Nas Ta Bega is the man. You stick to that Indian. ... Well, we <b>start</b> <b>down</b> here into this ca√±on, and we go down some, I reckon. In half an hour you'll see sago-lilies and Indian paint-brush and {{vermilion}} cactus." ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly they <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the field, the Colonel on the right, George in {{the middle}} and Edward Cossey on the left.|$|R
60|$|So Peter Rabbit <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the Lone Little Path {{through the}} wood {{as fast as}} he could go after Striped Chipmunk.|$|R
60|$|DEAR AUNT BETSEY,--Ma has {{not written}} you, {{because she did}} not know when I would get <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the river again....|$|R
60|$|Virginia was motionless, {{with her}} back to the intruder, She was frozen by a presentiment. As she saw her father <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the steps, she yearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she knew not what. Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly as ever. And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Tell {{him when}} he comes back we have gone down {{to have a look at}} the rapid. Tom, you may as well stay here.

6000|$|... "Bess, here's the bad place, {{the place}} I told you about, with the cut steps. You <b>start</b> <b>down,</b> leading your burro. Take {{your time and}} hold on to him if you slip. I've got a rope on him and a half-hitch on this point of rock, so I can let him down safely. Coming up here was a killing job. But it'll be easy going down." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} three {{when they left}} the tent and <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the trail, {{carrying}} nothing but a few toilet articles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, good-night, fellows," [...] he said, and <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the hill, with sixty exasperated and grimly {{determined}} stampeders at his heels.|$|R
60|$|So {{the cries}} ran {{on as the}} two bobsleds slowly {{gathered}} momentum and <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the long slope leading to Clearwater Lake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't folks fools," [...] Shorty giggled back. [...] "Say, Smoke, they ain't nothin' in hard graft. A geezer that'd {{work his}} hands {{these days is}} a--well, a geezer. The world's sure bustin' full an' dribblin' over the edges with fools a-honin' to be {{separated}} from their dust.

60|$|I bayed {{them for}} an hour. My voice grew from hoarse to hoarser, and finally failed in my throat. The lions {{immediately}} grew restless again. The lower one hissed, spat and growled at me, and made many attempts to <b>start</b> <b>down,</b> {{each one of}} which I frustrated by throwing stones under the tree. At length he made one more determined effort, turned head downward, and stepped from branch to branch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{the guerrillas}} sure will get their nerve back, and come sneakin' on our trail {{or try to}} head us off by ambushin'," [...] replied Ambrose. [...] "That's their way. Otherwise three cowboys couldn't bluff a whole gang like that. Gene knows the nature of Greasers. They're white-livered. But I reckon we're in more danger now than before, unless we get a good <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the mountain. There! Gene's callin'. Come! Hurry!" ...|$|E
