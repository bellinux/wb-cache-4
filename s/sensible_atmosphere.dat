Current efforts have focused on validating the direct aerosol optical depth measurements. Efforts have been primarily focused on characterizing the instrument angular response, as well as validating measurements of aerosol optical depth, and water-vapor columnar abundance. Recent work has been aimed at refining the analysis procedures. Comparisons of the Advanced Sun Photometer AOD measurements have been made with AOD readings taken with a commercial Microtops II handheld sun photometer. Background: Dust is one of the primary drivers in the Martian atmosphere, second only to carbon dioxide. Understanding the characteristics and distribution of Martian dust is not only essential to understanding the climatology and weather of Mars, but could provide data essential for the development of future manned and unmanned missions to Mars. Previous surface observations of Mars have been largely performed by instruments developed for geological, navigational, and engineering applications. A sun photometer instrument dedicated to the measurement of Martian dust would considerably increase our understanding of the atmospheric physics and chemistry of the Martian atmosphere, providing a detailed knowledge of the composition and phase of atmospheric gasses, the size and distribution aerosols, as well as the upwelling and down welling radiative flux. Continuous measurements throughout the diurnal and seasonal planetary cycles are needed, since aerosols in the Martian atmosphere vary spatially and temporally. Although planetary orbiters can be used to obtain these measurements, the revisit times/rates of these orbiters are limited by their orbital geometry. Concept: the CCD array records both the diffuse light entering the cone as well as the direct solar beam. Most sun photometers incorporate a rigid tracking mechanism to follow the sun. The tracking mechanism may provide a point of failure during the entry, descent, and landing phase or later during the operational phase due to the harsh entry/planetary environment. Making these systems more robust usually requires increasing the instruments size, weight, and/or power requirements. Eliminating the need for a tracking mechanism can significantly reduce instrument weight while increasing system robustness. The Advanced Sun Photometer described here will use an optical system to provide a hemispherical field of view, removing the need for a sun tracking mechanism. A CCD array is placed {{at the base of the}} optical system captures and records the light. Measurements at specific wavelengths are achieved by interposing various interference filters into the light path by means of a filter wheel.

40|$|Scientific Background A {{fundamental}} problem {{in evaluating the}} exchange of heat, momentum, and gases (including water vapor and carbon dioxide) across the ocean-atmosphere interface is the “cool skin of the ocean. ” Inherently a transient phenomenon because of the breaking of waves, boundary-layer turbulence, rainfall, and other disturbances, the skin layer re-establishes itself quickly {{so that it is}} present under most conditions. Located at the upper limit of the molecular boundary layer, the skin temperature is generally a few tenths of a degree cooler than the temperature a few millimeters below it because of heat loss by sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as outgoing longwave radiative fluxes (Robinson et al. 1984). The recent results of Van Scoy et al. (1995) show that failure to account for the skin effect leads to an underestimation of the- 1 global air-sea CO 2 flux of between 0. 17 and 0. 4 GtC yr, which is a significant fraction of the total exchange, estimated- 1 to be ~ 2. 2 GtC yr (Tans et al. 1990). This is a consequence of the temperature dependence of the solubility of CO 2 in sea water. There are two main reasons for the spread in the results of Van Scoy et al. : knowledge of the surface wind speed distributions and the response of the skin temperature gradients (and the attendant exchange coefficients). The turbulent heat exchange between the ocean and <b>atmosphere</b> (<b>sensible</b> and latent, i. e., evaporative) is controlled by the skin temperature, whereas the conventional parameterizations are applied to bulk temperatures, simply because these are more readily available. The parameterizations (the bulk aerodynamic formulae) are strongly dependent on the air-sea temperature difference, which is generally only a few degrees over much of the world’s oceans. Discrepancies between the bulk and ski...|$|R

40|$|Snow melt runoff is an {{important}} factor in runoff generation for most Utah rivers and a large contributer to Utah 2 ̆ 7 s water supply and periodically flooding. The melting of snow is driven by fluxes of energy into the snow during warm periods. These consist of radiant energy from the sun and <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>sensible</b> and latent heat transfers due to turbulent energy exchanges at the snow surface and a relatively small ground flux from below. The turbulent energy exchanges are also responsible for sublimation from the snow surface, particularly in arid environments, and result in a loss of snow water equivalent available for melt. The cooling of the snowpack resulting for sublimation also delays the formation of melt runoff. This paper describes measurements and mathematical modeling done to quantify the sublimation from snow. Measurements were made at the Utah State University drainage and evapotranspiration research farm. I attempted to measure sublimation directly using weighing lysimeters. Energy balance components were measured, by measuring incoming and reflected radiation, wind, temperature and humidity gradients. An energy balance snowmelt model was tested against these measurements. The model uses a lumped representation of the snowpack with two state variables, namely, water equivalent and energy content relative to a reference state of water in the solid phase at 0 degrees Celcius. This energy content is used to determine snowpack average temperature or liquid fraction. The model is driven by inputs of air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation. The model uses physically based calculations of radiative, sensible, latent and advective heat exchanges. An equilibrium parameterization of snow surface temperature accounts for differences between snow surface temperature and average snowpack temperature without having to introduce additional state variables. This is achieved by incorporating the snow surface thermal conductance, which with respect to heat flux is equivalent to stomatal and aerodynamic conductances used to calculate evapotranspiration from vegetation. Melt outflow is a function of the liquid fraction, using Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law. This allows the model to account for continued melt outflow even when the energy balance is negative. The purpose of the measurements presented here was to test the sublimation and turbulent exchange parameterizations in the model. However the weighing lysimeters used to measure sublimation suffered from temperature sensitive oscillations that mask short term sublimation measurements. I have therefore used the measured data to test the models capability to represent the overall seasonal accumulation and ablation of snow...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} joint calculations using a 3 D atmospheric {{general circulation}} model, an ocean model, and a sea ice evolution model. The {{purpose of the}} work is to analyze a seasonal and annual evolution of sea ice, long-term variability of a model ice cover, and its sensitivity to some parameters of model as well to define atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction. Results of 100 years simulations of Arctic basin sea ice evolution are analyzed. There are significant (about 0. 5 m) inter-annual fluctuations of an ice cover. The ice - <b>atmosphere</b> <b>sensible</b> heat flux reduced by 10 % leads to the growth of average sea ice thickness within the limits of 0. 05 m – 0. 1 m. However in separate spatial points the thickness decreases up to 0. 5 m. An analysis of the seasonably changing average ice thickness with decreasing, as compared to the basic variant by 0. 05 of clear sea ice albedo and that of snow shows the ice thickness reduction in a range from 0. 2 m up to 0. 6 m, and the change maximum falls for the summer season of intensive melting. The spatial distribution of ice thickness changes shows, that on the large part of the Arctic Ocean there was a reduction of ice thickness down to 1 m. However, there is also an area of some increase of the ice layer basically in a range up to 0. 2 m (Beaufort Sea). The 0. 05 decrease of sea ice snow albedo leads to reduction of average ice thickness approximately by 0. 2 m, and this value slightly depends on a season. In the following experiment the ocean – ice thermal interaction influence on the ice cover is estimated. It is carried out by increase of a heat flux from ocean to the bottom surface of sea ice by 2 W/sq. m in comparison with base variant. The analysis demonstrates, that the average ice thickness reduces in a range from 0. 2 m to 0. 35 m. There are small seasonal changes of this value. The numerical experiments results have shown, that an ice cover and its seasonal evolution rather strongly depend on varied parameters. The spatial and seasonal structure of changes has rather complex non-uniform character. There are great areas of changes with opposite signs. This is due to nonlinear behavior of feedback and interactions in model system including an atmosphere, a sea ice, and an ocean. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the energy balance of the earth's surface with a special {{emphasis}} on practical applications. A simple picture of the energy exchange processes that take place at the ground is the following. Per unit time and area an amount of radiant energy is supplied to the surface. This radiation originates partly from the sun, but an~ other fraction is coming from the atmosphere (= infra-red radiation emitted by clouds, water vapour and CO 2 ). From these gain terms the following losses must be subtracted: (a) the reflected solar radiation and (b) the infra-red radiation emitted by the surface itself. The final result is that a net amount of radiant energy is received by the surface, simply denoted as net radiation. At the ground net radiation is used to heat the ground (soil heat flux), to evaporate liquid water (evaporation), and to heat the <b>atmosphere</b> (<b>sensible</b> heat flux). In this simple picture we have neglected minor terms such as the energy used by the plants for their photosynthesis. Due to the high value of the latent heat of vaporization, the energy needed for evaporation is often an important term in the energy balance. In addition the energy balance of the earth's surface is linked with the water budget of both the atmosphere and the earth's surface, through the evaporation at the ground. Several practical questions in agriculture, hydrology and meteorology require information m the energy balance of the surface. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to find solutions for some of these problems. In hydrology one is mainly concerned in evaporation averaged over 1 day or more on a regional scale. Generally, this refers to land surfaces, but the evaporation of inland lakes or reservoirs is also of interest. In this context we also mention the problem of thermal pollution of open water bodies by industry or power plants. For this the so-called natural water temperature must be known, which is the temperature of the water in the hypothetical case that there is no artificial heating. It appears that this temperature depends mainly m the energy balance at the surface. In Chapter VI a model dealing with this problem is discussed. In agriculture one is interested also in evaporation. Now time intervals ranging from half an hour to several days are of interest. The relation between evaporation an the one side and plant diseases and pest control an the other can be mentioned. Furthermore, the yield of several agricultural crops is the greatest when the evapotranspiration is potential (= a maximum under the given weather conditions). When the crop transpires less than the potential rate, because the soil is too dry, the yield can be augmented by artificial precipitation. For applications such as these cheap and simple techniques are required for measuring the actual and potential evaporation. This applies also to agricultural research projects, e. g. to determine yield-water use relationships. In Chapter II simple measurement techniques are considered. Recent developments in meteorology have led to an increase of the interest in the energy balance of the earth's surface, especially in the input of heat and humidity at ground level into the atmosphere. Examples are models for the atmospheric boundary layer and related models for short range weather forecasts (12 - 18 h ahead). These models require simple parameterizations of the surface fluxes. This applies also to weather forecast models on a medium time range (3 - 10 days ahead). Since the height of the boundary layer is related to the heat input at the ground information an the surface energy balance is needed also for air pollution problems. In Chapter III a simple parameterization for evaporation and sensible heat flux is described that can be used for these type of problems. Usually, the only available data are standard weather observations. For that reason, many of the practical questions, mentioned above, can be formulated as: "How can the surface energy balance be estimated from standard weather data only'?" In Chapters III and VI possible answers to that question are discussed. Chapter II {{is devoted to}} simple measuring techniques that, in principle, can be used on an operational base. These methods will be compared with the so-called energy-balance method, using Bowen's ratio. In Chapter III two models for evaporation and sensible heat flux during daytime are compared. Both require standard weather data as input and an indication of the surface wetness. The first model needs more data, but contains more physics. The second is less complete, but requires less input data. Chapter IV has a mainly theoretical character. A model is presented that couples the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer to the surface energy balance. It describes the course of the height, temperature and humidity of the boundary layer, together with the surface fluxes, when the initial profiles of temperature and humidity the radiative forcing and the surface wetness are known. It is restricted to convective conditions. Model output will be compared with observations. In Chapter V an empirical evaporation model for open water is considered. Comparisons with observations of evaporation of the former Lake Flevo will be made; the annual and the diurnal cycle will be considered. In Chapter VI a model for the (natural) temperature and energy balance of inland lakes and water reservoirs is discussed that requires standard weather data only. A comparison between the calculated and measured water temperature will be given. This concerns two adjacent water reservoirs, which have about the same size, but which differ in depth (5 and 15 m). This is of importance, since the water temperature also depends on water depth. At some places we made new modifications, but most of the theoretical concepts applied in this study are adopted from literature. This is inherent in our practical approach. Some of the theories used have been available for many years. But, e. g. because no suitable instruments were available, they were not usefull for practical applications. Recent developments in the field of instrumentation and data handling have changed the situation-to our advantage. A good example is the temperature fluctuation method for measuring the sensible heat flux (discussed in 11. 4). The theoretical basis for this approach was given by Prandtl already in 1932. But for an experimental verification we had to wait until the sixties and early seventies. In that period instruments were developed to measure turbulent surface fluxes and fast temperature fluctuations, while also the data handling techniques were improved significantly. Finally) the method wouldn't be operationally until quite recently. For the verification of the parameterizations, measuring techniques and models treated in this study, we used data collected at the 200 m mast at Cabauw, and at the nearby micrometeorological field, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute...|$|R

In order for the airplane to arrive safely in the Martian atmosphere a number of sequences must occur.

This region receives energy and momentum from both the sun (ultra-violet light and electromagnetic energy coupled via the earth’s magnetosphere) and the lower atmosphere (turbulent waves).

Few observations of these processes and their coupling are available and no validation of the predicted fundamental neutral or plasma processes has been accomplished. Although almost immeasurable themselves, these atmospheric changes have very measurable consequences to Earth’s inhabitants. The need to make long-term measurements is crucial, but is frustrated by factors such as cost, short orbit lifetimes, and infrequent launch opportunities. The International Space Station (ISS), orbiting just above this “inaccessible region”, is an ideal platform from which CubeSats can be deployed to study the region below.

40|$|Terrestrial climatic effects {{associated}} with solar variability {{have been proposed}} {{for at least a}} century, but could not be assessed quantitatively owing to observational uncertainities in solar flux variations. Measurements from 1980 to 1984 by the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM), capable of resolving fluctuations above the <b>sensible</b> <b>atmosphere</b> less than 0. 1 % of the solar constant, permit direct albeit preliminary assessments of solar forcing effects on global temperatures during this period. The global temperature response to ACRIM-measured fluctuations was computed from 1980 to 1985 using the NYU transient climate model including thermal inertia effects of the world ocean; and compared the results with observations of recent temperature trends. Monthly mean ACRIM-driven global surface temperature fluctuations computed with the climate model are an order of magnitude smaller, of order 0. 01 C. In constrast, global mean surface temperature observations indicate an approx. 0. 1 C increase during this period. Solar variability is therefore likely to have been a minor factor in global climate change during this period compared with variations in atmospheric albedo, greenhouse gases and internal self-inducedoscillations. It was not possible to extend the applicability of the measured flux variations to longer periods since a possible correlation of luminosity with solar annual activity is not supported by statistical analysis. The continuous monitoring of solar flux by satellite-based instruments over timescales of 20 years or more comparable to timescales for thermal relaxation of the oceans and of the solar cycle itself is needed to resolve the question of long-term solar variation effects on climate...|$|E
40|$|Internal plasma sources usually {{arise in}} {{planetary}} magnetospheres {{as a product}} of stellar ablation processes. With the ignition of a new star and the onset of its ultraviolet and stellar wind emissions, much of the volatiles in the stellar system undergo a phase transition from gas to plasma. Condensation and accretion into a disk is replaced by radiation and stellar wind ablation of volatile materials from the system- Planets or smaller bodies that harbor intrinsic magnetic fields develop an apparent shield against direct stellar wind impact, but UV radiation still ionizes their gas phases, and the resulting internal plasmas serve to conduct currents to and from the central body along reconnected magnetic field linkages. Photoionization and thermalization of electrons warms the ionospheric topside, enhancing Jeans' escape of super-thermal particles, with ambipolar diffusion and acceleration. Moreover, observations and simulations of auroral processes at Earth indicate that solar wind energy dissipation is concentrated by the geomagnetic field by a factor of 10 - 100, enhancing heavy species plasma and gas escape from gravity, and providing more current carrying capacity. Thus internal plasmas enable coupling with the plasma, neutral gas and by extension, the entire body. The stellar wind is locally loaded and slowed to develop the required power. The internal source plasma is accelerated and heated, inflating the magnetosphere as it seeks escape, and is ultimately blown away in the stellar wind. Bodies with little <b>sensible</b> <b>atmosphere</b> may still produce an exosphere of sputtered matter when exposed to direct solar wind impact. Bodies with a magnetosphere and internal sources of plasma interact more strongly with the stellar wind owing to the magnetic linkage between the two created by reconnection...|$|E
40|$|Despite the fanciful {{predictions}} of Eugen Sanger, Wernher von Braun, and {{a wealth of}} science fiction novelists, {{it was not until}} the mid- 1950 s that the first piloted spacecraft design was undertaken in earnest. It was the height of the Cold War, and the paranoia that swept the country and the military had resulted in the largest arms race the world had ever seen. In aviation the desire was to go higher, faster, and farther than ever before. In response to a need for basic research into the ever-increasing speeds and altitudes, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) began preliminary research into a piloted vehicle that could exceed five times the speed of sound. The research was felt necessary to support both unmanned missile programs and the eventual development of hypersonic combat aircraft. Interestingly, the group of researchers that took the lead in developing the concept (led by John V. Becker) at the NACA s Langley Laboratory added a new wrinkle-they wanted to be able to leave the <b>sensible</b> <b>atmosphere</b> for a few minutes in order to gain a preliminary understanding of space flight 2 At the time it was generally felt that piloted space flight would not take place until the turn of the century, although contemporary science fiction-a genre that enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in the mid- 1 950 s-usually showed it coming much earlier. In fact, many serious researchers believed that the group at Langley should remove the "space leap" from their concept for a hypersonic research air~lane. ~ However, the basic designs for a very high speed airplane and for one capable of short excursions outside the atmosphere were not radically different, so the capability remained...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} both {{classical and}} minimax problems of optimal control arising {{in the study}} of coplanar aeroassisted orbital transfer. The basic idea is to employ the hybrid combination of propulsive maneuvers in space and aerodynamic maneuvers via lift modulation in the <b>sensible</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Within the framework of classical optimal control, the following problems are studied: (i) minimize the energy required for orbital transfer, Problem (P 1); (ii) minimize the time integral of the heating rate, Problem (P 2); (iii) minimize the time of flight during the atmospheric portion of the trajectory, Problem (P 3); (iv) maximize the time of flight during the atmospheric portion of the trajectory, Problem (P 4); (v) minimize the time integral of the square of the path inclination, Problem (P 5); (vi) minimize the time integral of the square of the difference between the altitude and a reference altitude to be determined, Problem (P 6); and (vii) minimize the sum of the squares of the initial and final path inclinations, Problem (P 7). Within the framework of minimax optimal control, the following problems are studied: (i) minimize the peak heating rate, Problem (Q 1); (ii) minimize the peak dynamic pressure, Problem (Q 2); and (iii) minimize the peak altitude drop, Problem (Q 3). If one disregards the bounds on the lift coefficient, one finds that the optimal solution from the energy viewpoint is the grazing trajectory, which is characterized by favorable values of the peak heating rate and peak dynamic pressure. While the grazing trajectory is not flyable, it represents a limiting solution that one should strive to approach in actual flight. For this reason, Problems (P 5), (P 6), (P 7), (Q 3) are introduced; their solutions, obtained by accounting for the bounds on the lift coefficient, are referred to as nearly-grazing trajectories. Numerical solutions are obtained by means of the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm for optimal control problems. Several numerical examples are presented, and their engineering implications are discussed. In particular, the merits of nearly-grazing trajectories are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Orion capsule vehicle {{will have}} a Lift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) of 0. 3 - 0. 35. For an Apollo-like direct entry into the Earth's {{atmosphere}} from a lunar return trajectory, this L/D will give the vehicle a maximum range of about 2500 nm and a maximum crossrange of 216 nm. In order to y longer ranges, the vehicle lift must be used to loft the trajectory such that the aerodynamic forces are decreased. A Skip-Trajectory results if the vehicle leaves the <b>sensible</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and a second entry occurs downrange of the atmospheric exit point. The Orion capsule is required to have landing site access (either on land or in water) inside the Continental United States (CONUS) for lunar returns anytime during the lunar month. This requirement means the vehicle must be capable of flying ranges of at least 5500 nm. For the L/D of the vehicle, this is only possible {{with the use of}} a guided Skip-Trajectory. A skip entry guidance algorithm is necessary to achieve this requirement. Two skip entry guidance algorithms have been developed: the Numerical Skip Entry Guidance (NSEG) algorithm was developed at NASA/JSC and PredGuid was developed at Draper Laboratory. A comparison of these two algorithms will be presented in this paper. Each algorithm has been implemented in a high-fidelity, 6 degree-of-freedom simulation called the Advanced NASA Technology Architecture for Exploration Studies (ANTARES). NASA and Draper engineers have completed several monte carlo analyses in order to compare the performance of each algorithm in various stress states. Each algorithm has been tested for entry-to-target ranges to include direct entries and skip entries of varying length. Dispersions have been included on the initial entry interface state, vehicle mass properties, vehicle aerodynamics, atmosphere, and Reaction Control System (RCS). Performance criteria include miss distance to the target, RCS fuel usage, maximum g-loads and heat rates for the first and second entry, total heat load, and control system saturation. The comparison of the performance criteria has led to a down select and guidance merger that will take the best ideas from each algorithm to create one skip entry guidance algorithm for the Orion vehicle...|$|E
