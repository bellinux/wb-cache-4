5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|Stars <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> 90% {{of their}} {{existence}} fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars {{are said to be}} on the main sequence, and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E

The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or {{as a part of a}} round trip in Denmark. The average stay is little more than three days on average.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{later became}} a vestryman for Copole Parish and Justice of the Peace in Westmoreland County. In 1723, Lee {{became a member of}} the House of Burgesses. He held this office until he was {{appointed}} to the Governor's Council in the Virginia General Assembly in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was the upper half of the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor. Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in the General Court of the colony. Their work led them to <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{itself was}} inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For Brütal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend. This subsequently led {{to much of the}} action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.|$|E
