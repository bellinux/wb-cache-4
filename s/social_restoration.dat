Yet, such forms of justice are more likely to contribute to <b>social</b> <b>restoration,</b> if they account for the heterogeneity of needs and experiences of those affected by the conflict. This is particularly significant in the case of BiH, because it constitutes a complex social reality within which contrasted and competing understandings of the past are often contested and negotiated between different collectives through symbolic TJ measures. Through the analysis of survey data collected across BiH (n= 855), we analyse how the relative support for dimensions of symbolic justice of acknowledgment and truth-telling is related to specific patterns of experiences of conflict, of beliefs about the war and justice, as well as of demographic factors. Our findings suggest that whether respondents {{may be more likely to}} support both forms of symbolic recognition or only one or the other may be highly dependent on the specific nature of their reported past victimization and their present justice and conflict-related concerns. They reveal the key role of personal experiences of the past in shaping symbolic justice needs and their embedding within specific social identities and memories. Highlighting the value of non-judicial TJ measures as significant sources of symbolic recognition, they also point to the necessity of not only ensuring the inclusiveness and mutuality of these initiatives, but also of accounting for various levels of recognition in the implementation of post-conflict justice. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} approach governing {{my work is}} interdisciplinary, including religious history, hermeneutics, theology, and sociology of religion {{with an emphasis on}} the intersections of religion and culture. My dissertation uncovers notions of healing through an attempt to transform social and racial reality within African American Christian thought and life. Making the Wounded Whole challenges the dominant assumption that black Christianity, is governed by a primary theological focus on corporate liberation. Accordingly, it uncovers a deep concern with healing [...] -in relation to bodily, political, spiritual, and <b>social</b> <b>restoration</b> [...] -as a theological thrust fueling black Christian religion. I reveal this concern through an interrogation of the bio-political and socio-political significance of enslavement and its consequences. This theme of healing and identity (re) formation manifests itself within various aspects of religious life and activity [...] -among them are ritual and worship, aesthetic presentation, Scriptural interpretation, and general resistance to racial oppression. I argue that such practices are in consequence therapeutic, in that social and political imagination is recast in ways more suitable for a healthy existence. I locate these practices as a particular style of religious life and therefore a way of understanding the nature of black Christian experience. Ultimately, this work connects these ideas to normative Christo-religious practices found within the black enslaved experience during the antebellum period...|$|E

40|$|Within {{scholarship}} {{focusing on}} non-judicial forms of transitional justice (TJ), {{there has been}} an increasing interest in the use of more symbolic forms of justice (as opposed to concrete or material forms) to help post-conflict societies overcome a violent past. These are understood here as those often localized and non-judicial measures that aim at reparation and acknowledgment through the validation of victimization, the recognition of various levels of accountabilities and facts, as well as remembrance. Such forms of justice may constitute a key element of <b>social</b> <b>restoration</b> in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH), in their potential to symbolically acknowledging individuals’ suffering as well as providing them a voice and status, but also in representing, when targeted towards collectives, a societal recognition of past harm doing. Yet, it is also increasingly suggested that such outcomes may be more likely if they account for the needs and experiences of all those affected by the conflict, especially those representing traditionally marginalized voices. This is particularly significant in BiH, as it constitutes a complex social reality within which various social groups struggle to gain recognition and public visibility for their experiences of the past and contingent justice needs. These processes are often reflected in the implementation of symbolic TJ measures. Yet, symbolic justice measures have been afforded little empirical attention in BiH and beyond, especially within the framework of quantitative studies. The existent scholarship on symbolic justice measures has mostly taken the form of ethnographic case studies related to specific initiatives, without any comprehensive analysis of the factors that may ground particular symbolic justice needs. We aim to bridge these gaps in this study. Through the analysis of survey data collected across BiH (n= 855), we show how specific profiles of war experiences, beliefs and identity can be related to support for different symbolic justice needs, such as acknowledgment of suffering or voice and information. They reveal the complexity and heterogeneity of current justice concerns in BiH and the key role of personal experiences of the past and their embedding within specific social identities and memories. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{recovery}} following a disaster, disaster waste managers are restricted by existing legislation. In many cases, emergency legislation {{is available to}} waive peace-time requirements to reduce threats to life, property and the environment. But disaster waste management sits in a grey area between an immediate hazard and a longer term threat to the economic, social and environmental recovery of a disaster struck area. Emergency laws are not often written with disaster recovery in mind. Legal waivers were used effectively and ineffectively during the waste management processes following both Hurricane Katrina, 2005 and the Victorian Bushfires, 2009. In both these examples {{it was clear that}} the main driver behind use of the legal waivers was to expedite the clean-up process. New Zealand law applicable to disaster waste is complex with a plethora of legislations and regulatory authorities associated with it. In general, current laws have adequate provisions to cope with the likely needs of disaster waste management, however, the complexity of responsibilities, stakeholders and unclear statutory precedence may result in slow or ineffectual decision-making. One potential bottle neck identified is the restrictions on transportation of hazardous goods by road and by sea. Complex licencing and permitting structures may be extremely restrictive. The consultative, effects based nature of the Resource Management Act in New Zealand is also a potential hurdle to long-term disaster waste management. While there are effective emergency mechanisms to commence activities quickly, medium to long-term continuation of activities will be dependent on resource consent approval. The uncertainties associated with consent approvals may dis-empower the decision-maker. A pre-established, regulatory approved, assessment process which balances <b>social</b> <b>restoration</b> and environmental protection would be a useful tool to support the decision maker. I n general, disaster waste management laws needs to: allow for flexibility for adaptation to any situation; be bounded enough to provide support and confidence in outcomes for decision-makers; be effectively communicated with the public both pre and post disaster; and provide stream-lining of waste management organisational structures including decision-making authority...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} ancient Israel's {{mortuary}} culture {{have shown that}} mourning rites were not restricted to the occasions of death, burial and subsequent grief but were, in fact, implemented in diverse contexts. In this thesis I am looking at biblical traditions in which these solemn practices contributed, or sought to contribute to various forms of <b>social</b> <b>restoration.</b> More specifically, I explore the stories of biblical grieving mothers who are placed at key junctures in Israel's history to renegotiate the destinies not only of their own children, dead or lost, but also those of larger communities, i. e. family lines, ethnic groups, or entire nations. Since 'the social and ritual dimensions of mourning are intertwined and inseparable [...] . [and] rites in general are a context for the creation and transformation of social order', these women use the circumstance of their 'interrupted' motherhood as a platform {{for a kind of}} grief-driven socio-political activism. Since maternal bereavement is generally understood as the most intense of all types of loss and was seen as archetypal of all mourning in ancient Near Eastern cultures, Israelite communities in crisis deemed sorrowing motherhood as a potent agent in bringing about their own survival and resurgence back to normalcy. I begin my discussion on mourning rites as tools of social preservation and restoration in biblical traditions with (1) a list of modern examples that attest to a phenomenon of social, political, and religious engagement among women that stems from the circumstance of child loss; (2) a survey of recent grief and death studies that identify maternal grief as the most intense and the most enduring among other types of bereavement; (3) an overview of ancient Near Eastern cultures (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Hatti, Syro-Palestine) that not only viewed maternal grief as paradigmatic of all mourning but also utilised ritual actions performed by mothers in contexts of large scale catastrophes as mechanisms for dealing with a collective trauma. Against this background my project then turns to discuss four biblical mothers: Hagar (Gen. 21 : 14 - 21), Rizpah (2 Sam. 21 : 1 - 14), the woman of Tekoa (2 Sam. 14 : 1 - 20) and Rachel (Jer. 31 : 15 - 22), all of whom perform rites for their dying or dead children and exhibit a form of advocacy for society at large.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between environmental affect and mental health using restorative theory as an organising framework. Environmental affect {{can be described as}} how the physical environment (home, park etc) and social context (being with a friend) influence emotion and thereby various activities and outcomes. Three types of psychological experiences are explored, theoretically grouped under the rubric “restorative”: discrete (short-term) psychological restoration, instoration (longer term strengthening of internal resources) and person-environment fit conceptualised as niche environments supportive of 1) personal goals and 2) mood regulation. Mixed research methods (qualitative and quantitative) were used to elicit the affective dimensions of different settings (natural vs. built-external vs. built-internal) across several different groups within the population. A key aim was to explore whether restorative experiences would differ between settings in adults and young people with and without mental health problems. Five studies are presented, each exploring one or more aspect of the three part restorative framework outlined above, with one additional study focusing on <b>social</b> <b>restoration.</b> Two aspects of psychological restoration are examined: firstly, mood and secondly, cognitive reflection (defined as “changes in perspective” on life tasks over time 1) using personal project analysis (Little 1983). Evidence of discrete restoration: the research supports existing empirical evidence linking activity in natural settings with mood restoration and adds to the evidence base by showing the benefits also extend to manageability of life tasks. New evidence is provided showing people with variable mental health differ in their potential for restoration, both in terms of the intensity of the experience and in response to the places in which the process occurs. People with poor mental health experienced more intensive restoration in a natural setting, but also responded more favourably to the urban setting than people without mental health problems. Natural settings promoted a mental equanimity 2 across individuals with variable mental health as compared to the built setting where group outcomes diverged. 1 For simplification this is referred to as “mindset” in the research 2 A levelling out of mood differences iii Evidence of instoration; the research supports the notion that activity in green settings can sustain longer term instorative benefits in adults and young people with mental health problems including increased capacity for trust and recollection, exploratory behaviour and social cohesion. Evidence of person-environment fit: a. niche environments supportive of mood regulation: the research extends existing evidence by showing natural and built settings support the continuum of good mood as well as the negation of bad mood in young people. b. niche environments supportive of personal goals: natural settings support age specific needs in young people for new experiences and community cohesion (in the form of societal projects), two dimensions supportive of well-being. Affect was found to be a significant discriminator between settings with positive affect aligned with the natural environment. Conclusions: results are consistent with a restorative effect of landscape and suggest differing states of mental health moderate in restorative processes. The research has also shown that the built environment is potentially restorative amongst certain health groups. The affective quality of environments varies and the ‘personal project’ research has shown the potential impact on well-being. Items flagged for further research include firstly, the need for further evidence on {{the relationship between}} the challenge of green activity and self-esteem in poor mental health groups; and secondly, the need to identify exactly what aspects of the built environment cause restorative differences to occur (i. e. the social context v. physical) ...|$|E
40|$|The south Indian city of Bangalore {{provides}} a challenging yet representative {{context within which}} to examine issues of governance of urban social-ecological commons. The city was once famous for its numerous large water bodies, which have witnessed tremendous encroachment and pollution in recent years. These water bodies, called tanks or lakes, were typically managed by adjacent village communities but are now administered {{by a number of}} government departments involved with aspects of lake management, with multiple overlapping jurisdictions. The publics perceptions of lakes has also changed with urbanization, transitioning from community spaces valued for water and cultural services to urban recreational spaces used largely by joggers and walkers. We focus on a set of seven lakes located in the urbanizing peripheral areas of southeast Bangalore. Some water bodies have been restored and managed effectively by newly forged collaborations between citizens and local government. Others are extremely polluted, and some have completely dried up and have been encroached. We use a social-ecological system (SES) framework to investigate why some locations have been successful in negotiating changes in governance from community-based systems to state management following urbanization, whereas other lakes have deteriorated. We use seven second-tier SES variables that were associated with self-organization in previous research: size of resource system, number of actors, leadership, social capital, importance of resource, existence of operational-choice rules, and existence of informal mechanisms for monitoring. We also include three third-tier variables previously identified as important in urban lake commons in Bangalore: scale and type of pre-existing pollution, exclusion of socioeconomic groups from the planning process, and networking with government organizations. We use this subset of 10 variables to examine social outcomes of the lakes, which we define as the extent of collective action by residents working together for lake restoration and ecological outcomes based on the ecological condition of the lakes. Collective action was low in only one of seven lakes, which challenges the presumption that citizens will not organize efforts to cope with common-pool problems. However, only two of seven lakes were highly successful in regard to both the extent of collective action and the level of ecological performance. While one lake was small and the other moderate in size, these two cases shared similar ranking in all other variables. Both lakes were polluted at a relatively low level compared with the other lakes, and in both cases, the leaders of local groups were able to network with government officials to clean up the lakes. Unfortunately, the challenge of cleaning up urban lakes after many decades of pollution is very difficult without effective interaction with various governmental units. Our analysis illustrates the usefulness of the SES framework in examining the combination of variables that makes a collective difference in affecting the outcomes of collective action and ecological performance. Our findings illustrate the need for polycentric arrangements in urban areas, whereby local residents are able to organize in diverse ways that reflect their own problems and capabilities, but can also work jointly with larger-scale governments to solve technical problems requiring changes in major engineering works as well as acquiring good scientific information. Such arrangements can reduce transaction costs for city governments by actively engaging local communities in processes that include coordination of collective activities, design of inclusive and locally suited ecological and <b>social</b> <b>restoration</b> goals, and planning and enforcement of regulations limiting access and withdrawal. At a time when many city governments are facing financial and administrative challenges that limit their ability to regulate and maintain urban commons, models of public-community partnerships could provide more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable institutional alternatives. This is an aspect that needs significant further consideration because the attention of most urban planners and scholars has remained on privatization while studies of successful instances of cooperative action in the urban context remain few and far between. ...|$|E

Two studies were conducted in Indonesia, where separatist conflict is rife. Javanese students (representing the nonseparatist majority) responded surveys regarding separatist conflicts in Aceh (Study 1, N = 679) or West Papua (Study 2, N = 500).
