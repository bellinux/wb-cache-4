25|$|A {{number of}} {{longitudinal}} studies on AA's effectiveness have been done. These studies tend to show that, the more involved subjects are with AA (usually, the more frequently the subjects go to meetings), {{the more likely}} the subjects will stay sober. Longitudinal studies suffer from <b>self-selection</b> bias, but one 2014 study claims that AA's effectiveness shown in these studies {{does not come from}} <b>self-selection.</b>|$|E

As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for <b>self-selection</b> bias.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, 91% {{of white}} {{children}} in the state attend public schools {{and most of the}} black children. In 2008, Mississippi was ranked last among the fifty states in academic achievement by the American Legislative Exchange Council's Report Card on Education, with the lowest average ACT scores and sixth-lowest spending per pupil in the nation. In contrast, Mississippi had the 17th-highest average SAT scores in the nation. As an explanation, the Report noted that 92% of Mississippi high school graduates took the ACT, but only 3% of graduates took the SAT, apparently a <b>self-selection</b> of higher achievers. This breakdown compares to the national average of high school graduates taking the ACT and SAT, of 43% and 45%, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural {{research}} generally {{indicates that}} teenagers begin their smoking habits due to peer pressure, and cultural influence portrayed by friends. However, {{one study found}} that direct pressure to smoke cigarettes played a less significant part in adolescent smoking, with adolescents also reporting low levels of both normative and direct pressure to smoke cigarettes. Mere exposure to tobacco retailers may motivate smoking behaviour in adults. A similar study suggested that individuals may play {{a more active role in}} starting to smoke than has previously been thought and that social processes other than peer pressure also need to be taken into account. Another study's results indicated that peer pressure was significantly associated with smoking behavior across all age and gender cohorts, but that intrapersonal factors were significantly more important to the smoking behavior of 12- to 13-year-old girls than same-age boys. Within the 14- to 15-year-old age group, one peer pressure variable emerged as a significantly more important predictor of girls' than boys' smoking. It is debated whether peer pressure or <b>self-selection</b> is a greater cause of adolescent smoking.|$|E

The majority of respondants earned less than ten {{thousand dollars a year}} with a secondary level of education. The majority of viewers have a secondary level of education (52.19%), with all other education levels tending to watch less.|$|E

2500|$|AA {{tends to}} {{polarize}} observers into believers and non-believers, {{and discussion of}} AA often creates controversy rather than objective reflection. [...] Moreover, a randomized study of AA is difficult: AA members are not randomly selected from the population of chronic alcoholics; they are instead self-selected or mandated by courts to attend AA meetings. There are two opposing types of <b>self-selection</b> bias: (1) drinkers may be motivated to stop drinking before they participate in AA; (2) AA may attract the more severe and difficult cases.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{domestic}} violence {{has been seen}} as a heterosexual family issue and little interest has been directed at violence in same-sex relationships, but {{domestic violence}} can occur in same-sex relationships as well. The Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention states, [...] "For several methodological reasons– nonrandom sampling procedures and <b>self-selection</b> factors, among others– {{it is not possible to}} assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Self-selection</b> by more food-needy {{households}} into SNAP {{makes it}} difficult to observe positive effects on food security from survey data. [...] While SNAP participants and other low-income nonparticipants spend similar amounts on food spending, SNAP participants tend to still experience greater food insecurity than nonparticipants. This is believed to be a reflection of welfare of individuals who take the time to apply for SNAP benefits than the shortcomings of SNAP. In other words, households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear of the burden of applying for program benefits. Statistical models that control for this endogeneity suggest that SNAP receipt reduces the likelihood of being food insecure and very food insecure by roughly 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In the Stanford prison study, by Philip Zimbardo, a {{simulated}} exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. In {{just a few}} days, the [...] "guards" [...] became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued {{to be an important}} demonstration {{of the power of the}} immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits. However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant <b>self-selection</b> may have affected the participants' behaviour, and that the participants' personality influenced their reactions in a variety of ways, including how long they chose to remain in the study. One of the most concerted empirical revisitations of the themes raised by Zimbardo came with the 2002 BBC prison study.|$|E
2500|$|The College {{introduced}} undergraduate {{societies to}} campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations. Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, undergraduate societies {{were required to}} have open, coeducational membership policies. Panarchy, a coeducational fraternity with a 97-year history at Dartmouth, voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called Amarna. [...] Phi Tau chose to remain a Greek house. [...] In 1999, the College administration announced a [...] "Residential and Social Life Initiative" [...] to improve campus life. [...] Speculation that all Greek houses at Dartmouth College {{might be forced to}} open admissions to anyone who wanted to join drew attention to Phi Tau's status as an already coeducational institution, but one that still held to Greek traditions. [...] Then house president Virginia DeJesus-Rueff, class of 2000, defended Phi Tau's policy of <b>self-selection.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Satoshi Kanazawa {{said that}} part of the success of eHarmony can be {{explained}} by the high cost of entry in terms of the amount of time required to answer the initial questionnaire—over 18 hours, although other sources put the time to complete the relationship questionnaire at approximately one hour. Using Laurence Iannaccone's original idea that success of fundamentalist churches is explained by the high demands imposed on their members, Kanazawa hypothesizes that a similar <b>self-selection</b> mechanism is at work with eHarmony: [...] "they select their members very carefully, and only admit those who are very committed (or desperate; if anyone who chooses to join eHarmony is truly desperate to get married, then it can potentially and partially explain why it produces such a high proportion of all marriages in the US)." [...] Another factor suggested by Dan Ariely is the limited choice of partners offered, which may make the decision easier for some.|$|E
2500|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{estimated}} that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old {{results in a}} relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were {{just as likely to}} die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect might be less in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased <b>self-selection</b> rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is “no longer effective” at preventing deaths and “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. [...] The review also concluded that [...] "half or more" [...] of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment. They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because these changes would not have progressed into invasive cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Academic criticisms {{were made}} {{pertaining}} to sample selection and sample {{bias in the}} reports' methodology. This was {{despite the fact that}} Kinsey sought to work on a more 'complete' report that would have involved 100000 interviews and that the initial 1948 publication was merely considered by him to be a sample progress report. Two main problems cited were that significant portions of the samples come from prison populations and male prostitutes, and that people who volunteer to be interviewed about taboo subject are likely to create a <b>self-selection</b> bias. Both undermine the usefulness of the sample in terms of determining the tendencies of the overall population. In 1948, the same year as the original publication, a committee of the American Statistical Association, including notable statisticians such as John Tukey, condemned the sampling procedure. Tukey was perhaps the most vocal critic, saying, [...] "A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey." [...] Psychologist Abraham Maslow asserted that Kinsey did not consider [...] "volunteer bias". The data represented only those volunteering to participate in discussion of taboo topics. Most Americans were reluctant to discuss the intimate details of their sex lives even with their spouses and close friends. Before the publication of Kinsey's reports, Maslow tested Kinsey's volunteers for bias. He concluded that Kinsey's sample was unrepresentative of the general population. [...] In 1954, leading statisticians, including William Gemmell Cochran, Frederick Mosteller, John Tukey, and W. O. Jenkins issued for the American Statistical Association a critique of Kinsey’s 1948 report on the human male, stating: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Self-selection</b> makes {{determination}} of causation more difficult. For example, {{when attempting to}} assess {{the effect of a}} test preparation course in increasing participant's test scores, significantly higher test scores might be observed among students who choose to participate in the preparation course itself. Due to <b>self-selection,</b> there may be a number of differences between the people who choose to take the course and those who choose not to, such as motivation, socioeconomic status, or prior test-taking experience. Due to <b>self-selection</b> according to such factors, a significant difference in mean test scores could be observed between the two populations independent of any ability of the course to effect higher test scores. An outcome might be that those who elect to do the preparation course would have achieved higher scores in the actual test anyway. If the study measures an improvement in absolute test scores due to participation in the preparation course, they may be skewed to show a higher effect. A relative measure of 'improvement' might improve the reliability of the study somewhat, but only partially.|$|E
