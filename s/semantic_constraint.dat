40|$|Using a cross-modal naming {{paradigm}} {{this study}} investigated the effect of sentence constraint and language use on the expectancy of a language switch during listening comprehension. Sixty-five Algerian bilinguals who habitually code-switch between Algerian Arabic and French (AA-FR) but not between Standard Arabic and French (SA-FR) listened to sentence fragments and named a visually presented French target NP out loud. Participants’ speech onset times were recorded. The sentence context was either highly semantically constraining towards the French NP or not. The language of the sentence context was either in Algerian Arabic or in Standard Arabic, but the target NP was always in French, thus creating two code-switching contexts: a typical and recurrent code-switching context (AA-FR) and a non-typical code-switching context (SA-FR). Results revealed a <b>semantic</b> <b>constraint</b> effect indicating that the French switches were easier to process in the high compared to the low-constraint context. In addition, the effect size of <b>semantic</b> <b>constraint</b> was significant in the more typical code-switching context (AA-FR) suggesting that language use influences the processing of switching between languages.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of bilingualism research on visual word recognition in isolation and in sentence context. Many studies investigating the processing of words out-of-context have shown that lexical representations from both languages are activated when reading in one language (language-non-selective lexical access). A newly developed research line asks whether language-non-selective access generalizes to word recognition in sentence contexts, providing a language cue and/or <b>semantic</b> <b>constraint</b> information for upcoming words. Recent studies suggest that the language of the preceding words is insufficient to restrict lexical access to words of the target language, even when reading in the native language. Eye tracking studies revealing the time course of word activation further showed that <b>semantic</b> <b>constraint</b> does not restrict language-non-selective access at early reading stages, but there is evidence that it has a relatively late effect.
