5|$|The United States {{responded to}} the attack by {{increasing}} its drone attacks against militants in Pakistan. Nearly every day after the CIA facility was attacked, the U.S. military conducted drone strikes aimed at leaders of the Haqqani network in North Waziristan. In the week after the attack, the U.S. military conducted five drone strikes, an unusually high number. However, U.S. counter-terrorism officials cautioned against linking these attacks to the bombing. After reports of drone strikes, Pakistan <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> support the attacks in its territory, as they were counterproductive.|$|E
5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{met with}} senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss {{formation}} of a pro-independence political party that {{was not associated with}} Mahdism. The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper, al-Umma (The Community). In February 1945 the Umma party had been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar; the only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding. However, there were rumors that the Umma party had been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al-Rahman on the throne. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> support a Mahdist monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Although France <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{tolerate}} Libya's {{military presence}} at Faya-Largeau on August 25, Mitterrand {{was unwilling to}} openly confront Libya and return northern Chad to Habré.

The Libyans, too, avoided crossing the Red Line, thereby avoiding engagement with the French troops.|$|E

25|$|Opponents of ASFA {{argued that}} the real reason {{children}} languished in foster care was that too many were taken needlessly from their parents in the first place. Since ASFA did not address this, opponents <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accomplish its goals, and would only slow {{a decline in the}} foster care population that should have occurred anyway because of a decline in reported child abuse.|$|E
25|$|Other leaders, while {{supporting}} the fatwa, claimed that British Muslims {{were not allowed}} to carry out the fatwa themselves.

25|$|Justice Souter {{noted that}} {{the ability of a}} U.S. citizen to get a trial may {{necessarily}} imply that the court has jurisdiction in that geographic area, since jurisdiction is largely a geographic and sovereignty matter. Since the government had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> challenge 'habeas corpus' by a U.S. citizen in Guantanamo Bay, in Hamdi v.

The UFW deployed its best strategic weapon, the boycott, and kept up the push for a national boycott of grapes, wine and lettuce. The Teamsters reiterated their pledge to uphold their contracts in November.|$|E
