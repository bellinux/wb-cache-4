40|$|International audienceAmong emotions, <b>surprise</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in psychology. In linguistics, <b>surprise,</b> like other emotions, has mainly been studied through the syntactic patterns involving <b>surprise</b> lexemes. However, little has been done so far to correlate the reaction of <b>surprise</b> investigated in psychological approaches {{and the effects of}} <b>surprise</b> on language. This cross-disciplinary volume aims {{to bridge the gap between}} emotion, cognition and language by bringing together nine contributions on <b>surprise</b> from different backgrounds – psychology, human-agent interaction, linguistics. Using different methods at different levels of analysis, all contributors concur in defining <b>surprise</b> as a cognitive operation and as a component of emotion rather than as a pure emotion. <b>Surprise</b> results from expectations not being met and is therefore related to epistemicity. Linguistically, there does not exist an unequivocal marker of <b>surprise.</b> <b>Surprise</b> may be either described by <b>surprise</b> lexemes, which are often associated with figurative language, or it may be expressed by grammatical and syntactic constructions. Originally published as a special issue of Review of Cognitive Linguistics 13 : 2 (2015...|$|R
40|$|While <b>surprise</b> is {{a common}} emotion in {{everyday}} life, some of its fundamental characteristics are still unclear. For example, what does <b>surprise</b> feel like, positive or negative? The emotion literature has been somewhat unclear about the experiential valence of <b>surprise.</b> <b>Surprise</b> has been depicted as a pre-affective state, or as an emotion that can be both positive and negative, depending on the goal conduciveness of the surprising event. Based on recent work on cognitive consistency and neuroscientific/psychophysiological studies on <b>surprise,</b> we explored the possibility that <b>surprise</b> may be a (mildly) negative emotion {{in a study of}} autobiographical recall of unexpected and surprising events (Experiment 1) and in two studies of facial expressions of <b>surprise</b> (Experiments 2 and 3 a/b). The studies show that experience of <b>surprise</b> and the perception of <b>surprise</b> in others may indeed be initially negative. We furthermore show how linguistic features of <b>surprise</b> and the temporal dynamics may have contributed to previous confusion regarding its valence.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} <b>surprise</b> on learning with prevocational students {{in the domain of}} proportional reasoning. <b>Surprise</b> involves an emotional reaction, but it also serves a cognitive goal as it directs attention to explain why the surprising event occurred and to learn for the future. Experiment 1 - comparing a <b>surprise</b> condition with a control condition - found no differences, but the results suggested that <b>surprise</b> may be beneficial for higher level students. In Experiment 2 we combined Expectancy strength (Strong vs. Weak) with <b>Surprise</b> (Present vs. Absent) using higher level students. We found a marginal effect of <b>surprise</b> on learning indicating that students who experienced <b>surprises</b> learned more than students who were not exposed to these <b>surprises</b> but we found a stronger positive effect of <b>surprise</b> when we included existing proportional reasoning skill as factor. These results provide evidence that narrative techniques such as <b>surprise</b> can be used for the purpose of learning. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of surprise—at something unexpected—is a key form of emotional display. Focusing on displays of <b>surprise</b> performed {{by means of}} reaction tokens (akin to Goffman’s “response cries”), such as wow, gosh, oh my god, ooh!, phew, we use an ethnomethodological, conversation-analytic approach to analyze <b>surprise</b> in talk-in-interaction. Our key contribution is to detach the psychology of <b>surprise</b> from its social expression by showing how co-conversationalists collaborate to bring off an interactionally achieved performance of <b>surprise.</b> Far from being a visceral eruption of emotion, {{the production of a}} <b>surprise</b> token is often prepared for several turns in advance. We also show how <b>surprise</b> can be recycled on an occasion subsequent to its initial production, and how <b>surprise</b> displays may be delayed by silence, ritualized disbelief, and other repair initiations. Finally, we consider some of the uses of <b>surprise</b> as an interactional resource, including its role in the reflection and reproduction of culture.
