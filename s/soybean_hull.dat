Experiment 1 tested increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %) and increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> decreased ADG and G:F. Experiment 2 evaluated increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> (0, 10, and 20 %) in diets balanced or not for NE and showed reduced performance with increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls.</b> Balancing for NE resulted in G:F similar to pigs fed the control. Experiments 3 and 4 evaluated increasing dietary <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> in corn-soybean meal and corn-soybean meal-DDGS diets. <b>Soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> in either diet worsened G:F and improved caloric efficiency, suggesting current INRA (2004) values for <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> underestimate their energy value. Experiment 5 evaluated 10 and 20 % ground or unground <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> in meal and pelleted diets. Caloric efficiency improved {{with high levels of}} <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls.</b> Pelleting improved ADG and eliminated negative effects on G:F with increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls,</b> while grinding <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> reduced performance. Experiment 6 tested increasing ground and unground <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> (0, 7. 5, and 15 %). Increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> worsened G:F, carcass yield, and hot carcass weight. Grinding <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> to finer particle sizes did not improve ADG and worsened G:F. Experiments 7 and 8 evaluated the replacement of corn with wheat and crystalline amino acids in nursery and finishing pig diets. Replacing 50 % of corn with wheat did not affect growth performance in either nursery or finishing; however 100 % replacement of corn with wheat reduced performance. In addition, feeding wheat improved carcass fat IV, while use of high levels of crystalline amino acids in wheat-based diets did not influence performance in either study. Experiment 9 evaluated the replacement of soybean meal with high-protein dried distiller’s grains with solubles and crystalline amino acids. High-protein DDGS and crystalline AA can replace 50 % of the SBM in finishing diets without negatively affecting performance or carcass yield.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{in this trial}} {{was to determine the}} effects of partial replacement of ground corn by citrus pulp or <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> on performance and carcass characteristics of feedlot goat kids. Twenty one Boer x Saanen kids (initial BW 15. 8 ± 0. 7 kg), nine males and 12 females, were distributed in a complete randomized block design, according to sex and initial body weight. Treatments were set by replacing 50 % of ground corn (DM basis) for citrus pulp or soybean hulls; whereas, forage concentrate ratio was of 10 : 90. Partial replacement of corn by citrus pulp or <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> increased dry matter intake, average daily gain and final body weight, but feed efficiency was not affected. There was no difference between citrus pulp or <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls.</b> Inclusion of coproducts increased slaughter weight, hot and cold carcass weight and longissimus muscle area, with no difference between citrus pulp and <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls.</b> Subcutaneous fat thickness, hot and cold carcass yields, shrink after chilling and body wall thickness were not affected by treatments. Citrus pulp and <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> can replace 50 % of ground corn (DM basis) increasing dry matter intake and weight gain in goat kids enabling higher slaughter weight at earlier age...|$|R
40|$|Algae meal {{is a novel}} {{coproduct}} {{created by}} the unique combination of <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> and oil-extracted heterotrophic micro algae. Algae meal is highly digestible by ruminants and was readily consumed by lambs when included at up to 60 % of the diet dry matter.

40|$|Degradation {{characteristics}} of three by-product, were studied using the nylon bag technique. Nylon bags technique {{were conducted in}} two rumen fistulated Brahman-Thai native crossbred steers. They were offered ad libitum rice straw and received concentrate at 0. 5 % BW. Nylon bags containing 3. 0 g of each by-product were immersed in duplicate {{at each time point}} in the ventral rumen of each steer for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The data were fitted to the equation P = a+b (1 -e -ct) and effective degradability were calculated using a theoretical rumen out flow rate of k = 0. 05 /h. The treatments were 1) tomato pomace, 2) <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> and 3) peanut pod assigned according to a completely randomize design with four replication. The results indicate that the rapidly soluble fraction (a), potentially degradable fraction (b), degradation rate (c) and potential degradation (a+b) of DM, OM and CP were different among treatments (p< 0. 01). The effective degradability of DM, OM and CP are the same between <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> and peanut pot, but differences with tomato pomace. This data is necessary to screen by-product for nutritive value before using them in ruminant production systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of purified cellulose, soybean hulls and citrus pulp in the diet of weaned piglets. A total of 72 piglets (36 castrated males and 36 females) weaned at 21 days of age (BW 6. 45 ± 0. 66 kg) was distributed according to a randomized block design, for evaluation of performance, transit time, diarrhea incidence and blood parameters of piglets which received diets containing different sources of fiber. The experimental diets were: control diet - diet composed of corn, soybean meal {{and a source of}} lactose; control + 1. 5 % purified cellulose; control + 3 % <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> and control + 9 % citrus pulp. The inclusion of purified cellulose, soybean hulls and citrus pulp in diets of weaned piglets did not affect the performance or transit time of diets in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the use of purified cellulose reduced incidence of diarrhea. The use of purified cellulose, <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> and citrus pulp in the diet of weaned piglets does not affect performance or gastrointestinal transit time.

40|$|A 6 -week {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of supplementation of diets with soybean hulls (NSP) and Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) on growth performance, the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) and fecal and slurry noxious gas emission in finishing pigs. A total of 96 pigs with an average initial body weight (BW) of 80. 70 ± 2. 29 kg were assigned {{on the basis of}} weight to four treatment groups (6 replicates per treatment and 4 pigs per pen). In this study, dietary L. reuteri led to a higher ATTD of N than the negative groups (P< 0. 05). Pigs fed with <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> supplemental diet decreased (P< 0. 05) the fecal NH 3, H 2 S and acetic acid emission compared with those without supplementation. The inclusion of L. reuteri significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) NH 3 emission from slurry as compared with those without supplementation. Moreover, a synergistic effect (P< 0. 05) between dietary soybean hulls and L. reuteri was observed on the emission of H 2 S and R. SH emission from slurry in the current study. Taken together, both the supplementation of <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> or L. reuteri could decrease the noxious gas emission without any effect on the animals.

Treatments consisted of different levels of substitution of corn by <b>soybean</b> <b>hulls</b> (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) and elephant grass silage as forage. The design was completely randomized. Samples of concentrate and silage were collected to evaluate the fatty acid composition. The experimental period lasted 110 days.

Pens of pigs were balanced by initial weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design with 26 to 28 pigs per pen and 9 replications per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial, and main effects were <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> particle size (unground or ground, 787 and 370 μ, respectively) and amount of soybean hulls (7. 5 or 15 %) in corn-soybean meal–based diets. The fifth treatment was a positive control, a corn-soybean meal–based diet. No particle size × <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> interactions (P > 0. 18) occurred. Overall (d 0 to 118), increasing soybean hulls, regardless of particle size, did not affect ADG but numerically increased (P = 0. 11) ADFI, resulting in poorer (linear, P < 0. 02) F/G. Although F/G became worse, increasing soybean hulls in the diet improved (linear, P < 0. 002) caloric efficiency on an ME and NE basis, indicating that published energy values undervalue the energy content of soybean hulls. Unexpectedly, grinding soybean hulls to a lower particle size worsened F/G (P < 0. 04) and caloric efficiencies (P < 0. 03) ...|$|E

The average particle size of the unground and ground soybean hulls were 617 and 398 μ, respectively. Pens of pigs (5 barrows and 5 gilts) were balanced by initial BW and randomly allotted to 1 of 8 treatments with 11 replications per treatment. A 2 -phase diet series was used with treatment diets fed from d 0 to 14 for Phase 1 and d 14 to 42 for Phase 2. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of 10 or 20 % unground or finely ground soybean hulls with diets in pelleted or meal form. For individual phases and overall (d 0 to 42), no <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> × particle size × diet form or particle size × <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> interactions (P > 0. 37 and P > 0. 17, respectively) were observed; however, diet form × particle size interactions were observed for F/G and ADFI (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 10, respectively). Grinding soybean hulls resulted in improved F/G and reduced ADFI when added to meal diets, but did not change F/G and had less effect on ADFI when added to pelleted diets. Diet form × particle size interactions (P < 0. 05) also were observed for caloric efficiency on an ME and NE basis. Grinding soybean hulls slightly improved caloric efficiency in meal diets but worsened NE and ME caloric efficiency in pelleted diets. There was also a tendency for a diet form × soybean hulls interaction (P < 0. 06) for ADFI and F/G. Increasing soybean hulls from 10 to 20 % increased ADFI and worsened F/G in meal diets but resulted in slightly reduced ADFI and no changes to F/G when added to pelleted diets; furthermore, there were tendencies for diet form × soybean hulls interactions (P < 0. 06) on caloric efficiency on an ME and NE basis in which increasing soybean hulls from 10 to 20 % improved caloric efficiency to a greater extent in pelleted diets than in meal diets...|$|E

Twenty four Holstein Friesian crossbred (> 87. 5 % Holstein Friesian) lactating dairy cows, averaging 16. 3 + 1. 4 kg/d of milk, 84 + 15 days in milk, 42 + 5 mo old, and 415 + 20 kg body weight, were blocked by milking days first and then by milk yield, body weight, and age into 2 groups of 12 cows. Cows within each group were further randomly assigned to 3 treatments of 8 cows each. The treatments were control (0 % <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> (SH)), 10 % SH and 20 % SH in the concentrates. Performance parameters showed that DM intake, CP intake, NELP intake, milk yield, milk composition, and body weight change were similar in all treatments. However, milk fat and milk protein contents tended to linearly increase with increasing <b>soybean</b> <b>hull</b> in the concentrates while total solid content was significantly linearly increased by the addition of SH. Concentrations of ruminal ammonia nitro-gen, volatile fatty acids, and pH were unaffected by the treatments. Milk fatty acid contents were also similar in all treatments except for C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3 that were significantly linearly increased by the addition of SH.
