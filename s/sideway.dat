2500|$|In 1993 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} add the missing flyover and underpass close to Stoke-on-Trent railway station, after an alternative plan had been rejected because of its cost. A full review of the national roads programme resulted in the suspension of that scheme however. [...] In 1997 the A50 was rerouted through Stoke-on-Trent to meet the A500 at <b>Sideway,</b> where a new grade separated roundabout was constructed.|$|E
40|$|Eye gaze is {{compelling}} for interaction with situated displays as we naturally use {{our eyes to}} engage with them. In this work we present <b>SideWays,</b> a novel person-independent eye gaze interface that supports spontaneous interaction with displays: users can just walk up to a display and immediately interact using their eyes, without any prior user calibration or training. Requiring only a single off-the-shelf camera and lightweight image processing, <b>SideWays</b> robustly detects whether users attend to {{the centre of the}} display or cast glances to the left or right. The system supports an interaction model in which attention to the central display is the default state, while "sidelong glances" trigger input or actions. The robustness of the system and usability of the interaction model are validated in a study with 14 participants. Analysis of the participants' strategies in performing different tasks provides insights on gaze control strategies for design of <b>SideWays</b> applications...|$|R
5000|$|The Peats Ridge Festival {{featured}} a dedicated area for arts and theatre, called <b>SideWays</b> Alley, located along the riverfront. The arts program featured over 1,500 artists, performing puppetry, mime, spoken word, dance, music, circus and visual arts. A main feature was the Bohemian Love Theatre, which {{was described as}} [...] "a barefoot velvet vaudeville club, boho glam rock ‘n roll circus, a bohemian absinthe den, and lost-in-tie faerie tale speakeasy dream world," [...] and featureg a number of comedy, dance, circus, cabaret and musical acts. The backyard of the Bohemian Love Theatre is the Avant Garden is a space for painting, organic wine and Sangria and enjoying the surroundings. The application process provided opportunities for new artists to establish themselves in an internationally recognised arena.|$|R
2500|$|Flash SFX, {{the team}} {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} the gimbal stated, [...] "The main challenge of physical effects work was that of inventing and developing a system that would perfectly simulate movements of train in motion. We managed to create a massive gimbal system supporting train cars with a total weight close to 100 tons. It was capable of simulating all <b>sideway</b> motions and vibrations of the train, including perfect make-believe curves of railroad tracks." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{leaned her}} own bicycle against the wall. From {{where she was}} she could catch a <b>sideway</b> glimpse of a tall, slight figure {{standing}} up before the handful of people.|$|E
60|$|The throne was void. But half-concealed by drapery, {{behind the}} goodliest lord, <b>sideway</b> leaned a figure diademed, a lifted poniard in its hand:--a monarch fossilized in {{very act of}} murdering his guest.|$|E
60|$|Soames' gorge {{had risen}} {{so that he}} could hardly speak. It was {{absolutely}} necessary to hide from this man that he had any but professional interest in the matter; and, mechanically, his face assumed its <b>sideway</b> smile.|$|E
6000|$|Buffoon! Soames {{passed him}} with his <b>sideway</b> smile. Lying back, rubbing his skin uneasily for {{the first signs of}} perspiration, he thought: 'Let them laugh! I won't feel anything! I can't stand violence! It's not good for me!' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{very thought}} seemed to {{completely}} terrify him; with both arms he hugged his various written treasures, and with many <b>sideway</b> bows and murmurs of thanks he finally succeeded in shuffling his lean figure {{out of the}} room, closely followed by M. Paul.|$|E
6000|$|Soames stole a <b>sideway</b> look: [...] "It's {{much too}} late to go into that," [...] he said, [...] "I only {{want it to be}} quite {{understood}} that if I give him a free hand, he doesn't let me in. I thought if you were to speak to him, it would carry more weight!" ...|$|E

60|$|The grave elderly man, son of that Bernardo Cennini, who, {{twenty years}} before, having {{heard of the}} new process of {{printing}} carried on by Germans, had cast his own types in Florence, remained necessarily in lathered silence and passivity while Nello showered this talk in his ears, but turned a slow <b>sideway</b> gaze on the stranger.|$|E

6000|$|More <b>sideway</b> walking, {{thicker and}} thicker mist, {{all sorts of}} points reached except the 'certain point;' third loss of Idle, third shouts for him, third {{recovery}} of him, third consultation of compass. Mr. Goodchild draws it tenderly from his pocket, and prepares to adjust it on a stone. Something falls on the turf--it is the glass. Something else drops immediately after--it is the needle. The compass is broken, and the exploring party is lost! ...|$|E
60|$|That which Hereward had {{foreseen}} was come at last. The bridge, strained {{more and}} more by its living burden, and by the falling tide, had parted,--not at the Ely end, where the sliding of the sow took off the pressure,--but at the end nearest the camp. One <b>sideway</b> roll it gave, and then, turning over, engulfed in that foul stream the flower of Norman chivalry; leaving a line--a full {{quarter of a mile}} in length--of wretches drowning in the dark water, or, more hideous still, in the bottomless slime of peat and mud.|$|E
60|$|The queer {{gestures}} {{and sounds of}} a hen looking about {{for a place to}} deposit her egg; her self-important gait; the <b>sideway</b> turn of her head and cock of her eye, as she pries into one and another nook, croaking all the while,--evidently with the idea that the egg in question {{is the most important thing}} that has been brought to pass since the world began. A speckled black and white and tufted hen of ours does it to most ludicrous perfection; and there is something laughably womanish in it too.|$|E
6000|$|And if, insatiate, {{the enquirer}} had gone on, [...] "You do not look, then, for spiritual union in this marriage?" [...] Soames would have lifted his <b>sideway</b> smile, and rejoined: [...] "That's {{as it may}} be. If I get {{satisfaction}} for my senses, perpetuation of myself; good taste and good humour in the house; it is all I can expect at my age. I am {{not likely to be}} going out of my way towards any far-fetched sentimentalism." [...] Whereon, the enquirer must in good taste have ceased enquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Posing ass!' thought Soames. Like all who {{fundamentally}} {{believe in}} themselves he was {{rising to the}} occasion, and, with his little <b>sideway</b> smile, he said: [...] "I've had your letter. I'm going to act. I suppose you know who the lady you've been watching really is?" [...] Mr. Polteed's expression at that moment was a masterpiece. It so clearly said: 'Well, what do you think? But mere professional knowledge, I assure you--pray forgive it!' He made a little half airy movement with his hand, as who should say: 'Such things--such things will happen to us all!' ...|$|E
60|$|Inside {{the house}} his {{maternal}} grandmother was sitting by a wood fire. Before it stood a pipkin, in which something was evidently kept warm. An eight-legged oak {{table in the}} middle of the room was laid for a meal. This woman of eighty, in a large mob cap, under which she wore a little cap to keep the other clean, retained faculties but little blunted. She was gazing into the flames, with her hands upon her knees, quietly re- enacting in her brain certain of the long chain of episodes, pathetic, tragical, and humorous, which had constituted the parish history for the last sixty years. On Swithin's entry she looked up at him in a <b>sideway</b> direction.|$|E
60|$|It was a rapid pattering growing {{louder and}} coming towards her, {{and in a}} little while she could hear {{grunting}} noises and the snapping of twigs. It was a drove of lean grisly wild swine. She turned about her, for a boar is an ill fellow to pass too closely, on account of the <b>sideway</b> slash of his tusks, and she made off slantingly through the trees. But the patter came nearer, they were not feeding as they wandered, but going fast--or else they would not overtake her--and she caught the limb of a tree, swung on to it, and ran up the stem with something of the agility of a monkey.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} one who found, to use his own words, 'a strange <b>sideway</b> out of Ladysmith,' whose memory many English-speaking people will preserve. I do not write of Steevens as a journalist, nor as the master of a popular and {{pleasing}} style, but as a man. I knew him, though I had met him rarely. A dinner up the Nile, a chance meeting at an Indian junction, five days on a Mediterranean steamer, two in a Continental express, and a long Sunday at his house near Merton--it was a scanty acquaintance, but sufficient to be quite certain that in all the varied circumstances and conditions to which men are subjected Steevens rang true. Modest yet proud, wise as well as witty, cynical but above all things sincere, he combined the characters of a charming companion and a good comrade.|$|E
6000|$|Not seldom {{from the}} uproar I retired [...] Into a silent bay, or sportively [...] Glanced <b>sideway,</b> leaving the tumultuous throng, [...] To {{cut across the}} reflex [12] of a star; [...] 50 [...] Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed [...] Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes, [13] [...] When we had given our bodies to the wind, [...] And all the shadowy banks on either side [...] Came {{sweeping}} through the darkness, spinning still [...] 55 [...] The rapid line of motion, then at once [...] Have I, reclining back upon my heels, [...] Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs [...] Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled [...] With visible motion her diurnal round!

6000|$|After {{giving a}} {{look out of}} the window, {{to see that the}} {{children}} were within sight, she opened the big Bible at the story of the ten plagues of Egypt, and adjusting her horn spectacles with a sort of <b>sideway</b> twist on her little pug nose, she seemed intent on her Sunday duties. A moment after she looked up and said, [...] "I don't know but I must send a message by you over to Mis' Deacon Badger, about a worldly matter, if 'tis Sunday; but I've been thinkin', Mis' Pennel, that there'll have to be clothes made up for this 'ere child next week, and so perhaps Roxy and I had better stop here a day or two longer, and you tell Mis' Badger that we'll come to her a Wednesday, and so she'll have time to have that new press-board done,--the old one used to pester me so." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{edges and}} {{corners of the}} box were carved with most {{wonderful}} skill. Around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women, and the prettiest children ever seen, reclining or sporting amid a profusion of flowers and foliage; and these various objects were so exquisitely represented, and were wrought together in such harmony, that flowers, foliage, and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty. But here and there, peeping forth from behind the carved foliage, Pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely, or something or other that was disagreeable, and which stole the beauty {{out of all the}} rest. Nevertheless, on looking more closely, and touching the spot with her finger, she could discover nothing of the kind. Some face, that was really beautiful, had been made to look ugly by her catching a <b>sideway</b> glimpse at it.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{from this}} {{peculiar}} <b>sideway</b> {{position of the}} whale's eyes, it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can one exactly astern. In a word, {{the position of the}} whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you {{would not be able to}} see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man-- what, indeed, but his eyes? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{felt that}} he was taking no steps to {{approach}} the subject which he should have to discuss before he left her,--or rather the statement which he had resolved that he would make. Indeed every word which he allowed her to say respecting this Mexican project carried him farther away from it. He was giving reasons why the journey should not be made; but was tacitly admitting that if it were to be made she might be one of the travellers. The very offer on her part implied an understanding that his former abnegation of the engagement had been withdrawn, and yet he shrunk from the cruelty of telling her, in a <b>sideway</b> fashion, that he would not submit to her companionship either for the purpose of such a journey or for any other purpose. The thing must be said in a solemn manner, and must be introduced on its own basis. But such preliminary conversation as this made the introduction of it infinitely more difficult.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! young man," [...] said Bratti, with a <b>sideway</b> glance of some admiration, [...] "you {{were not}} {{born of a}} Sunday--the salt-shops were open when you came into the world. You're not a Hebrew, eh?--come from Spain or Naples, eh? Let {{me tell you the}} Frati Minori are trying to make Florence as hot as Spain for those dogs of hell that want to get all the profit of usury to {{themselves}} and leave none for Christians; and when you walk the Calimara with a piece of yellow cloth in your cap, it will spoil your beauty more than a sword-cut across that smooth olive cheek of yours.--Abbaratta, baratta--chi abbaratta?--I tell you, young man, grey cloth is against yellow cloth; and there's as much grey cloth in Florence as would make a gown and cowl for the Duomo, and there's not so much yellow cloth as would make hose for Saint Christopher--blessed be his name, and send me a sight of him this day!--Abbaratta, baratta, b'ratta--chi abbaratta?" ...|$|E
60|$|Beaten off by such undreamed-of glooms and steeps, you now sadly retraced your steps, and, mayhap, went {{skirting}} the inferior <b>sideway</b> terraces of pastures; where the multiple and most sterile inodorous immortalness of the small, white flower furnished no aliment for the mild cow's meditative cud. But {{here and there}} you still might smell from far the sweet aromaticness of clumps of catnip, that dear farm-house herb. Soon you would see the modest verdure of the plant itself; and wheresoever you saw that sight, old foundation stones and rotting timbers of log-houses long extinct would also meet your eye; their desolation illy hid by the green solicitudes of the unemigrating herb. Most fitly named the catnip; since, like the unrunagate cat, though all that's human forsake the place, that plant will long abide, long bask and bloom on the abandoned hearth. Illy hid; for every spring the amaranthine and celestial flower gained on the mortal household herb; for every autumn the catnip died, but never an autumn made the amaranth to wane. The catnip and the amaranth!--man's earthly household peace, and the ever-encroaching appetite for God.|$|E
60|$|Half a shovelful of sand {{was placed}} in the vanner with a small {{quantity}} of water, and while Harry and Sam proceeded to wash some gravel roughly in the pans, Tom stood watching Jerry's operations. He gave a gentle motion to the vanner that caused its contents to revolve, the coarser particles being thrown towards the edges while the finer remained in the centre. The water was poured away and the rougher particles of gravel and sand swept off by the hand; fresh water was then added, and the process repeated again and again, until at last no more than a spoonful of fine sand remained in the centre. A <b>sideway</b> action of the vanner caused this to slope gradually down towards the edge. At the very bottom three tiny bits of yellow metal were seen. They were no bigger than pins' heads. It seemed to Tom that this was a miserably small return for five minutes' labour, but the others seemed well satisfied, and were still more pleased when, on the two pans being cleaned out, several little pieces of gold were found, one of which was nearly as large as a small pea.|$|E
