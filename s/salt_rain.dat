An angry mob forces K'mith and the dome technicians to allow Don to designate the dome-control building as the dog-god's shrine. Don then uses a signal generator that he had retrieved from Triton to modulate the current creating the dome forcefilm, causing a loud hum and <b>salt</b> <b>rain</b> to come from the dome and terrify the mob. Don then discovers that K'mith has had his own agenda which meshes perfectly with what Don had intended: the Atlanteans have been unable to find any more of the crystals that they need and he had hoped that scientists on the surface world might be able to make more. Don assures him that they can and will.

Regarding BDV tests, used polymers cover (i) thermoplastics (namely, polyamide 6, polyamide 66, polyarylamide, polycarbonate, high density polyethylene and polyphenylene sulfide); and (ii) unfilled/fireproofed EPDM rubbers. The obtained results clearly show that {{breakdown voltage}} (BDV) with spherical electrodes exhibits the highest values. It is also evidenced that the connection to the H.

Results show that the spherical-pyramidally capped point electrodes exhibit higher BDV than that for the spherical-cylindrical ones for PA 66 / 50 PC/ 40, PARA/ 50 and HDPE. Furthermore, thermal ageing affects seriously BDV of EPDM based materials while polyphenylene sulfide is less damaged due to its highest thermal stability. As concerns thermo-hygro ageing, the moisture absorption is responsible for the significant BDV decrease of polyamide materials (PA 6 / 50 and PA 66 / 50) ...|$|E

Deposition of constituents like H +, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride and sodium, were much higher in Pensacola Bay that at National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) sites. Chloride and sodium deposition are higher because Pensacola Bay sites are closer to the Gulf of Mexico which is a source of sea <b>salt</b> aerosols.

40|$|Rain water {{sampling}} {{in marine}} areas was undertaken by four groups working independently {{at the same}} lime at the same place. The analytical results of the samples collected exhibit large variations and {{the main cause of}} these variations is the "non-rain deposition" as sea <b>salt</b> during the <b>rain</b> itself. The collected water is a mixture of rain water and variable amounts of more concentrated sea salt transported by the wind. This non-rain deposition is influenced by the exposure geometry of the sampler to the wind flow. Because sample conductivity and pH were measured using exactly the same protocol each time, a quantitative model based on simple conductivity and pH measurements is proposed to compute the amount of dissolved sea salt within samples collected under marine conditions. The acid balance of the rain water appears to be not influenced by this non rain deposition.

5000|$|The size of {{the island}} has been {{increased}} several times by [...] "innings". Saltings build up along the shore from silt which is carried to the sea by the rivers, and is deposited on the shore by the tide. Salt-loving plants then take root in the mud, and the salting is established. The plants trap sediments, and the surface rises until it remains above the level of most tides. Inning occurs when a sea wall is built {{around the edge of}} the <b>salting,</b> after which <b>rain</b> washes the <b>salt</b> downwards.

40|$|Forest biomass has the {{potential}} to significantly impact the chemistry and volume of diffuse recharge to cave dripwater via the processes of nutrient uptake, transpiration and forest fire. Yet to-date, this role has been under-appreciated in the interpretation of speleothem trace element records from forested catchments. In this study, the impact of vegetation is examined and quantified in a long-term monitoring program from Golgotha Cave, SW Australia. The contribution of <b>salts</b> from <b>rain</b> and dry-deposition of aerosols and dissolved elements from soil mineral and bedrock dissolution to dripwater chemistry are also examined. This study is an essential pre-requisite for the future interpretation of trace element data from SW Australian stalagmite records, whose record of past environmental change will include alterations in these biogeochemical fluxes. Solute concentrations in dripwater vary spatially, supporting the existence of distinct flow paths governed by varying amounts of transpiration as well as nutrient uptake by deeply-rooted biomass. Applying principal components analysis, we identify a common pattern of variation in dripwater Cl, Mg, K, Ca, Sr and Si, interpreted as reflecting increasing transpiration, due to forest growth. Mass-balance calculations show that increasing elemental sequestration into biomass has the largest impact on SO 4, providing an explanation for the overall falling dripwater SO 4 concentrations through time, in contrast to the transpiration-driven rising trend dominating other ions. The long-term rise in transpiration and nutrient uptake driven by increased forest bioproductivity and its impact on our dripwater chemistry is attributed to (i) the post-fire recovery of the forest understorey after fire impacted the site in 2006 CE; (ii) and/or increased water and nutrient demand as trees in the overlying forest mature. The impact of climate-driven changes on the water balance is also examined. Finally, the implications for interpreting SW Australian speleothem trace element records are discussed. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the design of}} repair mortars for historic masonry are: the type of masonry, {{the condition of the}} masonry and the exposure conditions. Especially in case of low-strength masonry exposed to heavy <b>rain</b> and high <b>salt</b> contents the design of a repair mortar may be a challenge. The most important problem is obtaining adequate insight into and feeling for the requirements, that play a role with regard to the mortar design. To this end the paper concentrates on materials behaviour of repair mortars in historic masonry. This is done {{in the context of the}} analysis of several types of attack on mortar durability: freeze-thaw cycling, <b>salts,</b> thermal movement, <b>rain</b> penetration. From this analysis relevant materials characteristics and technical requirements are derived. The main conclusions are • the binder choice may significantly affect the durability of repairs, • a basic and determining condition is a good execution technique. Consequently, thorough insight into the characteristics and behaviour of the various available binders is then an important tool to the repair mortar designer. And, practical field experience with the possibilities and limitations of on-site execution practices may be very helpful to ensure good quality of the repair work. <br/...|$|R

But it is easier to do those things in an English port than in the sight of a number of natives, and especially when there is but one person able to communicate with the said natives. If I went off in the boat sounding, who was to look after the schooner? If I stayed on board, who was to explain to the natives what was being done in the boat? Besides, we have but five men on board, including the master and mate, and one of them was disabled by a bad hand, so that if I had manned the boat, I should have left only three able-bodied men on board--it was a puzzle, you see, dear Uncle. Now I have entered into this long defence lest any of you dear ones should think me rash. Indeed, I don't want to run any risks at all. But there was no risk here, as I supposed, and had we chosen to go round on the other tack we should have known nothing of a risk now.

Microbial {{diversity}} was measured along a salinity gradient at the Great Salt Plains of Oklahoma using colony color quantified as RGB components of microbial isolate streaks. Numerical taxonomy was performed using a UPGMA method to create trees of relatedness, define OTUs, and calculate diversity indices. Surface soil samples along a 6 -m salinity gradient (from hypersaline soil with 7. 5 % salinity to oligohaline rangeland soil) at WP 68 were dilution-plated on SP medium of various salinities and hundreds of random colonies were collected. The salinity tolerance of isolates along the gradient was determined. From the 1364 colonies examined, 338 OTUs were defined by colony color and their distribution statistically analyzed by soil type and the salinity of enrichment media. Most colonies were shades of cream that became distinguishable based on RGB color components. Diversity indices were high overall {{and it is likely}} that the OTUs defined by colony color are below the species level, at the strain level, where the greatest diversity lies in this environment. These results are complementary to previous molecular genetic analyses of 16 S rRNA clone libraries from soils at the Great Salt Plains.

Ground-water flow in the aquifer system is radially outward {{from the center of}} two ground-water mounds, corresponding to two 110 m-thick sand deposits. The isotopic data from ancient ground waters from the Liwa Oasis with its unusual “d ” (deuterium excess) of approximately- 15 indicate that Holocene moisture derived from previously evaporated water {{on the surface of the}} Indian Ocean rather than from the Mediterranean/Arabian Gulf. Such a source is consistent with a summer monsoonal circulation. Hydraulic heads in underlying aquifers are lower than those of the Liwa / Bu Hasa aquifer; thus, there is no advective water or solute input from these lower units. Solute diffusion from underlying aquifers provides a small solute flux, but it is inadequate to account for the observed solute mass, nor is the ionic ratio consistent with this source. There are no laterally adjacent aquifers; thus, there is no influx of solutes from these sources. Dissolution of the aquifer framework provides for only a minor fraction of most of the observed solutes.

40|$|The common {{appearance}} of hygroscopic brine (“sweating”) on ordinary chondrites (OCs) from Oman during storage under room conditions initiated {{a study on}} the role of water-soluble salts on the weathering of OCs. Analyses of leachates from OCs and soils, combined with petrography of alteration features and a 11 -month record of in situ meteorite and soil temperatures, are used to evaluate the role of salts in OC weathering. Main soluble ions in soils are Ca 2 +, SO 42 −, HCO 3 −, Na+, and Cl−, while OC leachates are dominated by Mg 2 + (from meteoritic olivine), Ca 2 + (from soil), Cl− (from soil), SO 42 − (from meteoritic troilite and soil), and iron (meteoritic). “Sweating meteorites” mainly contain Mg 2 + and Cl−. The median Na/Cl mass ratio of leachates changes from 0. 65 in soils to 0. 07 in meteorites, indicating the precipitation of a Na-rich phase or loss of an efflorescent Na-salt. The total concentrations of water-soluble ions in bulk OCs ranges from 600 to 9000 μg g− 1 (median 2500 μg g− 1) as compared to 187 – 14140 μg g− 1 in soils (median 1148 μg g− 1). Soil <b>salts</b> dissolved by <b>rain</b> water are soaked up by meteorites by capillary forces. Daily heating (up to 66. 3 °C) and cooling of the meteorites cause a pumping effect, resulting in a strong concentration of soluble ions in meteorites over time. The concentrations of water-soluble ions in meteorites, which are complex mixtures of ions from the soil and from oxidation and hydrolysis of meteoritic material, depend on the degree of weathering and are highest at W 3. Input of soil contaminants generally dominates over the ions mobilized from meteorites. Silicate hydrolysis preferentially affects olivine and is enhanced by sulfide oxidation, producing local acidic conditions as evidenced by jarosite. Plagioclase weathering is negligible. After completion of troilite oxidation, the rate of chemical weathering slows down with continuing Ca-sulfate contamination...|$|R
