In {{the event}} that a {{determination}} of non-regulated status made pursuant to section 411 of the Plant Protection Act is or has been invalidated or vacated, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon request by a farmer, grower, farm operator, or producer, immediately grant temporary permit(s) or temporary deregulation in part, subject to necessary and appropriate conditions consistent with section 411(a) or 412(c) of the Plant Protection Act, which interim <b>conditions</b> <b>shall</b> authorize the movement, introduction, continued cultivation, commercialization and other specifically enumerated activities and requirements, including measures designed to mitigate or minimize potential adverse environmental effects, if any, relevant to the Secretary's evaluation of the petition for non-regulated status, while ensuring that growers or other users are able to move, plant, cultivate, introduce into commerce and carry out other authorized activities in a timely manner: Provided, That all <b>such</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>shall</b> be applicable only for the interim period necessary for the Secretary to complete any required analyses or consultations related to the petition for non-regulated status: Provided further, That nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the Secretary's authority under section 411, 412 and 414 of the Plant Protection Act.|$|R

40|$|Powering superconducting magnets {{requires}} {{the use of}} cryogenic feedthroughs for the superconducting cables capable of withstanding severe thermal, mechanical and electrical operating <b>conditions.</b> <b>Such</b> feedthrough <b>shall</b> provide the continuity of the superconducting circuit while ensuring a hydraulic separation at cryogenic temperature. A study about the adhesive and polymers required for the production of thermal shock resistant feedthroughs is presented. The strength of the busbar to adhesive joints was first investigated by compression/shear tests as well as pin and collar tests performed with four epoxy adhesives. After the selection of the most appropriate adhesive, pin and collar tests were performed with four different polymers. Based on the results, a superconducting cable feedthrough for 6 busbars of 6 kA and 12 busbars of 120 A was constructed and successfully tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the town represented a key {{turning point in the}} life of the Flower Garden. Its entrance was relocated from the arcade in the upper part of the garden to its side, via the cour d'honneur. It means that visitors leave not having experienced the genius loci of the Flower Garden, since they entered the middle part of the garden “exhibition” without any previous explanation. The main idea of the entire project is to restore the garden into its original <b>condition,</b> which <b>shall</b> <b>include</b> the opening of a central pavilion and the possibility to enter the garden upon the “introduction” on the arcade in the upper part of the central axis. The project attempts to make use of the existing cour d'honneur as much as possible, which is finely renovated in order to be able to comply with the current requirements for a UNESCO World Heritage Site entrance building. The existing entrance building and cour d'honneur feature a foyer, restaurant, restaurant facilities and exhibition areas and supply off-loading area. The projected area features a new curve-defined exhibition area which represents reminiscence of a unique arcade. The new element is located in the upper third of the projected area and it is embedded in the surrounding terrain to create shallow passageway between the gardens. This embedding creates angularities running in opposite directions, one of which is designed as a ramp connecting the terrace on the arcade and the projected area. A florist’s is reconstructed in the lower part of the gardens (it is expected to be partly independent) with no relation to the applicable plan area. The florist’s is also interlaced with the axes of the Flower Garden, with the vision of the renovation of "rabbit’s hillock" and the reconstruction of a bird house with a body of water...|$|R
