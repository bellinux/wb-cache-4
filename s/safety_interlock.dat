25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a key switch, a <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers {{may not have a}} safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.|$|E
25|$|A Class 3B laser is {{hazardous}} if the eye {{is exposed}} directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the wavelength range from 315nm to far infrared is 0.5W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700nm, the limit is 30mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. Protective eyewear is typically required where direct viewing of a class3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a <b>safety</b> <b>interlock.</b> Class3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.|$|E
25|$|Class 4 is {{the highest}} and most {{dangerous}} class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class3B AEL. By definition, a class4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage {{as a result of}} direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite combustible materials, and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the beam path. Class4 lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a <b>safety</b> <b>interlock.</b> Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular hazard area (NOHA).|$|E
50|$|During {{a heated}} {{discussion}} during a stop-over at Gander International Airport, Honey realises {{that he has}} failed to persuade anyone to declare the Reindeer unfit for service, and in desperation, disables it by pulling <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> and raising its undercarriage while it {{is standing on the}} runway, leaving the aircraft unable to move and damaged.|$|R
50|$|Household {{microwave}} ovens have shielding around {{the inside of}} the oven that prevents microwaves from leaking out, as well as <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> that prevent the oven from operating when the door is open.

50|$|Blasting caps are ignited {{utilizing}} hand-held {{intrinsically safe}} control boxes which employ {{a series of}} <b>safety</b> <b>interlocks</b> and switches which require a strict radio sessioning handshake protocol between the unit which ignites the cap and the unit used by the Master Blaster controlling the shot, ensuring that the emplaced Tovex, detonation cord, and caps cannot ignite prematurely.|$|R
50|$|As the {{controller}} hardware evolved, the mills themselves also evolved.

50|$|In {{addition}} to carrying power the connector {{also makes a}} data connection using the CAN bus protocol. This performs functions such as a <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> to avoid energizing the connector before it's safe (similar to SAE J1772), transmitting battery parameters to the charging station including when to stop charging (top battery percentage, usually 80%), target voltage, and total battery capacity, and while charging how the station should vary its output current.|$|E
50|$|As {{mandated}} by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), wheelchair-accessible vans with wheelchair lifts are equipped with a safety lift interlock.

50|$|It {{was from}} the {{automotive}} industry in the USA that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and <b>safety</b> <b>interlock</b> logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays, cam timers, drum sequencers, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model change-over was very time consuming and expensive, as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics.|$|E

50|$|As {{with their}} air-actuated cousins, {{powder-actuated}} guns have a muzzle <b>safety</b> <b>interlock.</b> If the muzzle is not pressed against a surface with sufficient force, {{the firing pin}} is blocked and cannot reach the load to fire it. This ensures that the gun does not discharge in an unsafe manner, causing the nail to become a projectile. Nonetheless, good judgment should always be used when using a powder-actuated nail gun, since the nail is driven with far more force than an air-actuated gun. The surface being nailed should, therefore, certainly be capable of stopping and holding the nail.|$|E
