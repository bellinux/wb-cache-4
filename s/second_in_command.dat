Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further half an hour before reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw.|$|E
50|$|The {{manoeuvres}} of 1889 {{were similar}} to the previous year, with an enemy fleet based at Queenstown and Berehaven, but this time Baird commanded the 'enemy' fleet and Tryon the 'British'. Baird's task was to launch raids against Britain, and while Tryon would not attempt to blockade his enemy in port, it was his task to prevent the raiding. Both admirals had slow flagships, while their <b>second</b> <b>in</b> <b>commands,</b> Tracey for Tryon's fleet and D'Arcy Irvine for Baird, had fast ships.

5|$|After the Canadian {{government}} withdrew promised {{financial support}} for the expedition, the delay in finding replacement funding ate into the Arctic sailing season. Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any longer than he had to, decided to go south instead and attempt a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent. The expedition, known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, {{an old friend of}} Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands. The expedition included several Endurance veterans in addition to Worsley; Frank Wild was again <b>second</b> <b>in</b> <b>command,</b> and Leonard Hussey was the meteorologist.

In December Tang Shengzhi and Zhang Fakui announced their support of the anti-Chiang coalition. The Nationalist government in Nanjing expelled Wang Jingwei from the party in March {{as a response to}} the anti-Chiang coalition. The opposition moved to Beijing to set up a rival KMT government. In February 1930 Yan Xishan of the Shanxi clique demanded Chiang's resignation, which Chiang refused to give. Later that month Yan was chosen to be commander-in-chief of the coalition, while Feng, Li and Zhang Xueliang were chosen as his <b>seconds</b> <b>in</b> <b>command.</b> <b>In</b> April all of them were sworn into their positions except Zhang, who was not committed to either side at the time.|$|R

5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the <b>second</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
