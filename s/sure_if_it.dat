The invaders did cross and Arce's troops retreated, allowing the British to march towards the city on June 26.|$|E

As he freezes to death, he radios Capa to escape the airlock, decouple the bomb from the ship, and activate it as it plummets into the sun, delivering the payload to its destination. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie. Pinbacker ambushes them, telling them God ordered him to send all humanity to Heaven. As they hurtle into the sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker, reaching the bomb controls. Not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> will work under these extreme conditions, he watches as the bomb begins to successfully ignite {{at the edge of}} the sun itself.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm just not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> works.

[...] Isler observed {{that he would have}} [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup...

[...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell.

Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other [...] "real" [...] drums (6 tracks) were played by Y drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer {{would like to have}} a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack.

Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction.

On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty".

2500|$|Cyrus was in Ecbatana {{when the}} revolt had already begun. In Nicolaus's account, when Cyrus was let go, he fled from Astyages {{because he knew}} he might {{eventually}} be executed if Astyages discovered that Cyrus's true motive [...] was to join and fight alongside his father, if necessary. This is because when Cyrus was half way to becoming an adult he learned that Astyages had already tried to execute {{him when he was}} an infant, but it did not succeed, and as time passed, Astyages came to respect Cyrus for the similarities of character they shared. Meanwhile, Astyages was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was safe to let Cyrus return to his homeland. Astyages eventually did, and it helped terminate the Median kingdom. When Astyages was tricked by Harpagus twice into believing Cyrus was not a danger to him, even when the revolt and impending signs of danger had already happened, Cyrus saw how easily Astyages could be swindled. For this reason, Cyrus may have taken advantage of this to bring freedom to his own kingdom.|$|E
