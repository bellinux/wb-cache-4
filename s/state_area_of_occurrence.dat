40|$|The article {{describes}} the dispersion dynamics of snow crab opilio in the Barents Sea from 1996 to 2014 and the factors influencing its acclimatization. On the basis of spacial distribution modeling, it is <b>stated</b> that the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> has increased 10 times for the research period and currently the habitat of snow crab opilio in the Barents Sea occupies 34 % <b>of</b> the sea <b>area.</b> The main factor, limiting further distribution of snow crab could become the bottom temperature in the South East of the Barents Sea. However, the potential of further crab distribution in the sea is still rather high. The prognostic estimation shows that the habitat could double with north-western <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the Barents Sea and coastal <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the Svalbard archipelago...|$|R
40|$|Problem/Condition: CDC began {{abortion}} surveillance in 1969 {{to document}} the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Reporting Period Covered: This report summarizes and describes data voluntarily reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions obtained in the United States in 2005. Description of System: For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled abortion data by <b>state</b> or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Information is requested each year from all 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. For 2005, data were received from 49 reporting areas: New York City, District of Columbia, and all states except California, Louisiana, and New Hampshire. For the purpose of trends analysis, data were evaluated from the 46 reporting areas that have been consistently reported since 1995. Results: A total of 820, 151 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC for 2005 from 49 reporting areas, the abortion ratio (number of abortions per 1, 000 live births) was 233, and the abortion rate was 15 per 1, 000 women aged 15 [...] 44 years. For the 46 reporting areas that have consistently reported since 1995, the abortion rate declined during 1995 [...] 2000 but has remained unchanged since 2000. For 2005, the highest percentages of reported abortions were for women who {{were known to be}} unmarried (81 %), white (53 %), and aged 15 weeks' gestation (3. 7 % at 16 [...] 20 weeks and 1. 3 % at >/= 21 weeks). A total <b>of</b> 35 reporting <b>areas</b> submitted data <b>stating</b> that they performed and enumerated medical (nonsurgical) procedures, making up 9. 9 % of all known reported procedures from the 45 areas with adequate reporting on type of procedure. In 2004 (the most recent years for which data are available), seven women {{died as a result of}} complications from known legal induced abortion. One death was associated with known illegal abortion. Interpretation: For the 46 reporting areas that have consistently reported since 1995, the number of abortions has steadily declined over the previous 10 years. The abortion rate declined from 1995 to 2000, but remained unchanged since 2000. In 2004, as in the previous years, deaths related to legal induced abortions occurred rarely. Public Health Action: Abortion surveillance in the United States continues to provide the data necessary for examining trends in numbers and characteristics of women who obtain legal induced abortions and to increase understanding of this pregnancy outcome. Policymakers and program planners use these data to improve the health and well-being of women and evaluate efforts to prevent unintended pregnancies. " - p. 1 Sonya B. Gamble, Lilo T.

40|$|PROBLEM/CONDITION: CDC began {{abortion}} surveillance in 1969 {{to document}} the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes and describes data voluntarily reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions obtained in the United States in 2001. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled abortion data by <b>state</b> or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence.</b> During 1973 - 1997, data were received from or estimated for 52 reporting areas in the United States: 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. In 1998 and 1999, CDC compiled abortion data from 48 reporting areas. Alaska, California, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma did not report, and data for these states were not estimated. In 2000 and 2001, Oklahoma again reported these data, increasing the number <b>of</b> reporting <b>areas</b> to 49. RESULTS: A total of 853, 485 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC for 2001 from 49 reporting areas, representing a 0. 5 % decrease from the 857, 475 legal induced abortions reported by the same 49 reporting areas for 2000. The abortion ratio, defined {{as the number of}} abortions per 1, 000 live births, was 246 in 2001, compared with 245 reported for 2000. This represents a 0. 4 % increase in the abortion ratio. The abortion rate was 16 per 1, 000 women aged 15 - 44 years for 2001, the same as for 2000. For both the 48 and 49 reporting areas, the abortion rate remained relatively constant during 1997 - 2001. The highest percentages of reported abortions were for women who were unmarried (82 %), white (55 %) and aged 15 weeks' gestation, including 4. 3 % at 16 - 20 weeks and 1. 4 % at > or = 21 weeks. A total <b>of</b> 35 reporting <b>areas</b> submitted data <b>stating</b> that they performed medical (nonsurgical) procedures, making up 2. 9 % of all reported procedures from the 45 areas with adequate reporting on type of procedure. In 2000 (the most recent year for which data are available), 11 women {{died as a result of}} complications from known legal induced abortion. No deaths were associated with known illegal abortion. INTERPRETATION: During 1990 - 1997, the number of legal induced abortions gradually declined. When the same 48 reporting areas are compared, the number of abortions decreased during 1996 - 2001. In 2000 and 2001, even with one additional reporting state, the number of abortions declined slightly. In 2000, as in previous years, deaths related to legal induced abortions occurred rarely (less than one death per 100, 000 abortions). PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Abortion surveillance in the United States continues to provide the data necessary for examining trends in numbers and characteristics of women who obtain legal induced abortions and to increase understanding of this pregnancy outcome. Policymakers and program planners use these data to improve the health and well-being of women and infants. Lilo T. Strauss, Joy Herndon, Jeani Chang, Wilda Y. Parker, Sonya V. Bowens, Suzanne B.

40|$|Abstract 1 One {{expected}} {{effect of}} global climate change on insect populations is a shift in geographical distributions toward higher latitudes and higher elevations. South-ern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis and mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae undergo regional outbreaks that result in large-scale disturbances to pine forests in the south-eastern and western United States, respectively. 2 Our objective was to investigate potential range shifts under climate change <b>of</b> outbreak <b>areas</b> for both bark beetle species and the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the forest types susceptible to them. 3 To project range changes, we used discriminant function models that incor-porated climatic variables. Models to project bark beetle ranges employed changed forest distributions as well as changes in climatic variables. 4 Projected outbreak areas for southern pine beetle increased with higher temperatures and generally shifted northward, as did the distributions of the southern pine forests. 5 Projected outbreak areas for mountain pine beetle decreased with increasing temperature and shifted toward higher elevation. That trend was mirrored in the projected distributions of pine forests in the region of the western U. S. encompassed by the study. 6 Projected outbreak areas for the two bark beetle species and the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> western pine forests increased with more precipitation and decreased with less precipitation, whereas the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> southern pine forests decreased slightly with increasing precipitation. 7 Predicted shifts of outbreak ranges for both bark beetle species followed general expectations for the effects {{of global climate}} change and reflected the under-lying long-term distributional shifts of their host forests...|$|R
