5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E

Such abuse would be practices that treat the members as objects one {{is free to}} manipulate instead of respecting their autonomy, human rights, identity and dignity. In a group they may also play mind games with another person that can make the victim <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are accepted, but in actuality are backstabbing the person when his/her back is turned. When the victim requests assistance from the abusing group it is not given.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", in reference to the words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are something separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to content generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites {{that cater to}} expanding a user's image through accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity. Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability. With Twitterbots, users are able {{to create the illusion}} of [...] "buzz" [...] on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms. The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are real. This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter. The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike. According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "a clunky, poorly {{constructed}} drama designed to spotlight the little-remarked role of black American soldiers in World War II." [...] James Rocchi, writing for Cinematical, gave the film a mixed review: [...] "When Miracle at St. Anna falters, it's in the moments that <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> {{could have been}} crafted by any other film maker; when Miracle at St. Anna succeeds, it's in the moments that {{could only have been}} crafted by Lee." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "overwrought, overproduced, overbusy and overlong" [...] and that [...] "Miracle at St. Anna finally suffers from the worst filmmaking sin of all: the failure of trust, in the story and the audience." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the film [...] "aspires to be epic, but mostly it's just unfocused, sprawling and badly in need of editing" [...] and that [...] "t tries hard to be inspiring, but it has jarring tonal shifts, stereotyped characters and a lack of narrative perspective." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described the film as [...] "too long, lazily constructed, and crammed with too many characters and subplots for any director to develop fully outside of an HBO miniseries."

2500|$|... "Donnie or Marie" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode 4.6 out of 5 stars and [...] "could barely move" [...] {{after watching the}} episode. [...] "There's still a sense of not really having any clue who killed Rosie, which may be extremely obnoxious to some and perfectly riveting to others. But that noir tone has never changed, The characters have remained true to themselves flaws and all, and the case, while at times long winded, in these last few episodes has felt like it's moved somewhere, giving us something to grasp onto and feel as if the answers are within our reach." [...] The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B, calling it a [...] "suspenseful cliffhanger" [...] and comparing the cross-editing to the previous episode [...] "Bulldog" [...] by stating: [...] "The difference is that last week cut between an absorbing dramatic scene and an energetic detective scene while [...] "Donny Or Marie" [...] cuts between two thrilling mysteries surfing each other's wakes. Instead of falling through the dramatic pauses, the momentum carries {{all the way through}} the finale." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline was pleased to see an episode dedicated to the murder investigation. He stated: [...] "I've been saying throughout this season that The Killing would have to really step up its game in the last few episodes to make the last 11 episodes <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were worth the trouble, and while 'Donnie or Marie' is certainly a strong one, it's not so revelatory or dramatic that it forgives the failings of the season that precedes it. If every episode of the season was this good, The Killing would have been a much better series. But even then, it would need to really end with a glorified bang to justify the buildup." ...|$|E
