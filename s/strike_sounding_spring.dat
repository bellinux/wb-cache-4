40|$|Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) are {{designed}} to prevent space launch vehicles from flight through environments conducive to natural or triggered lightning and are used for all U. S. government and commercial launches at government and civilian ranges. They are maintained by a committee known as the NASA/USAF Lightning Advisory Panel (LAP). The previous LLCC for anvil cloud, meant to avoid triggered lightning, {{have been shown to}} be overly restrictive. Some of these rules have had such high safety margins that they prohibited flight under conditions that are now thought to be safe 90 % of the time, leading to costly launch delays and scrubs. The LLCC for anvil clouds was upgraded in the summer of 2005 to incorporate results from the Airborne Field Mill (ABFM) experiment at the Eastern Range (ER). Numerous combinations of parameters were considered to develop the best correlation of operational weather observations to in-cloud electric fields capable of rocket triggered lightning in anvil clouds. The Volume Averaged Height Integrated Radar Reflectivity (VAHIRR) was the best metric found. Dr. Harry Koons of Aerospace Corporation conducted a risk analysis of the VAHIRR product. The results indicated that the LLCC based on the VAHIRR product would pose a negligible risk of flying through hazardous electric fields. Based on these findings, the Kennedy Space Center Weather Office is considering seeking funding for development of an automated VAHIRR algorithm for the new ER 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) RadTec 431250 weather radar and Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) radars. Before developing an automated algorithm, the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) was tasked to determine the frequency with which VAHIRR would have allowed a launch to safely proceed during weather conditions otherwise deemed "red" by the Launch Weather Officer. To do this, the AMU manually calculated VAHIRR values based on candidate cases from past launches with known anvil cloud LLCC violations. An automated algorithm may be developed if the analyses from past launches show VAHIRR would have provided a significant cost benefit by allowing a launch to proceed. The 45 WS at the ER and 30 th Weather Squadron (30 WS) at the Western Range provided the AMU with launch weather summaries from past launches that were impacted by LLCC. The 45 WS provided summaries from 14 launch attempts and the 30 WS fkom 5. The launch attempts occurred between December 2001 and June 2007. These summaries helped the AMU determine when the LLCC were "red" due to anvil cloud. The AMU collected WSR- 88 D radar reflectivity, cloud-to-ground lightning <b>strikes,</b> <b>soundings</b> and satellite imagery. The AMU used step-by-step instructions for calculating VAHIRR manually as provided by the 45 WS. These instructions were used for all of the candidate cases when anvil cloud caused an LLCC violation identified in the launch weather summaries. The AMU evaluated several software programs capable of visualizing radar data so that VAHIRR could be calculated and chose GR 2 Analyst from Gibson Ridge Software, LLC. Data availability and lack of detail from some launch weather summaries permitted analysis of six launch attempts from the ER and none from the WR. The AMU did not take into account whether or not other weather LCC violations were occurring at the same time as the anvil cloud LLCC since the goal of this task was to determine how often VAHIRR provided relief to the anvil cloud LLCC at any time during several previous launch attempts. Therefore, in the statistics presented in this report, it is possible that even though VAHIRR provided relief to the anvil cloud LLCC, other weather LCC could have been violated not permitting the launch to proceed. The results of this cost-benefit analysis indicated VAHIRR provided relief from the anvil cloud LLCC between about 15 % and 18 % of the time for varying 5 -minute time periods based on summaries fkom six launch attempts and would have allowed launch to proceed that were otherwise "NO GO" due to the anvil cloud LLCC if the T- 0 time occurred during the anvil cloud LLCC violations...|$|R

40|$|SCRAP is {{a student}} {{experiment}} that aims to validate theories on electron density fluctuations induced {{by the presence of}} dust particles connected to the phenomenon of polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE). Radar echoes are to be measured from a dust cloud of metallic microparticles released into the mesosphere above northern Sweden using a <b>sounding</b> rocket in <b>spring</b> 2015. This report presents a subproject of selecting the best size, amount and material of the dust particles to be used. A collisionless model describing the charging of and wave backscattering from the dust cloud has been compiled and applied for typical mesospheric conditions. The results indicate that the charging is dominated by photoelectric emission, leading to a positive steady-state charge number between about 10 and 1000 in less than 24 s. The particle characteristics are shown to be measurable by computing the scattering cross-section originating in the propagation of dust acoustic waves. The choice of optimal particle parameters depends on two competitive effects. For large particles of high density and low photoelectric yield, the measured signals will be stronger but also broader in the frequency spectrum. Of the alternatives considered, silver particles of 0. 1 m radius are found to be the best choice...|$|R

Sensory feedback was manipulated by perturbing the surface stiffness specified by audition and haptics in a congruent or incongruent manner. The compensatory changes in striking velocity were measured as the motor effects of the sensory perturbations, and sensory dominance was quantified by the asymmetry of congruency effects across audition and haptics. A pronounced dominance of haptics over audition suggested a superior utility of somatosensation developed through long-term experience with object exploration. Large interindividual differences in the motor effects of haptic perturbation potentially arose from a differential reliance {{on the type of}} tactual prediction error for which participants tend to compensate: vibrotactile force vs. object deformation. Musical experience did not have much of an effect beyond a slightly greater reliance on object deformation in mallet percussionists. The bias towards haptics in the presence of crossmodal perturbations was greater when participants appeared to rely on object-deformation feedback, suggesting a weaker association between haptically sensed object deformation and the acoustical structure of concomitant sound during everyday experience of actions upon objects...|$|R
