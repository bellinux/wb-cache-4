5000|$|A barge to {{be weighed}} {{was brought into}} a <b>supporting</b> <b>cradle</b> {{connected}} by levers to a weighing mechanism. The water was then drained and the scale balance adjusted to determine the barge gross weight. Subtracting the tare weight ({{the weight of the}} barge when empty) would give the cargo weight. Originally weighlocks measured the weight of the barge, initially by measuring the displacement of water from the lock by collecting the liquid in a separate measuring chamber after the barge had entered. [...] This method also requires that the unladen weight of the barge be known.|$|R

30|$|Structural {{investigations}} of the warship were not initiated {{until the beginning of}} the 21 st century, when data on on-going deformation were collected. At about the same time, an investigation of different reinforcement concepts for the ship and/or its <b>support</b> <b>cradle</b> was undertaken and different simple finite element (FE) models were also constructed for single cross-sections of the hull to predict future deformation and structural behaviour for different support scenarios [9, 10]. No final decisions have as yet been made about how to support the hull and prevent further movement and deformation. However, research has focused increasingly on the mechanical properties of Vasa oak and the way they are influenced by chemical degradation and PEG content. In the first stage, the compression strength in the radial direction and tensile strength and stiffness in the longitudinal direction of both Vasa oak and PEG-impregnated recent European oak (Quercus robur) have been investigated [7, 8]. In 2013, a new support structure project was initiated with the aim of modelling the structural behaviour of the entire ship. For this reason, a holistic approach is recommended and parameters such as geometry, joints, load transfer within the warship and load transfer from the warship to the existing <b>support</b> <b>cradle</b> have to be thoroughly explored. Material parameters such as stiffness in terms of moduli of elasticity (MOE) and cross-sectional stiffness and strength need to be investigated in more detail than before, which is a difficult task in itself. Due to both natural variation in the Vasa oak and chemical degradation and softening due to PEG in the Vasa timbers, the stiffness and strength properties are expected to vary considerably at different positions. It is therefore desirable to develop a methodology which enables the quick and easy measurement of geometry, damage and predictions of strength and stiffness. Due to the unique nature of the material, the measurements should preferably be as non-invasive and non-destructive as possible.|$|E
50|$|After this Abramelin were dormant as a live {{band for}} a few years. Their second album Deadspeak was {{gradually}} recorded, originally with drums by Sanders although his tracks were later re-recorded using a drum machine. It was released in 2000 on Shock, which featured only Dower on vocals and Aldridge performing all the music. With the live line-up of Aldridge, Dower, Rizzo, Grant Karajic on bass guitar and Matt Wilcock on guitar; Abramelin <b>supported</b> <b>Cradle</b> of Filth and again played at Metal for the Brain. Following this, however, the group effectively disbanded. Further recording was rumoured but no new material emerged. Wilcock moved to Steel Affliction and The Berzerker, and then was with UK black, death metal band, Akercocke; Rizzo was again a member of Blood Duster.|$|R

40|$|The Central Calorimeter and its <b>support</b> <b>cradle</b> {{are to be}} {{supported}} by either hydraulic or mechanical jacks. If hydraulics are used, each support will use two hydraulically coupled jacks with two out of the four supports hydraulically coupled giving {{the effect of a}} three point support system. If mechanical jacks are used, all four points are used for support. Figure 2 shows two examples of jack placement on a 3. 5 inch support plate. These two support scenarios lead to five jack failure cases to be studied. This report deals with the way in which a 0. 25 inch drop (failed jack) at one support affects the stresses in the cradle. The stresses from each failure case were analyzed in two ways. First, stress factors, defined as quotients of stress intensities of the failed case with respect to the static case, were generated and then, hand calculations similar to those in Engineering Note 3740. 215 -EN- 14 were done using the reaction forces from the failed case...|$|E
30|$|Challenges {{related to}} the Vasa that have {{previously}} been identified are of a both structural and material character. One general problem is the progressive deformation that has occurred since the ship was salvaged. The monitoring of the deformation behaviour only {{began in the late}} 1990 s [11], when the movements of the warship started to be registered in more detail. At that time, problems with indentations on the hull from the <b>support</b> <b>cradle</b> attracted special interest [11]. The present cradle on the concrete slab, which is absolutely necessary for the support of the warship, consists of stanchions which transfer the loads from the ship to the slab via wooden wedges. Over the years, the number of stanchions has been more than doubled {{in order to reduce the}} local pressure on the hull, as has the number of wedges. This has proved successful to some degree, but the problem of heterogeneously distributed loads still remains. This is indicated by the wedges, which tend to work loose or be wedged harder as the ship moves and deforms.|$|E
40|$|As the Barrel Tile Calorimeter is constructed, {{the support}} saddles and the modules will be {{subjected}} to different forces, stresses, and deflections than when completely assembled. The purpose of this analysis {{is to examine the}} forces, stresses, and deflections acting on the support saddles and modules at various stages of assembly. The nominal weight of a barrel module is 20 tons. CERN Document number ATL-LB-EA- 0001 'Summary of the Structural Analysis of the Barrel Support Saddles' describes in detail the structural analysis of the saddles and the completed barrel assembly. These calculations followed Eurocode 3. This paper examined several load cases which occur during the assembly of the Barrel. The following are the main conclusions: (1) The assembly is not stable until 18 modules are in place, and only then can the <b>support</b> <b>cradle</b> be removed; (2) The forces between modules are nominal and are far less that the forces in the completed cylinder with 64 modules in place and the cryostat load applied; (3) All of the stresses in the connections between modules are within acceptable limits; and (4) The interface between the cryostat supports and the cryostat move approximately 1. 0 mm in the X and Y directions when the load of the cryostat is transferred to the Barrel...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this effort}} is to {{demonstrate}} telerobotic inspection and mainpulation of space shuttle payloads {{in the presence of}} substantial communications time delays between the operator station and the robotic work space. The processing of space shuttle payloads provides a variety of tasks which are typical of both space shuttle ground operations and Space Station in-flight operations, and communications time delays are inevitable in space operations where the operator station will be light-seconds away from the telerobot. With this demonstration we hope to show the efficacy and safety of robotic technology for ground and space operations. Our approach is to develop an experimental telerobotic system with the remote sensing, actuation and reflex portions located at KSC in Florida, while the operator control station will be located at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. The JPL portion of the system includes a high-level operator interface, intelligent spatial planning and machine vision, while the KSC portion includes the robot arm, end effectors, cameras and proximity sensors, and the necessary control and communications computers and software. The communications between JPL and KSC are over a limited-bandwidth network channel (19200 baud) with unpredictable and unrepeatable time delays. In FY 89 we integrated a basic version of the robotic, communications, and computer hardware, and we developed the software to perform an operator-supervised inspection of a PAM-D satellite upper stage rocket motor and its shuttle <b>support</b> <b>cradle.</b> The demonstration, though severely limited by the bulk of the available computer arm, showed the potential of telerobotics for inspection tasks. In the future, we plan to develop additional capabilities which will allow manipulation tasks to be performed, including removal of dust covers and lens caps, insertion of connectors and batteries, and installation of payload objects...|$|E
40|$|Small-animal imaging {{has been}} widely {{implemented}} to study succession of disease, therapeutic treatments {{and the effects of}} environmental insults. The gold standard noninvasive technique for following progression of heart failure in small-animal models is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this project was to adapt a clinical MRI system to perform small-animal cardiac MRI. The first part of the thesis describes the adaptations required, which included design and construction of a small-animal radiofrequency (RF) coil, physical <b>support</b> (<b>cradle),</b> a core body temperature regulation system, and optimization of pulse sequences. The system was validated using a phantom and in-vivo in 5 healthy rats. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the phantom was 91 % higher using the small-animal coil compared to the standard head coil. SNRs of 7 ¬± 2 and 18. 9 ¬± 0. 6 were achieved in myocardium and blood, respectively, in healthy rats and MR left ventricular mass (LVM) was highly correlated with (r= 0. 87) with post-mortem mass. In {{the second part of the}} study, left ventricular remodeling (LVR) was investigated in a nonreperfused model of myocardial infarction (MI) in 5 sham and 7 infarcted rats. Rats were scanned at 2 and 4 weeks post surgery to allow for global and regional functional and structural analyses of the heart. Images were of sufficient quality to enable semi-automatic segmentation using Segment. Significant increase in end-systolic volume (ESV) was observed in MI rats at 2 weeks post surgery. At 4 weeks post surgery, end-diastolic volume (EDV) and ESV of MI rats were significantly higher than in sham rats. Ejection fraction (EF) of MI rats dropped significantly at 2 weeks and a further significant drop was observed at 4 weeks indicating contractile dysfunction. Wall thickness (WTh) analyses in MI rats at 4 weeks revealed significant reduction in end-diastolic (ED) wall thickness in the anterior region due to necrosis of myocytes. In the posterior region, WTh was significantly higher due to LV hypertrophy. At end-systole (ES), the MI rats revealed significant decrease in WTh in the anterior and lateral regions. MI rats suffered reduction in systolic wall thickening in all regions of the heart, indicating global contractile dysfunction...|$|E
