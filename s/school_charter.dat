25|$|Berwick Area Senior High School {{offers a}} dual {{enrollment}} program. This state program permits {{high school students}} to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. Berwick Area School District has a concurrent agreement with King's College, Luzerne County Community College, Bloomsburg University ACE program, Wilkes University and Pennsylvania State University.The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $6,779 for the program. Non district students, who reside in the district and attend a private nonpublic <b>school,</b> <b>charter</b> school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate in this program.

40|$|Washington State is amongst {{a handful}} of states without <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation. Even {{in the absence of}} such legislation, the idea of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> is no new {{phenomenon}} in Washington. State residents voted against the authorization of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> in 1996, 2000, and 2004. A review of voterâ€Ÿs ballots and Seattle Times online newpaper archives revealed three of the most common reasons cited opposing <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation in 1996, 2000, and 2004. 1. If <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation was implemented, low-income and other disadvantaged students would be left behind in increasingly impoverished traditional public <b>schools,</b> 2. <b>Charter</b> <b>schools</b> increase taxes and take money away from traditional public <b>schools,</b> and 3. <b>Charter</b> <b>schools</b> are experimental and have not been proven to work. This research tests the validity of these three arguments in states with <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation by answering the following research questions: 1. What was the demographic composition of traditional public <b>schools</b> vs. <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> after <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation was implemented? 2. What was the amount of per-pupil revenue for traditional public <b>schools</b> vs. <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> after <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation was implemented? 3. What percent of traditional public <b>schools</b> vs. <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> students performed at or above proficiency on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) after <b>charter</b> <b>school</b> legislation was implemented? Results reveal that greater percentages of minority students attended <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> receive significantly less funding per-pupil than traditional public schools. Results did not reveal any significant differences between NAEP scores for <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and traditional public schools. ...|$|R
