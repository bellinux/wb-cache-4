40|$|AbstractPanicum mosaic virus (PMV) is a {{single-stranded}} positive-sense RNA {{virus in}} the family Tombusviridae. PMV genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) are not capped or polyadenylated. We have determined that PMV uses a cap-independent mechanism of translation. A 116 -nucleotide translational enhancer (TE) region on the 3 ′-untranslated region of both the gRNA and <b>sgRNA</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> identified. The TE is required for efficient translation of viral proteins in vitro. For mutants with a compromised TE, addition of cap analog, or transposition of the cis-active TE to another location, both restored translational competence of the 5 ′-proximal sgRNA genes in vitro...|$|R
