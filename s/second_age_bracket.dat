40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of creating good social relations. One {{of them is the}} creative puppet-drama education, which convinced me the most. The aim of my thesis is to prove that the use of puppets can promote the successful establishment of relationships between children. In the theoretical part, I present puppets and their division by type. I introduce their educational value, how to achieve the aspired goals in the educational process, and which aspects of a child's development are particularly affected by a puppet. Throughout, the use and effects of puppets intertwine regarding the development of social relations. The thesis describes the child's perception of puppets in the first and <b>second</b> <b>age</b> <b>bracket</b> and the importance of puppets {{in the hands of a}} teacher. In the practical part I present the use of puppets in the preschool daily routine. I introduced two puppets as group favourites into a group of children aged from two to six years. They helped detect the situation within the group and promoted social learning. In my diaries I focused primarily on the responses of children when playing with puppets, the usage of puppets and the role of the teacher. I realized that puppets are invaluable tools which raise the quality of relationships between children and have positive effects on the development of children. The active process with puppets was happening on a daily basis for a period of one month. ...|$|E
40|$|Nature {{offers us}} and {{children}} endless opportunities to acquire new knowledge, {{if only we}} observe it carefully, if we allow ourselves to explore it, ask questions and persistently search for answers. Children like to explore, therefore they learn about the world spontaneously, by playing games. Adults can guide children by appropriate stimulation and direction and thus by {{the creation of new}} circumstances which lead to problem solving and researching. These result in conclusions, which are followed by the development of critical thinking. In the theoretical part of this thesis I describe child development in the preschool period and the field of natural science in kindergarten. The understanding of these two is the basis of planning activities, which enable children knowing the features of the moon {{on the basis of their}} own observations. The essential features of the moon are also described in the theoretical part of the thesis in order to help successfully plan and lead the activities of moon observation. Findings from children's interviews are included in the empirical part. Children from two age groups (first and <b>second</b> <b>age</b> <b>bracket)</b> answered questions on their observations and notions of the moon. In accordance to their answers and ideas I developed science activities which help children learn about the features of the moon, its movement and the changes in the shape of its illuminated portion on the basis of their own observations and perceptions. These activities are planned in accordance with other activities of the curriculum, are related to them, intertwined with them and they also upgrade them. Interviews with children from both age groups were conducted again after the observations and other activities were finished. The comparison of the conclusions results in my evaluation of the planned activities influence on children's notions and knowledge of the moon features. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a thesis}} we are {{presenting}} {{the problem of}} preschool period of coordination process because of its integrated development of the child, his fast growth and ripening, importance of know-how rich environmental influence on adaptation and important urgency of totaly different access and methodic ways to a global child's growth. Accessories for growth coordination must not only be adapted but changed in total. Because until now the explorers did not expose in such way, we treat in thesis the growth of coordination first with experts and explorers results, who researched this domain in preshool and later period. We followed on ground of previous literature and characteristics of locomotive development of preschool child and we established examples of methodical units for specific exposing forms of coordination. With appropriate methods of work this methodic units can serve as example of efficent locomotive learning. In accordance with this problem we waggoned targets: to show the importance of growth coordination in preschool period and methodical units for coordination development in first and <b>second</b> <b>age</b> <b>bracket.</b> Through section of Slovenian and foreign contemporary literature we answered in our thesis: «What are the answers this literature offers on questions about importance of coordination growth in preschool period?« and » What kind of locomotive challenges contemporary Slovenian literature is proposing for growth of coordination {{and on the other}} hand what methods do foreign explorers suggest for suitable teaching and researching the oriented locomotive activities in kindergarten?« We answered this two specific questions and we estimated critical evaluation of temporary explorers, especially on their uncritical and common transfer of methods and accessories for locomotive growth of older children to preschool children. On the basement of new results we found propper cases of methodic units for coordination growth and presented them along with efficient preschool methods of working in preschool period. ...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} {{mountaineering}} in kindergartens: {{how it affects}} a child's development, what are the advantages of organising alpine activities in kindergarten, what influence do {{the teacher and the}} management of the kindergarten have on the implementation of alpine content and how it is included in the document Kurikulum za vrtce. The goals of the research are to present the frequency of the implementation of theoretical and practical alpine content in kindergarten, to study the differences between the implementation of this content in the first age bracket and in the second one, and to research the factors that affect the frequency of alpine content implementation in kindergarten. With the help of non-standardised survey questionnaires, we obtained the data on the frequency of alpine content implementation in kindergarten, the suitability of the environment and the support of the kindergarten management on the implementation, and the teachers' opinion on the effects of mountaineering on children. The obtained data were numerically weighted. SPSS Statistics software package 21. 0 for Windows was used for statistical data processing. Basic statistical parameters (descriptive statistics) were used. Contingency tables, chi-squared test and Pearson correlation coefficient were employed to discover the differences between the groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to discover the effects of chosen factors (location, age of children, support of the management) on the implementation of alpine contents. Statistical significance was examined on the level of 5 percent risk (p ≤ 0, 05). The analysis of obtained results determined that the implementation of both theoretical and practical alpine content is more frequent in the <b>second</b> <b>age</b> <b>bracket.</b> A good 60 percent of all interviewed kindergarten teachers go for a short walk {{in the vicinity of the}} kindergarten more than two times per week, while more than 20 percent take their group for a short walk fewer than three times per month. A longer trip which exceeds a child's everyday strain and includes at least 150 m of elevation gain in one direction, was implemented by 64. 6 percent of the interviewed teachers in the past school year, while 17 percent of the interviewed teachers implemented four or more such trips. The results showed that the frequency of alpine content implementation is not connected to the kindergarten's surroundings. It also showed that the factors we chose and thought they strongly affect the frequency of alpine content implementation (location, teacher's opinion and support of the management) only have a 10 percent effect on it. Support, provided for the teachers by the management of the kindergarten, has a positive effect on the frequency of practical alpine content implementation in kindergarten (walks, longer trips, orienteering and climbing). ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{oral health}} {{conditions}} {{of indigenous peoples}} in Amazonia are closely associated with ecological and dietary changes related to interaction with non-Indians. Aim: The study investigated the incidence of caries in an indigenous community from Central Brazil focusing on gender differences. Subjects and methods: The research was conducted among the Xavante Indians and was based on longitudinal data collected in two surveys (1999 and 2004). The study included 128 individuals, 63 (49. 2 %) males and 65 (50. 8 %) females, divided in four <b>age</b> <b>brackets</b> (6 - 12, 13 - 19, 20 - 34, 35 - 60 years of age). The DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) index and incidences (difference between 1999 and 2004) were calculated for each individual. The proportion of incidence was also calculated. Differences in caries risk between gender and <b>age</b> <b>brackets</b> were compared by parametric and non-parametric tests. Results: There were statistically significant differences in relation to caries incidence between <b>age</b> <b>brackets</b> and gender. The greatest incidence was observed in the 20 - 34 <b>age</b> <b>bracket,</b> which presented 3. 30 new decayed teeth, twice {{the risk of the}} 6 - 12 <b>age</b> <b>bracket</b> (p 0. 01), chosen as reference. While females in most age groups did not show higher risk for caries when compared to males, there was a 4. 04 -fold risk in the 20 - 34 <b>age</b> <b>bracket</b> (p 0. 01). Conclusion: It is concluded that factors related to the social functions of each sex (gender issues) and differential access to information, health services, and education may help to understand the differences observed in the incidence of caries.
