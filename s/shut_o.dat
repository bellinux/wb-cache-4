40|$|What {{is a good}} {{monetary}} policy rule for stabilizing the economy? In this paper, e cient policy rules are computed using the FRB/US large-scale openeconomy macroeconometric model. Simple three-parameter policy rules {{are found to be}} very e ective at minimizing uctuations in in ation, output, and interest rates: Increases in rule complexity yield only trivial reductions in aggregate variability. Under rational expectations, e cient policies smooth the interest rate response to shocks and use the feedback from anticipated policy actions to stabilize in ation and output and to moderate movements in shortterm interest rates. Policy should react to a multi-period in ation rate rather than the current quarter in ation rate; in fact, targeting the price level, as opposed to the in ation rate, involves only small additional stabilization costs. These results are robust to parameter and model uncertainty and the imposition of the non-negativity constraint onnominal interest rates. However, if expectations formation is invariant to policy, as in backward-looking models, the expectations channel is <b>shut</b> <b>o</b> and the performance of policies that are e cient under rational expectations may, as a result, deteriorate markedly; e cient policies, in contrast, exploit systematic expectational errors...|$|E

6000|$|I never {{expected}} to see him again; yet {{it is one of}} the two or three odd coincidences of my life that I did see him. At some public sports or recreation ground I saw a group of rather objectless youths, one of whom was wearing the dashing uniform of a private in the Lancers. Inside that uniform was the tall figure, shy face, and dark, stiff hair of Simmons. He had gone to the one place where every one is dressed alike--a regiment. I know nothing more; perhaps he was killed in Africa. But when England was full of flags and false triumphs, when everybody was talking manly trash about the whelps of the lion and the brave boys in red, I often heard a voice echoing in the under-caverns of my memory, [...] "Shut up... <b>O,</b> <b>shut</b> up... <b>O,</b> I say, <b>shut</b> it." ...|$|R

6000|$|But Simmons went even further. He felt it as {{an insult}} to brotherly {{equality}} if any task or knowledge {{out of the ordinary}} track was discovered even by accident. If a boy had learnt German in infancy; or if a boy knew some terms in music; or if a boy was forced to confess feebly that he had read [...] "The Mill on the Floss"--then Simmons was in a perspiration of discomfort. He felt no personal anger, still less any petty jealousy, what he felt was an honourable and generous shame. He hated it as a lady hates coarseness in a pantomime; it made him want to hide himself. Just that feeling of impersonal ignominy which most of us have when some one betrays indecent ignorance, Simmons had when some one betrayed special knowledge. He writhed and went red in the face; he used to put up the lid of his desk to hide his blushes for human dignity, and from behind this barrier would whisper protests which had the hoarse emphasis of pain. [...] "O, shut up, I say... <b>O,</b> I say, <b>shut</b> up.... <b>O,</b> <b>shut</b> it, can't you?" [...] Once when a little boy admitted that he had heard of the Highland claymore, Simmons literally hid his head inside his desk and dropped the lid upon it in desperation; and when I was for a moment transferred {{from the bottom of the}} form for knowing the name of Cardinal Newman, I thought he would have rushed from the room.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a controversy {{as to whether}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s one operating nuclear research reactor, HIFAR, should be replaced with a n e w reactor. HIFAR {{will almost certainly be}} permanently <b>shut</b> d <b>o</b> w n in the next 5 - 10 years, and there is considerable pressure on the federal government to make a firm decision, in the near future, for or against the replacement of HIFAR. Much of the thesis is focused on a sub-debate within the broader HIFAR replacement controversy - whether a n e w reactor is justified for the production of radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Alternative radioisotope supply scenarios - involving greater reliance on imported radioisotopes and cyclotron-produced radioisotopes - are proposed and evaluated. The medical radioisotope sub-debate, and the HIFAR replacement controversy more generally, are analysed in the context of civil and military nuclear development around the world and in Australia. This material serves two purposes - it provides context for the HIFAR replacement controversy and the medical radioisotope sub-debate, and it develops a set of arguments concerning the problems with research reactor programs, in particular their links to covert nuclear weapons programs. In terms of situating the thesis in the context of Science and Technology Studies scholarship, the thesis draws on strands of the 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 sociology of technology literature but pays greater attention to structural analysis. The principles which guide most studies in the sociology of scientific knowledge tradition - such as reflexivity, impartiality, and symmetrical treatment of knowledge claims - are recast as practical problems within a social problem centred approach...|$|R

40|$|Use of irrigating fluids are {{necessary}} and im p ortant, for transurethral prostatic resection. However, occurrence {{of side effects}} due to mostly changes in the electrolytes of the body fluids and complications well-known as TUR-reaction are not uncommon. In an attempt to prevent the so-called TUR-reaction, the following two kinds of mannitol solution for intravenous use were administered before, {{during and after the}} procedure. solution-I (M-I) Mannitol 15 % Glucose 5 % NaC 1 0. 45 % solution-II (M-II) Mannitol 5 % Glucose 5 % NaC 1 0. 25 % Clinical effectiveness of the solutions was evaluated by studying 15 recent cases of prostatic hypertrophy given our mannitol solutions (the first series), and 10 control cases of the same condition in which the TUR-procedure was performed using glucose or Ringer's solution (the second series). In the both series, " urigal " was used as irrigating fluid, which was put at the height of 60 to 80 cm. from the mid-bladder level. In the first series, the 15 patients studied were at first given 1 00 ml. of M-I for 15 to 20 minutes prior to the TUR-procedure, followed by administration of 300 ml. of the same for over an hour during the surgical procedure. Then after the surgery, M-II was given intravenously at the rate of 200 ml. per hour until 7 a. m. of the following day, the total of the solution being to be from 1, 800 to 4, 000 ml. The amount of tissue resected varied fro m 4 to 46 gm. and the operating time was mostly limited to one hour. In both of ne seri e s, serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Ca), BUN and hematocrit were examined just before, immediately after, and further 4 -, 8 -and 24 -hours after the completion of the TUR procedure. Urinary output via catheter was also measured every hour during the first 4 hours then every 4 hours during the first 24 hours after the surgery. The results obtained were as follows : The urinary output measured at a n one hour interval during the first 4 hours varied from 130 to 400 ml. The total of 4 -hour output, however, was almost equal to the amount of simultaneous 4 hour intake of the solution. The 15 patients of the first series showed an average 24 -hour output of 3, 050 ml., which was only 230 ml less than the average intake of the solution during the same period. Contrariwisely, control patients (the second series) showed an average 24 -hour output of 1, 010 ml., which was 2, 040 ml. less than that of the mannitol-treated patients. In the first series, serum sodiu m level decreased as much as 5. 4 meq/L at the immediate postoperative period and returned gradually with in the following 24 hours. Serum potassium showed an increase immediately after the operation and recorded the maximum value of 5. 1 meq/L at the 4 th hour after the resection, which was 0. 6 meq/L higher than the average preoperative value. The increased value gradually returned to preoperative level within 24 hours. In the contro l series, however, the serum potassium though showing an increase in its value immediately after the operation, only exceeded the normal limit as much as 0. 2 meq/L at the 4 th hour after the operation. Serum sodium values, remained within normal limits. Both of the serum chlor and calcium values demonstrated no remarkable changes in either the mannitol-treated or the control series. The most remarkable merit of the mann i t ol solutions was noted in the changes of BUN values. In the control series, the BUN values showed gradual rise starting immediately after the operation and reached as high as an average of 29. 9 mg/dl at the 24 th hour, of which result suggesting a riskiness of the transurethral prostatic resection to the aged patients with impaired kidney function. In the mannitol-treated series, the BUN values were successfully controlled within the normal limits. There was no case of oliguria or renal <b>shutd</b> <b>o</b> wn in all cases of the both series. Blood pressure was more stable in the 15 mannitol-treated patients as compared to that of the 10 control patients. Conc l u sively, it is suggested that intravenous infusion of the mannitol solutions (M-I and M-II) administered in the manner described in this paper is a desirable way to promote excretion of toxic substance, to increase urinary output, to minimize potential urinary tract infection, and to obviate postoperative irrigations. However further studies on the use of mannitol in the transurethral surgery are still needed in order to obtain better results, espeically in stabilizing serum electrolytes...|$|R
6000|$|Dissident Priests {{likewise}} give trouble enough. Expelled {{from their}} Parish Churches, where Constitutional Priests, {{elected by the}} Public, have replaced them, these unhappy persons resort to Convents of Nuns, or other such receptacles; and there, on Sabbath, collecting assemblages of Anti-Constitutional individuals, who have grown devout all on a sudden, (Toulongeon, i. 262.) they worship or pretend to worship in their strait-laced contumacious manner; to the scandal of Patriotism. Dissident Priests, passing along with their sacred wafer for the dying, seem wishful to be massacred in the streets; wherein Patriotism will not gratify them. Slighter palm of martyrdom, however, shall not be denied: martyrdom not of massacre, yet of fustigation. At the refractory places of worship, Patriot men appear; Patriot women with strong hazel wands, which they apply. <b>Shut</b> thy eyes, <b>O</b> Reader; see not this misery, peculiar to these later times,--of martyrdom without sincerity, with only cant and contumacy! A dead Catholic Church {{is not allowed to}} lie dead; no, it is galvanised into the detestablest death-life; whereat Humanity, we say, shuts its eyes. For the Patriot women take their hazel wands, and fustigate, amid laughter of bystanders, with alacrity: broad bottom of Priests; alas, Nuns too reversed, and cotillons retrousses! The National Guard does what it can: Municipality 'invokes the Principles of Toleration;' grants Dissident worshippers the Church of the Theatins; promising protection. But it is to no purpose: at the door of that Theatins Church, appears a Placard, and suspended atop, like Plebeian Consular fasces,--a Bundle of Rods! The Principles of Toleration must do the best they may: but no Dissident man shall worship contumaciously; there is a Plebiscitum to that effect; which, though unspoken, is like the laws of the Medes and Persians. Dissident contumacious Priests ought not to be harboured, even in private, by any man: the Club of the Cordeliers openly denounces Majesty himself as doing it.

40|$|Environmental {{protection}} and ecient energy utilization have been always important {{issues in the}} automotive industry, but have gained signicant momentum with the growing demand for mobility {{around the world and}} its impact on the global environment. For this purpose, many improvements in automobile technology have been accomplished over the past decades. However fuel economy with improvements in vehicle powertrain technology has been penalized by customer preferences. Automotive industry faces the challenge of producing vehicles that meet future fuel economy and emissions requirements which are priced to meet the desired customer value. As hybrid vehicles, due to the high cost of the electrication they introduce, in next years will not impact the OEM eet-averaged CO 2 gures in a signicant way, it is benecial to introduce new cost-oriented CO 2 features able to optimize engine operations, as they oer a very favorable cost/benet ratio. According to market trend, the increasing interest on automated transmission (i. e. AMT, DCT) plays a key-role towards the optimization of engine operation. The basic principle of <b>shutting</b> the engine <b>o</b> at idle to remove engineâs drag torque could be adopted at vehicle in motion, extending the distance covered by the vehicle coasting, when no traction is required, by opening the clutch automatically. Literature calls such operation âsailingâ: represents a low cost control feature, as it does not introduce new components, able to enhance Start & Stop technology. Turning o the combustion engine during coasting conditions increases the number of engine starts over vehicle lifetime, impacting the whole vehicle. Today starter motors are typically designed for Start&Stop applications for up to 300 : 000 engine crank over vehicle lifetime. This number can double for Start&Stop Sailing applications. However, the number of load cycles for the starter motor can be reduced signicantly if the engine is revved up via clutch. The work focuses on the development clutch assisted start by applying a new methodology based on modeling and simulation. In general, starting the engine through clutch engagement consists in spending a certain amount of the traveling vehicle kinetic energy to spin up the engine. The consequent deceleration of the vehicle, due to this maneuver, must be mitigated by an appropriate clutch closing strategy. Moreover, vibrations induced in the powertrain during the maneuver can generate uncomfortable feelings for the passenger. Hence a powertrain and driveline modeling that allows to investigate the impact on drivability for dierent clutch engagement in dierent operating conditions in order to fulll drivability requirement...|$|R
