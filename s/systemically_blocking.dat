40|$|Background: The innate {{immune system}} {{contributes}} to the outcome after stroke, where neuroinflammation and post-stroke systemic immune depression are central features. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which exists in both a transmembrane (tm) and soluble (sol) form, is known to sustain complex inflammatory responses associated with stroke. We tested the effect of <b>systemically</b> <b>blocking</b> only solTNF versus blocking both tmTNF and solTNF on infarct volume, functional outcome and inflammation in focal cerebral ischemia. Methods: We used XPro 1595 (a dominant-negative inhibitor of solTNF) and etanercept (which blocks both solTNF and tmTNF) to test the effect of systemic administration on infarct volume, functional recovery and inflammation after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. Functional recovery was evaluated after one, three and five days, and infarct volumes at six hours, 24 hours and five days after ischemia. Brain inflammation, liver acute phase response (APR), spleen and blood leukocyte profiles, along with plasma microvesicle analysis, were evaluated. Results: We found that both XPro 1595 and etanercept significantly improved functional outcomes, altered microglial responses, and modified APR, spleen T cell and microvesicle numbers, but without affecting infarct volumes. Conclusions: Our data suggest that XPro 1595 and etanercept improve functional outcome after focal cerebral ischemia by altering the peripheral immune response, changing blood and spleen cell populations and decreasing granulocyte infiltration into the brain. Blocking solTNF, using XPro 1595, was just as efficient as blocking both solTNF and tmTNF using etanercept. Our findings may have implications for future treatments with anti-TNF drugs in TNF-dependent diseases...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{findings}} indicate that administration of abeta-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>systemically</b> <b>blocks</b> glucocorticoid impairment of memory retrieval. Here, we report that beta-adrenoceptor activation in the hippocampus and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is implicated in the impairing effects of glucocorticoids on memory retrieval. The specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist 11 beta, 17 beta-dihydroxy- 6, 21 -dimethyl- 17 alpha-pregna- 4, 6 -trien- 20 yn- 3 -one (RU 28362) (15 ng) infused into the hippocampus of male Sprague Dawley rats 60 min before water maze retention testing, 24 hr after training, impaired probe trial retention performance, as assessed by quadrant search time and initial latency to cross the platform location. Because we found previously that RU 28362 infused into the hippocampus does not affect water maze acquisition or immediate recall, {{the findings suggest that}} the GR agonist-induced retention impairment was attributable to a selective influence on long-term memory retrieval. Likewise, systemic injections of the beta 1 -adrenoceptor partial agonist xamoterol (3. 0 or 10. 0 mg/kg, s. c.) 60 min before the probe trial dose-dependently impaired retention performance. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2. 0 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously before retention testing did not affect retention performance alone, but blocked the memory retrieval impairment induced by concurrent intrahippocampal infusions of RU 28362. Pretest infusions of the beta 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol into either the hippocampus (1. 25 microg in 0. 5 microl) or the BLA (0. 5 microg in 0. 2 microl) also prevented the GR agonist-induced memory retrieval impairment. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids impair retrieval of long-term spatial memory by facilitating noradrenergic mechanisms in the hippocampus, and additionally, that norepinephrine-mediated BLA activity is critical in enabling hippocampal glucocorticoid effects on memory retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Anxiety {{and affective}} {{disorders}} are {{often associated with}} hypercortisolism and dysfunctional serotonergic systems, including increased expression of TPH 2, the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of neuronal serotonin synthesis. We previously reported that chronic glucocorticoid exposure is anxiogenic and increases rat Tph 2 mRNA expression, {{but it was still}} unclear if this also translates to increased TPH 2 protein levels and in vivo activity of the enzyme. Here, we found that adult male rats treated with corticosterone (CURT, 100 mu g/ml) via the drinking water for 21 days indeed show increased TPH 2 protein expression in the dorsal and ventral part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRD, DRV) during the light phase, abolishing the enzyme's diurnal rhythm. In a second study, we <b>systemically</b> <b>blocked</b> the conversion of 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) to serotonin immediately before rats treated with CURT or vehicle were either exposed to 30 min acoustic startle stress or home cage control conditions. This allowed us to measure 5 -HTP accumulation as a direct readout of basal versus stress-induced in vivo TPH 2 activity. As expected, basal TPH 2 activity was elevated in the DRD, DRV and MnR of CURT-treated rats. In response to stress, a multitude of serotonergic systems reacted with increased TPH 2 activity, but the stress-, anxiety-, and learned helplessness-related dorsal and caudal DR (DRD/DRC) displayed stress-induced increases in TPH 2 activity only after chronic CORT-treatment. To address the mechanisms underlying this region-specific CURT-dependent sensitization, we stereotaxically implanted CURT-treated rats with cannulae targeting the DR, and pharmacologically blocked either corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 (CRHR 1) or type 2 (CRHR 2) 10 min prior to acoustic startle stress. CRHR 2 blockade prevented stress-induced increases of TPH 2 activity within the DRD/DRC, while blockade of CRHR 1 potentiated stress-induced TPH 2 activity in the entire DR. Stress-induced TPH 2 activity in the DRD/DRC furthermore predicted TPH 2 activity in the amygdala and in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC), while serotonin synthesis in the PnC was strongly correlated with the maximum startle response. Our data demonstrate that chronically elevated glucocorticoids sensitize stress- and anxiety-related serotonergic systems, {{and for the first time}} reveal competing roles of CRHR 1 and CRHR 2 on stress-induced in vivo serotonin synthesis.

40|$|Hippocampal dentate gyrus {{reactivity}} to perforant path (PP) stimulation in the anesthetized rat was enhanced after {{systemic administration}} of the serotonin-releasing drug fenfluramine (FFA). This effect of FFA was mimicked by local application of the drug via the recording pipette, indicating {{that the effect of}} FFA is mediated by release of serotonin from intrahippocampal serotonergic terminals. The 5 -HT 1 a antagonist NAN- 190 and the 5 -HT 1 b agonist CGS- 12066 -B, applied both <b>systemically</b> and locally, <b>blocked</b> the effect of FFA. This blocking action was not shared by the 5 -HT 2 – 4 receptor agonists or antagonists tested. The 5 -HT 1 a receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT, applied systemically, caused a marked reduction in population spike responses to PP stimulation, whereas an opposite effect was produced by local application of this drug.

40|$|Ischemic {{white matter}} injury has been {{relatively}} little studied despite its importance to the outcome of stroke. To aid such research a new rat model has been developed in vivo and used to assess whether blockade of the sodium/calcium exchanger is effective in protecting central axons from ischemic injury. Vasoconstrictive agent endothelin- 1 was injected into the rat spinal cord to induce ischemia. KB-R 7943 or SEA 0400 was administered <b>systemically</b> to <b>block</b> {{the operation of the}} sodium/calcium exchanger. Endothelin- 1 caused profound reduction of local blood perfusion and resulted in a prompt loss of axonal conduction. Whereas recovery of conduction following vehicle administration was only to 10. 5  ±  9 % of baseline (n =  8) 4. 5  h after endothelin- 1 injection, recovery following KB-R 7943 (30  mg/kg, i. a.) administration was increased to 35  ±  9 % of baseline (n =  6; P <  0. 001). SEA 0400 (30  mg/kg, i. a.) was also protective (33. 2  ±  6 % of baseline, n =  4; P <  0. 001). Neither drug improved conduction by diminishing the severity of the ischemia. The protective effect of KB-R 7943 persisted for at least 3 days after ischemia, as it improved axonal conduction (76. 3  ±  11 % for KB-R 7943 vs. 51. 0  ±  19 % for vehicle; P <  0. 01) and reduced lesion area (55. 6  ±  15 % for KB-R 7943 vs. 77. 9  ±  9 % for vehicle; P <  0. 01) at this time. In conclusion, a new model of white matter ischemia has been introduced suitable for both structural and functional studies in vivo.

40|$|The VEGFs -A, -B, -C, -D are {{important}} signaling molecules with pivotal implication {{in the growth}} of blood and lymphatic vessels, the so-called angio- and lymphangiogenesis. They exert their activities by binding to their receptors, VEGFRs- 1, - 2 and - 3. Their involvement in pathologic processes such as tumor growth or inflammatory disorders has been thoroughly described, rheumatoid arthritis being just one example. The VEGF family represents the link between angiogenesis and bone turnover, as seen in cancer metastasis to the bone or arthritis. Furthermore, they are involved in the differentiation of dendritic cells and lymphocytes, while macrophages and PMNs have been identified as sources of VEGFs, showing a mediatory function of these molecules in immune responses. The presence of VEGF-A and its main angiogenic receptor VEGFR- 2 in well- vascularized normal dental pulp has been previously described. Apical periodontitis, a common inflammatory disease caused by the interaction of root canal bacteria with the host immune response, is characterized by bone resorption. VEGF-A is also known to be present in these lesions of endodontic origin. However, the picture of VEGF family and their receptors with respect to location and function in the dental pulp and in periapical pathology have so far been incomplete. The aims of this thesis were to identify and map the presence of VEGF family and their receptors VEGFR- 2 and - 3 in apical periodontitis and dental pulp and to investigate their role in periapical disease development. In normal rat apical periodontium (Paper I), VEGF-A, -C, -D and VEGFR- 2 and - 3 were present on blood vessels. Upon endodontic exposure for periapical disease development, an intensification of immunohistochemically stained vascular structures was noticed. Macrophages and neutrophils expressed all VEGFs and VEGFRs in the lesions, with macrophages being an important source of VEGF-C and -D. Osteoclasts were the source for VEGFR- 2 and - 3. The gene expression of VEGF-A and VEGFR- 3 was significantly up-regulated following pulp exposure. The results suggest the implication of VEGF family and their receptors in the periapical immune response, vascular remodeling and in bone resorptive activities. In human periapical lesions (Paper II) VEGFs and VEGFRs were expressed on blood vessels and on macrophages, PMNs, B- and T-lymphocytes. At the gene level, significant up-regulations were recorded for genes involved in VEGF-mediated angiogenic activity, such as phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinases (Pl 3 K), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phospholipases (PL). These findings suggest the implication of VEGF family in ongoing immune reactions along with vascular remodeling in human established periapical lesions. The normal dental pulp (Paper III) presented with blood vessels, macrophages and T- lymphocytes positive for the same VEGFs and VEGFRs. Furthermore, VEGF-B was only seen at cellular level in the dental pulp. Twenty-six of 84 VEGF signaling genes, including VEGFR- 3 were significantly altered in the dental pulp compared with control PDL. The pulpal tissue has high VEGF signaling capacity with respect to immune responses and vascular activity. Using specific markers for lymphatic vessels, we confirmed the absence of lymphatic vessels from both apical periodontium and the dental pulp. Macrophages expressing LYVE- 1 were found in human periapical lesions and the dental pulp, with an assumed angiogenic role. Upon inducing periapical lesions we <b>systemically</b> <b>blocked</b> VEGFR- 2 and/or - 3 in order to investigate their signaling patterns with respect to lesion size, angiogenesis, local inflammatory response and lymphangiogenesis in the draining lymph nodes (Paper IV). We have found that VEGFR- 2 reduces inflammation whereas combined VEGFR- 2 and - 3 signaling causes an increase of the process, seen in amounts of PMNs and osteoclasts, as well as different cytokines expression. In the regional lymph nodes, lymphangiogenesis is dependent on VEGFR- 2 and/or VEGFR- 3 signaling. The results of these studies provide evidence on the presence of VEGFs and VEGFRs in dental pulp and apical periodontitis, with implications in immune responses and vascular remodeling. VEGFR- 2 and/or - 3 signaling influences inflammatory reactions during periapical disease development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Memories {{formed as}} a result of {{threatening}} events can have debilitating effects on quality of life. Solutions to treat these memories are limited to behavioural therapies and non-specific pharmacotherapy. Neither behavioural therapies nor current pharmacotherapy have a lasting effect on memories and quality of life. Pavlovian threat (fear) conditioning results in changes to neural plasticity in the amygdala, specifically in the dorsal subdivision of the lateral amygdala (LAd), where plastic changes to the microcircuitry occur. Plastic changes include increases in the number of neurons expressing pMAPK/ERK activity and changes to the structure and shape of the neuron including changes to dendritic spines. Modifications to plasticity occur during both initial memory consolidation and subsequent reconsolidation of fear memories. MEK inhibitors, upstream inhibitors of pMAPK/ERK activity are known to block pMAPK/ERK activity when administered both intra brain and <b>systemically</b> and also <b>block</b> initial consolidation and reconsolidation of threat memories. However the precise effect of MEK inhibitors on different sub-regional microcircuitry is unknown. Our initial data suggests that the number of neurons in the LAd expressing pMAPK/ERK is significantly reduced (by up to 90 %) following a systemic injection of the MEK inhibitor SL 327. In conclusion these data provide initial microcircuit level analysis of the effects of MEK inhibitor on neural microcircuits underlying threat memories...|$|R
40|$|Following initial encoding, {{memories}} {{undergo a}} prolonged period of reorganization. While such reorganization may occur in many different memory systems, its purpose is not clear. Previously, we have shown that recall of recent contextual fear memories engages the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). In contrast, recall of remote contextual fear memories engages {{a number of different}} cortical regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). To examine whether this reorganization leads to greater memory stability, we examined reconsolidation of 1 d-old (recent) and 36 d-old (remote) contextual fear memory in mice. We infused the protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (ANI), into either the dHPC or ACC immediately following retrieval of either a recent or remote contextual fear memory. In the dHPC, ANI infusions disrupted subsequent expression of recent, but not remote, contextual fear memory. Similar infusions into the ACC had no effect on either recent or remote contextual fear memories, whereas <b>systemically</b> applied ANI <b>blocked</b> subsequent remote memory expression when long re-exposure durations were used. Together, these data suggest that as memories mature they become increasingly stable. Furthermore, the dissociation between the effects of systemically and centrally administered ANI on remote memory suggests that stability is due, in part, to the distributed nature of remote contextual fear memories...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{intravascular}} {{approaches for}} regenerative cell therapy, the underlying mechanisms of stem cell migration to non-marrow tissue have not been clarified. We hypothesized that next to a local inflammatory response implying adhesion molecule expression, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) -dependent signaling is required for stromal- cell-derived factor- 1 alpha (SDF- 1 alpha) -induced adhesion of c-kit+ cells to the vascular endothelium. SDF- 1 alpha/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) -induced c-kit+-cell shape change and migration capacity was studied in vitro using immunohistochemistry and Boyden chamber assays. In vivo interaction of c-kit+ cells from bone marrow with the endothelium in response to SDF- 1 alpha/TNF-alpha stimulation was visualized in the cremaster muscle microcirculation of wild-type (WT) and eNOS (-/-) mice using intravital fluorescence microscopy. In addition, NOS activity was inhibited with N-nitro-L-arginine-methylester-hydrochloride in WT mice. To reveal c-kit+-specific adhesion behavior, endogenous leukocytes (EL) and c-kit+ cells from peripheral blood served as control. Moreover, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and CXCR 4 were <b>blocked</b> <b>systemically</b> to determine their role in inflammation-related c-kit+-cell adhesion. In vitro, SDF- 1 alpha enhanced c-kit+-cell migration. In vivo, SDF- 1 alpha alone triggered endothelial rolling-not firm adherence-of c-kit+ cells in WT mice. While TNF-alpha alone {{had little effect on}} adhesion of c-kit+ cells, it induced maximum endothelial EL adherence. However, after combined treatment with SDF- 1 alpha+TNF-alpha, endothelial adhesion of c-kit+ cells increased independent of their origin, while EL adhesion was not further incremented. Systemic treatment with anti-ICAM- 1 and anti-CXCR 4 -monoclonal antibody completely abolished endothelial c-kit+-cell adhesion. In N-nitro-L-arginine-methylester-hydrochloride-treated WT mice as well as in eNOS (-/-) mice, firm endothelial adhesion of c-kit+ cells was entirely abrogated, while EL adhesion was significantly increased. The chemokine SDF- 1 alpha mediates firm adhesion c-kit+ cells only in the presence of TNF-alpha stimulation via an ICAM- 1 - and CXCR 4 -dependent mechanism. The presence of eNOS appears to be a crucial and specific factor for firm c-kit+-cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium...|$|R
