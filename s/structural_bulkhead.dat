40|$|A static {{structural}} analysis of an ocean going patrol vessel subjected to hydrodynamic planning loads is discussed. The analysis required {{the development of}} a detailed model that included hull plating, five <b>structural</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> longitudinal and transverse stiffners, and a coarse representation of the superstructure. The finite element model was developed from fabrication drawings using the Navy computer aided design system. Various stress and displacement contours are shown for the entire hull. Because several critical areas appeared to be overstressed, these areas were remeshed for detail and are presented for completeness...|$|R

The CSY hull is up to 1.5" [...] of solid fiberglass reinforced plastic resin with 14 dual layers (one sheet of fiberglass mat and one sheet of fiberglass weave = one layer). The avoidance of wood cores extends to the deck, which is also solid fiberglass.

The ship sailed from Naval Station Norfolk on 2 December, {{passed through the}} Panama Canal to rendezvous with the Pacific group, and with them reached Bay of Whales, New Zealand on 16 January 1947. Mount Olympus was detached from the group on 11 February and returned to Norfolk on 17 April to become the flagship of Commander, Amphibious Group 2, in training along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. She became flagship and temporary headquarters for CINCNELM/CINCSOUTH in the Mediterranean on 21 June 1951. Mount Olympus was relieved by [...] in August 1951 and returned to Norfork and duty as Amphibious Group 2 flagship, joining in NATO naval exercises “Mainbrace” and “Longs” in northern Europe and the Mediterranean from August to December 1952. After an overhaul in Norfolk from December to March 1953, when a helicopter deck was installed, she served in the Atlantic Fleet until 5 January 1955, when she sailed for the Panama Canal and San Diego, arriving 23 January. Having participated in exercise “Surfboard” {{off the coast of}} Washington in February, Mount Olympus proceeded to Arctic waters as part of Project 572 in support of DEW Line operations, While underway from Point Barrow to Point Hope, Alaska, she became icebound, but was freed by the icebreaker [...] Having sustained damage to <b>structural</b> <b>bulkheads</b> from the ice pressure, the ship was repaired by Current in Point Hope. Mount Olympus returned to San Diego on 29 September and on 31 October 1955 proceeded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for inactivation.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate structural shadow zones encountered in shipbuilding design using the I-DEAS (Integrated Design Engineering Analysis Software) software. The term 'shadow zone' refers to areas of low stress concentrations that are caused by lines of stress bending around structural discontinuities. Two ship design situations frequently encountered that result in shadow zones are hull girder penetrations and short <b>structural</b> longitudinal <b>bulkheads.</b> In both of these situations, a long-used rule of thumb is to construct a line with a slope of 1 : 4 originating from the. discontinuity that encompasses the area of low stress. The material within this line is then considered ineffective when computing the section modulus. This can prove to be expensive. However, powerful finite element analysis software is readily available that can analyze the shadow zones in greater detail and possibly minimize the area considered ineffective. This study uses the I-DEAS software to develop finite element models of the cited design situations for a U. S. Navy Frigate, FFG- 7 class of ship. It conducts a static structural linear analysis of the ship balanced on a trochoidal wave of height 1. 1 VL. The results generated in this study validate the rule of thumb in both situations[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for automated generation of fully connected finite-element meshes for all internal structural components and skins of a given wing-body geometry model, controlled by a few conceptual-level structural layout parameters. Internal structural components include spars, ribs, frames, and <b>bulkheads.</b> <b>Structural</b> layout parameters include spar/rib locations in wing chordwise/spanwise direction and frame/bulkhead locations in longitudinal direction. A simple shell thickness optimization problem with two load conditions is used to verify versatility and robustness of the automated meshing process. The automation process is implemented in ModelCenter starting from an OpenVSP geometry and ending with a NASTRAN 200 solution. One subsonic configuration and one supersonic configuration are used for numerical verification. Two different structural layouts are constructed for each configuration and five finite-element meshes of different sizes are generated for each layout. The paper includes various comparisons of solutions of 20 thickness optimization problems, as well as discussions on how the optimal solutions {{are affected by the}} stress constraint bound and the initial guess of design variables...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Catamaran is a dual hull ship {{which has}} many {{advantages}} then the mono hull ship. Some {{of the advantages}} are excellent stability, Cruise in shallow water, large wide deck areas, large load carrying capacity, faster and Motion comfort etc. In this paper work, design of main or strength deck and <b>Bulkhead</b> <b>structural</b> member calculations for Catamaran ship used for transport for the crane (Mantis ® 10010 mx 46 ton tele-boom crawler crane) to its place of work. Ship’s main deck or Strength deck hull structural scantlings or calculations play a very vital role in carrying the deck loads such as crane load safely against the external pressures which are acting on the deck. This can done by designing the suitable deck and hull plate thickness, and it’s strengthening stiffening. The design of main deck involves determination of scantlings of deck plate, deck plate stiffeners, girders, pillars, Bulkhead and its stiffeners against the wheel load. Scantlings of deck and Bulkhead plates, stiffeners and girders to meet the local strength requirements are to be determined {{in accordance with the}} general principles of the rules. Scantlings of hull members should contribute the longitudinal strength of the ship and to be subjected to compressive stresses. The design calculations are carried out according to Indian Register of shipping (IRS) Rules and Regulations, Construction & Classification of steel ships July 2013. This design process gives the effective & efficient solutions to the new generation ships...|$|R
40|$|Many mining {{operations}} rely on bulkheads {{to provide a}} barrier between impounded water or slurry and active mine workings. However, bulkhead failures could cause and have caused catastrophic flooding that puts the underground workforce at risk. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 1 (NIOSH) {{in collaboration with the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is conducting research to evaluate the adequacy of existing design practices for water and slurry bulkheads. A key component of this research effort is documentation of the performance history and design parameters for bulkheads installed in underground coal mines during the last 20 + years. This research {{is part of a larger}} effort to develop general design guidelines and procedures for constructing and maintaining bulkheads that will help to ensure their long-term structural integrity, while significantly reducing the inundation risk for miners. This paper presents the results of NIOSH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s research to identify state-of-the-art bulkhead designs, including design criteria, leakage monitoring systems, and emergency warning systems. Underground observations and evaluations of existing bulkheads suggest that the most important design factors influencing their performance are the interface of the bulkhead with the surrounding strata and the potential magnitude of the hydraulic pressure to which they may be subjected. When a bulkhead has failed, leakage has generally been through the surrounding strata or along the bulkhead/strata interface, with the failure potential along the interface increasing with hydraulic head. It was also determined that development of a monitoring program to ensure the long term <b>structural</b> integrity of <b>bulkheads</b> is an important safety consideration. Current monitoring procedures range from weekly visual inspections to constant monitoring via pressure transducers and fluid level indicators. Where possible, these devices are used in conjunction with a computer based mine monitoring system to alert mine personnel when an emergency condition exists at the bulkhead installation...|$|R
