As immigrant males had a greater incidence of parasites and higher concentrations of both metabolites than resident males, this profile appears to fit immigrant males best.

40|$|Background: Group {{dynamics}} of gregarious ungulates in the grasslands of the African savanna {{have been well}} studied, but the trade-offs that affect grouping of these ungulates in woodland habitats or dense vegetation are less well understood. We examined the landscape-level distribution of groups of blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and Burchell’s zebra, Equus burchelli, in a predominantly woodland area (Karongwe Game Reserve, South Africa; KGR) {{to test the hypothesis}} that group dynamics are a function of minimizing predation risk from their primary predator, lion, Panthera leo. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using generalized linear models, we examined the relative importance of habitat type (differing in vegetation density), probability of encountering lion (based on utilization distribution of all individual lions in the reserve), and season in predicting group size and composition. We found that only in open scrub habitat, group size for both ungulate species increased with the probability of encountering lion. Group composition differed between the two species and was driven by habitat selection as well as predation risk. For both species, composition of groups was, however, dominated by males in open scrub habitats, irrespective of the probability of encountering lion. Conclusions/Significance: Distribution patterns of wildebeest and zebra groups at the landscape level directly support the theoretical and empirical evidence from a range of taxa predicting that grouping is favored in open habitats and when predation risk is high. Group composition reflected species-specific <b>social,</b> <b>physiological</b> and foraging constraints, as well a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Exercise {{referral}} schemes {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular forms of physical activity intervention in primary care in the UK and present an opportunity to better understand the factors related to exercise adherence. But standard schemes tend to be delivered over a short period and so provide information about the factors associated with short-term adherence. This retrospective register-based study of a longer-duration scheme allowed investigation of longer-term adherence. Methods <b>Social,</b> <b>physiological</b> and anthropometric data were extracted from records of a cohort of ERS participants who had enrolled between 01 January and 31 December 2007 (n[*]=[*] 701). Characteristics of adherers and non-adherers were compared and potential predictors of longer-term adherence examined using binomial logistic regression. Results Significant adjusted odds ratios predicting longer-term adherence were found for age and medical condition. For every 10 [*]year increase in age, the odds of people continuing exercise increased by 21. 8 % (OR[*]=[*] 1. 02; CI[*]=[*] 1. 00 to 1. 04; p[*]=[*] 0. 03). Participants referred with orthopaedic (OR[*]=[*] 0. 25; CI[*]=[*] 0. 07 - 0. 94; p[*]=[*] 0. 04), cardiovascular (OR[*]=[*] 0. 18; CI[*]=[*] 0. 05 - 0. 70; p[*]=[*] 0. 01) and other (OR[*]=[*] 0. 20; CI[*]=[*] 0. 04 - 0. 93; p[*]=[*] 0. 04) problems had significantly lower odds of adhering than those with metabolic conditions. Conclusion Improved understanding of the factors that influence adherence to exercise referral schemes will enable providers develop better referral guidance and tailor schemes to better meet participants’ needs. Longer-term schemes offer the opportunity to understand participants’ likelihood of maintaining adherence to exercise. </p...|$|E

40|$|Vitellogenin (Vg) and lipophorin (Lp) are lipoproteins which play {{important}} roles in female reproductive physiology of insects. Both are actively taken up by growing oocytes and especially Vg and its receptor are considered as female-specifically expressed. The finding that the fat body of in honey bee (Apis mellifera) drones synthesizes Vg and is present in hemolymph has long been viewed as a curiosity. The recent paradigm change concerning {{the role played by}} Vg in honey bee life history, especially social division of labor, has now led us to investigate whether a physiological constellation similar to that seen in female reproduction may also be represented in the male sex. By means of Western blot analysis we could show that both Vg and Lp are present in the reproductive tract of adult drones, including the accessory (mucus) glands, but apparently are not secreted. Furthermore, we analyzed the transcript levels of the genes encoding these proteins (vg and lp), as well as their putative receptors (Amvgr and Amlpr) in fat body and accessory glands. Whereas lp, vg and Amlpr transcript levels decreased with age in both tissues. Amvgr mRNA levels increased with age in fat body. To our knowledge this is the first report that vitellogenin and its receptor are co-expressed in the reproductive system of a male insect. We interpret these findings as a cross-sexual transfer of a <b>social</b> <b>physiological</b> trait, associated with the rewiring of the juvenile hormone/vitellogenin circuitry that occurred in the female sex of honey bees.

40|$|The minimal legal space {{allowance}} for grouped pregnant sows in the EU is 2. 25 m(2) /sow. The effect of higher space per animal on agonistic behaviour and social stress of animals living in dynamic groups is not known. Two groups of 34 pregnant Belgian Landrace sows were housed in two pens of respectively 102 m(2) (3 m(2) /sow) and 76. 5 m(2) (2. 25 m(2) /sow). Each sow {{lived there for}} 15 weeks. Sows were fed through an electronic sow feeder. According to the dynamic system, one third of each group (i. e. 11 or 12 nearly parturient sows) was replaced every 5 weeks by {{the same number of}} recently inseminated sows. Welfare indicators were collected during six of these 5 week-periods: performance, agonistic behaviour, skin lesion score and salivary cortisol. No differences were observed for production parameters, or for fighting activity. However, the mean number of one-way aggressions, when observed during 2 h-periods at 3 and 8 days after grouping, was significantly lower in the large pen than in the small one (respectively 16 +/- 2 versus 26 +/- 3, p < 0. 01, and 10 +/- 2 versus 20 +/- 5, p < 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} from Aboriginal Health Workers (AHWs) working {{in the area of}} heart health in the Aboriginal community of western Sydney. Discussion AHWs are well placed and keen {{to be a part of}} the team that assesses cardiovascular risk. However, lack of recognition of the AHWs’ skills and lack of access to formal training are current barriers to enhancing their role in the heart health team. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major health concern in the Aboriginal population and contributes to the significant life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Conventional risk factors alone do not account for the excess CVD mortality, which has foundations in the economic, <b>social,</b> <b>physiological,</b> psychological and educational disadvantage of the Aboriginal population. There is a lack of progress in reducing the disparities in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. This may be because of a focus, to date, on acute care and patient responsibility rather than addressing underlying determinants of health such as living conditions and socioeconomic factors. In Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal Health Workers (AHWs) fulfil a variety of roles, depending on personal interests and the needs of the community. Unfortunately, a lack of understanding of the diverse expertise of AHWs persists. A universal role is that of a cultural broker through which communication between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal healthcare providers are enhanced, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their interaction. Recognition of AHWs as an important part of the healthcare team has been suggested as a means of delivering improved healthcare to the Aboriginal population. The aim of this study was to study the perspectives of Aboriginal health professionals (nurses and AHWs) regarding cardiovascular risk and heart health, including their understanding of cardiovascular risk assessment. Qualitative research methods can improve the understanding of perceptions of health across cultures and lead to improved health outcomes. This study was undertaken with AHWs and Aboriginal nurses from the Aboriginal Medical Service Western Sydney (AMSWS) and Western Sydney Local Health District, all of whom are working in the area of chronic disease management or heart health.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1950 ’s the migration of population from countryside to cities constitutes a subject as {{an important part of}} demographic changing on its own. Since the second half of 1970 ’s, especially domestic migration from the small and medium size cities to big cities, by turning into family migration became dense in the three big metropolises in west. (Ãstanbul, Ankara, Ãzmir). In 1990 ’s both the migration from east and Southeast Anatolia to other regions and the obligatory migration inside the region have been added to elements which effect movement of population. While this changing, which occurs in the dynamics of domestic migration during the time, does not exist in most of present researches, one of the other absence is social sex viewpoint. In the studies about migration, the lack of social sex viewpoint is not peculiar only to Turkey but also it seems limited in international literature. Present studies show there are important differences between women and men in the point of migration causes, participation to migration process, experiences during this process and effects of migration, attitudes and reactions of immigrants. In the core of these differences there are, collaboration inside the family between woman and man and parallel to this, social roles of woman and man, which described by customs and traditions. Women’ life relating to migration is generally closely related to their situations in family as a wife, a mother or a young girl about to marry. The relations between them and both the places they left and they just came is formed in this base. Consequently, in a migration process, which includes a social and place changing, identity of sex has an important role as much as socio-economic class, culture, ethnic or national identity. G. A. P.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the implications of U. S. federal and international regulatory mandates in the construction and circulation of racial categories in biomedical research and drug development. It {{will focus on the}} interface between two regulatory mandates in particular: the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline Document E- 5 on Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data, and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry: Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials. The ostensible purpose of both of these guidelines is to promote more efficient and economical development of new pharmaceutical interventions. Underlying both Guidances is a presumption that race and ethnicity are relevant variables in assessing the safety and efficacy of drugs in clinical trials. Both Guidances also implicitly cast race and ethnicity as obstacles to be managed and overcome in the course of getting new drugs to global markets as quickly and cheaply as possible. The ICH process is transforming global drug development and marketing, and, in particular, is opening up the large Japanese market to pharmaceuticals tested in the West. The FDA Guidance similarly promises to transform the production and organization of racial and ethnic data in clinical trials for the U. S. market. As pharmaceutical development goes global, however, the social classifications of the FDA Guidance also promise to collide with the mixture of <b>social,</b> <b>physiological</b> and genetic factors elaborated in the ICH guideline. These diverse classificatory schemes cannot be easily reconciled. This paper will explore how concepts of race and ethnicity are being produced and reproduced through this collision. It will further explore how these distinct attempts to regulate race in a bureaucratic context are shaping the development of global pharmaceutical markets. Part II of the article will set forth the background to the ICH E 5 regulatory mandate and its distinct concepts of race and ethnicity. Part III will explore how the ICH guidelines have already begun to affect global pharmaceutical development. Part IV will set forth the background to the FDA guidelines on the collection of racial and ethnic data for clinical trials. It will then go on to examine the debates that arose around the adoption of the FDA guidelines, specifically as they involved considerations of how the FDA guidelines might impact global pharmaceutical development under the ICH regulatory regime. Part V will conclude the article with an examination of the broader implications of this story for the production of social and regulatory understandings of the nature of race and ethnicity...|$|E
40|$|Developments {{during the}} last decade have {{resulted}} in an increased globalization of both personal and financial resources. This thesis is based on a longitudinal, prospective study, following a group of employees and their families (n= 131, expatriate group) before (pre-assignment), during (expatriation) and after (repatriation) a work-related assignment abroad. Concurrently, a home-based, non- moving group was followed (n= 81). Psychosocial and physiological parameters were assessed on a regular basis. The aims of the thesis were 1) to study psychological, <b>social,</b> <b>physiological</b> and immunological reactions during the relocation process; 2) to identify biophysiological predictors of healthy adjustment to foreign work assignment and; 3) to increase knowledge of individual modifiers of psychophysiologic reactions to strains an stressors. Psychophysiological reactions, such as increased serum levels of prolactin were associated with relocating abroad and partly modified by individual characteristics, such as internal locus of control, high self-esteem, active coping ability and sense of coherence. The first year of the assignment seems to be the most critical period abroad. Negative changes in the psychosocial work environment predicted {{a large part of the}} decrease in work adjustment - measured as decreased work satisfaction - during the first year. These findings were also reflected in physiological stress indicators. Job promotion was not related to work satisfaction. Contrary to our expectations, employees reported more decreased well-being after the first six months abroad than their spouses. This might indicate that employees, not the spouses, are the most vulnerable link, in mediating decreased mental well-being in families during the first period abroad. The repatriation phase affected employees' mental health more negatively than expatriation. Psychophysiological indicators of distress, such as cortisol, significantly increased. Results in paper V suggest that unidentified factors associated with foreign relocations increase the risk of sensitization in predisposed children. Stress might be one such factor. In one paper we evaluate the interplay between a real-life stressor (relocation) and possible effects on subjective rated health. Sleep quality suggests a link between stress, vital exhaustion, and subjective health. Changes in subjective health seem closely related to changes in sleep quality and decreased mental energy. Psychophysiological reactions to relocation were primarily individual, as were the consequences for mental well-being and health. Therefore, solutions need to be targeted to individual needs. Results in the thesis emphasize the importance of multinational organizations looking more closely at these individual characteristics before sending employees abroad. They should also be more involved in supporting employees to more effectively manage stressors characteristic of the first year of foreign work. The results suggest that company resources should be concentrated on expatriate employees who exhibit a reduced capacity to handle stress situations. Companies could design policies that ensure the mental and psychological well-being of employees during both the expatriation and repatriation phases of foreign assignments. Such policies would ultimately benefit the individual, employee, family, company and the end user: the customer...|$|E
