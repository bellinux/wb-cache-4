40|$|Rivers whose basins are {{underlain}} by limestone {{possess a}} high buffering capacity for discharged pollutants. During {{the discharge of}} metals in the aquatic environment, metals are partitioned between the sediment and the water column phases. Further partitioning of metals occurs within the sediment chemical fractions and metal speciation in water column, thus leading to the possible reduction of the toxic free hydrated metal ion. The present study focuses on one of Lebanon's rivers; the Nahr-Ibrahim whose basin is underlain by limestone and its river water is dominated by carbonate species due to the high pH and alkalinity values. The objectives of this study were: first, to determine the metal speciation (Fe, Zn, Pb and Cd) in the (operationally defined) sediment chemical fractions and metal speciation in river water; second, to evaluate the role of carbonate species in the <b>self-purification</b> <b>process</b> from metal pollutant inputs into the river. Bed sediments and water were collected from eight locations in one dry season (September, 1997), and a sequential chemical fractionation scheme {{was applied to the}} < 75 μm sieved sediment fraction. The data show that the highest percentages of total metal content in sediment are for: Fe in the residual fraction followed by moderately reducible fraction, Zn and Pb in the carbonate and in the moderately reducible fractions and Cd primarily in the carbonate fraction. Aqueous metal speciation was predicted using AQUACHEM software interfaced to PHREEQC geochemical computer model. The water speciation data predicted that a high percentage of Pb and Zn were present as carbonate species, very low percentages as free hydrated ion species; whereas Cd exhibited high percentage occurrence as a free hydrated metal ion species. Iron was present in water mainly as ferric hydroxide ion pair species.

In the Czech Republic discharging wastewater has its rots in the 14 th century, but the first wastewater treatment plant was not activated until the February 1905. It operated till the sixties (Pražské vodovody a kanalizace, 2010; Historie stokování a čištění odpadních vod v Praze, 1998). The wastewater treatment plant collects the wastewater from households, the rain water and wastewater from factories.

The statistical analyses proved HRPs were close to the natural system from all the growth conditions. The HRP could show the "natural optimization as nature" to perform as well as the artificial reactor of continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In the nutrition study, the carbon mass balance indicated CO 2 was the main carbon source. Accordingly, the HRPs can keep a neutral pH range to provide dissolved oxygen (DO), to promote total nitrogen (TN) /total phosphorous (TP) removal efficiencies and to demonstrate <b>self-purification</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, the observations of different nitrogen species in the reactors demonstrated that the major nitrogen source was decided by pH.

The used LA-ICP-MS system consists of a DUV 193 laser ablation system linked to a Thermo Finnigan Element 2 mass spectrometer. The use of a 193 nm ArF excimer laser (50 - 200 mJ energy output) and the standards NIST 611 and NIST 612 enables to produce and analyse small crater diameters down to 5 μm. Trace-element profiles have been analyzed for the elements Ti, Ge, Al, Fe, Mn, U, Th, Ba, Sr, Rb, Cs, and Y in the ppm- and sub-ppm level. The concentrations of the REE are sometimes below the detection limit of the method. Almost all elements (except Cu) display higher contents in chalcedony than in the macrocrystalline quartz.

30|$|Dynamics of {{ammonium}} and nitrite ion {{concentrations in}} the Isnovat River highlights braking nitrification/self cleaning of the water samples containing a cationic surfactant as CTMA. The influence of CaCO 3 on the toxicity and SAS interaction with different long chain (hydrophobic) groups of organic radicals and electrostatic groups is obvious. UV-Vis spectra exhibit the interaction described above, {{which leads to a}} reduction of STA in the solution. Experiences have proved the changes in the SAS interaction with CaCO 3 particles, depending on the proportions of these substances in water. The higher the concentration ratio of SAS-An in aqueous solution (LS) compared to that in the cationic, the separation of the latter occurs completely. So, the transfer and the reorientation of CTMA to carbonate particles takes place depending on the amount of LS. So, the decomposition occurs in combining CTMA * LS and depositing them on nanoparticles, wherein the first bonding layer is formed with LS, and the rest are oriented based on the hydrophobic chain and group electrostatic interaction. This effect of shift results in a change of environmental toxicity. Both UV-Vis spectra and laboratory simulations establish the change due to the addition of calcium carbonate.

In urban rivers, organic matter (OM), oxygen, and nutrients are primarily controlled by wastewater releases which depend on the population and the WWT capacity in the river basin, the latter being dependent on environmental policy decisions. We introduce a novel basin-scale evaluation method that considers the evolution of annual pollutant loads at the outlet of the river basin directly as a function of WWT capacity. Based on this approach, we could prove that the load reductions observed after the implementation of WWT in the river basin was a good indicator of the global treatment efficiency of the WWT plants. We also show that high <b>self-purification</b> <b>processes</b> within the river basin may lead to reach minimum levels of OM before the completion of WWT. In addition, {{the effects of}} wet weather conditions did also change {{as a function of the}} WWT capacity going from positive effects at low capacity to negative effects at high capacity. Finally, the full implementation of WWT in urban river basins does not necessarily guarantee a good status for water quality, mostly because of the high volumetric proportion of treated wastewaters, which do not have the quality standards of river waters.

A range of attempts to dope Ge QDs both during and post-synthesis are reported here. The QDs have been characterized by TEM, XPS, and I/V measurements of SiO 2 coated QD thin films in test cells using doped Si substrates. The solution synthesis of Ge QDs by the reduction of GeCl 4 with LiAlH 4 results in Ge QDs with a low level of chlorine atoms on the surface; however, during the H 2 PtCl 6 catalyzed alkylation of the surface with allylamine, chlorine functionalization of the surface occurs resulting in p-type doping of the QD. A similar location of the dopant is proposed for phosphorus when incorporated be the addition of PCl 3 during QD synthesis; however, the electronic doping effect is greater. The detected dopants are all present on the surface of the QD (s-type), suggesting a <b>self-purification</b> <b>process</b> is operative. Attempts to incorporate boron or gallium during synthesis were unsuccessful. The silica coating of these particles was successful using a modified Stöber method. Monodispersed silica nanoparticles 20 nm in diameter were synthesized with Ge QDs as seeds. The resulting structures comprise of Ge QD core within a silica sphere. Films of these particles result in an average QD…QD distance of 9. 6 nm, which is less than the maximum distance required for good electron transfer (10 nm). Film thickness and annealing tests were done to optimize the cells. These cells were tested for efficiency, and it was found that the phosphorus doped quantum dots and the undoped quantum dots both produced the highest photo induced current on n-type silicon wafers at ¼ of the maximum concentration of these particles with the phosphorus doped quantum dots producing a higher efficiency overall. Thermal annealing the films prior to deposition of the front and back contacts enabled a doubling in the cell efficiency, but did not show any marked increase in the density or crystallinity of the films...|$|E
40|$|The {{awareness}} of {{and interest in}} human activities environmental impact, {{in the framework of}} the ongoing climate change, has imposed the need to evaluate waste disposal in terms of greenhouse gases emission, in addition to the productive processes. Constructed wetlands (CW) are a low environmental impact technology to treat wastewater with little or no energy input, increasingly used as a natural-like treatment system that is applicable in urban and/or production contexts. CW systems reproduce the physical, chemical and biological <b>self-purification</b> <b>process</b> of the soil-plant-microorganism systems that characterize aquatic habitats and natural wetlands. Depuration processes, largely operated in these systems by rhizosphere microorganisms that contribute to the reduction of organic and nitrogen wastewater load, determine gaseous compounds release into the atmosphere, some of which act as greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The evaluation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from CWs, influenced by CW and wastewater types and vegetation and species presence in the beds, has been investigated for about 15 years in CWs in central-northern European Countries, while few experiments, and mostly at laboratory scale, have been conducted in the Mediterranean Basin, and none in Italian CWs. With this in mind, the main aim of this PhD thesis was to evaluate the role of the main components used in the construction of CWs on GHGs emission in the more widespread (full scale or pilot plants) Italian CW systems. For this purpose in two different Italian bioclimatic contexts, Sicily and Veneto, two CW sites were selected that treated urban wastewater and digestate fluid fraction respectively. Particular attention was paid in the research to the role of vegetation on CWs GHGs emission studying different species (Arundo donax L., Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex Steud., Cyperus papyrus L., Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty and Mischantus x giganteus Greef et Deu.). The results obtained in the Sicilian context showed a species specific effect on CO 2 and CH 4 emissions. Significantly higher CO 2 emissions (median value 16. 5 g m- 2 d- 1) were monitored in the beds vegetated with A. donax, M. giganteus and P. australis, than those vegetated with C. papyrus and C. zizanioides and the unvegetated bed (median value 5. 2 g m- 2 d- 1). The M. giganteus presence in the bed and the absence of vegetation both determined significantly higher CH 4 emissions than those monitored with C. papyrus. At the end of the two trial years all vegetated beds showed a CO 2 (eq) positive balance with better values calculated for A. donax (21. 4 kg CO 2 (eq) m- 2), whereas the unvegetated bed showed a net emission into the atmosphere of 5. 5 kg CO 2 (eq) m- 2. The CW system in Veneto that treated digestate fluid fraction coming from an anaerobic digester for biogas production fed with livestock slurry and energy crops biomass, showed no significant depuration performance differences between P. australis and A. donax vegetation, but the latter did not regrow in the second year, thus determining a significant increase in CH 4 emissions. The digestate fluid fraction, characterized by a high organic matter and nitrogen content, can also be considered as an agronomic resource in a region where land availability is not a limiting factor and considering the limit on its spreading imposed by Directive 91 / 676 /EEC of 12 December 1991. In fact, the intensive mineral fertilization and deep soil tillage that were typical of Italian agriculture {{in the second half of}} last century, have caused some problems in the agro-ecosystems, including the loss of organic carbon. The addition of soil organic matter and the use of agricultural techniques to directly or indirectly reduce CO 2 emissions, may be a response to soil organic carbon loss with a positive effect on the environment. Taking this into account, an additional investigation topic of the PhD research has been to evaluate the effect exerted by the digestate fluid fraction application on agricultural soil CO 2 emissions by: 1) soil texture (sandy loam vs. clay loam) and preparatory tillage (plowing vs ripping) after splash-plate spreading; 2) the digestate fluid fraction injection depth into the soil (10, 25 and 35 cm). The results have shown a CO 2 emission peak one hour after digestate distribution and emission values reaching those of un-amended soils after 3 days, using both application methods. Considering the splash-plate technique in the two weeks following spreading, significantly higher CO 2 emissions were found in sandy loam than clay loam soil, the preparatory soil tillage showed no significant effect. Digestate fluid fraction soil injection determined after one hour of application, an opposite trend with injection depth, with lower emissions at increasing depth. ...|$|E
30|$|The results {{encompassing}} {{the several}} class-I WWTPs, {{on the one}} hand, and the class-IV WWTP, on the other hand, had similar implications. Samples inducing the severest effects were those not directly downstream the effluent, but those a little further along the river course (H 2.1, H 2 a uh 2, H 2 a uh 3). Substances might need some time to sediment and do so increasingly in zones of lower flow velocity [49]. Another clear hint pointing in this direction is the results obtained from H 2 -B samples collected in the low velocity basin area close to the effluent. H 2 -B sediment induced consistently effects on a high level and more pronounced {{than in any other}} sample. Those effects seem comparable to findings in the lower Neckar region (Germany). Sediment samples collected from a less drained conservation area induced a higher embryo toxicity than samples directly from the Neckar, where sediments get permanently shifted [26]. Although, there is clear indication that discharges of the WWTPs influence embryotoxicity at the Horloff River, the results have to be regarded with suspicion as even samples from the uppermost site caused effects. Further to the mouth of the Horloff River entering the Nidda, the tendency of improved conditions downstream is reflected in the results obtained for site H 4. Similar to the situation at the downstream sites of the Nidda River, there might be a slight dilution effect, as three ditches enter the Horloff between H 3 and H 4. Furthermore H 4 is located between two renaturation areas that might have positive influence on <b>self-purification</b> <b>processes</b> and therefore, support mitigating effects.|$|R
40|$|Many {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs) are not properly equipped {{for the removal of}} various compounds, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and hormones. These compounds are continually discharged into surface waters, which has become an emerging issue for environmental and public health. Microorganisms in the natural environment may {{play a crucial role in}} ecosystem <b>self-purification</b> <b>processes</b> such as contaminant degradation. The aim of this research was to determine if there were microorganisms from water and sediment samples located near wastewater effluent outfalls in Central and Western New York capable of degrading ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and 17 β-estradiol, and if the degradation capability of microorganisms varied by sampling site. An isolation approach was developed using serial enrichment in mineral medium containing each individual pharmaceutical as the sole carbon source available to heterotrophs. After four weeks of enrichment, bacteria were isolated and the growth of each isolate on its selected pharmaceutical source was measured. The biodegradation of pharmaceuticals was then examined with the isolates that showed the most consistent growth. Results from the various enrichment experiments have led to the isolation of several heterotrophic bacteria capable of utilizing the compounds as their sole carbon sources. An isolate cultured from Payne Beach had the ability to remove up to 40. 1 % ± 3. 9 % of acetaminophen, 23. 2 % ± 5. 7 % of ibuprofen, and 18. 6 % ± 5. 3 % of 17 β-estradiol and an isolate cultured from Charlotte Beach had the ability to remove up to 23. 4 % ± 3. 5 % of ibuprofen, 32. 2 % ± 2. 5 % of naproxen, and 29. 1 % ± 1. 9 % of 17 β-estradiol. The data suggests that there are endogenous heterotrophs located near wastewater outfalls that can degrade various pharmaceuticals, and that the degradation capability of microorganisms on certain compounds may be site specific...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{ecological}} ambience (Ecological Ambience System, EASY) {{is based on}} the idea that biocenoses (BIO) are not only related to the input of organic and mineral substances (IN) but also to the way they are stored and processed by the ecosystem. Storage, assimilation and <b>self-purification</b> <b>processes</b> ("ecosystem defences": ED) are likely to vary among the different functional units (FUs) of the ecosystem. The functional units have been defined on the basis of a simple physical description of sites in an ecosystem, because the physical structure of these units is considered as being of prime importance in the ED processes. For example, mineral and organic substances may be preferentially stored in fine-sediment units, whereas the mineralization rate of organic matter is more likely to be highest in coarse permeable sediments. If the stream ecosystem is viewed as a mosaic, its overall ecological defences will depend upon: 1) the self-purification capacity of the different functional units; 2) their relative proportion within the ecosystem. The EASY concept is now used for ecological researches and also has several applications in the biomonitoring of running waters, illustrated by the study of the River Dore. Biological compartments, specific for each functional unit, are related to operational bio-indicators to build up a global harmonisation system for biomonitoring indices. Four main biological compartments were defined with their related bio-indicators: 1) general biological quality (IBGN biotic index), 2) biological sediment quality (IOBS oligochaete index), 3) biological water quality (diatom index IBD) and 4) biological fish quality (study of fish communities). The selected bio-indicators were adjusted to an ecological classification model (Typic concept). A weighting system of the general ecological quality at a site based on the percentage cover of fine sediments is proposed. This approach can be developed using several other compartments. Major difficulties and potential improvements are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The present Doctoral Thesis {{is framed}} within the main {{research}} {{line of the}} Chemical and Biochemical Processes Technology Group (TEP 025), from the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of Granada. In this research group, different treatments {{have been developed for}} industrial wastewaters purification through advanced oxidation processes, membrane technology as well as IE technique. Concretely, one of the research lines is focused on the depuration of olive mill effluents. During the two-phase olive oil extraction system, two wastewater streams are mainly produced: the first one comes from the washing of the fruit, and is therefore called olives washing wastewater (OWW), and the second one is generated in the extraction of the olive oil, thus referred to as olive oil washing wastewater, OOW, a mixture of the olive-fruit humidity along with process-added water. These effluents are commonly known as olive mill wastewater (OMW). Olives washing wastewater presents low organic load and constitutes the largest amount of the generated wastewater volume. On the other hand, olive oil washing wastewater has high organic load, highlighting the phenols content, which are phytotoxic and refractory, thus resistant to biological degradation. In moderate concentrations are often toxic to aquatic fauna and flora. Therefore, the wastewater from these industries great difficulty degrade by biological processes, both aerobic and anaerobic. Polyphenols gives a high antimicrobial activity inhibiting the development of flora responsible for <b>self-purification</b> <b>processes,</b> presenting phytotoxic activity. Improper disposal of OMW to the environment or to domestic wastewater treatment plants is prohibited due to its toxicity to microorganisms, and also because of the consequent surface and groundwater potential contamination. Moreover, there is a legislation requiring the reduction of the global indicators concentration - COD and suspended solids - so these effluents can be reused or discharged. On the other hand, this wastewater also presents a high inorganic compounds concentration, especially high levels of potassium salts (60 - 70...|$|R
