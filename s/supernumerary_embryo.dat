40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple births are {{associated}} with serious adverse infant and maternal outcomes. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the multiple-birth risk (MBR) associated with IVF and determine whether the risk is impacted by stage of embryo development at transfer. METHODS: A population-based sample of 50 819 IVF transfers utilizing day 3 or day 5 embryos performed in the USA in 2001 on women aged 20 – 40 years was used to assess MBR and live-birth rate (LBR), stratified by patient age, <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryo</b> availability, and number of embryos transferred. RESULTS: Although significantly more day 5 than day 3 transfers used # 2 embryos (69. 2 versus 27. 7 %), the former were not associated with decreased MBR. MBR was high when> 1 embryo was trans-ferred, irrespective of embryo development stage. LBR were generally maximized with 2 embryos transferred, and for some (day 5 transfers, patients aged 35 – 37 years) with one embryo. Electing to transfer a single day 5 embryo appeared efficacious for some patients: women aged 20 – 37 years with supernumerary embryos cryopreserved had LBR of 31. 6 – 39. 5 %. CONCLUSIONS: MBR is high when $ 2 embryos are transferred. Single embryo transfer is the only way to prevent many multiple births and associated adverse health outcomes.

40|$|Although rice {{is a key}} crop species, {{few studies}} have {{addressed}} both rice seed physiological and nutritional quality, especially at the tissue level. In this study, an exhaustive “multi-omics” dataset on the mature rice seed was obtained by combining transcriptomics, label-free shotgun proteomics and metabolomics from embryo and endosperm, independently. These high-throughput analyses provide a new insight on the tissue-specificity related to rice seed quality. Foremost, we pinpointed that extensive post-transcriptional regulations occur {{at the end of}} rice seed development such that the embryo proteome becomes much more diversified than the endosperm proteome. Secondly, we observed that survival in the dry state in each seed compartment depends on contrasted metabolic and enzymatic apparatus in the embryo and the endosperm, respectively. Thirdly, it was remarkable to identify two different sets of starch biosynthesis enzymes as well as seed storage proteins (glutelins) in both embryo and endosperm consistently with the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryo</b> hypothesis origin of the endosperm. The presence of a putative new glutelin with a possible embryonic favored abundance is described here for the first time. Finally, we quantified the rate of mRNA translation into proteins. Consistently, the embryonic panel of protein translation initiation factors is much more diverse than that of the endosperm. This work emphasizes the value of tissue-specificity-centered “multi-omics” study in the seed to highlight new features even from well-characterized pathways. It paves the way for future studies of critical genetic determinants of rice seed physiological and nutritional quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} intracytoplasmic sperm {{injection}} (ICSI) warrants further study {{on the role of}} paternal factors in early human embryogenesis. To investigate whether poor sperm parameters can influence embryo development, we examined the development of ICSI-fertilized embryos to the blastocyst stage. We present results of blastocyst development from <b>supernumerary</b> ICSI <b>embryos</b> after co-culture on monkey kidney epithelial cells. In addition, we compare the development of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> to the blastocyst stage after ICSI and in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Of 168 <b>supernumerary</b> ICSI <b>embryos,</b> 45 (26. 8 %) developed to blastocysts. Sperm concentration and morphology did not influence blastocyst development. In contrast, blastocysts arose from spermatozoa that had a significantly higher (P = 0. 015) forward progressive motility compared with spermatozoa from those patients who failed to produce blastocysts (42. 7 % versus 28. 2 %, respectively). Overall the rate of embryo development to the blastocyst stage after ICSI was lower (26. 8 %) than that after IVF (47. 3 %). When the rate of blastocyst development was calculated for patients with three or more <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos,</b> it remained significantly higher for the IVF patients than for the ICSI patients (45. 6 % versus 30. 0 %).

In this study we present: (i) results of blastocyst development from <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> after co-culture on green monkey kidney epithelial cells and (ii) pregnancy rates after transfer of frozen blastocysts. In addition, we have examined {{the influence of the}} day of blastocyst freezing and the day of transfer after the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak on pregnancy and implantation rates. Of 423 <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos,</b> 200 developed to the blastocyst stage (47. 3 %). By days 5 and 6, 67 % of the blastocysts had reached the blastocyst stage, and were frozen, compared to 28. 5 % by day 7. When we compared the cases where only blastocysts frozen on days 5 and 6 were transferred compared to those frozen and transferred on or after day 7 the pregnancy rates were 7 / 18 (38. 9 %) and 1 / 16 (6. 2 %) respectively. In contrast, when we examined the influence of the day of transfer we found that pregnancies were established from day 5 up to day 9 post LH peak. Based on these results, we suggest that every attempt should be made to increase the development rate of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> to the blastocyst stage, as it appears that the quality of blastocysts transferred, as shown in this study by rate of development, plays a more crucial role than the timing of transfe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The huge {{potential}} of {{human embryonic stem}} cells has been a subject of wide discussion as regards the ethical and legal justi®cation of using human embryos for establishing such cell lines. The opinions of infertile couples and their willingness to donate their <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> for stem cell research have not been investigated earlier. METHODS: We conducted {{an analysis of the}} answers of couples who were asked to give informed consent as regards donating their embryos for stem cell research in our IVF unit in 2001 ± 2002. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of the couples gave informed consent as regards establishing and characterizing embryonic stem cell lines from the embryos which could not be used in their infertility treatment. Discussion in the Swedish media during May to December, 2001 regarding the importance and ethical justi®cation of stem cell research made informing the couples easier.

40|$|The {{challenges}} before {{science and}} medicine are these: science must explore {{the natural world}} as thoroughly as possible, while still honoring, protecting, serving and preserving the subject of its investigations, and the human beings for whom it is a tool; medicine must confront disease and disability as effectively as possible, while also honoring, protecting, and preserving those beings for whom it serves – all of those beings, not just some, or even most, at the potential expense of others. These goals are challenged by embryo-destructive human embryonic stem cell research. The human embryo {{is a human being}} as clearly defined by embryology, and as such should be protected by the codes governing human subject research. However, because of the “potential” benefits offered by pluripotent stem cells, coupled with abortion politics and a very poorly regulated infertility industry, United States governmental advisory commissions and the scientific, medical, and political communities have attempted to define away the humanity of the human embryo, witha few notable exceptions. Because infertility treatments in the United States are poorly regulated, there are large numbersof <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> in cryopreservation. However, only a tiny portion of these will ever be potentially available for research, and thus are not a realistic source of the cells necessary to provide treatments to the millions who might benefit from proposed stem cell based therapies. Cloning willnot be the answer either, given the millions of women who must be exploited to provide sufficient numbers of eggs to generate the cloned cell lines. Moreover, the disposition decisions parents must make for their extra embryos are often agonizing, and not uncommonly change. The use of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> as a source for human embryonic stem cells is unethical, will never be a sufficient source for the medical treatments expected from stem cell research, and is often a source of great distress for the conceiving parents.

40|$|Polyembryony, though {{far from}} a rare {{phenomenon}} in the angiosperms, is intimately and regularly associated with the reproductive processes {{in only a few}} taxa. Among the grasses some species of Poa (Nielson 1946 a, 1946 b), Tripsacum dactyloides and T. lanceolatum (Farquharson, 1955) are remarkable prolific in their production of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos.</b> Other grasses produce double embryos much less frequently. For example, Webber (1940) in a review of polyembryony, cites twinning frequencies of less than one percent for wheat, oats, rice and rye. Thus, although sporadic formation of more than one embryo per ovule may be encountered among members of Gramineae, it is noteworthy when an additional species can be numbered with those few in which the phenomenon frequently occurs. Several years ago, in the course of an investigation of embryogenesis in some Michigan grasses, it was found that a number of the grains of Seneca grass, Hier-ochloe odorata (L.)

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> is {{routinely}} performed in human-assisted reproduction, providing {{a source of}} embryos which can be thawed for use in subsequent treatment cycles. However, the viability of cryopreserved embryos has traditionally relied on morphological assessment, which is a poor predictor of embryo health since freezing leads to a significant overall reduction in implantation potential, and its long-term efficacy is unknown. This study describes how the post-thaw metabolism of human embryos {{can be used to}} predict future development to the blastocyst stage. METHODS: HPLC was used to analyse the post-thaw amino acid metabolism of human embryos from day 2 to day 3 of development. RESULTS: It was possible to predict with 87 % accuracy which frozen-thawed embryo would develop to the blastocyst stage. Developmentally competent embryos were more metabolically quiescent than their arresting counterparts. Amino acid turnover was also capable of distinguishing between the developmental potential of the best, Grade I embryos P < 0. 05.

But science and technology may have to take note of regulatory developments, which might impact if, how, and where that hope will be realized. Until now, no data have been available on the influence of national human stem cell research legislation on the technological activity in the field of stem cells. In this contribution, we assess whether legislative framework conditions affect technological activity in this field. Stem cell patent activity (US Patent and Trademark Office [USPTO]/European Patent Office [EPO]) and legislative framework conditions with respect to human stem cell research have been identified and characterized for the period 1997 – 2003 for 23 countries. For these countries, differences in human stem cell legislation coincide with differences in technological productivity. Where obtaining human stem cells from <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> is permitted, higher levels of technological productivity for all types of stem cell research are observed. Amore permissive legislative approach to human therapeutic cloning coincides with greater emphasis on embryonic stem cell development activities in general.

40|$|A RENEWED INTEREST IN CRYOPRESERVATION: WHY? It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} {{that the proportion of}} births following transfer of cryopreserved gametes or embryos will increase dramatically. Several reasons may explain this rising interest for embryo transfer (ET) after cryopreservation. The improvement of in vitro culture technique enables gaining better quality embryos associated with the policy of single embryo transfer (SET) results in the increasing proportion of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> cryopreserved at different stages of development. Moreover, with the increased efficiency of the cryopreservation technique such as vitrification, there is now a tendency to shift from fresh ET to cryopreserved ET in artificial or natural cycles. This attitude is relevant especially when the progesterone level before oocyte pick-up is above a physiological limiting value, a not optimal thickness of the endometrium or when embryos are originated from an in vitro maturation cycle. Cryopreserved ET is also an opportunity, when fresh ET cycles are cancelled because of hyperstimulation. With the introduction of vitrification, there is also an emergent change in the general attitude towards oocyte cryopreservation offering available solution, for example, in the field of preservation of fertility, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, poor responder, absence of sperm at the time of oocyte pick-up, cryo-banking for egg donation program or for social reason and finally to overcome ethical concerns and legal restrictions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze {{critically}} real cases of actions, often deemed “supererogatory” {{in the context}} of bioethics and medical ethics, in order to assess whether it is appropriate to classify them in this way. More specifically, I try to discuss the moral legitimacy of a consequence of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), i. e., the freezing of the so-called <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos,</b> and their “adoption”, focusing on the possibility of it being a supererogatory action. The hypothesis of this paper is that we often misuse “supererogation” to describe actions that do not have a clear moral connotation, since it is offered as a “shortcut” to resolve moral issues without clearly defining the issues at stake. In order to determine whether “embryo adoption” can be defined as “supererogatory”, indeed, we have first to assess its morality and then get back to the definition of supererogation given by Heyd. Once acknowledged that embryo adoption is not a supererogatory action, I conclude with some anthropological and ethical considerations about this bioethical solution. Furthermore, I suggest that the misuse of supererogation, far from helping the development of an ethical theory, should create a kind of moral dichotomy among ordinary and extraordinary (heroic) way of acting. In these regards, ethics does not need any heroism or sanctity. Too many times, thus, supererogation is supererogatory, especially in the field of bioethics...|$|R

METHODS:This is a retrospective cohort follow-up study performed between November 2012 and February 2015 at the IVF Laboratory Unit of Cochin University Hospital (Paris, France) including 3108 day- 2 <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> resulting from 1237 IVF/ICSI cycles. RESULTS:Total blastulation rate was 67. 2 % from GQE and 48. 7 % from PQE. Percentage of good-quality blastocysts was 60. 7 and 47. 9 % respectively including 14. 7 and 7. 3 % top-quality blastocysts. A total of 150 blastocysts originating from GQE and 729 from PQE were frozen, and then, 37 and 164 were thawed and transferred respectively resulting in 19 (51. 4 %) and 61 (37. 9 %) clinical pregnancies with 13 (35. 1 %) deliveries from GQE and 32 (19. 9 %) from PQE (p = 0. 046) without any difference in neonatal outcomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-invasive {{selection}} of developmentally competent human oocytes {{may increase the}} overall efficiency of human assisted reproduction and is regarded as crucial in countries where legal, social or religious factors restrict the production of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to summarize the predictive value for IVF success of morphological features of the oocyte that can be obtained by light or polarized microscopic investigations. METHODS: Studies about oocyte morphology and IVF/ICSI outcomes were identified by using a systematic literature search. RESULTS: Fifty relevant articles were identified: 33 analysed a single feature, 9 observed multiple features and investigated the effect of these features individually, 8 summarized the effect of individual features. Investigated structures were the following: meiotic spindle (15 papers), zona pellucida (15 papers), vacuoles or refractile bodies (14 papers), polar body shape (12 papers), oocyte shape (10 papers), dark cytoplasm or diffuse granulation (12 papers), perivitelline space (11 papers), central cytoplasmic granulation (8 papers), cumulus–oocyte complex (6 papers) and cytoplasm viscosity and membrane resistance characteristics (2 papers). None of these features were unanimously evaluated to have prognostic value for further developmental competence of oocytes.

40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in stimulation protocols, culture media formulations and laboratory protocols, the success rates in human IVF remain disappointingly low. The ability to successfully cryopreserve <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> {{in a given}} IVF cycle without losing significant embryo viability is essential to maximize the cumulative benefit of a given treatment cycle. Therefore, studies on culture, cryopreservation and gene expression of human embryos fertilized in vitro were performed. In these studies the impact of culture media on fertilization of human oocytes in vitro was investigated. Furthermore, the impact of growth factor supplementation to in vitro culture media and embryo survival and cryodamage after vitrification were studied. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry methods, the expression of genes in the human Fallopian tube, endometrium, and pre-implantation embryos and in human embryonic stem cells (hES) cells was studied. The findings can be summarized as follows: in vitro culture media has impact on normal fertilization. Supplementation of growth factors to in vitro culture media implicates a physiological role in regulating pre-implantation development. Vitrification of embryos is an effective way of cryopreservation. In situ hybridization, immunohistochemical and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry methods are versatile tools in reproductive medicine research. These findings will help to identify markers for embryo development and characterisation of hESC. Furthermore, knowledge obtained will give us tools to improve formulations of culture and cryopreservation media, which in turn might increase the overall results in IVF treatment and maximise the usage of hESC...|$|R

An anonymous mail questionnaire was sent to 412 female patients from the Department of Reproductive Medicine (Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium). The questionnaire had a response rate of 79 %. The majority of patients who did not want to continue the storage of their embryos (87. 9 %) thought the information provided was sufficient to make a decision.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cryopreservation of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> {{resulting}} from IVF treatment offers extra chances to conceive. The {{objective of this}} study is to describe patients' decisions to continue or discontinue storage of their embryos after a minimum storage period of 2 years. METHODS: Female patients who had embryos stored at the Infertility Centre of the Ghent University Hospital (Belgium) were sent a mail questionnaire to be completed anonymously. RESULTS: The questionnaire had a response rate of 79 % (326 / 412). After an embryo storage period of at least 2 years, 40 % of the couples who were still together wished to continue storage of their embryos. Half of these had no concrete plans for a transfer and wanted to postpone the decision or keep all options open. For those who decided to discontinue storage (60 %), the main reason was the completion of their families. Despite the fact that the patients' child wish was the main factor in their storage decision, two groups of patients with distinct profiles made decisions that were inconsistent with their child wish: those who wanted to continue storage while not wanting a(nother) child (7 % of those with no child wish), and those who wanted a(nother) child but decided to discontinue storage (25 % of those with a child wish). Overall, these patients more often expressed emotional difficulties regarding this decision.

Human oocyte cryopreservation has practical application in preserving fertility for individuals prior to cancer treatments. While the efficiency of oocyte and embryo freezing technology has increased over time, there is still room for improvement, since even under ideal circumstances the clinical pregnancy rate from frozen embryo transfer is approximately two-thirds of that from the fresh transfer of embryos. Thus, studies connected with cryopreservation of human oocytes and embryos {{are very important to}} the expansion of effective clinical services. This review gives a summary of the theoretical and technical aspects of oocyte and embryo cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{abandonment of}} frozen embryos by the gamete providers or intentional parents urgently demands a solution. Most centres react by requiring patients {{to enter a}} prior agreement gov-erning the future disposition of their embryos in all foreseeable circumstances. These dispositional directives are inappropriate and self defeating {{in the event of}} contingencies in which the patients remain competent to execute an updated directive. Internal and external changes may invalidate the prior directive by altering the situation as represented by the couple at the initiation of treatment {{to such an extent that}} it no longer corresponds with the actual situation at the time of the execution of the dis-position. The prior agreement should only be considered binding if the agreement among the partners on a specific option was a material condition for one of the partners to start treatment. Reproduction is an important and central part of a person’slife plan. Control over one’s reproductive capacities istherefore a crucial element of a person’s autonomy. This control includes both a right to reproduce and a right not to reproduce. These rights are expressed in the general accept-ance of the gamete providers or intentional parents as the pri-mary decision makers about embryos resulting from infertil-ity treatment. In most centres around the world, it became standard practice to ask patients to sign a consent form in which they indicate what should be done with the frozen <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> when these are no longer needed for their own reproduction. This practice partly developed because of the remarkable fact that a considerable number of the embryos are abandoned by the gamete providers or inten-tional parents. As a consequence of conflicts between the intentional parents and the fertility centre and between the partners themselves, questions were raised about the validity of these contracts...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} the human embryo has always be a subject of {{philosophical}} and theological thoughts with major social consequences, but, until the 19 th century, it has been mainly an abstraction. The arrival of the human embryo in vitro, materialized by Louise Brown's birth in 1978 and above all by the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> produced by the Australian team of Trounson and Wood following the introduction of ovarian stimulation, will turn theoretical thoughts into a reality. Nobody may ignore the hidden intentions behind the debate, as to recognise a status to a few days old embryo will immediately {{have a major impact}} on the status of a few weeks old foetus and therefore on the abortion rights. We will see that the embryo status, essentially based as well on a vision on the good and evil as on social order, cannot be based on a scientific analysis of the reproduction process but comes from a society's choice, by essence " arbitrary " and always disputable. This does not preclude the collectivity right and legitimacy to give a precise status and it is remarkable to observe the law is careful not to specify which status to give to the human embryo. It is more thru handling procedures and functioning rules that the law designed the embryo position, neither with a status of a person, nor of a thing. It nevertheless remains true that there is a constant risk that the legislation gives the embryo a status that would call into question it's unique characteristic of early reproductive stage, jeopardizing at once the hard-won reproductive freedom (reproductive choice) as well as freedom of research on embryonic stem cells, one of the most promising field of medical research.

40|$|The main aims were to {{investigate}} emotional reactions during {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) treatment among women and men, attitudes of IVF couples towards cryopreserved embryos and public attitudes towards various aspects of oocyte donation in Sweden. Assessments of emotional, physical and social reactions were made on a daily reaction scale and attitudes {{on the basis of}} study-specific questionnaires. Both women and men experienced the stages of oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer, as well as the luteal phase, as being particularly stressful and there was a similarity in the type of reaction pattern. Presence of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> for cryopreservation increased the women’s optimism, but did not seem to reduce their level of distress on the day of embryo transfer. One-third of IVF couples chose not to use their cryopreserved embryos. The main reasons among the respondents concerned family planning and too short a legally allowed time of embryo storage. There was strong support for oocyte donation among a subset of the Swedish population. Women were more positive than men towards oocyte donation and to disclosure of the origin to offspring. Factors that might increase the likelihood of women becoming oocyte donors were talking to women with experience of donating oocytes, proximity to the clinic, accessibility of counselling and having children of their own. These results indicate that different approaches to psychological care for women and men may not be warranted during IVF treatment. Contact should be maintained during the cryopreservation period in order to adress the couple’s questions and concerns about the embryos. To increase the donor pool, IVF clinics could provide information about donation to potential donors through the Internet and through experienced donors. The information to donors and recipient couples about different consequences of donation seems to be of great importance...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the optimal protocol for cryopreservation of human embryos obtained from IVF. Design: Prospective randomized study. Setting: Consenting patients {{in an academic}} research environment. Patients: Couples undergoing IVF. Interventions: A cohort of 2, 220 <b>supernumerary</b> multicellular <b>embryos</b> were obtained from 488 patients who were randomized over slow freezing protocols with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 819 embryos), 1, 2 - propanediol (699 embryos) or a mixture of DMSO and 1, 2 -propanediol (702 embryos). A total of 725 embryos have been thawed (DMSO, 232 embryos; 1, 2 - propanediol, 250 embryos and DMSO and 1, 2 -propanediol, 243 embryos) for transfer in natural ovarian cycles. Main Outcome Measures: Embryo survival rate, embryo implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate (PR), delivery rate, live-birth rate. Results: The embryo survival rate was significantly higher with the DMSO protocol (52. 6 %) than with the 1, 2 -propanediol (32. 0 %) or the DMSO and 1, 2 -propanediol protocols (34. 9 %). The clinical PR per thawing cycle was significantly higher in the DMSO protocol (17. 2 %) than in the 1, 2 - propanediol protocol (3. 9 %). The clinical implantation rate per embryo thawed was significantly different between a DMSO-frozen embryo (4. 7 %) and a 1, 2 - propanediol-frozen embryo (1. 2 %). A DMSO and 1, 2 -propanediol frozen embryo had a 3. 7 % chance of implantation. The delivery rate per thawing cycle was significantly higher in the DMSO protocol (12. 5 %) than in the 1, 2 -propanediol protocol (2. 6 %). The live-birth rates per embryo thawed were 3. 5 %, 0. 8 %, and 2. 9 % in the DMSO, 1, 2 -propanediol, and DMSO and 1, 2 -propanediol groups, respectively. Conclusion: <b>Supernumerary</b> multicellular <b>embryos</b> as presented in daily clinical IVF practice have the highest chance of survival and of implantation after cryopreservation when DMSO has been used.

40|$|Overweight and obese (OWOB) {{women are}} {{reported}} to have a lower chance of becoming pregnant. The nutritional enrichment of the periconceptional environment apparent in obese women may be detrimental for embryo viability. This is the first study to examine the development and metabolism of embryos derived from OWOB women compared with those from normal weight women. Measurements of oocyte quality, embryo development and utilisation of exogenous and endogenous metabolites were performed. Results were compared for normal weight and OWOB and examined in relation to blastocyst development and pregnancy outcome. Patients attending the Hull IVF Unit for fertility treatment (n= 176) donated <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> (n= 808) from day 5 to 7 / 9 of development. Full ethical approval was obtained. Oocytes from overweight or obese women were smaller than those from women of healthy weight, yet post-fertilization they reached the morula stage faster and, as blastocysts, showed reduced glucose consumption and elevated endogenous triglyceride levels. There were no differences in the metabolism of pyruvate or lactate. Amino acid metabolism was more active in embryos generated from OWOB women and significant differences were seen in the turnover of individual amino acids that were also predictive of blastocyst formation and pregnancy outcome. The significant findings were independent of male BMI. In vitro culture supplementation with insulin did not influence glucose consumption, but did appear to modulate developmental progression to the blastocyst stage {{as well as the}} utilisation of specific amino acids. Whereas, when the medium was supplemented with l-carnitine (LC), embryos consumed LC from the medium, and at 0. 05 mM LC addition; embryos showed reduced intracellular triglyceride levels and increased exogenous glucose consumption. However, at 0. 5 mM LC addition; embryo viability was compromised in cohorts of embryos from women with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2. The data support the hypothesis that embryo viability is compromised in OWOB women. This may reduce not only the chances of conception, but have long-term implications for the health of the offspring in later life. ...|$|R
40|$|One in six couples {{suffer from}} infertility, and many undergo {{treatment}} with in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Given that IVF {{often results in}} more embryos than can be transferred during one embryo transfer cryopreservation of the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> {{has been an important}} addition to IVF. In recent years, improvements in cryo-thaw technologies have increased interest in the transfer of frozen thawed embryos as a means of increasing the efficacy of the procedure and to encourage the transfer of fewer embryos, {{in order to reduce the}} costs and morbidity associated with multiple pregnancy. In the Netherlands, in 2015, over half of all embryos transferred was a frozen-thawed embryo. A key element of successful freeze thaw treatment is the appropriate preparation of the endometrium to receive embryos. In order to reach optimal synchronization of embryo and endometrium various methods of preparation have been developed. In the thesis “Endometrial preparation methods in frozen-thawed embryo transfer”pregnancy and live birth rates of the various methods of endometrium preparation described in recent literature were compared. None of the methods of endometrium preparation methods could be preferred over another. Comparing the cost-efficiency of two of these methods of endometrial preparation methods similar conclusion were drawn. Therefore, the best method to prepare the womb for receiving a frozen and thawed embryo; it is up to the patient to decide. The second part of the thesis focusses on improving the efficiency of one of the methods of endometrium preparation. In so-called natural cycle frozen-thawed embryo transfer the patients’ own menstrual cycle determines planning of thawing and transferring. Various circumstances that might disrupt the synchronization between embryo and endometrium have been suggested. Insufficient endometrium thickness, elevated progesterone levels and the presence of an LH surge are suggested disruptors of endometrium – embryo synchronization. Even though these circumstances are often observed during natural cycle frozen-thawed embryo transfer they seem to have little consequences with regard to pregnancy rates. Extensive hormonal monitoring also does not help identifying patients that will conceive from those that do not. From an efficiency point of view refraining from monitoring of various hormonal measurements and of the endometrial thickness can be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of human}} embryonic stem (hES) cell line derivation methods is challenging be-cause many worldwide laboratories have neither access to spare human embryos nor ethical ap-proval for using <b>supernumerary</b> human <b>embryos</b> for hES cell derivation purposes. Additionally, studies performed directly on human embryos imply a waste of precious human biological mater-ial. In this study, we developed a new strategy based on the combination of whole-blastocyst cul-ture followed by laser drilling destruction of the trophoectoderm for improving the efficiency of in-ner cell mass (ICM) isolation and ES cell derivation using murine embryos. Embryos were divided into good- and poor-quality embryos. We demonstrate that the efficiency of both ICM isolation and ES cell derivation using this strategy is significantly superior to whole-blastocyst culture or laser drilling technology itself. Regardless of the ICM isolation method, the ES cell establishment depends on a feeder cell growth surface. Importantly, this combined methodology can be successfully ap-plied to poor-quality blastocyts that otherwise would not be suitable for laser drilling itself nor im-munosurgery {{in an attempt to}} derive ES cell lines due to the inability to distinguish the ICM. The ES cell lines derived by this combined method were characterized and shown to maintain a typica...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{long-term}} evaluation of the total pregnancy potential of cohorts of fresh and cryopreserved sibling embryos from in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles stimulated with either the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue buserelin (BUS) (long protocol) or clomiphene citrate (CC) both in combination with human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG). Therefore a retrospective analysis was performed on patients who entered the IVF programme between January 1986 and July 1987 and who had triple embryo transfer in the collection cycle. Significantly more fertilized oocytes developed to good-quality embryos in the CC-HMG group (86. 1 %) than in the BUS-HMG group (80. 8 %). Transfer of the three morphologically best-looking embryos was performed on day 2 post-insemination in 106 CC-HMG and 80 BUS-HMG cycles. <b>Supernumerary</b> <b>embryos</b> were cultured for a further 24 h and multicellular embryos with up to 20 % of fragments were frozen slowly with 1. 5 M dimethylsulphoxide on day 3 post-insemination (162 embryos in CC-HMG cycles, 102 embryos in BUS-HMG cycles). Outcome was measured by embryo survival rate, embryo implantation rate and delivery rate in fresh and frozen embryo transfers. Delivery rates were 31. 3 and 21. 7 % per fresh embryo transfer in BUS-HMG and CC-HMG cycles respectively. Fresh embryo implantation rates were significantly higher in collection cycles stimulated with BUS-HMG (17. 9 %) than in cycles stimulated with CC-HMG (11. 3 %). Implantation rates were significantly enhanced in embryos transferred in excess of one in cycles leading to pregnancy, perhaps indicative of higher embryo quality in BUS-HMG cycles. Almost all cryopreserved embryos have by now been thawed, so the contribution of frozen embryos to overall pregnancy rates can be evaluated. Overall morphological survival rates of frozen-thawed embryos were similar for 140 embryos from CC-HMG cycles (50 %) and 100 embryos from BUS-HMG cycles (46 %). The percentage of fully intact embryos was, however, significantly lower in the BUS-HMG group (19 %) than in the CC-HMG group (39. 5 %). Delivery rates were significantly lower following 30 transfers of frozen-thawed embryos from BUS-HMG-stimulated cycles (3. 3 %) than following 42 transfers of frozen-thawed embryos from CC-HMG cycles (19. 1 %). Embryo implantation rates were lower for frozen-thawed embryos from BUS-HMG cycles (2. 3 %) than from CC-HMG cycles (12. 7 %). Here we demonstrate that ovarian stimulation with the long protocol BUS-HMG instead of the CC-HMG protocol led to higher embryo implantation rates in collection cycles but to lower intact embryo survival rates and to lower embryo implantation rates for frozen sibling embryos. Despite the lower implantation rates with frozen embryos originating from the BUS-HMG protocol, {{there was no significant}} difference between total delivery rate per transfer from cycles stimulated with CC-HMG (30. 2 %) compared with BUS-HMG (33. 8 %).
