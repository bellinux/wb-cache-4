The new Criticality <b>Safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> were consistent with regulatory requirements of the then new DOE Order 5480. 24, Nuclear Criticality <b>Safety.</b> The <b>evaluations</b> provide a criticality safety basis for each operation in the facility {{in support of the}} facility Safety Analysis Report. This implementation program provided a transition from one method of conducting and documenting Criticality <b>Safety</b> <b>Evaluations</b> to a new method consistent with new regulatory requirements.

25|$|The FAA {{began an}} {{aggressive}} <b>safety</b> <b>evaluation</b> in July 2005. The evaluation is performing a detailed review of accidents, incidents, airworthiness directives, service difficulty reports, safety recommendations and safety reports. It also is examining pilot training requirements, {{the history of}} the aircraft's commercial operators and possible engine problems. The goal is to identify the root causes of MU-2 accidents and incidents and determine what, if any, additional safety actions are needed.|$|E
25|$|The Airports Division runs {{development}} programs for airports which includes planning, design <b>safety</b> <b>evaluation</b> and construction. Additional, this division licenses airports, flight schools, aircraft, and aircraft dealers and inspects airports.

The Aviation Services Division assists airports in bring in and retaining airline services. Through the Airport Preservation Program, this division aids at risk airports to find ways to stay open.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about safety in {{operating}} the aircraft; there have been 337 fatalities from MU-2 crashes. As of October 2005, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) undertook a <b>safety</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the aircraft. It concluded that the aircraft has met its certification requirements: It is safe when operated by properly trained pilots who operate properly maintained aircraft. The FAA {{is in the process}} of mandating training specific to the MU-2, as it has in the past for other aircraft. When such mandated training was required outside of the U.S., the MU-2 accident record was vastly improved.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the cold}} war, the need for {{operating}} weapons production facilities has faded. Criticality Safety Limits and controls supporting production modes in these facilities became outdated and furthermore lacked the procedure based rigor dictated by present day requirements. In the past, in many instances, the formalism of present day criticality <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> was not applied. Some of the <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> amounted to a paragraph in a notebook with no safety basis and questionable arguments with respect to double contingency criteria. When material stabilization, clean out, and deactivation activities commenced, large numbers of these older criticality <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> were uncovered with limits and controls backed up by tenuous arguments. A dilemma developed: on the one hand, cleanup activities were placed on very aggressive schedules; on the other hand, a highly structured approach to limits development was required and applied to the cleanup operations. Some creative approaches were needed to cope with the limits development process...|$|R
500|$|In August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia {{ordered the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission to either [...] "approve or reject the Energy Department's {{application}} for [...] never-completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain." [...] The court opinion {{said that the}} NRC was [...] "simply flouting the law" [...] in its previous action to allow the Obama administration to continue plans to close the proposed waste site since a federal law designating Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository remains in effect. The court opinion stated that [...] "The president may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections." [...] In response, NRC issued the final volumes of the Yucca Mountain <b>Safety</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Report (SER), this presented the NRC staff’s statement that the site would meet all applicable standards. At the same time, the staff also stated that NRC should not authorize actual construction of the repository until the requirements for land and water rights were met and a supplement to DOE’s environmental impact statement (EIS) was finished. On March 3, 2015, NRC ordered the staff to complete the supplemental EIS and make the Yucca Mountain licensing document database publicly available, using all the remaining previously appropriated licensing funds.|$|E

50|$|Lactylates {{have been}} {{subjected}} to extensive <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> prior to being FDA approved for use as food additives. The first <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> were initiated by the C.J. Patterson Company in 1950. These biochemical and toxicology studies focused on Verv®, calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate. Data collected from eighteen separate investigations over eleven years were extensively reviewed by physiologists, toxicologists, and statisticians. The results of these studies conclusively demonstrated lactylates to be non-toxic by ingestion leading to FDA approval in April 1961. Research into the safety of lactylates has since continued, with the latest study being completed in 2010. The results of each new study have confirmed the safety of lactylates.|$|R

2500|$|Byron Station {{consists}} of two pressurized water reactors, termed Byron Unit One and Byron Unit Two, and the surrounding grounds and facilities. Byron Unit One received its operating license from the NRC on February 14, 1985 and Unit Two received its license on January 30, 1987. On September 16, 1985, Unit One entered commercial service and power began to be generated at Byron. The operating licenses for the two reactors are set to expire two years apart: Initially, Unit One's license expired on October 31, 2024, and Unit Two's on November 6, 2026. On May 29, 2013 Exelon Generation Co. applied to renew the licences and on November 19, 2015, based on a final <b>safety</b> <b>evaluation</b> report (July 6, 2015) and a [...] (July 15, 2015), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission renewed both operating licenses for an additional 20 years. The renewed licenses authorize Unit One to operate through October 31, 2044, and Unit Two through Nov. 6, 2046.|$|E

40|$|Inclusion of {{alternative}} methods that replace, reduce, or refine (3 R) animal testing within regulatory <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> of chemicals generally faces many hurdles. The {{goal of the}} current work is to i) collect responses from key stakeholders involved in food <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> on what they consider the most relevant factors that influence the acceptance and use of 3 R methods and to ii) use these responses to formulate activities needed to increase the acceptance and use of 3 R methods, particularly for kinetics. The stakeholders were contacted by e-mail for their opinions, asking the respondents to write down three barriers and/or drivers and scoring these by distributing 5 points over the three factors. The main barriers that obtained the highest aggregated scores were i) uncertain predictability 3 R methods/lack of validation, ii) insufficient guidance regulators/industry and iii) insufficient harmonization of legislation. The major driver identified was the possibility of 3 R methods to provide more mechanistic information. Based on the results, recommendations are given to enhance the acceptance and application of 3 R toxicokinetic methods in food <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations.</b> These include steering of regulatory data requirements as well as creating (funding) opportunities for development and validation {{of alternative}} methods for kinetics and development of guidances...|$|R

The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute has been studying pyroprocess technology, and the conceptual design of an engineering-scale pyroprocess facility, called the Advanced Fuel Cycle (AFC) facility, has been performed {{on the basis of}} a 10 tHM throughput per year. In this paper, the concept of the AFC facility was introduced, and its <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations</b> were performed. For the <b>safety</b> <b>evaluations,</b> anticipated accident events were selected, and environmental safety analyses were conducted for the safety of the public and workers. In addition, basic radiation shielding safety analyses and criticality safety analyses were conducted.
