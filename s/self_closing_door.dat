30|$|Active fire {{protection}} systems, AS: Fire protection system {{that needs to}} activate {{as a response to}} fire, e.g. sprinkler system, evacuation alarm, <b>self</b> <b>closing</b> <b>doors</b> activated by smoke detector etc.|$|R
30|$|Scenarios {{incorporating}} antagonistic {{events have}} a {{potential to be}} more severe, this has been discussed above, e.g. flammable liquids present the potential of a fast developing fire (Richards 2008) and of course an explosion can create a significant damage. As discussed in the Literature review section {{there is a potential}} that fire protection systems, both active (sprinkler, <b>self</b> <b>closing</b> <b>doors</b> etc.) and passive (fire barriers, physical separation etc.) are inadequate or damaged if the initiating event is severe, e.g. an explosion. To handle this within the method a question is always asked whether the passive/active fire protection is still operational after the initiating event, see Figure  3. These factors need {{to be included in the}} evaluation and should have its starting point in the assets as well as the exposure analysis and be qualitatively described in the previous step. In this step the basis of quantifying this scenario need to be developed, e.g. what kind of flammable liquid, amount etc., i.e. input needed in order to calculate the scenario.|$|R
30|$|The worst {{credible}} consequence (WCC) {{scenario is}} the first step in evaluating a scenario. It considers the scenario when all active fire protection systems are impaired. Active fire protection systems can be active fire suppression systems such as sprinklers, evacuation alarm, <b>self</b> <b>closing</b> <b>doors</b> activated by smoke detection etc. This scenario has similarities with maximum foreseeable loss or estimated maximum loss within the insurance industry. However, it should be pointed out that different insurance companies have different definitions, some assumes that fire walls are not breeched and others require a special fire wall or physical separation if it should be assumed to limit the fire damage. The benefit of analyzing this scenario is that it provides information to whether active fire protection systems are needed to meet the protection objectives. If the protection objectives are met without any active fire protection system there is no need to conduct any further analysis of the scenario. Further, if protection objectives are met, there is no need to analyze impairment of the fire protection systems due to any reason (as part of antagonistic attack or common failures), hence there is no need to analyze the availability and reliability of the systems.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{airconditioning}} use in some sectors of the UK's non-domestic building stock, is increasing rapidly and may be approaching saturation, but exact reliable figures are scarce. It is important also to know the reasons for such an increase and if energy efficiency measures are being used effectively to limit the power required by AC (Air-conditioning) units. Systems exist primarily for the comfort of customers and staff, also for stock preservation {{in the case of}} food, but the same effect can be achieved with much less energy use, particularly in temperate climates such as in the UK. Typical energy efficiency measures in the retail sector may include more efficient use of display lighting, more and non-arbitrary setting of cooling temperatures combined with <b>self</b> <b>closing</b> <b>doors</b> or air curtains. The results presented in this paper are from a broad-brush (low data depth, but from a large sample) pilot survey of around 700 retail premises from in 4 UK towns and cities. This was found to be a very effective way of gathering key data for a statistically valid, large sample, in a matter of days, helping surveys to coincide, for example, with favourable weather. Although the surveying process was largely qualitative there was also some quantitative sampling. To asses...|$|R
