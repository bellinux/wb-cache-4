5000|$|If {{salad is}} the first course, the soup spoon is skipped. The dinner fork is placed {{immediately}} left of the dinner plate; the <b>salad</b> <b>fork</b> {{is placed on the}} outer left side of the place setting.|$|E
50|$|Tables {{are often}} set {{with two or}} more forks, meant {{to be used for}} {{different}} courses; for example, a <b>salad</b> <b>fork,</b> a meat fork, and a dessert fork. Some institutions wishing to give an impression of high formality set places with many different forks for meals of several courses, although many etiquette authorities regard this as vulgar and prefer that the appropriate cutlery be brought in with each course.|$|E
25|$|Serving {{pieces were}} often elaborately {{decorated}} and pierced and embellished with ivory, and could include {{any or all}} of the following: carving knife and <b>fork,</b> <b>salad</b> knife and <b>fork,</b> cold meat fork, punch ladle, soup ladle, gravy ladle, casserole-serving spoon, berry spoon, lasagna server, macaroni server, asparagus server, cucumber server, tomato server, olive spoon, cheese scoop, fish knife and fork, pastry server, petit four server, cake knife, bon bon spoon, salt spoon, sugar sifter or caster and crumb remover with brush.|$|R

60|$|There are two {{or three}} courts in the castle, but of no great size. We were now led across one of them, and {{dismissed}} out of the arched entrance by which we had come in. We found the gendarme still keeping watch on his roofed drawbridge, and as there was the same gentle shower that had been effusing itself all the morning, we availed ourselves of the shelter, more especially as there were some curiosities to examine. These consisted chiefly of wood-carvings,--such as little figures in the national costume, boxes with wreaths of foliage upon them, paper knives, the chamois goat, admirably well represented. We at first hesitated to make any advances towards trade with the gendarme because it was Sunday, and we fancied {{there might be a}} Calvinistic scruple on his part about turning a penny on the Sabbath; but from the little I know of the Swiss character, I suppose they would be as ready as any other men to sell, not only such matters, but even their own souls, or any smaller--or shall we say greater--thing on Sunday or at any other time. So we began to ask the prices of the articles, and met with no difficulty in purchasing a <b>salad</b> spoon and <b>fork,</b> with pretty bas-reliefs carved on the handles, and a napkin-ring. For Rosebud's and our amusement, the gendarme now set a musical-box a-going; and as it played a pasteboard figure of a dentist began to pull the tooth of a pasteboard patient, lifting the wretched simulacrum entirely from the ground, and keeping him in this horrible torture for half an hour. Meanwhile, mamma, Miss Shepard, U----, and J----- sat down all in a row on a bench and sketched the mountains; and as the shower did not cease, though the sun most of the time shone brightly, they were kept actual prisoners of Chillon much longer than we wished to stay.|$|R
50|$|Utensils {{are placed}} inward about 20cm or 8 {{inches from the}} edge of the table, with all placed either upon the same {{invisible}} baseline or upon the same invisible median line. Utensils in the outermost position are to be used first (for example, a soup spoon or a <b>salad</b> <b>fork,</b> later the dinner fork and the dinner knife). The blades of the knives are turned toward the plate. Glasses are placed an inch (2.5 cm) or so above the knives, also in the order of use: white wine, red wine, dessert wine, and water tumbler.|$|E
50|$|The cutlery to {{the right}} of the service plate is, from the outside in, the oyster fork resting in the bowl of the soup spoon, the fish knife, the meat knife and the salad knife (or fruit knife). On the left, from the outside in, are the fish fork, the meat fork and a <b>salad</b> <b>fork</b> (or fruit fork). If both a salad and a fruit course are served, the {{necessary}} extra flatware is brought out on a platter, as it is bad form to have more than three knives or forks on the table at once, the oyster fork excepted.|$|E
5000|$|Humor theorist NoÃ«l Carroll {{explains}} {{humor in}} relation to incongruity theory and annoyance: [...] "Imagine the cutlery laid out for a formal dinner. Suppose that the <b>salad</b> <b>fork</b> is in the wrong place. If you are {{the sort of person}} who is disturbed by such deviations from the norm, you will not be capable of finding this amusing. On the other hand, if you are more easy-going about such matters and also aware of the incongruity, it may elicit a chuckle. That is, you may find the error amusing or not. But if you find it genuinely amusing you cannot find it annoying." ...|$|E
5000|$|If soup is {{the first}} course, {{to the left of}} the dinner plate, moving clockwise, are placed a small <b>salad</b> <b>fork</b> {{to the left of the}} dinner plate; a large dinner fork to the left of the salad fork; a side plate above the forks; a wine or water glass above and to the right of the dinner plate; a large dinner knife to the right of the dinner plate; a smaller butter knife to the right of the dinner knife; a dinner spoon to the right of the knives; a soup spoon to the right of the dinner spoon.|$|E
50|$|Rebadow {{was a young}} {{architect}} {{sometime in}} the mid-1960s. With a child on the way, he was planning a large-scale architectural project. Rebadow committed his crime at a business lunch where he was displaying his blueprints to his business partner who laughs and mocks his designs. Enraged, Rebadow stabs his partner in the neck with his <b>salad</b> <b>fork,</b> killing him. In spite of the abrupt nature of the crime, Rebadow was still convicted of premeditated murder {{and sentenced to death}} in the electric chair. During Rebadow's execution, there was a power surge (attributed to the Great Northeast Blackout of 1965); the execution was botched and Rebadow was admitted to the medical unit for the injuries he sustained during the botched electrocution. During his stay, the death penalty was abolished and his sentence was commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Following Rebadow's release back into general population, he began claiming that he now received regular visits from God. Although written off as insane, Rebadow now possesses a certain mystic knowledge about everything going on in Oz, and in some instances even knows private details about prisoners' lives of which he had no prior knowledge.|$|E
