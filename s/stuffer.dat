2500|$|The {{subject of}} Jewish {{surnames}} in Yemen {{is a complex}} one. Most surnames are eponymous, meaning, they are derived from {{the name of an}} ancient ancestor, or an ancestor's profession, or an ancestor's place of residence (village or town name). In some cases, surnames are derived from a certain physical characteristic of one's distant ancestor. Some families bear original Spanish surnames, such as Medina and Giyyat. Some names went through additional changes upon returning to the Land of Israel. For example, some who formerly bore the surname of Radha (Judeo-Arabic: רצ'א) have changed their surname to Ratzon (Hebrew: [...] ), the Hebrew being the direct translation of the word's meaning in Arabic, while yet others have simply changed their names to a more Hebraicized sound, such as the surnames of Al-Nadaf (lit. a <b>stuffer</b> of cushions; carder of cotton), which was later changed to Nadav ("generous"), and 'Urqabi (so-named from a locality in Yemen) which was later changed to Argov, or Sheḥib (Judeo-Arabic: שחב), meaning [...] "one whose voice is hoarse," [...] which was changed to Shevach (Hebrew: שבח), meaning [...] "praise." ...|$|E

The four <b>stuffers</b> each pick a piñata and are led to a ring where larger sizes of the piñatas are located. The <b>stuffers</b> will man their piñatas while the three swingers will be given five minutes to break one each. If a piñata is broken, the swinger who broke the piñata earns that box. The players who are in piñatas that did not break earn their boxes. For each box that was broken that contains one of three $10,000 boxes, the group earns that money. Whoever possess the other box earns an exemption unless they give it back for up to $50,000.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Emergency {{departments}} are facing nowadays {{an increasing number}} of illegal drug-related health problems, associated with medicolegal and/or social consequences. Body <b>stuffers</b> are street cocaine dealers, who either store wrapped packets of drugs in their rectum or hastily swallow them, prompted by fear of police's arrest. These packets can be life threatening in case of leakage. We evaluate the diagnostic value of unenhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) for detection of cocaine-filled packets (CFP) ingested by body <b>stuffers</b> in a phantom model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our phantom simulated normal bowel contents in which a varying number of true and false CFP were randomly mixed. Both only differ in radiological density. During 18 different reading sessions, four radiologists independently evaluated the presence and number of true and false CFP. Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for detection of any packets, for visualization of true, and false CFP was good (kappa= 0. 63, 0. 74 and 0. 58, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for detection of any packets was 95. 6 %, 100 %, 100 % and 62. 5 %, respectively; for visualization of the true CFP 86. 5 %, 100 %, 100 % and 77. 6 %, respectively; and for the false packets 98. 1 %, 65 %, 88. 6 % and 87. 5 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced MDCT without bowel preparation is a fast, reliable and easily reproducible imaging modality for the immediate detection of ingested CFP, thus facilitating medicolegal management of body <b>stuffers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value and image quality of CT with filtered back projection (FBP) compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstructed images (ASIR) in body <b>stuffers</b> with ingested cocaine-filled packets. Methods and Materials: Twenty-nine body <b>stuffers</b> (mean age 31. 9 years, 3 women) suspected for ingestion of cocaine-filled packets underwent routine-dose 64 -row multidetector CT with FBP (120 kV, pitch 1. 375, 100 - 300 mA and automatic tube current modulation (auto mA), rotation time 0. 7 sec, collimation 2. 5 mm), secondarily reconstructed with 30 % and 60 % ASIR. In 13 (44. 83 %) {{out of the}} body <b>stuffers</b> cocaine-filled packets were detected, confirmed by exact analysis of the faecal content including verification of the number (range 1 - 25). Three radiologists independently and blindly evaluated anonymous CT examinations (29 FBP-CT and 68 ASIR-CT) for the presence and number of cocaine-filled packets indicating observers' confidence, and graded them for diagnostic quality, image noise, and sharpness. Sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) Az and interobserver agreement between the 3 radiologists for FBP-CT and ASIR-CT were calculated. Results: The increase {{of the percentage of}} ASIR significantly diminished the objective image noise (p< 0. 001). Overall sensitivity and specificity for the detection of the cocaine-filled packets were 87. 72 % and 76. 15 %, respectively. The difference of ROC area Az between the different reconstruction techniques was significant (p= 0. 0101), that is 0. 938 for FBP-CT, 0. 916 for 30 % ASIR-CT, and 0. 894 for 60 % ASIR-CT. Conclusion: Despite the evident image noise reduction obtained by ASIR, the diagnostic value for detecting cocaine-filled packets decreases, depending on the applied ASIR percentage...|$|R

Without proper hygienic control, the environment in slaughterhouses and butcher shops can act as {{an important source of}} microbiological contamination.

After a dîner d'Axim and discussing a plum-pudding especially made for our Christmas by a fair and kind friend at Trieste, he set out Ancobra-wards on March 16. He would have no Krumen; so our seven fellows, who refused to take service in the Effuenta mine, were paid off and shipped for 'we country.'

40|$|Background: People who ingest {{packets of}} illicit drugs or insert them into body {{cavities}} {{in an attempt}} to smuggle them are termed body packers. People who do this {{in an attempt to}} hide the drugs when encountered by law enforcement are called body <b>stuffers.</b> Severe toxicity and death occurs in body packers and body <b>stuffers,</b> and this is usually secondary to leaking of drug from packets in the gastrointestinal tract. This is well reported with cocaine and heroin and occurs less commonly with methamphet-amine. We report an unusual case of intravaginal body stuffing that lead to severe methamphetamine toxicity in a young woman. Case Report: A 20 -year old female, who was in police custody, developed multiple seizures, altered mental status, tachycardia and hypertension shortly after admitting to having drugs enclosed in plastic bags in her vagina. She was hospitalized for 4 days with gradual improvement in her symptoms {{with the exception of a}} resting tachycardia. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the urine at this time confirmed the presence of methamphet-amine and the amphetamine metabolite, co-intoxicants were excluded based on comprehensive urine drug screening using GCMS. Quantitative serum levels of methamphetamine and amphetamine were 3100 ng/ml and 110 ng/ml, repectively. Conclusions: We report an unusual case of intravaginal body stuffing that lead to severe methamphetamine toxicity in a young woman. This case highlights the potential for severe methamphetamine poisoning secondary to intravaginal stuffing. If either body packing or stuffing is suspected, a vaginal exam may be warranted...|$|R
