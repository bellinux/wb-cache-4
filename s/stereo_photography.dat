40|$|Parasites {{significantly}} influence food webs {{and ecosystems}} and occur {{all over the}} world in almost every animal group. Within crustaceans there are numerous examples of ectoparasites; for example, representatives of the isopod group Cymothoidae. These obligatory parasitic isopods are relatively poorly studied regarding their functional morphology. Here we present new details of the morphological adaptations to parasitism of the cymothoiid ingroup Nerocila with up-to-date imaging methods (macro <b>photography,</b> <b>stereo</b> imaging, fluorescence <b>photography,</b> micro CT, and histology). Central aspects of the study were (1) the morphology of the mouthparts and (2) the attachment on the host, hence the morphology of the thoracopods. The mouthparts (labrum, mandibles, paragnaths, maxillulae, maxillae, maxillipeds) form a distinct mouth cone and are most likely used for true sucking. The mouthparts are tightly “folded” around each other and provide functional rails for the only two moving mouthparts, mandible and maxillula. Both are not moving in an ancestral-type median-lateral movement, but are strongly tilted to move more in a proximal-distal axis. New details concerning the attachment demonstrate that the angular arrangement of the thoracopods is differentiated to impede removal by the host. The increased understanding of morphological adaptation to parasitism of modern forms will be useful in identifying disarticulated (not attached to the host) fossil parasites...|$|R

40|$|Glaucoma, a world {{leading cause}} of blindness, is a {{progressive}} optic neuropathic disease associated with uncontrollable intra-ocular pressure. Vision loss from glaucomatous damage is irreversible but the onset is preventable if diagnosed early. Biomechanical changes of the Optic Nerve Head (ONH) specifically the lamina cribrosa have been suggested to be associated to glaucoma susceptibility. However, imaging the ONH is complicated by its location {{at the back of}} the eye. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can image the retina but commercial OCT systems do not have the tissue penetration to image deeper structures of the ONH. In this thesis, volumetric OCT data are compared with the clinical gold standard of ophthalmic imaging, <b>stereo</b> disc <b>photography,</b> to provide clinicians with a better understanding of the disc margin anatomy.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Skylab photographs {{are superior to}} ERTS images for photogeologic interpretation, primarily because of improved resolution. Lithologic contacts can be detected consistently better on Skylab S 190 A photos than on ERTS images. Color photos are best; red and green band photos are somewhat better than color-infrared photos; infrared band photos are worst. All major geologic structures can be recognized on Skylab imagery. Large folds, even those with very gentle flexures, can be mapped accurately and with confidence. Bedding attitudes {{of only a few}} degrees are recognized; vertical exaggeration factor is about 2. 5 X. Mineral deposits in central Colorado may be indicated on Skylab photos by lineaments and color anomalies, but positive identification of these features is not possible.

Some correlation {{was found between the}} degree of relative degradation and floor roundness, implying that flat floors are primary and round floors are degradational features. No difference was found between the average depth-to-diameter ratio of flat- and round-floored craters, indicating that the factor of two variation in depth-to-diameter ratio in this sample of fresh craters is a primary morphologic feature and that minor degradation of fresh craters has no significant effect on average crater depth...|$|R

METHODS—Thirty-four consecutive patients with glaucoma {{were included in the}} study, and the ONH in the left eye was imaged with SD-OCT and <b>stereo</b> color <b>photography</b> on the same day. The cup and rim were segmented in all ONH OCT volumes by a novel voxel column classification algorithm, and linear cup-to-disc (c/d) ratio was determined.

The primary outcome measure was the correlation between algorithm-determined c/d and planimetry-derived c/d.

Remote Sensing of Environment, 114 (11), 2536 - 2547 For many years, {{the classification of}} forest communities and their associated species from airborne data (primarily aerial photography) has largely been through manual interpretation. With the development of digital imagery, options for delineating individual crowns and identifying these to species have become available but automated techniques for grouping these into meaningful community descriptions still requires development. This paper proposes a method that links individual tree crowns (classified to species) using graph data structures and minimum spanning trees. The method was applied to tree crowns delineated and mapped to species using hyperspectral CASI data acquired over Injune, central Queensland, Australia. The resulting clusters were attributed with tree level statistics relating to crown area and diversity and were shown to produce mapping {{comparable to that of}} manual interpretation of <b>stereo</b> aerial <b>photography.</b> The study concludes that provided reliable tree level mapping of species can be achieved, automated classification of forest communities can be undertaken.

The study investigated the use of aerial photographs, acquired in 1950 and 1991, for assessing the temporal dynamics of mangroves along the West Alligator River in Australia's Northern Territory. For both years, mangrove extent was mapped using an unsupervised classification of the digital orthomosaic and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), or height maps, of the mangrove canopy were derived from stereo pairs. Helicopter and field observations in 1998 and 1999 respectively provided ground truth for interpreting the derived datasets. The comparison of mangrove extent revealed a substantial movement over the 41 -year period, perhaps in response to hydrological changes that {{have resulted in a}} landward extension of saline conditions. Changes in the height of mangroves were observed but were difficult to quantify due to the reduced quality of the 1950 DEM.
