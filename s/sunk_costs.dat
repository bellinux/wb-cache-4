However, if the new firm cannot use or transfer the new machines that it bought for the production of steel to other uses in another industry, the fixed costs on machinery become <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> so if there are <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> in the market, they impede the first assumption of no exit barriers.

However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify <b>sunk</b> <b>costs</b> as [...] "fixed" [...] or [...] "variable."

40|$|O efeito <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> é definido como a tendência a persistir em um curso de ação que se tornou desvantajoso, uma vez que já se investiu esforço, tempo ou dinheiro. O presente estudo investigou se a história {{experimental}} com instrução verdadeira ou falsa, ou sem instrução, afeta o efeito <b>sunk</b> <b>cost.</b> Estudantes universitários foram expostos a um cenário financeiro em que deveriam tentar comprar lotes de ação. Ao tentar uma compra, o participante deveria pressionar a barra de espaço do teclado de um computador; quando a compra era efetuada, um ponto era adicionado ao contador. Para desistir de uma tentativa de compra, o participante deveria clicar com o mouse no botão “Desistir”, presente na tela; nesse caso, um nova tentativa era iniciada. Na Fase de Treino, o mais vantajoso era persistir na tentativa de compra, em oposição a desistir. Para o Grupo Instrução Verdadeira, havia uma instrução que indicava ser melhor persistir e para o Grupo Instrução Falsa, uma instrução que dizia ser melhor desistir; para o Grupo Sem Instrução, não havia instrução. Na Fase de Teste, desistir de uma tentativa de compra era a alternativa mais vantajosa (persistir, então, exemplificaria o efeito <b>sunk</b> <b>cost).</b> Essa fase foi dividida em três condições: com instrução verdadeira na primeira e terceira condições e com instrução falsa na segunda.

The present study investigated whether an experimental history with true and false instructions, or with no instruction, affects the <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> effect. College students were exposed to a financial scenario in which they should attempt to purchase lots of shares. When attempting a purchase, the participant should press the space bar in a computer keyboard; when a purchase was made, one point was added to the counter. When quitting a purchase attempt, the participant should click with the mouse on the “Quit” button, shown on the screen; in this case, a new trial was initiated. In the Training Phase, the most advantageous choice was to persist in attempting to purchase instead of quitting. For the True Instruction Group, there was an instruction indicating that persisting was the best choice, and for the False Instruction Group, the instruction indicated that quitting was the best choice; for the No Instruction Group, there was no instruction. In the Testing Phase, quitting a purchase attempt was the most advantageous choice (persisting was an example of the <b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> effect). This phase was divided in three conditions: with true instructions in the first and third conditions, and with false instructions in the second condition. In the Training Phase, the participants of all groups persisted in attempting to purchase. In the Testing Phase, the participants with no history of true instructions continued persisting (<b>sunk</b> <b>cost</b> effect), in spite of quitting being more advantageous and even when there was a true instruction.
