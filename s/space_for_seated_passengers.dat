50|$|Ford {{entered the}} city car market in 1996 with its oddly-named and oddly-styled Ka, and was beaten into {{second place in}} the 1997 European Car of the Year award by the Renault Scenic. It made use of the Fiesta's chassis and 1300 cc petrol engine, which gave it strong {{handling}} for such a small car. Going against the appeal were its cramped rear seats and tiny boot, but it managed to sell well for most of its 12-year production run. Around the same time, the Mondeo gained a facelift which saw the exterior styling brought up to date and the seating re-designed to improve <b>space</b> <b>for</b> rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|After winning SkyTrain, Bombardier further {{improved}} the design by introducing an articulating section between adjacent cars, replacing the coupling and {{doors of the}} older (retroactively named) Mark I design. The articulation allows passengers to move freely between the cars, and adds more internal <b>space</b> <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seating.</b> These versions of the Mk II design have won several new contests, and are operating on the Kelana Jaya Line in Kuala Lumpur, the Airport Express in Beijing (in four-car trains), and on the EverLine outside of Seoul.|$|R
50|$|The styling of the Series III {{which the}} Rootes Group {{announced}} in October 1960 was distinguishable by its four headlights and revised full-width grille. This Snipe {{was the first}} British car to fit two pairs of headlamps. The suspension of the car had been considerably modified along with the car's floor structure which improved the car's high speed stability. The {{front of the car}} was redesigned to give a lower bonnet line. The nose of the car was also lengthened by 3.25 in to accommodate an additional pulley, mounted {{on the front of the}} crankshaft, that enabled air conditioning to be included as an option, principally for the North American market. Separate ducts were provided for heating and cooling air to the passenger compartment. The engine received improved bearings with a changed lubrication system and was given better cooling with a quieter fan. Seats were redesigned to give more leg <b>space</b> <b>for</b> back <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The new Soarer {{continued}} some of {{the pioneering}} features of earlier models, such as digital dashboard instrumentation and integrated car systems control via the in-dash EMV touchscreen. It {{was also one of}} the first cars in the world to feature factory GPS automotive navigation system via CD-ROM. This generation Soarer was considered an expensive and extravagant luxury car in Japan. It was longer and wider than a Crown, while comfortably accommodating two passengers, with only modest <b>space</b> available <b>for</b> rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b> It did not comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations which made buyers liable for yearly taxes due to its size. The larger engines also obliged Japanese buyers to pay more annual road tax.|$|R
5|$|The Pendolino is {{designed}} as a premium facility train. The seats are fitted with audio sockets for radio and music channels; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage. All seats have electricity sockets for laptops and mobile phones. All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi-Fi Internet access since 2010. The passenger information monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train's current speed in addition to VR's marketing material and station information. They are also used to convey passenger information for the deaf. The train is accessible for wheelchairs, contains pet <b>spaces</b> and <b>seats</b> <b>for</b> allergic <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Renault Mégane Sedan, {{launched}} in July 2016, resembles the Talisman, {{but with the}} front section of the Mégane IV hatchback and a fastback-like sloping roofline. It has more <b>space</b> <b>for</b> the back <b>seat</b> <b>passengers</b> than the hatchback and a larger boot, with a theoretical volume of 508 decimetres. It will be sold on the African continent, the United Arab Emirates, various Eastern Asian and Australia markets. Within Europe it will be offered in several countries including Turkey, Italy, Poland, Romania and Ireland but not in France. [...] Depending on the market, there are two petrol engines and 3 diesel engines offered, with power outputs ranging from 90 to 130 bhp. Only the mid range engine is suitable to be matched with the dual clutch six speed transmission.|$|R
25|$|ART {{technology}} {{was selected for}} the AirTrain JFK project, which is widely considered a great success in spite of predictions to the contrary. After winning the SkyTrain Millennium Line contract in Vancouver, Bombardier further improved the design by introducing an articulating section between adjacent cars, replacing the coupling and doors of the older Mark I design. The articulation allows passengers to move freely between the cars, as well as adding more internal <b>space</b> <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seating.</b> These versions of the Mark II design won several more contracts, and are currently operating on the Kelana Jaya Line in Kuala Lumpur, the Airport Express, Beijing Subway in China (in four-car trains), and the YongIn EverLine near Seoul in South Korea. When Bombardier started marketing ART {{as part of its}} Bombardier Innovia family of automated transit systems, the {{technology was}} rebranded as the Innovia ART 100 for the Mark I and Innovia ART 200 for the Mark II.|$|R

5000|$|MV Iona was {{ten feet}} longer than , and of greater draft, but twin rudders gave her greater {{manoeuvrability}} than the earlier MacBrayne ferries. She was the companys first vessel without traditional teak decking. Her vehicle facilities impressed, but passenger accommodation compared poorly with the 1964 ships. She {{had very little}} open deck <b>space</b> <b>for</b> passengers. Forward on the boat deck (B Deck), there was a full-width lounge <b>for</b> 101 <b>passengers</b> with <b>seating</b> upholstered in blue until they were recovered with sick coloured vinyl in 1984. High bows obstructed the forward view <b>for</b> <b>seated</b> <b>passengers.</b> Aft of this, a deckhouse held a cafeteria. On the lower deck (E Deck), below the car deck were a smoke-room/bar (no longer used) and crew quarters. Unusually for a large MacBrayne ship, Iona had no sleeping accommodation for passengers.|$|R
