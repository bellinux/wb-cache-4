40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt is {{said that}} the chronic {{outcomes}} of the two-stent technique for bifurcation lesions are inferior to that of <b>cross-over</b> <b>single</b> stenting. However, there are many cases where true bifurcations are difficult to treat by single stenting and, in particular, strategies for bifurcation lesions that are not left main trunk (LMT) bifurcations are still not clear. ObjectiveThis study aims to compare the usefulness of crush stenting with that of <b>cross-over</b> <b>single</b> stenting using the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) on bifurcation lesions with the exclusion of LMT bifurcations. MethodsSubjects were 92 consecutive patients (100 lesions) who underwent <b>cross-over</b> <b>single</b> stenting or crush stenting using SES for bifurcation lesions with the exclusion of LMT bifurcations. The patients were divided into 33 patients with 34 lesions, in whom the stent was implanted in the main vessel alone with the kissing balloon technique performed for the main vessel and side branch (Single-stenting group; S group), and 59 patients with 66 lesions, in whom the stent was implanted through crush stenting (Crush-stenting group; C group). The two groups were compared for target lesion revascularization (TLR) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). ResultsThere were no differences for TLR, with this conducted in the main vessel in 5. 9 % of S group and 4. 5 % of C group. There {{was no difference between}} the groups in MACE with 9. 1 % in S group and 8. 5 % in C group. No significant difference was seen in MACE-free survival rate in the chronic phase with 93. 9 % for S group and 94. 9 % for C group (P=NS). ConclusionNo differences in chronic clinical outcomes were revealed in a comparison between <b>cross-over</b> <b>single</b> stenting and crush stenting.

To evaluate the potential of this protein as a drug target, we assessed its essentiality. Both gene disruption by double cross-over and gene truncation by <b>single</b> <b>cross-over</b> recombination failed. We were also unable to achieve allelic replacement by using a missense mutation at the catalytic cysteine codon, although we could obtain synonymous allelic replacement parasites. These results suggested that the calpain gene and its proteolytic activity are important for optimal parasite growth.

40|$|Allelic {{exchange}} mutagenesis {{that relies}} on RecA-mediated homologous recombination up- and downstream from the targeted gene is a generalizable method of site-specific bacterial gene knock-out and knock-in. However, generation of a mutagenic DNA construct (alternative allele flanked by regions surrounding the gene target) and subsequent mutant selection are laborious procedures. Here we demonstrate allelic exchange knock-out facilitated by Gibson Assembly in Streptococcus iniae.

In the new modification, a digestion/ligation reaction is used to join the antibiotic resistance cassette to the circular DNA. The original VFAE protocol results in high number of false-positive colonies with average percentage 38 % and has single and double crossover rates of 19 and 39 %, respectively (Fig.  3 a). In comparison, the current new modification showed significant improvement in the single and double cross-over, with an average increase of 3.0 -fold, especially for the <b>single</b> <b>cross-over</b> (Fig.  3 b).

Elastic scans performed either {{as a function of the}} temperature (back-scattering) and /or by varying the instrumental resolution (time of flight spectroscopy) yield the activation parameters of molecular motions and the approximate intermediate scattering function in the time domain. The two methods are unified by a scaling function, which depends on the ratio of correlation time and instrumental resolution time. The elastic scattering concept is illustrated with a dynamic characterization of alanine-dipeptide, protein hydration water and water-coupled protein motions of lysozyme, per-deuterated phycocyanin and hydrated myoglobin.

30|$|Another {{obstacle}} for conditional mutant strain {{construction in}} Mycobacteria is the {{low rate of}} homologous recombination. Gordhan and Parish described three methods to pretreat DNA to enhance the homologous recombination (Gordhan and Parish 2001). Single-stranded phagemid DNA can abolish unwanted recombination {{but the problem is}} the generation of sufficient amount of single-stranded DNA especially for the GC rich Mtb genome. UV pretreated DNA can raise the homologous recombination events, however, additional point mutations are inevitable. Alkali-denaturation will lead to no additional mutations but lower the homologous recombination events. Lineated double-stranded DNA may also cause higher homologous recombination probability, but lineated DNA is not stable in bacteria. Plasmid pJV 53, an Escherichia–Mycobacteria shuttle plasmid, can generate Che 9 c mycobacteria phage gp 60 and gp 61 proteins, which are homologous to recombinant protein RecE and RecT respectively. These recombinant proteins promote foreign genes to recombine with homologous genes in Mycobacteria with high efficiency (van Kessel and Hatfull 2007). In this study, before the lineated DNA was introduced into Mtb, plasmid pVJ 53 was therefore electroporated into Mtb to improve homologous recombination. Only the double cross-over mutants could form colonies on the 7 H 10 agar media, the <b>single</b> <b>cross-over</b> mutants were not viable.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{current work}} focused on {{molecular}} {{changes in a}} spontaneous Bacteroides fragilis-mutant selected by low concentrations of metronidazole as an adaptive response to the drug. Methods: A metronidazole-resistant strain derived from B. fragilis ATCC 25285 was selected by pas-sage {{in the presence of}} drug using 0 – 4 mg/L gradient plates. Using a combination of proteomics for identification of differentially expressed proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis and selected mutational analyses by <b>single</b> <b>cross-over</b> insertion and an allelic exchange, we have identified genes involved in the adaptive response to metronidazole. Results: There are significant changes in the protein profiles of resistant strains. These changes appeared to affect a wide range of metabolic proteins including lactate dehydrogenase (up-regulated) and flavodoxin (down-regulated), which may be involved in electron transfer reactions. Also, the enzy-mic activity of the pyruvate–ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PorA) complex was impaired. Mutant strains lacking the genes for flavodoxin and PorA were less susceptible to metronidazole than the sensitive parent, and a double flavodoxin/PorA mutant had even less susceptibility but none of the mutants were as resistant as the spontaneous metronidazole-resistant strain. Conclusions: Overall, the data indicated that there were global changes in the regulation of the physi-ology of the metronidazole-resistant strain.

METHODS: Sixteen postmenopausal women (PMW) (mean age 58 +/- 9 years) with more than two risk factors for coronary artery disease, were randomized to receive either oral estradiol (2 mg) for 28 days or oral estradiol (2 mg) for 14 days and oral estradiol (2 mg) and dydrogesterone (10 mg) for 14 days, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, <b>single</b> <b>cross-over</b> study.
