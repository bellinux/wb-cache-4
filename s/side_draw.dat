60|$|This flock {{was known}} to be grazing in a <b>side</b> <b>draw,</b> well up from Grass Valley, where the brush afforded some {{protection}} from the sun, and there was good water and a little feed. Before Jean reached his destination he heard a shot. It was not a rifle shot, which fact caused Jean a little concern. Evarts and Bernardino had rifles, but, to his knowledge, no small arms. Jean rode up on one of the black-brushed conical hills that rose {{on the south side of}} Grass Valley, and from there he took a sharp survey of the country. At first he made out only cattle, and bare meadowland, and the low encircling ridges and hills. But presently up toward the head of the valley he descried a bunch of horsemen riding toward the village. He could not tell their number. That dark moving mass seemed to Jean to be instinct with life, mystery, menace. Who were they? It was too far for him to recognize horses, let alone riders. They were moving fast, too.|$|E

50|$|Howard {{made his}} 100th {{appearance}} for Everton against West Ham United, on November 8, 2008. On April 19, 2009, in the FA Cup semi final, he saved two penalties against his former club Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out to send Everton {{to the final}} against Chelsea. During the 2008-09 Premier League season, Howard set the club record for most league match clean sheets in a season. Howard started the 2009-10 Premier League season with four consecutive clean sheets, including away to Portsmouth where he helped his team secure a 1-0 win and claimed {{the man of the}} match award for his performance.

5000|$|Because {{the boiling}} point of argon (87.3 K at {{standard}} conditions) lies between that of oxygen (90.2 K) and nitrogen (77.4 K), argon builds up in the lower section of the low pressure column. When argon is produced, a vapor <b>side</b> <b>draw</b> is taken from the low pressure column where the argon concentration is highest. It is sent to another column rectifying the argon to the desired purity from which liquid is returned to the same location in the LP column. Use of modern structured packings which have very low pressure drops enable argon with less than 1 ppm impurities. Though argon is present in less to 1% of the incoming, the air argon column requires {{a significant amount of}} energy due to the high reflux ratio required (about 30) in the argon column. Cooling of the argon column can be supplied from cold expanded rich liquid or by liquid nitrogen.|$|E

50|$|In October 2006 Peter Grant was {{appointed}} manager of Norwich City, leaving {{his position as}} Alan Pardew's assistant manager at West Ham United. On 14 October {{he was in the}} stands to see his new <b>side</b> <b>draw</b> 3-3 with Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road, presided over by caretaker manager Martin Hunter. Grant opted to retain Hunter, but appointed a new assistant manager, Jim Duffy. Hunter eventually left the club in the summer of 2007 to take up a coaching position at Watford. Grant's first signing for Norwich was Jamie Ashdown from Portsmouth on a one-month loan. Grant generally made a good start to his managerial career only losing 2 league games out of his first 6 although this was a heavy 5-0 defeat to Stoke and a defeat to local rivals Ipswich. They did get wins against high flying teams such as Birmingham and Cardiff. However following this City only won once in the league in December and January which put them very close to the relegation zone. At one point City were only three points off the drop zone although two consecutive away wins at relegation rivals Barnsley and Luton all but ended any fears of relegation and City finished the season off in 16th.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years in {{petroleum}} industry the focus of innovation has turned to the increase of energy efficiency and the reduction of carbon dioxide emission. One of the most difficult engineering challenges is the utilization of low temperature process streams (< 180 °C) although the largest part of waste heat has been generated in this segment. Installation of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system to the waste heat source unit is providing an adequate solution for handling of loss energy and yielding “green” electricity for the facility. This system involves the same devices as in the usual steam power plant (a boiler, a work-producing expansion device, a generator, a condenser and a pump). However, for such a system, the working fluid is an organic compound having a lower ebullition temperature than water and allowing reduced evaporating temperatures. The success of this technology is coming from its box module application: a similar ORC system can be used, with little modifications for handling various heat sources. Moreover, unlike the conventional Rankine cycle, local and small scale power generation is made possible by this technology. Today, Organic Rankine Cycles are commercially available even in the MW power range. The object of our examination in this paper is a unit having three technical points for future ORC utilization: i) a small quantity of liquid naphtha <b>side</b> <b>draw</b> at 165 °C; ii) a higher amount of vapor column overhead at 140 °C; iii) a furnace flue gas at 250 °C. We investigated the utilization of these streams in a cascade structure using isopentane as working fluid. Cascade structure has two working fluid cycles: a relatively high pressure (12. 5 bar) for the utilization of higher temperature streams and a relatively low pressure (5. 5 bar) for the utilization of lower temperature level streams. Analysis of the potential of energy saving has been made by supporting the steady-state process flowsheeting and simulation. As the result of this investigation promising results were brought for the industrial scale utilization of cascade ORC system. One can see the dimensions of this system including needed area of heat exchangers, calculated expander performances, efficiency of the system etc...|$|E
