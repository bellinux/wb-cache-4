After losing his hand and defeating Morgan, Guybrush reunites with Elaine on the Jerkbait Islands and is forced {{to work with a}} seemingly reformed LeChuck to obtain the summoning artifacts to help him find La Esponja before poxed pirates do. When Guybrush acquires all three artifacts, stops the poxed pirates, and summons the creatures that will guide him to La Esponja, Guybrush goes off to find the sponge while Elaine stays with LeChuck to help him in returning the Monkeys of Montevideo to their proper habitats.|$|E

However, Heckyl starts to get curious when he realizes that Singe knows more about the Energems than he admits. After the Rangers {{discover}} the location of the Titano Zord, Heckyl demands to know how Singe knew its location, only for <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> flee and return to Earth with the person who hired him named Lord Arcanon. It was Lord Arcanon who hired Sledge to bring him the galaxy's most dangerous monsters to make an army out of them. Arcanon's reign ends with the return of Sledge who destroys his former employer with Snide (who was split from Heckyl) and takes back leadership of his crew.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{believed}} that the first chapter, [...] "Launch of the Screaming Narwhal", was a respectable start to the game. Ryan Scott of GameSpy wrote that the puzzles [...] "generally challenge player just enough without becoming too frustrating", while Eurogamers Kristan Reed stated that their quality was [...] "bang-on time after time". However, criticism was directed toward certain puzzles designs—particularly toward that of one maze puzzle. The writing and story were lauded, with several reviews commending the dialogues humor. Adventure Gamers staff writer Evan Dickens felt that writing did not match up {{to the quality of}} LeChucks Revenge, however. Although the chapters supporting cast was considered weak, critics enjoyed the introduction of de <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> the series. The voicework for the main characters was praised, as was Lands soundtrack. Critics were mostly complimentary toward the episodes graphics, with New Straits Times Bruno Chan and The Sunday Times David Phelan praising the updated interpretation of The Curse of Monkey Islands art style while 1UP.coms Bob Mackey called Guybrush [...] "the most convincingly expressive Telltale character yet"; however, concerns were voiced over erratic graphical quality between characters. The games controls were subject to reproof by a number of reviews; several preferred the keyboard controls over Telltales new [...] "click and drag" [...] system.|$|E

5000|$|While Guybrush and Winslow {{follow the}} creatures, they are intercepted by Morgan again who has {{returned}} to capture Guybrush for De Singe. Before any harm is done however, all three are swallowed by a giant Manatee, which guides them {{to the location of}} the sponge. While in the manatee en route to La Esponja, Guybrush meets an unstable Coronado and collaborates with Morgan, posing as his wife, {{to get out of the}} manatee and obtain the sponge. Even though Morgan falls for Guybrush, she betrays him after he obtains La Esponja and hands him back to De Singe on Flotsam Island. Guybrush is taken away by an angry mob however, and is placed on trial for causing the [...] "Pox of LeChuck", in which Guybrush is able to stall long enough for Elaine, who is deeply infected by the pox, and LeChuck to come to his aid. LeChuck ultimately saves Guybrush by blaming himself for the pox and reveals the Voodoo Lady has been manipulating the events of the whole series for her own agenda. Guybrush is released and is able to amplify the strength of La Esponja, uses it to cure the pox, and kills De <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> save his wife from his experiments.|$|E
40|$|We present Singe, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) {{compiler}} for combustion chemistry that leverages warp specialization to pro-duce {{high performance}} code for GPUs. Instead {{of relying on}} tra-ditional GPU programming models that emphasize data-parallel computations, warp specialization allows compilers like <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> partition computations into sub-computations which are then as-signed to different warps within a thread block. Fine-grain synchro-nization between warps is performed efficiently in hardware using producer-consumer named barriers. Partitioning computations us-ing warp specialization allows <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> deal efficiently with the irregularity in both data access patterns and computation. Further-more, warp-specialized partitioning of computations allows <b>Singe</b> <b>to</b> fit extremely large working sets into on-chip memories. Finally, we describe the architecture and general compilation techniques necessary for constructing a warp-specializing compiler. We show that the warp-specialized code emitted by Singe is up to 3. 75 X faster than previously optimized data-parallel GPU kernels...|$|E
