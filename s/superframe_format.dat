50|$|BIP-8 has no error-correcting functionality: {{like the}} CRC-6 bits in the much older {{extended}} <b>superframe</b> <b>format,</b> it merely provides an approximate method for monitoring link quality {{at the bit}} error level.|$|E
50|$|Line {{signaling}} {{can also}} be conveyed within the channels being supervised, as in the original T1 scheme which used {{one out of every}} eight bits for supervision, or with robbed bits of a <b>superframe</b> <b>format,</b> or as in-band signaling, e.g. as in L1 signaling where 2280 Hz tone pulses are used.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{preferred}} to its predecessor, superframe, because {{it includes a}} cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and 4000 bit/s channel capacity for a data link channel (used to pass out-of-band data between equipment.) It requires less frequent synchronization than the earlier <b>superframe</b> <b>format,</b> and provides on-line, real-time [...] of circuit capability and operating condition.|$|E
30|$|It must {{be pointed}} out that a similar DQ-MAC <b>superframe</b> <b>format</b> {{approach}} using the preamble and the above-depicted FBP have already been proposed by the same authors in [2, 23], though studied in totally different scenarios and conditions. In [2], the DQBAN protocol commitment is to guarantee that all packet transmissions are served within their particular application-dependant quality-of-service requirements (i.e., reliability and message latency), without endangering body sensors battery lifetime within BSNs in medical scenarios. For that purpose, the authors propose a cross-layer fuzzy-logic scheduling algorithm to deal with multiple cross-layer input variables of diverse nature in an independent manner. Note that the introduction of the fuzzy-logic techniques does not change the energy-consumption performance of the depicted protocol [2]. In [23], a preliminary analytical evaluation of the enhanced DQ-MAC protocol is presented under general WSN scenarios in saturation conditions. Though following the same line as [2, 23] in terms of DQ-MAC energy-saving <b>superframe</b> <b>format,</b> this paper aims to analyze the non-saturation DQ-MAC energy-efficiency performance in BSNs, mainly completing the work in [2] in a broadened scenario.|$|E

3000|$|Similar to the 802.15. 4 MAC <b>superframe</b> <b>format,</b> one of {{the main}} uses of the FBP is to {{synchronize}} the attached body sensors to the BAN coordinator. The FBP always contains relevant MAC control information (i.e., corresponding also to the protocol rules), which is essential for the right functioning of all body sensors in the BSN. When a body sensor wishes to transfer data, it first waits for the FBP. After synchronization, it independently actualizes the integer counters, by applying a set of rules that determine its position in the protocol distributed queues, CRQ and DTQ (see Figure 4). At the appropriate time, the body sensor transmits either an access request sequence (ARS), of duration [...]...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are dense {{clusters}} of sensor nodes, {{made up of}} small, intelligent, resource-constrained wireless devices that are deployed to monitor a specific phenomenon in a certain field. The sensor nodes can be constrained by limited power supply, memory capacity and/or processing capabilities, {{which means that the}} design of WSNs requires all algorithms and protocols to be lightweight and efficient, and use as little power as possible. The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol in WSNs, defined by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard, employs the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA-CA) algorithm to control the nodes contending for access to the communication medium. Though the performance of this protocol has been studied extensively, and several improvements to its backoff counter, <b>superframe</b> <b>format</b> and contention-free period (CFP) features have been proposed, very few studies have addressed improving the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) feature. In this thesis, we study the impact of increasing the value of the contention window beyond the standard value of 2, on the performance of the MAC protocol. We propose a semi-persistent MAC protocol that is a hybrid form of 802. 11 and 802. 15. 4, to achieve a favorable performance that can serve a broad range of applications over the IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based WSNs. We build an analytical model of the proposed protocol based on Markov chain modelling and derive the analytical expressions of the performance metrics, which we then validate against the simulation result sets generated by our in-house built simulation framework. We prove analytically that the probability of collision of the semi-persistent MAC is lower than that of the standard protocol. Based on our theoretical and simulated models, we show that incorporating the semi-persistent feature into existing MAC protocols leads to significant improvement of the performance metrics, including the probability of collision, throughput, energy consumption, transmission delay and reliability, particularly for networks with a large number of sensor nodes...|$|E
