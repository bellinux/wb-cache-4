40|$|Key to {{restoring}} sagebrush {{habitat in}} the Great Basin is minimizing wildfire and promoting ecosystem resiliency. Land managers use {{methods such as}} fuel reduction treatments and creation of fuel breaks to decrease fire risk and promote perennial dominated landscapes. Mastication (mechanical shredding) of pinyon and juniper has become an important tool for restoring sagebrush habitat throughout Utah’s West Desert. Benefits of mastication include ease of implementation, shrub retention, erosion control, and providing safe sites for seed germination and establishment. Achieving the goal of restoring ecological resiliency requires increasing perennial grass and forb cover. Ironically, this increase in fine fuels combined with masticated debris can actually increase the flammability of a site. When fire does occur within masticated treatments, however, fire behavior is modified and intensity is often decreased relative to adjacent untreated sites. Over time, the masticated debris will eventually break down. But in the short term, in some especially fire prone areas, prescribed burning of <b>shredded</b> <b>material</b> is an option to remove the fuel load while keeping the sagebrush component intact...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{management}} {{often involves}} shredding {{to dispose of}} cut plant material or to destroy the vegetation itself. In the case of invasive plants, this can represent an environmental risk if the <b>shredded</b> <b>material</b> exhibits vegetative regeneration capacities. We tested the effect of shredding on aboveground and below-ground vegetative material of five ornamental widespread invaders in Western Europe {{that are likely to}} be managed by cutting and shredding techniques: Buddleja davidii (butterfly bush, Scrophulariaceae), Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed, Polygonaceae), Spiraea x billardii He´rincq (Billard’s bridewort, Rosaceae), Solidago gigantea (giant goldenrod, Asteraceae), and Rhus typhina L. (staghorn sumac, Anacardiaceae). We looked at signs of vegetative regeneration and biomass production, and analyzed the data with respect to the season of plant cutting (spring vs summer), the type of plant material (aboveground vs below-ground), and the shredding treatment (shredded vs control). All species were capable of vegetative regeneration, especially the belowground material. We found differences among species, but the regeneration potential was generally still present after shredding despite a reduction of growth rates. Although it should not be excluded in all cases (e. g., destruction of giant goldenrod and staghorn sumac aboveground material), the use of a shredder to destroy woody alien plant material cannot be considered as a general management option without significant environmental risk.

40|$|A {{leachate}} {{ion conductivity}} {{test was used}} to evaluate the activity access of mechanically processed whole-plant corn and corn stover. The test procedure was refined with regard to material loading and incubation time to yield a rapid (10 minutes) procedure for detecting differences among mechanical treatments. Conductivity increased with material loading and showed only limited saturation at loadings up to 0. 108 g sample/mL water; however, low sample bulk density limited practical material loading to 0. 042 g sample/mL water when using unground samples (which had particles larger than 19 mm). Abrasive cyclone milling with a 1 mm screen produced small enough particles to achieve near ultimate conductivity with less than 6 h of incubation. Conductivity of leachate from biomass processed with different mechanical treatments was divided by the conductivity of leachate from cyclone milled biomass to compute an index (0 to 1 scale) which normalizes results for actual chemical composition and indicates access to plant constituents in the processed biomass. Limited data suggests that conductivity index may be related to glucose conversion during enzyme hydrolysis. ^ A prototype linear shredder was used to shred rehydrated dry corn stover; shredding energy and the activity access of the <b>shredded</b> <b>material</b> were recorded.

40|$|Agricultural {{residues}} {{represent an}} important source of biomass for energy. Among the available biomass suitable for energy and available in Italy, pruning represents about the 20 % of the total. About 1. 184 million of hectares are planted with olive trees; the pruning residues coming from these plantations represent a wide source of biomass at National level. The authors tested six commercial pruning harvesters to determine harvesting losses and product contamination when recovering pruning residues. All harvesters used a mechanical pick-up to collect the residues and a shredder to reduce them into chips. Three different pick-up settings were tested and namely: 1 cm above ground level, manufacturer’s specification and 3 cm above ground level. Ash content in the <b>shredded</b> <b>material</b> was taken as a measure of contamination: the uncontaminated branch material collected directly from the trees had a value of 3. 5 %, whereas in shredded residues varied between 4. 5 % and over 5. 5 %, for the shortest and the longest distance between the pick-up and the soil surface, respectively. Harvesting losses were slightly, but significantly, related to pick-up setting, and mainly depended on machine type.

40|$|Corona {{electrostatic}} separation (CES) {{is a process}} that separates conductive from non-conductive particles in recycling streams. Its range of application, specifically dedicated to the treatment of small particles (typically below 2 mm), makes it suitable for the mechanical separation of complex <b>shredded</b> <b>material</b> matrices, e. g. printed circuit boards or other waste electrical and electronic equipment. Therefore, a numerical model of this type would be useful for further optimization of machine parameters {{as a function of the}} input stream. In the literature, several attempts have been made to simulate particle trajectories in roll-type electrostatic separators. Although existing models are accurate in the simulation of the trajectories of single metal particles, they are not suitable to simulate the trajectories of a mixture of metal and plastic particles. In addition, they neglect particle-particle interactions and collisions. However, in real corona {{electrostatic separation}} systems, the quality of the separation is affected by the occurrence of impacts between particles, which increases the variability in the particle throws. Therefore, this limitation mines the applicability of existing models in an industrial settings. A more realistic model of CES is therefore needed to better capture the real behavior of the system and to provide a more accurate performance analysis of CES processes.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The need {{to develop}} {{recycling}} solutions for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites has been well established. However, recycled composites remain inferior to composites fabricated with virgin fibers for several reasons. Realistically, recycled composites {{can be expected to}} achieve comparable performance to sheet molding compounds fabricated with virgin fibers if fiber volume fractions can be improved without significantly reducing fiber length. One possible way to achieve this is to fabricate laminates with flakes of cured CFRP. The goal of this research was to investigate the effect of flake geometry on the properties of recycled flake reinforced composites, and to evaluate whether fabricating recycled laminates with CFRP flakes may become a viable alternative to current CFRP recycling techniques. This was accomplished by fabricating and mechanically testing several composite laminates with either shredded flake or single ply flake reinforcement. The <b>shredded</b> <b>material</b> was provided as-shredded by The Boeing Company, and no further processing of the flakes was done prior to resin infusion. The single ply flakes were cured in individual sheets and cut into flakes of different geometries. This flake system was chosen to simulate cured prepreg scrap or delaminated CFRP recyclate, and to provide a well-controlled material system for studying the effects of flake geometry on the properties of flake reinforced composites. The aspect ratio of the singe ply flakes was varied between 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 while either flake area or flake length was held constant.
