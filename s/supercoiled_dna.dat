2500|$|An old {{standing}} dynamic {{problem is}} how DNA [...] "self-replication" [...] {{takes place in}} living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated biopolymer molecules called fibers or chains (that are made of repeating nucleotide units of four basic types, attached to deoxyribose and phosphate groups), its molecular structure in vivo undergoes dynamic configuration changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions. Supercoiling, packing with histones in chromosome structures, and other such supramolecular aspects also involve [...] in vivo DNA topology which is even more complex than DNA molecular geometry, thus turning molecular modeling of DNA into an especially challenging problem for both molecular biologists and biotechnologists. Like other large molecules and biopolymers, DNA often exists in multiple stable geometries (that is, it exhibits conformational isomerism) and configurational, quantum states which are {{close to each other}} in energy on the potential energy surface of the DNA molecule.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{represents}} a promising therapeutic and prophylactic macromolecule in treating genetic diseases, infectious diseases and cancers. The therapeutic potential of DNA {{is directly related}} to how DNA transports within the targeted tissue. In this study, fluorescence photobleaching recovery was used to examine the diffusion of plasmid DNAs with various size (2. 7 ∼ 8. 3 kb), topology, and in the presence of transfection reagents in mucus. We observed that DNAs diffused slower when size of <b>DNAs</b> increased; <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNAs</b> diffused faster than linear ones; mucus did not reduce the diffusion of linear DNAs but retarded the diffusion of <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Diffusion data were fitted to models of a polymer chain diffusing in gel systems. Diffusion of linear DNAs in mucus were better described by the Zimm model with a scaling factor of − 0. 8, and <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNAs</b> showed a reptational behavior with a scaling factor of − 1. 3. Based on the Zimm model, the pore size of bovine mucus was estimated and agreed well with previous experimental data. In the presence of transfection reagents, e. g., liposomes, the diffusion of DNAs increased by a factor of 2 in mucus. By using bovine mucus as a model system, this work suggests that DNA size, topology, and the presence of transfection reagents may affect the diffusion of DNA in tissues, and thus the therapeutic effects of DNA...|$|R
5000|$|The {{conformation}} of the DNA molecule {{can significantly}} affect {{the movement of}} the DNA, for example, <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact. In a normal plasmid DNA preparation, multiple forms of DNA may be present, and gel from the electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show a main band which would be the negatively supercoiled form, while other forms of DNA may appear as minor fainter bands. These minor bands may be nicked DNA (open circular form) and the relaxed closed circular form which normally run slower than <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA,</b> and the single-stranded form (which can sometimes appear depending on the preparation methods) may move ahead of the <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA.</b> The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions, for example linear DNA may run faster or slower than <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> depending on conditions, and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel. [...] Unless <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> markers are used, the size of a circular DNA like plasmid therefore may be more accurately gauged after it has been linearized by restriction digest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> forms two structures; a plectoneme or a toroid, or a {{combination}} of both. A negatively <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule will produce either a one-start left-handed helix, the toroid, or a two-start right-handed helix with terminal loops, the plectoneme. Plectonemes are typically more common in nature, and this is the shape most bacterial plasmids will take. For larger molecules it is common for hybrid structures to form - a loop on a toroid can extend into a plectoneme. If all the loops on a toroid extend then it becomes a branch point in the plectonemic structure. DNA supercoiling is important for DNA packaging within all cells, and seems to also play a role in gene expression.|$|E

40|$|As DNA gyrase is {{the only}} enzyme to <b>supercoil</b> <b>DNA</b> actively, we address here the {{question}} of whether it does play the expected dominant role in controlling the level of <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> and growth rate in Escherichia coli. We modulated the expression of DNA gyrase around its wild-type level, and measured the effect on plasmid supercoiling and growth rate. As both the activity and the transcription rate of DNA gyrase are sensitive to <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> we distinguish two types of control (with control defined as the percentage change observed on a 1 % modulation of a parameter). The first type of control, here named inherent control, quantifies the effect of a sustained modulation of the transcription rate of gyrase. At its wild-type expression level this inherent control exerted by DNA gyrase on growth rate was very low, i. e. c(μ) (gyrase) = 0. 05 - 0. 00, as was the inherent control on <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling,</b> c(aLk) (gyrase) = 0. 2. The second type of control, here named global control, quantifies the effect of a change in gyrase activity whilst allowing the cell to respond by readjusting gyrase transcription. Both types of control are linked via the sensitivity of gyrase transcription to <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling,</b> as determined from the inherent control by gyrase of the gyrase promoter activity using a chromosomal gyrB::lacZ fusion. As expected, the latter control was negative, but small, i. e. c(gyr promoter) (gyrase) = - 0. 3. The global control by gyrase of active linking number was 0. 1. These results show that although gyrase is an essential enzyme it does not have a high control, on either growth rate or <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling.</b> Homeostatic regulation of physiological DNA structure appears to dominate. At low degrees of <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling,</b> the control by DNA gyrase and by the other topoisomerases is much stronger...|$|R

50|$|Topologically linked {{circular}} molecules, aka catenanes, adopt {{a positive}} supercoiled form {{during the process}} of replication of circular plasmids. The unlinking of catenanes is performed by type IIA topoisomerase, which was recently found to be more efficient unlinking positive supercoiled DNA.The conformational properties of negative vs. positive supercoiled catenanes affects their features in respect to their corresponding enzymatic reaction catalyzed by topoisomerases. Experiments have demonstrated that positive <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> provides a sharp DNA bend in the first bound DNA segment, which allows the topoisomerase to bind successfully and therefore carry on its enzymatic reaction to the following segment in an specific inside-to-outside matter. In the other hand, negative <b>supercoiled</b> <b>DNA</b> does not provide such bend and the access of the enzyme to the first segment is nearly impossible, therefore inhibiting unlinking.|$|E

40|$|Bacteria {{frequently}} possess two type IIA DNA topoisomerases, gyrase and topo IV, which maintain chromosome topology by variously supercoiling, relaxing, and disentangling DNA. DNA {{recognition and}} functional output {{is thought to}} be controlled by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the topoisomerase DNA binding subunit (GyrA/ParC). The deeply rooted organism Aquifex aeolicus encodes one type IIA topoisomerase conflictingly categorized as either DNA gyrase or topo IV. To resolve this enzyme’s catalytic properties and heritage, we conducted a series of structural and biochemical studies on the isolated GyrA/ParC CTD and the holoenzyme. Whereas the CTD displays a global structure similar to that seen in bone fide GyrA and ParC paralogs, it lacks a key functional motif (the “GyrA-box”) and fails to wrap DNA. Biochemical assays show that the A. aeolicus topoisomerase cannot <b>supercoil</b> <b>DNA,</b> but robustly removes <b>supercoils</b> and decatenates <b>DNA,</b> two hallmark activities of topo IV. Despite these properties, phylogenetic analyses place all functional domains except the CTD squarely within a gyrase lineage, and the A. aeolicus GyrB subunit is capable of supporting supercoiling with Escherichia coli GyrA, but not DNA relaxation with E. coli ParC. Moreover, swapping the A. aeolicus GyrA/ParC CTD with the GyrA CTD from Thermotoga maritima creates an enzyme that negatively <b>supercoils</b> <b>DNA.</b> These findings identify A. aeolicus as the first bacterial species yet found to exist without a functional gyrase, and suggest an evolutionary path for generation of bacterial type IIA paralogs...|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} utilises {{the inherent}} biological activity of DNA topoisomerase I.

40|$|A {{principle}} {{challenge of}} modern biology {{is to understand}} how the human genome is organised and regulated within a nucleus. The field of chromatin biology has made significant progress in characterising how protein and DNA modifications reflect transcription and replication state. Recently our lab has shown that the human genome is organised into large domains of altered DNA helical twist, called <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> domains, similar to the regulatory domains observed in prokaryotes. In my PhD I have analysed how the maintenance and distribution of <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> relates to biological function in human cells. <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> domains are set up and maintained by the balanced activity of RNA transcription and topoisomerase enzymes. RNA polymerase twists the DNA, over-winding in front of the polymerase and under-winding behind. In contrast topoisomerases relieve supercoiling from the genome by introducing transient nicks (topoisomerase I) or double strand breaks (topoisomerase II) into the double helix. Topoisomerase activity is critical for cell viability, but the distribution of topoisomerase I, IIα and IIβ in the human genome is not known. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach I have shown that topoisomerases are enriched in large chromosomal domains, with distinct topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II domains. Topoisomerase I is correlated with RNA polymerase II, genes and underwound DNA, whereas topoisomerase IIα and IIβ are associated with each other and over-wound DNA. This indicates that different topoisomerase proteins operate in distinct regions of the genome and can be independently regulated depending on the genomic environment. Transcriptional regulation by <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> is believed to occur through changes in gene promoter structure. To investigate <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> my lab has developed biotinylated trimethylpsoralen (bTMP) as a DNA structure probe, which preferentially intercalates into under-wound DNA. Using bTMP in conjunction with microarrays my lab identified a transcription and topoisomerase dependent peak of under-wound DNA in a meta-analysis of several hundred genes (Naughton et al. (2013)). In a similar analysis, Kouzine et al. (2013) identified an under-wound promoter structure and proposed a model of topoisomerase distribution for the regulation of promoter <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling.</b> To better understand the role of supercoiling and topoisomerases at gene promoters, a much larger-scale analysis of these factors was required. I have analysed the distribution of bTMP at promoters genome wide, confirming a transcription and expression dependent distribution of <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoils.</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> is distinct at CpG island and non-CpG island promoters, and I present a model in which over-wound DNA limits transcription from both CpG island promoters and repressed genes. In addition, I have mapped by ChIP topoisomerase I and IIβ at gene promoters on chromosome 11 and identified a different distribution to that proposed by Kouzine et al. (2013), with topoisomerase I maintaining <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> at highly expressed genes. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> at promoters and identifies the relationship between supercoiling, topoisomerase distribution and gene expression. In addition to regulating transcription, <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> and topoisomerases are important for genome stability. Several studies have suggested a link between <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> and instability at common fragile sites (CFSs), which are normal structures in the genome that frequently break under replication stress and cancer. bTMP was used to measure <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> across FRA 3 B and FRA 16 D CFSs, identifying a transition to a more over-wound DNA structure under conditions that induce chromosome fragility at these regions. Furthermore, topoisomerase I, IIα and IIβ showed a pronounced depletion {{in the vicinity of the}} FRA 3 B and FRA 16 D CFSs. This provides the first experimental evidence of a role for <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> in fragile site formation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{detecting}} sequence defects by <b>supercoiling</b> <b>DNA</b> with magnetic tweezers. The method is sensitive to a single mismatched base pair in a DNA sequence of several thousand base pairs. We systematically compare DNA molecules with 0 to 16 adjacent mismatches at 1 M monovalent salt and 3. 5 pN force and show that, under these conditions, a single plectoneme forms and is stably pinned at the defect. We use these measurements to estimate the energy and degree of end-loop kinking at defects. From this, we calculate the relative probability of plectoneme pinning at the mismatch under physiologically relevant conditions. Based on this estimate, we propose that <b>DNA</b> <b>supercoiling</b> could contribute to mismatch and damage sensing in vivo...|$|R
