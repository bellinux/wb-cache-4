40|$|Multiplex genome {{engineering}} is a standalone recombineering tool for large-scale programming and accelerated evolution of cells. However, this advanced genome engineering technique {{has been limited}} to use in selected bacterial strains. We developed a simple and effective strain-independent method for effective genome engineering in Escherichia coli. The method involves introducing a <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> carrying the l Red recombination system into the mutS gene. The <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> can be excised from the chromosome via selection {{in the absence of}} antibiotics, thus allowing transient inactivation of the mismatch repair system during genome engineering. In addition, we developed another <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> that enables integration of large DNA fragments into the lacZ genomic locus.

40|$|Allelic {{exchange}} experiments allow {{investigation of}} the functions of many unknown genes identified during the sequencing of entire genomes. Isogenic strains differing by only specific mutations can be constructed. Among other tools, suicide plasmids are widely used for this task. They present many advantages because they leave no scars on the chromosome, and therefore allow combining several mutations in the same genetic background. While using the previously described pCVD 442 <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> [Infect. Immun. 59 (1991) 4310], we found untargeted recombination events due {{to the presence of}} an IS 1 element on this plasmid. The plasmid was therefore improved by removal of the IS 1 element. We also replaced the bla gene of pCVD 442, conferring ampicillin resistance, by the cat gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance, leading to the new <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> pDS 132. The plasmid was entirely sequenced. We demonstrate that this new vector can be easily used to introduce various types of mutations into different genetics backgrounds: removal of IS elements, introduction of point mutations or deletions. It can be introduced into bacterial strains by either transformation or conjugation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We have {{established}} a transposon mutagenesis procedure for the moderate halophile Halomonas eurihalina, a bacteria that produces an exopolysaccharide (EPS) of considerable biotechnological interest. We used <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> pUT and pSUP 102 to introduce the transposons mini-Tn 5 and Tn 1732 into H. eurihalina via Escherichia coli mediated conjugation. Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated that insertions of the transposon mini-Tn 5 into H. eurihalina occurred randomly at single sites in the chromosome, whereas Tn 1732 insertion also took place at random, but simultaneously, at several sites. Phenotypic analysis revealed that different mutants were generated by using mini-Tn 5. The isolation of exopolysaccharide-defective strains is the first stage towards carrying out genetic studies on EPS production by this microorganism. © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Efflux by RND-type {{transporters}} {{is known}} to confer resistance to tigecycline in several Enterobacteriaceae species and we examined the potential of this mechanism in Serratia marcescens using a clinical isolate and laboratory-selected mutants. Methods Expression of RND-type efflux pump genes was analysed by real-time RT–PCR. Laboratory mutants were selected by exposure to either tigecycline or tetracycline in vitro. Efflux pump genes were inactivated by <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing the R 6 K? origin of replication. Results Higher tigecycline MICs correlated with elevated expression of the RND-type efflux pump genes sdeXY. Inactivation of sdeY or the outer membrane component gene hasF reduced MICs of tigecycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and cefpirome to below those for strain NCTC 10211. A tetracycline-selected laboratory mutant also showed increases in sdeXY expression and tigecycline MIC. Conclusions Up-regulation of endogenous SdeXY–HasF-mediated efflux is associated with tigecycline resistance in S. marcescens along with MIC rises for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and cefpirome.

40|$|In {{the last}} two years of this research, the most {{exciting}} results have come from the work on the genetics of methanococci. First, the author demonstrated that the cryptic plasmid from Methanococcus maripaludis C 5, pURB 500, could be transformed into Methanococcus maripaludis JJ. Strain JJ is the type strain of M. maripaludis and has only about 65 % DNA:DNA hybridization to strain C 5. Because of the low relatedness of these strains, it was not obvious that pURB 500 could be transferred between them. This goal was achieved by first transforming strain C 5 with a series of <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing the pac cassette, which possessed the selectable puromycin resistance marker, and different cloned fragments of pURB 500. From the puromycin-resistant transformants, a plasmid was isolated that transformed strain JJ. However, when this plasmid was electroporated into E. coli, only rearrangement products were obtained that contained small portions of the original pURB 500. These plasmids no longer transformed Methanococcus. While these experiments did not yield a shuttle vector, they demonstrated that pURB 500 could replicate in strain JJ...|$|R

40|$|To {{construct}} Thiobacillus ferrooxidans mutants by marker exchange mutagenesis, {{a genetic}} transfer system is required. The transfer of broad-host-range plasmids {{belonging to the}} incompatibility groups IncQ (pKT 240 and pJRD 215), IncP (pJB 3 Km 1), and IncW (pUFR 034) from Escherichia coli to two private T. ferrooxidans strains (BRGM 1 and Tf- 49) and to two collection strains (ATCC 33020 and ATCC 19859) by conjugation was analyzed. To knock out the T. ferrooxidans recA gene, a mobilizable <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> carrying the ATCC 33020 recA gene disrupted by a kanamycin resistance gene was transferred from E. coli to T. ferrooxidans ATCC 33020 by conjugation under the best conditions determined. The two kanamycin-resistant clones, which have retained the kanamycin-resistant phenotype after growth for several generations in nonselective medium, were shown to have the kanamycin resistance gene inserted within the recA gene, indicating that the recA::Ω-Km mutated allele was transferred from the <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> to the chromosome by homologous recombination. These mutants exhibited a slightly reduced growth rate and an increased sensitivity to UV and γ irradiation compared to the wild-type strain.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{insertion sequence}} IS 21 when repeated in tandem efficiently promotes non-replicative cointegrate formation in Escherichia coli. An IS 21 -IS 21 junction region {{which had been}} engineered to contain unique SalI and BglII sites close to the IS 21 termini was not affected {{in the ability to}} form cointegrates with target plasmids. Based on this finding, a novel procedure of random linker insertion mutagenesis was devised. <b>Suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing the engineered junction region (pME 5 and pME 6) formed cointegrates with target plasmids in an E. coli host strain expressing the IS 21 transposition proteins in trans. Cointegrates were resolved in vitro by restriction with SalI or BglII and ligation; thus, insertions of four or 11 codons, respectively, were created in the target DNA, practically at random. The cloned Pseudomonas aeruginosa arcB gene encoding catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase was used as a target. Of 20 different four-codon insertions in arcB, 11 inactivated the enzyme. Among the remaining nine insertion mutants which retained enzyme activity, three enzyme variants had reduced affinity for the substrate ornithine and one had lost recognition of the allosteric activator AMP.

Subcloning and sequencing experiments {{showed that a}} 2, 124 -bp DNA fragment containing the rmlD and wbbL genes {{was responsible for the}} observed phenotypes. On the basis of amino acid similarity, we suggest that the 288 -residue RmlD protein is a dTDP-L-rhamnose synthase. Plasmid pJT 102, containing only the wbbL gene, was able to induce O 16 -antigen production and serum resistance in E. coli DH 5 alpha.

40|$|A {{spontaneous}} rpsL mutant of Thermus thermophilus {{was isolated}} {{in a search}} for new selection markers for this organism. This new allele, named rpsL 1, encodes a K 47 R/K 57 E double mutant S 12 ribosomal protein that confers a streptomycin-dependent (SD) phenotype to T. thermophilus. Models built on the available three-dimensional structures of the 30 S ribosomal subunit revealed that the K 47 R mutation directly affects the streptomycin binding site on S 12, whereas the K 57 E does not apparently affect this binding site. Either of the two mutations conferred the SD phenotype individually. The presence of the rpsL 1 allele, either as a single copy inserted into the chromosome as part of <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> or in multicopy as replicative plasmids, produced a dominant SD phenotype despite the presence of a wild-type rpsL gene in a host strain. This dominant character allowed us to use the rpsL 1 allele not only for positive selection of plasmids to complement a kanamycin-resistant mutant strain, but also more specifically for the isolation of deletion mutants through a single step of negative selection on streptomycin-free growth medium.

40|$|Abstract only availablePink-pigmented {{commensal}} bacteria, Methylobacterium spp. are facultative methylotrophs (i. e. they utilize methanol, {{but they}} can also use other carbon compounds) commonly referred to as PPFMs. PPFMs associate with seeds and other tissues of soybean and other plants and have been shown by the Polacco lab, and others, to stimulate germination. We tested the hypothesis that germination stimulation was due to production of nitric oxide (NO). One possible source of NO in plants and bacteria is nitrate reductase (NR) which can reduce nitrite (not its "normal" substrate) to NO. M. extorquens AM 1 has two forms of nitrate reductase. The first, encoded by the nap gene, is the periplasmic form. The nar gene encodes the respiratory membrane-bound form. Primers were designed to amplify internal fragments of the two nitrate reductase genes, NR 1404 (nap) and NR 1537 (nar). These fragments were then cloned into a suicide vector (pAYC 61), which allows for insertional disruption of the endogenous, nitrate reductase genes. The suicide vector contains a sequence that encodes resistance to tetracycline (tetR). Tri-parental mating was performed among an E. coli strain carrying a mobilization helper plasmid, pRK 2013, an E. coli donor strain carrying the <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid,</b> and the recipient PPFM strain.

Genetic analysis of {{magnetotactic bacteria}} has remained difficult and requires the development of novel tools. We established a Cre-lox-based deletion method which allows the excision of large genomic fragments in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense. Two conjugative <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> harboring lox sites that flanked the target region were subsequently inserted into the chromosome by homologous recombination, requiring only one single-crossover event, respectively, and resulting in a double cointegrate. Excision of the targeted chromosomal segment that included the inserted plasmids and their resistance markers was induced by trans expression of Cre recombinase, which leaves behind a scar of only a single loxP site. The Cre helper plasmid was then cured from the deletant strain by relief of antibiotic selection. We have used this method for the deletion of 16. 3 -kb, 61 -kb, and 67. 3 -kb fragments from the genomic MAI, either in a single round or in subsequent rounds of deletion, covering a region of approximately 87 kb that comprises the mamAB, mms 6, and mamGFDC operons. As expected, all mutants were Mag− and some were Mot−; otherwise, they showed normal growth patterns, which indicates that the deleted region is not essential for viability in the laboratory.

Using a reporter strain synthesizing the nonpartner kinase VanS under tight arabinose control and carrying a promoter-lacZ fusion activated by phospho-PhoB, we isolated altered recognition (AR) mutants of PhoB showing enhanced activation (phosphorylation) by VanS as arabinose-dependent Lac+ mutants. Changes in the PhoBAR mutants cluster in a “patch” near the proposed helix 4 of PhoB based on the CheY crystal structure (a homolog of the PhoB receiver domain) providing further evidence that helix 4 lies in the kinase-regulator interface. Based on the CheY structure, one mutant has an additional change in a region that may propagate a conformational change to helix 4.

40|$|Studies of {{microorganisms}} are often hindered {{by a lack}} of effective genetic tools. One such example is Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including those causing periodontal disease and preterm birth. The first double-crossover allelic-exchange mutant in F. nucleatum was recently constructed using sonoporation, a novel ultrasound-mediated intracellular delivery method, demonstrating potential for bacterial gene transfection. To better unveil its mechanism, the current study examines the factors affecting the outcome of sonoporation. Delivery of Texas Red-conjugated dextran into F. nucleatum by sonoporation was at least twice as efficient as that by electroporation, and sonoporation was nonbactericidal, unlike electroporation. The delivery efficiency was affected by the acoustic pressure amplitude, the duty cycle, and the quantity of microbubbles used to initiate cavitation but not by the pulse repetition frequency of ultrasound application. To examine the involvement of homologous recombination in sonoporation-mediated mutant construction, the highly conserved recA gene, which carried most of the consensus residues, including the P loop, was identified in F. nucleatum, and a double-crossover recA mutant of F. nucleatum 12230, US 1610, was constructed by sonoporation. The mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to UV exposure compared with that of the wild type, indicating that the RecA function in F. nucleatum was conserved. Interestingly, US 1610 was also sensitive to ultrasound treatment, suggesting the likely involvement of RecA in postsonoporation repair and survival.

40|$|The {{attachment}} site (attP) of phage #U, a {{lysogenic phage}} of Rhizobium Zeguminosarum biovar trijiolii, was identified on a 6 0 kb EcoRI fragment of the phage DNA. Plasmid pCI 6 was constructed by cloning this EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> vector pSUP 202. Escherichia coli S 17 - 1 harbouring plasmid pC 16 was mated with wild-type R. Zeguminosarum biovar trifolii strain 4 s and its lysogenic strain 4 S(4 U) using tetracycline resistance (Tc') as a selection marker. The Tc ' R. Zeguminosarum biovar trifolii transconjugants appeared at high frequency (10 - 3 - 10 - 4 per recipient cell in both matings). Southern hybridization with the attP fragment and pSUP 202 as probes indicated that plasmid pCI 6 {{integrated into the}} chromosome of all these transconjugants {{in the same manner}} as phage #U...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Cytotoxin-associated protein (antigen) A (CagA) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) pathogenesis. Our aim was to obtain cagA- mutant strains by a new mutation method so as to better understand the mechanism of CagA in epithelial cells. METHODS: In contrast with the traditional method using <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid,</b> we constructed cagA – mutant strains directly with PCR products. The constructed mutant clones grew on selective media and allelic exchange was confirmed by Southern blot. Furthermore, two different transformation methods, electroporation, and natural transformation, were compared with regard to the efficiency of recombination. RESULTS: The mutation by PCR products could be completed within 3 - 5 d, and the recombination rate by electroporation and natural transformation was 4. 02 × 10 - 8 and 1. 03 × 10 - 9 respectively. Mutation rate by electroporation (4. 02 × 10 - 8) was far higher than by natural transformatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} of transposon mutagenesis involving {{the use of}} Tn 5 on a <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmid</b> was developed for Proteus mirabilis. Analysis of the resulting exconjugants indicated that Tn 5 transposed in P. mirabilis at a frequency of ca. 4. 5 x 10 (- 6) per recipient cell. The resulting mutants were stable and retained the transposon-encoded antibiotic resistance when incubated for several generations under nonselective conditions. The frequency of auxotrophic mutants in the population, as well as DNA-DNA hybridizaiton to transposon sequences, confirmed that the insertion of the transposon was random and the Proteus chromosome did not contain significant insertional hot spots of transposition. Approximately 35 % of the mutants analyzed possessed plasmid-acquired ampicillin resistance, although no extrachromosomal plasmid DNA was found. In these mutants, insertion of the Tn 5 element and a part {{or all of the}} plasmid had occurred. Application of this technique to the study of swarmer cell differentiation in P. mirabilis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} an R 6 K-based {{suicide vector}} (pJP 5603) {{that requires a}} trans supply of the pir-encoded π protein of plasmid R 6 K for replication. Therefore, efficient <b>plasmid</b> <b>suicide</b> results upon transfer to bacteria not harbouring pir. The 3. 1 -kb vector encodes kanamycin resistance and is mobilizable. When {{used in conjunction with}} a JM 109 strain carrying pir, it has nine unique restriction sites available for α-complementation cloning. Vector functionality was demonstrated in Rhodobacter sphaeroides...|$|R
40|$|The Tn 5 tac 1 {{transposon}} {{contains a}} strong outward-facing promoter, Ptac, a lacI repressor gene, and a selectable Kanr gene. Transcription from Ptac is repressed by the lacI protein unless an inducer (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside [IPTG]) is present. Thus, Tn 5 tac 1 generates insertion mutations in Escherichia coli with conditional phenotypes {{because it is}} polar on distal gene expression when IPTG is absent and directs transcription of these genes when the inducer is present. To test the usefulness of Tn 5 tac 1 in Bordetella pertussis, a nonenteric gram-negative bacterial pathogen, we chose the bifunctional adenylate cyclase-hemolysin determinant as an easily scored marker to monitor insertional mutagenesis. Tn 5 tac 1 delivered to B. pertussis on conjugal <b>suicide</b> <b>plasmids</b> resulted in Kanr exconjugants at a frequency of 10 (- 3) per donor cell, and nonhemolytic (Hly-) mutants were found among the Kanr colonies at a frequency of about 1 %. Of eight independent Kanr Hly- mutants, two were conditional and exhibited an Hly+ phenotype only {{in the presence of}} IPTG. Using a new quantitative assay for adenylate cyclase based on high-pressure liquid chromatography, we found that enzymatic activity in these two strains was specifically induced at least 500 -fold in a dose-dependent fashion over the range of 0 to 125 microM IPTG. These data show that Ptac serves as a promoter, lacI is expressed and is functional, and IPTG can induce Ptac transcription in B. pertussis. Adenylate cyclase expression in whole cells, culture supernatants, and cell extracts from these strains depended upon IPTG, suggesting that the insertions do not merely alter secretion of adenylate cyclase-hemolysin. Other virulence determinants under control of the vir locus are expressed normally, implying that these Tn 5 tac 1 insertions specifically regulate adenylate cyclase-hemolysin expression. We conclude that Tn 5 tac 1 insertion mutations permit sensitive, exogenous control over the expression of genes of interest, providing a useful tool for studying virulence and other important traits of diverse bacterial species...|$|R
40|$|When {{inactivation}} of {{the cell}} division gene ftsZ was attempted in the Pleurocapsalean cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis CCMEE 029 via homologous recombination by using a both-ends truncated ftsZ fragment cloned into the <b>suicide</b> mobilizable <b>plasmid</b> pRL 271, the scored transconjugants invariably died upon restreaking. The integration of plasmid pRL 271 -FZ into the transconjugants genome by single crossover events, leading to the generation of two mutated copies of ftsZ, characterized by whole plasmid in-between, was assessed by colony PCR. Heteroplasmic ftsZ mutants occurred mostly as cell aggregations, lacking the regularity of successive division planes. Their aberrant topology was resolved by electron transmission microscopy as resulting from the irregular clustering of distinct aggregates. These results suggested that FtsZ is essential in this cyanobacterium able of binary and multiple division and that its partial inactivation results in an impaired coordination {{in time and space}} of successive divisions undertaken by single cells...|$|R
