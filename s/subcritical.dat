The station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems, including selective catalytic reduction, to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas desulphurisation, to remove sulphur dioxide. The station would also have been able to allow the installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a <b>subcritical</b> amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a <b>subcritical</b> sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E

25|$|Critical fission {{reactors}} are {{the most}} common type of nuclear reactor. In a critical fission reactor, neutrons produced by fission of fuel atoms are used to induce yet more fissions, to sustain a controllable amount of energy release. Devices that produce engineered but non-self-sustaining fission reactions are <b>subcritical</b> fission reactors. Such devices use radioactive decay or particle accelerators to trigger fissions.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} five reactor units, reactor 3 ran on mixed core, {{containing}} both uranium fuel and mixed uranium and plutonium oxide, or MOX fuel (with the core comprising ~6% MOX fuel), during a loss of cooling accident in a <b>subcritical</b> reactor MOX fuel will not behave differently from UOX fuel. The key difference between plutonium-239 and uranium-235 is that plutonium emits fewer delayed neutrons than uranium when it undergoes fission.|$|E
25|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} of a {{coal-fired power plant}} also reduces emissions. For example, emissions can be reduced by upgrading existing plants or building new high-efficiency, low-emissions plants. Such plants emit almost 20% less CO2 than a <b>subcritical</b> unit operating at a similar load. Over the longer term, HELE plants can further facilitate emission reductions because coal-fired plants operating at the highest efficiencies are also the most appropriate option for {{carbon capture and storage}} retrofit.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{concepts}} rely on {{a negative}} temperature coefficient of reactivity and a large possible temperature rise to limit reactivity excursions. As an additional method for shutdown, a separate, passively cooled container below the reactor can be included. In case of problems and for regular maintenance the fuel is drained from the reactor. This stops the nuclear reaction and acts as another second cooling system. Neutron-producing accelerators have been proposed for some super-safe <b>subcritical</b> experimental designs.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{proposals}} for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful or shorter-lived, nuclear waste. In particular, the Integral Fast Reactor was a proposed nuclear reactor {{with a nuclear}} fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests, but was then canceled by the US Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate <b>subcritical</b> reactors to the transmutation of the left-over transuranic elements.|$|E
25|$|Shock waves {{can also}} occur in rapid flows of dense {{granular}} materials down inclined channels or slopes. Strong shocks in rapid dense granular flows {{can be studied}} theoretically and analyzed to compare with experimental data. Consider a configuration in which the rapidly moving material down the chute impinges on an obstruction wall erected perpendicular {{at the end of}} a long and steep channel. Impact leads to a sudden change in the flow regime from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap. This flow configuration is particularly interesting because it is analogous to some hydraulic and aerodynamic situations associated with flow regime changes from supercritical to <b>subcritical</b> flows.|$|E
25|$|The Rankine {{cycle is}} the most basic {{thermodynamic}} power cycle. The simplest cycle consists of a steam generator, a turbine, a condenser, and a pump. The working fluid is usually water. A Rankine power conversion system coupled to a LFTR {{could take advantage of}} increased steam temperature to improve its thermal efficiency. The <b>subcritical</b> Rankine steam cycle is currently used in commercial power plants, with the newest plants utilizing the higher temperature, higher pressure, supercritical Rankine steam cycles. The work of ORNL from the 1960s and 1970s on the MSBR assumed the use of a standard supercritical steam turbine with an efficiency of 44%, and had done considerable design work on developing molten fluoride salt – steam generators.|$|E
25|$|Fail safe core. LFTRs {{can include}} a freeze plug {{at the bottom}} {{that has to be}} {{actively}} cooled, usually by a small electric fan. If the cooling fails, say because of a power failure, the fan stops, the plug melts, and the fuel drains to a <b>subcritical</b> passively cooled storage facility. This not only stops the reactor, also the storage tank can more easily shed the decay heat from the short-lived radioactive decay of irradiated nuclear fuels. Even {{in the event of a}} major leak from the core such as a pipe breaking, the salt will spill onto the kitchen-sink-shaped room the reactor is in, which will drain the fuel salt by gravity into the passively cooled dump tank.|$|E
25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the inlet's central {{shock cone}} {{served as a}} compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a <b>subcritical</b> inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no longer any {{explosive}} tests of nuclear weapons at the site, there is still <b>subcritical</b> testing, {{used to determine the}} viability of the United States' aging nuclear arsenal. Additionally, the site is the location of the Area5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex, which sorts and stores low-level radioactive waste that is not transuranic and has a half life not longer than 20 years. Bechtel Nevada Corporation (a joint venture of Lockheed Martin, Bechtel, and Johnson Controls) ran this complex until 2006. Several other companies won the bid for the contract since and combined to form a new company called National Security Technologies, LLC (a joint venture of Northrop Grumman, AECOM, CH2M Hill, and Nuclear Fuel Services). AECOM, known earlier as Holmes and Narver, held the Nevada Test Site contract for many years before Bechtel Nevada Corporation had it.|$|E
500|$|The demon core was a [...] <b>subcritical</b> mass of {{plutonium}} measuring [...] in diameter, which {{was involved in}} two criticality accidents. The core was slated {{for use in a}} third World War II nuclear bomb, but remained in use for testing after Japan's surrender. It was designed with a small safety margin to ensure a successful explosion of the bomb. The device briefly went supercritical when it was accidentally placed in supercritical configurations during two separate experiments intended to guarantee the core was indeed close to the critical point. The incidents happened at the Los Alamos laboratory in 1945 and 1946, and resulted in the acute radiation poisoning and subsequent deaths of scientists Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin. After these incidents the spherical plutonium core was referred to as the [...] "demon core".|$|E
500|$|The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using {{plutonium}} {{was agreed}} {{at a meeting}} in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research oriented around the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb. The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional explosive lenses came from James L. Tuck, and was developed by von Neumann. To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston invented exploding-bridgewire detonators to replace the less precise primacord detonation system. Robert Christy is credited with doing the calculations that showed how a solid <b>subcritical</b> sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell. After Christy's report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the [...] "Christy Gadget".|$|E

The <b>subcritical</b> piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb component testing, while Tims and Rats were early <b>subcritical</b> hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In Vixen, an equivalent amount of plutonium fuel was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally. [...] In Kittens, Tims and Rats, smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 1946, {{physicist}} Louis Slotin {{and seven}} other Los Alamos personnel {{were in a}} Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the exact point at which a <b>subcritical</b> mass (core) of fissile material could be made critical by the positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would {{use it in a}} final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core via a thumb hole on the top. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. Allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. Under Slotin's unapproved protocol, the only thing preventing this was the blade of a standard straight screwdriver, manipulated by the scientist's other hand. Slotin, who was given to bravado, became the local expert, performing the test on almost a dozen occasions, often in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots, in front of a roomful of observers. Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be [...] "dead within a year" [...] if they continued performing it. [...] Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".|$|E

2500|$|Since {{mannitol}} {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and <b>subcritical</b> fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or <b>subcritical</b> fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction — [...] CO2 versus [...] ethanol per [...] olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, <b>subcritical</b> water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only [...] water per [...] of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and <b>subcritical</b> extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction.

2500|$|Hydrothermal {{circulation}} occurs {{within the}} Earth's crust wherever fluid becomes heated {{and begins to}} convect.

At mid-ocean ridges, this circulation is most evident by the appearance of hydrothermal vents known as [...] "black smokers". These are large (metres high) chimneys of sulfide and sulfate minerals which vent fluids up to 400°C. The fluids appear like great black billowing clouds of smoke due to the precipitation of dissolved metals in the fluid. It is likely that at depth many of these vent sites reach supercritical conditions, but most cool sufficiently by the time they reach the sea floor to be <b>subcritical.</b> One particular vent site, Turtle Pits, has displayed a brief period of supercriticality at the vent site.

Using the concept of potential energy, equilibrium is defined as a stationary point with respect to the degree(s) of freedom of the structure.

2500|$|While x-rays would {{normally}} travel {{at the speed}} of light through a low-density material like the plastic foam channel filler between (2) and (3), the intensity of radiation from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler, which acts like a slow-moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy.
