40|$|While the bending {{sequence}} planning {{has been}} intensively studied, {{design of the}} motion path of a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> in the bending operation tends to be ignored by researchers. Because during the bending operation, the space for maneuvering a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> is very small, collisions between the part and bending tools are likely to occur.

In this study, an evolutionary path-planning approach for robot-assisted handling of sheet metal parts in bending is firstly proposed and implemented. The proposed approach globally searches the motion path space to identify feasible paths. Collision detection algorithms based on segment intersection are used to check if the generated paths are feasible or infeasible. This method can automatically design feasible handling operations for a robot. Simulation examples on a simple “V ” shaped part and a part with multiple bents demonstrate that the approach is efficient and practical...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a technical demonstration {{of a system}} for determining the three-dimensional spatial location of complexly shaped, thin-walled sheet metal parts grasped by robots during assembly. For successful part assembly, the precise location of grasped parts (essential for successful mating of parts) must be achieved. A localization system is implemented to determine the accurate position and orientation of a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> that has been {{picked up by a}} robot from an arbitrary location. The proposed localiza-tion system employs a novel sensing method, utilizing laser-based proximity and edge detectors, to extract the part feature data in real time. These geometrical feature data are incorporated into an existing localization algorithm, which is based on the singular value decomposition formulation of the part localization problem. The sensingmethod is particularly effective in measuring 3 -D feature geometry (i. e., thin edges) of sheet metal parts. An experimental single-robot test bed has been developed to demonstrate the fea-sibility of the part localization concept for a single <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part.</b> The experimental results obtained from the test bed demonstrate that the system can be effectively used for the localization of thin-walled sheet metal parts. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 1...|$|E

When creating rules and structures for manufacturing features, it is possible to prepare simple guides for engineering designers so that they can design parts which are easy to manufacture.

Incremental <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> Forming (ISMF) is a recently invented die-less forming method that is quite different to the traditional methods. In ISMF, a piece of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> is formed to the desired shape by a series of small incremental deformations.

40|$|The {{market place}} {{of the twenty-first century}} will demand that {{manufacturing}} assumes a crucial role in a new competitive field. Two potential resources in the area of manufacturing are advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) and empowered employees. Surveys in Finland have shown the need to invest in the new AMT in the Finnish sheet metal industry in the 1990 's. In this run the focus has been on hard technology and less attention is paid to the utilization of human resources. In manymanufacturing companies an appreciable portion of the profit within reach is wasted due to poor quality of planning and workmanship. The production flow production error distribution of the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> based constructions is inspectedin this thesis. The objective of the thesis is to analyze the origins of production errors in the production flow of sheet metal based constructions. Also the employee empowerment is investigated in theory and the meaning of the employee empowerment in reducing the overall production error amount is discussed in this thesis. This study is most relevant to the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> fabricating industrywhich produces <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> based constructions for electronics and telecommunication industry. This study concentrates on the manufacturing function of a company and is based on a field study carried out in five Finnish case factories. In each studied case factory the most delicate work phases for production errors were detected. It can be assumed that most of the production errors are caused in manually operated work phases and in mass production work phases. However, no common theme in collected production error data for production error distribution in the production flow can be found. Most important finding was still that most of the production errors in each case factory studied belong to the 'human activity based errors-category'. This result indicates that most of the problemsin the production flow are related to employees or work organization. Development activities must therefore be focused to the development of employee skills orto the development of work organization. Employee empowerment gives the right tools and methods to achieve this...|$|E
