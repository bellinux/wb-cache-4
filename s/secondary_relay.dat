Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for the secondary outage probability under the primary outage constraint and the peak power constraint at both secondary transmitter and relay. In addition, we investigate the effect of the number of primary transceivers on the optimal energy harvesting duration that minimizes the secondary outage probability. By utilizing the primary interference as a useful energy source in the energy harvesting phase, the secondary network achieves a better outage performance.

30|$|In the {{aforementioned}} works [9, 10], SU’s transmit power is controlled {{to keep the}} interference of PU under a predefined limit. In such interference-limited cognitive networks, the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of PU is required to be known at SU to protect PU. Since a secondary network is typically not coordinated with a primary network and no dedicated feedback channel is available from PU to SU, the instantaneous CSI of PU can hardly be obtained, and unreliable CSI results {{in violation of the}} interference constraint. To deal with this critical obstacle, Zou et al. investigated the problem of relay selection to maximize the received signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) at SU under a novel independent primary outage constraint for PU [18], in which only the statistical CSI of PU is required at SU. The work in [18] restrained the transmit powers of secondary transmitter and <b>secondary</b> <b>relay</b> under individual primary outage constraint for PU.

30|$|Inspired by {{the above}} {{literature}} review, in this work, {{we deal with}} a comprehensive performance analysis of cooperative cognitive MIMO (CC-MIMO) multiuser downlink systems. In the interested schemes, the four promising techniques, CR, MIMO, multi-user selection, and relaying, are integrated perfectly together. Specially, the utilization of multi-user selection is a realistic consideration with high energy efficiency. For example, in wireless local network (WLN), there are multiple access points of Internet. Before communications, the user in WLN first selects one best access point. Then, during the communications only the selected best access point is activated, and the others keep silence. As a result, the energy efficiency is improved greatly even if the spectrum efficiency is degraded. The secondary system consists of one secondary source, one <b>secondary</b> <b>relay,</b> and multiple secondary destinations. The secondary source and secondary destinations are equipped with multiple antennas, while the <b>secondary</b> <b>relay</b> is equipped with one single antenna. Note that {{the reason that we}} employ single antenna relay is that, compared with base station, the relays should have low implementation complexity and engineering cost. For example, in a large wireless network, we should arrange many relays. If all relays are equipped with multiple antennas, the total engineering cost may be very expensive. Moreover, the perfect synchronization of multiple antenna systems leads to high implication complexity. Besides this, our schemes can be extended easily to the systems in which the relays have multiple antennas, and the relays employ the antenna selection technique. The transmit power of the secondary transmitters is constrained by the interference threshold of primary user. One data transmission round consists of two phases. In the first phase, by using MRT, the secondary source transmits signal to the single antenna <b>secondary</b> <b>relay.</b> In the second phase, only one secondary destination is selected for receiving data from relay. Then, by using the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocol, the <b>secondary</b> <b>relay</b> transmits the received signal to the selected best destination. At the selected secondary destination, the MRC is employed to process the received signal from relay. At the same time, in this paper, we consider the effect of feedback delay on MRT/MRC and user selection. This {{is due to the fact}} that, in beamforming and user selection schemes, the excellent performance is achieved only when the perfect CSI is achieved at transmitters. However, in practice, the available CSI at transmitters and the actual instant channels may be different due to the time-varying channels and feedback delay [20, 21]. At the same time, for comparison analysis, the CC-MIMO multiuser systems are also investigated under the case where the systems have the perfect CSI. For such CC-MIMO multiuser systems, the outage probability and average symbol error ratio (SER) are investigated over Rayleigh fading channels. Specially, we first derive the exact closed-form expressions of outage probability for the two scenarios with and without perfect CSI. Due to the fact that the exact closed-form expressions are very complicated, to reduce the implementation complexity, the tight lower bounds of outage probability and average SER are derived. Finally, to gain valuable insights and to highlight the effect of system’s parameters on the CC-MIMO multiuser systems, we also present the asymptotic performance analysis by using high SNR approximation. The impact of different antenna configurations, feedback delay, and SNR imbalance on the performance is illustrated.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a hybrid interweave-underlay {{spectrum}} access scheme for CCRNs. The motivation {{for this kind}} of hybrid spectrum access scheme is to inherent benefits of both the underlay and interweave spectrum access schemes. Specifically, the CCRN basically operates in the underlay spectrum access to obtain high spectrum efficiency, i.e., if the CCRN senses that it is concurrently active with the PN, the SUs must operate in the underlay spectrum access. In this operation mode, the SUs must control their transmit powers to satisfy the interference power constraint. However, if the PN is sensed to be inactive, the SUs opportunistically operate in the interweave mode without facing the interference power constraint imposed by the primary receiver to improve the system performance. In order to benefit from the advantages of relaying communication, in our proposed scheme, the <b>secondary</b> <b>relay</b> forwards the signals of the PN and CCRN. This is different from overlay CCRNs where the SUs have knowledge of the codebook of the PU and utilize this information to decode the message of primary users [2]. In our system, the <b>secondary</b> <b>relay</b> simply amplifies the signals of the PN and CCRN and broadcasts the resulting signals. It is noted that, in our study, the characteristics of traffic patterns of the PUs and SUs are taken into account when modeling the spectrum access. Further, the impact of imperfect spectrum sensing of the SUs are also considered when analyzing the system performance of the PN and SN. It is assumed that the PN and SN are subject to Nakagami-m fading. The Nakagami-m fading model is used here as it comprises a wide variety of fading channels as special cases by setting the fading severity parameter m to particular values. For example, m= 0.5 represents one-sided Gaussian fading and m= 1 represents Rayleigh fading. The Nakagami-m fading model also closely approximates the Nakagami-q (Hoyt) and the Nakagami-n (Rice) models.|$|E
