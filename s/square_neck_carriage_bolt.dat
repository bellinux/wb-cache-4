50|$|A <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> {{coach bolt}} or round head <b>square</b> <b>neck</b> bolt {{is a form}} of bolt used to fasten metal to wood.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{extensively}} used {{in security}} fixings, {{such as the}} Brenton Bolt where the bolt must only be removable from one side. The smooth domed head and square nut below prevent the <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> from being unlocked from the insecure side.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> - Bolt with {{a smooth}} rounded head and a square section to prevent turning {{followed}} with a threaded section for a nut.|$|R
50|$|Closely {{related to}} <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> are timber bolts, meant {{for use with}} large wood planks and structures. They have a domed head that is {{proportionally}} wider {{than that of a}} <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> and instead of a square section of shank under the head, they have four sharp-cornered fillets that grip the edge of the hole in the wood to prevent rotation. They are also known as mushroom head bolts or dome head bolts. They are used to fasten wood to wood, instead of metal to wood.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> were {{developed}} for use through iron strengthening plates {{on either side}} of a wooden beam. It is commonplace though to use them to bare timber, the squared section giving enough grip to prevent rotation.|$|R
50|$|A screw {{must always}} be turned to {{assemble}} the joint. Many bolts are held fixed in place during assembly, either by a tool or by a design of non-rotating bolt, such as a <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> and only the corresponding nut is turned.|$|R
50|$|Plough bolts are a {{flush-fitting}} <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> {{where the}} head is countersunk beneath the surface. They were first developed to hold replaceable ploughshares onto the mouldboard of iron ploughs. The share is the most quickly wearing part of the plough and would be replaced several times {{over the life of}} the plough.|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} tunings are used. Some <b>square</b> <b>neck</b> tunings are {{not recommended}} for round neck resonator guitars, owing to the high string tension required, which in turn requires the stronger <b>square</b> <b>neck.</b> Slack-key guitar tunings are most suitable for bottleneck playing, and conventional E-A-D-G-B-E guitar tuning is also popular.|$|R
50|$|The Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike, an east-west road, was {{extended}} through Marion in 1813, making the community a crossroads. Small-scale industrial activity {{began in the}} 19th century, including the manufacture of <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts in the factory of L.B. Frost and Son, which began operation in Marion in 1842, using the water power of Humiston Brook.|$|R
50|$|Wooden {{tables are}} {{constructed}} using lumber boards. Protection for the wood (stain, paint, or wood protectant that repels water) is necessary {{to protect it from}} cracking, warping, or rotting due to moisture. The table-top and bench-top boards are attached to the trusses or beams using wood screws or nails. The legs can be secured with <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> fastened by nuts and washers.|$|R
50|$|Southington {{originally}} was a small, rural farming community. In the early 1900s, Southington {{developed as a}} manufacturing center, but still maintained a very small population of a few thousand residents. Some of the products invented there include the first cement that was able to harden under water, the first <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> cutting machine, the break-neck rat trap, and a new tinware process.|$|R
50|$|Stage {{lighting}} suspension bolts {{are most}} commonly 3/8 in and 1/2 in BSW. Companies that initially converted to metric threads have converted back, after complaints that the finer metric threads increased {{the time and}} difficulty of setup, which often {{takes place at the}} top of a ladder or scaffold. Fixings for garden gates traditionally used Whitworth <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts,</b> and these are still the standard supplied in UK.|$|R
5000|$|Resonator guitar : {{particularly}} those with <b>square</b> <b>necks,</b> but also round neck versions with a raised nut.|$|R
50|$|The Micklethwait Baronetcy, of Iridge Place in the County of Sussex, was a {{title in}} the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 27 July 1838 for Peckham Micklethwait. The baronetcy was in honour of him having rescued Princess Victoria when her <b>carriage</b> <b>bolted</b> {{during a visit to}} Hastings in 1834. Micklethwait served as High Sheriff of Sussex in 1848. The title became extinct on his death in 1853.|$|R
50|$|The Clark Brothers Factory No. 1 was a {{historic}} industrial complex at 1331 South Main Street in the Milldale area of Southington, Connecticut. Developed {{beginning in the}} 1850s, {{it was one of}} the nation's largest sources of <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts.</b> The complex listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 consisted of a group of brick buildings dating to 1893 and later. It has since been entirely demolished, and the land stands vacant and overgrown.|$|R
50|$|Bluegrass players {{tend to use}} <b>square</b> <b>necks,</b> while blues players tend {{to prefer}} round necks. Square-necked guitars give a {{slightly}} greater variety of possible tunings, while round-necked guitars give a much greater variety of playing positions.|$|R
50|$|The Clark Brothers Company {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{industrial}} concerns in Southington, and was influential in its growth as an industrial community {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In the 1850s they developed specialized equipment for the manufacture of <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts,</b> a process they eventually automated in its entirety. Originally located in a factory on South Main Street (since demolished), they had this facility built beginning in 1911, using steam power for the manufacturing processes instead of water. It was expanded during the First World War, and broadened its production line to include other types of fasteners.|$|R
50|$|On the disused side of Platform 2, an old <b>carriage</b> is <b>bolted</b> to the ground. Set in its {{window is}} a plaque commemorating 100 years of Steamtrain Hoorn Medemblik, a Dutch steam train.|$|R
5000|$|The Phil Leadbetter Signature Dobro {{manufactured}} by the Gibson Guitar Corporation features a <b>square</b> <b>neck</b> for steel guitar playing {{and a single}} inverted-cone resonator. The guitar also features solid wood construction. It is the only guitar being made today which bears the name [...] "Dobro".|$|R
50|$|The {{resonator}} guitar is {{most often}} played as a lap steel guitar, and the more common square-necked version is limited to this playing position. <b>Square</b> <b>neck</b> instruments are always set up with the high action favored by steel guitar players, and tuned to a suitable open tuning.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the visual}} {{distinction}} usually referred {{to is that}} in a state funeral, the gun carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by sailors from the Royal Navy rather than horses. (This tradition dates from the funeral of Queen Victoria; the horses drawing the gun <b>carriage</b> <b>bolted,</b> so ratings from the Royal Navy hauled it to the Royal Chapel at Windsor.) This distinguishing feature is not invariable, however, as shown by the use of naval ratings rather than horses at the ceremonial funeral for Lord Mountbatten in 1979 (one of a number of features on that occasion which emphasized Mountbatten's lifelong links with the Royal Navy).|$|R
50|$|On two walls, {{usually the}} long walls, the {{dimensional}} lumber girts {{at the top}} of the walls are doubled, one on the inside and one on the outside of the posts, and usually through-bolted with large <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> to support the roof load. The roof structure is frequently a truss roof supporting purlins or laths, or built using common rafters. Wide buildings with common rafters need interior rows of posts. Sometimes rafters may be attached directly to the poles. The roof pitch of pole buildings is usually low and the roof form is usually gable or lean-to. Metal roofing is commonly used as the roofing and siding material on pole buildings.|$|R

50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from other bolts by its shallow mushroom head {{and that the}} shank cross-section of the bolt is circular {{for most of its}} length, as usual, but the portion immediately beneath the head is formed into a square section. This makes the bolt self-locking when placed through a square hole in a metal strap, or a round hole in most wood. This allows the fastener to be installed with only a single tool, a spanner or wrench, working from one side. The head of a <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> is usually a shallow dome. The squared section is of {{the same size as the}} diameter of the bolt shank, with a plain unthreaded shank.|$|R

5000|$|The slide {{technique}} of playing slide guitar is generally {{by using a}} steel bar. Resonator guitars, including round necked varieties, are particularly suitable for this style, yet are seldom referred to as [...] "steel guitars", but rather referred to generally as a Dobro, acoustic slide guitar, or <b>square</b> <b>neck</b> resonator guitars. Dobro is also a brand name {{of one of the}} leading manufacturers of resonator guitars.|$|R
50|$|When the {{ancestor}} of this canid, {{a species of}} the wolf-sized Xenocyon, became confined to the island, its diet became limited to small and fast prey, such as rodents and rabbits. This lack of large prey caused the Sardinian dhole to evolve into a small sized (perhaps 10 kg) canid. This view of Cynotherium as a predator specializing in small, fast prey is supported by {{an examination of the}} animal's anatomy. The evolution of short, powerful limbs, a low <b>neck</b> <b>carriage</b> and increased head and neck mobility suggests an animal well suited for stalking and then quickly pouncing on or running down small prey.|$|R
50|$|The Gibson Guitar Corporation {{acquired}} OMI in 1993, {{and announced}} it would defend its right to exclusive use of the Dobro trademark—which many people commonly used for any resonator guitar. , Gibson produces several round sound hole models under the Dobro name, and cheaper f-hole models both under the Hound Dog name and also its Epiphone brand. All have a single resonator, and many are available in either round or <b>square</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
