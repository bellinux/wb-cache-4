40|$|This paper 1 {{discusses}} cepstral feature combinations via linear {{discriminant analysis}} (LDA) {{in the context of}} automatic speaker identification (ASI). Two static cepstral features are considered, namely standard MFCC and a sub-band filtered form derived via linear prediction known as RASTA-PLP. These two are compared along with their first order dynamic forms as both single and combined feature sets. LDA is shown to provide a useful means of combining (dissimilar) feature sets and permitting a direct trade-off between the number of coefficients and ASI performance, particularly when testing under noisy conditions. Also, the importance of pre-normalisation is demonstrated. It is shown {{that in the case of}} individual features, the two <b>static</b> <b>forms</b> give the best performance in clean conditions, with a cross-over to the two dynamic forms being better in the region of SNR= 15 dB. The LDA combination of the two <b>static</b> <b>forms</b> gives the best overall results under both clean and noisy conditions [...] ...|$|R

House paintings are often seen as a continuous design wrapped around a house, forcing the viewer to walk around the work to experience it fully; while decorated cloths are worn as decorative or ceremonial garments, transforming the wearer into a living sculpture.

5000|$|Auguste Rodin {{at first}} was very {{impressed}} by Monet's 'vibrating works' and Degas' unique understanding of spatial relationships. As an artist and an author of art reviews, Rodin published multiple works supporting this style. He claimed that Monet and Degas' work created the illusion [...] "that art captures life through good modeling and movement". In 1881, when Rodin first sculpted and produced his own works of art, he rejected his earlier notions. Sculpting put Rodin into a predicament that he felt no philosopher nor anyone could ever solve; how can artists impart movement and dramatic motions from works so solid as sculptures? After this conundrum occurred to him, he published new articles that didn't attack men such as Manet, Monet, and Degas intentionally, but propagated his own theories that Impressionism is not about communicating movement but presenting it in <b>static</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
