25|$|Despite slowing of the economy, as of June 2015 the Chinese stock index, the CSI 300 Index, {{which is}} based on 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, had risen nearly 150% over the past 12 months. In an effort to {{forestall}} damage from collapse of a possible economic bubble fueled by margin trading the central government raised requirements for margin lending. Economic damage from a crash in 2007-2008 was limited due to margin lending being highly restricted. In early July, after a fall in the markets of nearly 30% from their 12 June highs, there were efforts by blue-chip, often state-owned, firms, the Chinese securities industry, and the central government to stabilize the market by buying back stock and increasing purchases of the stock of established firms; however, much of the volatility has been in smaller, less-established firms that had been heavily invested in by unsophisticated, often working class, investors who had purchased stock based solely on its rapid increase in valuation. 80% of Chinese stocks are owned by individual investors, many novices. As of 10 July 2015 efforts by the China Securities Finance Corporation, CFS, a firm created by China's commodities and stock exchanges to finance trades, had apparently stabilized the market. Major Chinese securities firms were required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to buy, and hold, a substantial amount of securities affected by the downturn. Using funds supplied by the central bank and commercial banks the China Securities Finance Corporation purchased enough stocks to halt the slide acquiring as much as 5% of the stock in some firms. Lines of credit were extended by CFS to 21 securities firms, some of which also purchased up to 5% of some companies stocks. Some of the <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> stocks acquired may be overvalued.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Small</b> <b>caps</b> {{are often}} used for {{sections}} of text that should be emphasized and where a run of uppercase capital letters would appear jarring to the reader.

500|$|The {{blackcap}} is a mainly grey warbler with distinct {{male and}} female plumages. The nominate subspecies is about [...] long with a [...] wing length. The weight is typically , but can be up to [...] for birds preparing to migrate. The adult male has olive-grey upperparts, other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head. The underparts are light grey, becoming silvery white on the chin, throat and upper breast. The tail is dark grey, with an olive tint to {{the outer edge of}} each feather. The bill and long legs are grey, and the iris is reddish brown. The female resembles the male, but has a reddish-brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts. Juveniles are similar to the female, but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge, and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts. This species is unmistakable; other dark-headed Sylvia species, such Sardinian and Orphean warblers have extensive black on the head instead of a <b>small</b> <b>cap.</b> They are also larger and have white edges on the tail.|$|E

50|$|Many word {{processors}} and text-formatting systems include {{an option to}} format text in <b>caps</b> and <b>small</b> <b>caps,</b> which leaves uppercase letters as they are, but converts lowercase letters to <b>small</b> <b>caps.</b> How this is implemented depends on the typesetting system; some can use true <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> glyphs that are included in modern professional font sets; but less complex digital fonts {{do not have a}} small-caps glyphs, so the typesetting system simply reduces the uppercase letters by a fraction (often 1.5 to 2 points less than the base scale). However, this will make the characters look somewhat out of proportion. A work-around to simulate real small capitals is to use a one-level bolder version of the <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> generated by such systems, to match well with the normal weights of capitals and lowercase, especially when such <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> are extended about 5% or letterspaced a half point or a point.|$|R
