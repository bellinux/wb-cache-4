The Bishop's calm {{thoughtful}} face, the dusky lads, the white-shelled square in front, relieved by a mass of bright geraniums or gay creepers, the little bed-room with its camp bed, and medicine bottles and good books, and, too often, in spite of our loving remonstrances, an invalid shivering with ague, or influenza, in possession. We knew that this involved broken nights for him, and a <b>soft</b> <b>board</b> and a rug for a couch. He was overtasking his powers during those years. He was at work generally from five A.M. to eleven P.M., and this in a close atmosphere; for both the schoolroom and his own house were ill- ventilated.

He had a horse and enjoyed riding, but he grudged the time except {{when he had to}} come up to town on business or to take Sunday services for the English in the country. It was very natural, as he had all a student's taste for quiet study, yet could only indulge it by cutting off his own hours for relaxation. He was constantly called off during the day to attend to practical work, teaching in school, prescribing for and waiting on the sick, weighing out medicines, keeping the farm accounts, besides the night classes in several languages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Tracking {{a surface}} via the {{end-effector}} of a ma-nipulator {{is a tough}} issue, one not only should implement the position and force control, but also monitor and sense the actual contacting state between the end-effector and the object’s surface. In this paper, we present an approach integrating the tactile sensing with force-torque information as the feedback to control the manipulator tracking a surface. Hybrid impedance control method is applied to follow both the position and force trajectories. At the same time, the posture of the end-effector is expected to keep horizontal. With the feedback of tactile sensing data such as contact state, contact area and so on, several strategies of tactile sensing feedback are proposed to be included into the control algorithm. Simulations and two groups of real experiments are made using a 5 -DOF manipulator equipped with force/torque and tactile sensors to contact with hard and <b>soft</b> <b>board</b> respectively, {{and the results are}} compared and analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is validated. I...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to {{presenting}} a parsimonious, simplified and heuristic method of gathering data concerning concepts of fertility behavior and control. The nature of the instrument is such that it also facilitates cross-cultural comparison and generalization. The method employs the female fecundity period as a standard for data gathering. Its main uses are to gather (a) primary information on actual, expected, intended and ideal fertility behavior practice; and (b) secondary information on knowledge about and attitudes towards methods and practices of fertility control based upon an analyses of the primary information. The measurement device calls for more active participation by the respondent in the interview situation. The actual measurement device is mounted on a <b>soft</b> <b>board</b> and respondents answer questions by sticking appropriately coded mapping pins into the relevant places on the Fertility Behavior Differential. In this way, information is efficiently gathered {{on such issues as}} the outset of menstruation and menopause, the actual parental ages at marriage and at present, the actual birth order of all children up till the present time, differentiating between miscarriages and births of male and female children both living and dead, the expected birth order of further children, the intended birth order of further children if perfect fertility control were possible, the ideal parental ages at marriage and ideal birth order of children assuming that the respondent could go back to square one and start all over again. The measuring device is not restricted to women in there fecundity period. It may be extended to use responses of males and females of all ages, barring infants. In addition, the measurement method ameliorates problems of jargonistic terminology and the use of "sensitive" words and language...|$|E

40|$|During {{the recent}} years the {{radiation}} of walking noise ("drum sound") of laminate floor coverings has become an important product property for marketing. Producers of floors are optimizing their products using attached underlays to attenuate drum sound, and the EPLF developed a measurement and evaluation procedure in cooperation with research institutes: A modified tapping machine is operating on the sample area laid in a test room with concrete floor and sufficient sound absorption. The stationary sound signal is recorded and post-processed using the Zwicker loudness analysis. The result is an overall loudness value (in Sone) and a diagram of specific loudness where the frequency components of the sound can be assessed. Today, very different types of underlay attachements for drum sound attenuation are in use. The range of materials comprises duroplastic or thermoplastic coatings, more or less stiff thermoplastic mats, recycled plastics, rubber mats, and <b>soft</b> fibre <b>boards.</b> Experiences from measurements for many floor and underlay products carried out at WKI show that the materials can perform very differently. But {{this is not only}} due to the type of underlay of floor material. Drum sound attenuation is a combined effect of laminate properties, thickness and stiffness of the underlay and the laying method. The difference of overall loudness values between "silent" and "loud" products can be up to 25 Sone. Typical for laminate floorings are a lower frequency peak (400 [...] . 1000 Hz) - probably caused by resonance effects between the areas mass of the laminate flooring and the stiffness and thickness of the underlay - and another peak at 2000 [...] . 3000 Hz corresponding to a "rattling" sound from the hard covering. Some products with underlays show a good attenuation of "rattling" sound components, others a shift of the low-frequency components in the spectra. The technical development of material combinations with improved performance is going on. There is still a need for modelling the process of drum sound generation and radiation so that further improvements can be expected...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Polyimides {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} classes of polymers used in the microelectronics and photoelec-tronics industries. Because of their high thermal stability, chemical resistance, and good mechanical and electric properties, polyimides are often applied in photoresists, passivation and dielectric films, <b>soft</b> print circuit <b>boards,</b> and alignment films within displays. Recently, fully aliphatic and alicyclic polyimides have found applications as opto-electronics and inter layer dielectric materials, due to their good transparencies and low dielectric constants (ε). The low molecular density, polarity and rare probability of forming inter- or intra-molecular charge transfers, resulting in lowering of the dielectric constant and high transparency, are the most striking characteristics of aliphatic poly-imide. However, the ultimate end use of polyimides derived from aliphatic monomers is in their targeted applications that need less stringent thermal requirements. Much research effort has been exerted in the development of aliphatic polyimide with increased thermal and mechanical stabilities, while maintaining their transparencies and low dielec-tric constants, by the incorporation of rigid moieties. In this article, the recent research process in synthesizing fully aliphatic polyimides, with improved dimensional stability, high transparency and low ε values, as well as the char-acterizations and future scope for their application in micro electric and photo-electronic industries, is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{adhesives}} {{often is}} indispensable, if dissimilar materials {{have to be}} joined. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} cooperate project with an adhesive manufacturer and an electronics company on the synthesis and application of electrically conductive adhesives. The adhesives comprised a polymer filled with approx. 80 wt. % metal flakes. The polymers were epoxies, silicones, thermoplasts or blends. As for the flakes Ag, Cu, Pd were utilized. Epoxies, possibly blended with thermoplasts, in conjunction with Ag-flakes {{turned out to be a}} good compromise between technical performance and economics. Adhesives could be synthesised having much lower shear moduli (lower stress of joint) and higher shear breaking strain (low failure rate during temperature cycling) than soft solders. Ageing the cured adhesives lead to Ag-diffusion. Different modes of diffusion occured depending on adhesive and climate. Ag-Pd-Flakes exhibited the least diffusion. The morphology of the flakes was investiga ted, a mixture of pellets and spheres yielded a low enough viscosity and a good conductivity. Cu-Flakes were covered with oxide. A lasting removal of the oxide could not be achieved which resulted in a poor conductivity. Electronic components were adhesively joined to <b>boards.</b> <b>Soft</b> solder (SnPb) coatings did not cause problems. The formation of an Agsub 3 Sn interlayer after temperature ageing, out forward by some, did not occur. We found recristallisations of the SnPb, but no Ag-rich interlayer...|$|R
60|$|His {{handcuffs}} {{were the}} first consideration. At first he saw no method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,--this species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his feet, and, leaving the cord {{in such a manner}} that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person's coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition here was of <b>soft</b> pine <b>board,</b> an inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate's gang. It appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Pressure ulcers are a high cost, {{high volume}} issue {{for health and}} medical care providers, having a {{detrimental}} effect on patients and relatives. Pressure ulcer prevention is widely covered in the literature, but little has been published regarding the risk to patients in the radiographical setting. This review of the current literature is to identify findings relevant to radiographical context. Methods: Literature searching was performed using Science Direct and Medline databases. The search was limited to articles published {{in the last ten}} years to remain current and excluded studies containing participants less than 17 years of age. In total 14 studies were acquired; three were excluded as they were not relevant. The remaining 11 studies were compared and reviewed. Discussion: Eight of the studies used ‘healthy’ participants and three used symptomatic participants. Nine studies explored interface pressure with a range of pressure mat technologies, two studies measured shear (MRI finite element modelling, and a non-invasive instrument), and one looked at blood flow and haemoglobin oxygenation. A range of surfaces were considered from trauma, nursing and surgical backgrounds for their ability to reduce pressure including standard mattresses, high specification mattresses, rigid and <b>soft</b> layer spine <b>boards,</b> various overlays (gel, air filled, foam). Conclusion: The current literature is not appropriate for the radiographic patient and cannot be extrapolated to a radiologic context. Sufficient evidence is presented in this review to support the need for further work specific to radiography in order to minimise the development of PU in at risk patients...|$|R
40|$|The term "bilateral deficit" (BLD) {{has been}} used to {{describe}} a reduction in performance during bilateral contractions when compared to the sum of identical unilateral contractions. In old age, maximal isometric force production (MIF) decreases and BLD increases indicating the need for training interventions to mitigate this impact in seniors. In a cross-sectional approach, we examined age-related differences in MIF and BLD in young (age: 20 - 30 years) and old adults (age: > 65 years). In addition, a randomized-controlled trial was conducted to investigate training-specific effects of resistance vs. balance training on MIF and BLD of the leg extensors in old adults. Subjects were randomly assigned to resistance training (n = 19), balance training (n = 14), or a control group (n = 20). Bilateral heavy-resistance training for the lower extremities was performed for 13 weeks (3 × / week) at 80 % of the one repetition maximum. Balance training was conducted using predominately unilateral exercises on wobble <b>boards,</b> <b>soft</b> mats, and uneven surfaces for the same duration. Pre- and post-tests included uni- and bilateral measurements of maximal isometric leg extension force. At baseline, young subjects outperformed older adults in uni- and bilateral MIF (all p <. 001; d = 2. 61 - 3. 37) and in measures of BLD (p <. 001; d = 2. 04).
