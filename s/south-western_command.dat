25|$|As {{a result}} of the Sino-Soviet border conflict, a sixteenth {{military}} district was created in 1969, the Central Asian Military District, with headquarters at Alma-Ata. To improve capabilities for war at a theatre level, in the late 1970s and early 1980s four high commands were established, grouping the military districts, groups of forces, and fleets. The Far Eastern High Command was established first, followed by the Western and <b>South-Western</b> High <b>Commands</b> towards Europe, and the Southern High Command at Baku, oriented toward the Middle East.|$|R
50|$|The {{trauma of}} the devastating German {{invasion}} of 1941 influenced the Soviet Cold War military doctrine of fighting enemies on their own territory, or in a buffer zone under Soviet hegemony, {{but in any case}} preventing any war from reaching Soviet soil. In order to secure Soviet interests in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Army moved in to quell anti-Soviet uprisings in the German Democratic Republic (1953), Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968).As a result of the Sino-Soviet border conflict, a sixteenth military district was created in 1969, the Central Asian Military District, with headquarters at Alma-Ata.

40|$|The Second Battle of Kharkov {{represented}} the Wehrmacht {{at its highest}} watermark, and the Red Army at its lowest ebb. Despite its incapability for large-scale offensive action {{in the spring of}} 1942, the Red Army attempted to recapture the city of Kharkov in a pincer movement from bridgeheads east of the city. Troops of the <b>South-Western</b> Front, <b>commanded</b> by Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, initially made good ground against Generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock’s thinly stretched Army Group South, only to be defeated by superior tactical and operational expertise in a smashing German counterattack. The Soviets intended “Second Kharkov ” to be their first properly organized warm-weather offensive of the Great Patriotic War. Instead, thanks to deficient intelligence, poor planning, inadequate logistics, and inept leadership, the Soviet offensive proved to be a precarious, ad hoc affair. Though it initially caught the Wehrmacht by surprise, the battle ended in another Soviet catastrophe reminiscent of the great defeats of 1941. The destruction of the Soviet armies near Kharkov left the South-Western Front virtually naked on the eve of Fall Bla...|$|R
50|$|At a later period, in {{the fourth}} century BC, the two names of Aurunci and Ausones had assumed a {{distinct}} signification, and came to be applied to two petty nations, evidently mere subdivisions of the same great race, both dwelling on the frontiers of Latium and Campania; the Ausones on the west of the Liris, extending from thence to the mountains of the Volscians; the Auruncans, on the other hand, being confined to the detached group of volcanic mountains now called Monte Santa Croce, or Rocca Monfina, on the left bank of the Liris, together with the hills that slope from thence towards the sea. Their ancient stronghold or metropolis, Aurunca was situated near the summit of the mountain, while Suessa, which they subsequently made their capital, was on its <b>south-western</b> slope, <b>commanding</b> the fertile plains from thence to the sea. On the east and south they bordered closely on the Sidicini of Teanum and the people of Cales, who, according to Livy, were also of Ausonian race, but were politically distinct from the Auruncans. Virgil evidently regards these hills as the original abode of the Auruncan, and speaks of them as merely a petty people.|$|R
50|$|Tukhachevsky, {{certain that}} all was going {{according}} to plan, was actually falling into Piłsudski's trap. There were only token Polish resistance {{in the path of}} the main Russian advance north and across the Vistula, on the right flank of the battle (from the perspective of the Soviet advance). At the same time, south of Warsaw, on the battle's left front, the vital link between the Northwestern and Southwestern Fronts was much more vulnerable, protected only by a small Soviet force, the Mozyr Group. Further, Semyon Budyonny, commanding the 1st Cavalry Army, a unit much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders, disobeyed orders by the Soviet High Command, which at Tukhachevsky's insistence, ordered him to advance at Warsaw from the south. Budyonny resented this order, influenced by a grudge between <b>commanding</b> <b>South-Western</b> Front generals Alexander Ilyich Yegorov and Tukhachevsky. In addition, the political games of Joseph Stalin, at the time the chief political commissar of the South-Western Front, further contributed to Yegorov's and Budyonny's disobedience. Stalin, looking for personal glory, aimed to capture the besieged Lwów (Lviv), an important industrial center. Ultimately, Budyonny's forces marched on Lwów instead of Warsaw, and thus missed the battle.|$|R
