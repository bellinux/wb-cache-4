40|$|Abstract—The project {{deals with}} {{replacing}} hand feed of <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> with automatic feed. Using common hand feed sliding table saws, smooth in-feed of material to cut {{could not be}} ensured. It negatively impacts quality of cut and surrounding surface structure. In this project, possibility of automation of sliding table feed is examined. Sliding table system must be modified concerning dimensions of the material to cut. Types of automated feeding systems of our design are reviewed and ordered also with regard to simplicity of implementation, work accuracy, safety, dust nuisance, reliability and costs.

40|$|Abstract—Modern <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{equipped}} with several passive safety devices. However, alone in Germany several hundred severe injuries or limb amputations occur each year due disregarding safety regulations and demounting of passive safety devices. Thus an active safety system is developed {{in order to protect}} the machine user. For this purpose, a multi sensor system for hazard analysis based on infrared and capacitive sensors is applied. When a dangerous situation is recognized by the developed sensors, the system triggers a rapid saw blade braking device. The hazard analysis is carried out by means of an information fusion of the sensor signals based on a Bayesian network. For the fusion process the measurement values of the sensors have to preprocessed appropriately. The system is implemented in C and LabView and runs in real-time. Validation tests have shown the very reliable function of the developed hazard analysis. Bayesian network, measurement fusion, infrared sensor, capacitive sensor, hazard analysis...|$|R

5000|$|The European {{combination}} machine allows efficient processing of both rough-cut timber and sheet stock (i.e. plywood). The <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> {{can work in}} conjunction with either the <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> or the shaper. Outfitted with an 8-foot <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> and outrigger, a single person can cut 4'x8' plywood very accurately and efficiently. Changing between most functions takes only a few seconds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> {{allows a}} {{straight}} edge to be cut on rough lumber, {{without the use of}} a fence. It also allows a cut to be made accurately at any angle across a sheet of plywood in just seconds - something that cannot be done nearly as easily, if at all, on a <b>table</b> <b>saw.</b> Used in conjunction with the shaper, the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> allows molding, door panels, rails and stiles, to be milled quickly and more accurately than a stand-alone shaper.|$|R
50|$|One {{rationale}} {{for the production of}} these machines is space saving. A combination machine takes up much less space than the equivalent separate machines. Most European machines have a <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> that tends to make them safer than typical North American <b>table</b> <b>saws.</b> Even though top end combination machines can be quite expensive, there usually is a cost saving over separate machines of similar quality.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sliding panel}} saw {{was invented by}} Wilhelm Altendorf in 1906 in Germany. Its {{invention}} set a new standard in woodworking, with dramatic differences from traditional machines. Up to that time, a conventional <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> had no mechanism for edging. Meaning {{that for the first}} and second longitudinal cut on untreated massive wood, the lumber always had to be fed manually through the saw blade. The new system accomplished the task more elegantly by allowing the work piece to be fed through the saw blade while lying on a <b>sliding</b> <b>table.</b> Thus cutting becomes faster, accurate and effortless.|$|R
25|$|Hybrid <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor <b>table</b> <b>saws.</b> They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid <b>saws</b> offer a <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the radial arm <b>saw,</b> <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> and hand saws were most {{commonly}} used for crosscutting lumber. <b>Table</b> <b>saws</b> can easily rip stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a <b>table</b> <b>saw</b> blade. In contrast, when a radial arm saw is used for crosscutting, the stock remains stationary on the <b>saw's</b> <b>table,</b> and the blade is pulled through it.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{pneumatic}} positioning device {{coupled with a}} piezoelectric self-moving mechanism to overcome the main disadvantages of the inherent poor positioning accuracy obtained by traditional pneumatic cylinder. The new driving mechanism is to mount a piezoelectric Impact Drive Mechanism (IDM) to the controlled <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> driven by the pneu-matic cylinder. Based on the configuration, {{the first step of}} positioning proc-ess is to actuate the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> with rough position accuracy but with the benefits of high-speed and large-range due to the pneumatic cylinder. The second step is to drive the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> with high position accuracy by utiliz-ing the impact force of IDM. The experimental results show that the con-trolled <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> is successfully positioned in 0. 236 s with rough accuracy of 10 µm and with the stroke of 100 mm by utilizing the pneumatic cylinder, and the final positioning accuracy of 10 nm with respect to the terminated position of the first-stage control is obtained in 1. 479 s due to the actuations of IDM. It is shown that the pneumatic positioning device coupled with IDM has attractive practical applications in the field of precision industry...|$|R
