40|$|Abstract: Effects of seed {{rates on}} grain, <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> yield of {{safflower}} (Carthamus tinctorius L.) were studied {{for two years}} in the semi-arid central Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. Three trials, two under rainfed and one under supplementary irrigations, were conducted using seed rates of 6, 12, 24 and 48 kg ha- 1 corresponding to intra-row spacing of 20, 10, 5, and 2. 5 cm, respectively. There was significant seed-rate by trial interaction on grain, <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> yield. In general, significant seed rate effects did not exist in the rainfed trials in 2004 and 2005, confirming that safflower has the capacity to compensate for planting density. In the irrigated trial in 2005, the 24 and 48 kg ha- 1 seed rates gave higher grain, <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> yields than the lower seed rates. Averaged over trials, the 24 kg ha- 1 seed rate gave the highest yields. Even if supplementary irrigation is not available, the large variation in annual rainfall in semi-arid areas warrants the use of 24 kg ha- 1 seed rate as it will benefit in years with above-average rainfall...|$|R

The strong color of wastewater affects aesthetic and water transparency of water bodies. The metabolites could be toxic to aquatic biota and posing a potential hazard to human health. Eventually, it will cause severe environmental problems. One of method that has advantages in term of simplicity to remove synthetic dyes is adsorption. Environmentally benign and low-cost materials to make adsorbent are biomass-based materials. Two different biomaterial wastes of rice <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> palm midrib were {{used in this study}} to develop activated carbon adsorbents. These adsorbents were applied for the removal of Naphtol AS-G dye in aqueous solution. The effects of solution pH, adsorbents masses and contact time on dye adsorption were evaluated based on batch experiments. Removal of dye can be achieved within 60 minutes at a wide pH range starting from 4 to 8. At lower pH, synthetic dye removal was decreasing probably due to protonation of adsorbent 2 ̆ 7 s active sites. The adsorption isotherms based on Langmuir and Freundlich models were analyzed. The isotherms analysis indicated that the adsorption by rice <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> palm can be represented by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm model, respectively. Adsorption isotherms of Naphtol AS-G onto activated carbon are favorable with high adsorption capacity for both biomaterials. The mechanisms of color removal by activated carbon involved chemical and physical adsorption, in accordance with both the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The calculated maximum dye adsorption capacities onto rice <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> palm midrib activated carbon were 55. 86 and 69. 44 mg/g, respectively.

30|$|From {{the present}} state of knowledge, the {{technological}} potential to reduce CO 2 in freight transport appears to be limited, compared with other sectors. Some progress can be achieved through more efficient propulsion technology, aerodynamics or tyres. A change to e-mobility is highly speculative (e.g. with fuel cell technology). This means that the major contribution to CO 2 reduction in the freight transport sector is expected to stem from alternative fuels. But the bio-fuel of the first generation included new risk for deforestation and crowding out of agricultural food and is therefore counterproductive. The second generation of bio-fuels made from waste, <b>straw</b> and <b>oil</b> seeds grown on areas not used for food production does not yield sufficient quantities needed for road freight and air transport.

40|$|Biorefineries {{constitute}} representative {{examples of}} multifunctional systems which {{are able to}} produce, similarly to conventional petroleum refineries, {{a wide range of}} chemicals (pharmaceutical constituents, plastics, food additives etc.), energy carriers and power through the optimal use of diverse biomass forms (wheat <b>straw,</b> <b>oils,</b> wood chips, municipal solid waste). For this purpose, biorefineries typically comprise a complicated, integrated network of physical and chemical transformation processes, such as mechanical and physical biomass pretreatment, pyrolysis, gasification, catalytic and enzymatic reactions, and downstream purification processes. For the environmental sustainability assessment of these complicated production systems, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA, ISO-Norm 14040) is considered as a widely acceptable methodology from scientists and engineers including, however, the debated aspect of partitioning the impacts among the co-products' in the biorefinery product portfolio. The aim {{of this study is to}} present the influence of the various allocation approaches on the LCA results of biorefinery products. The framework of this analysis systematically incorporates the steps of the LCA methodology as described in the ISO norms and estimates the impacts related with the products of interest, taking into account the contribution of the co- and by-products in the overall production path. For this reason, two wider approaches were adopted, the attributional which describes the impact of the production process itself from a retrospective point of view, and the consequential which focuses on the changes in the level of the output (as well as consumption and disposal) of a product, including market effects from increasing or decreasing demand for the study product, having therefore a more prospective point of view. Several scenarios which describe the possible options for handling those products, were developed and assessed based on different allocation methodologies, namely system expansion (substitution method) and partitioning methods according to the mass, thermal and economic values of the co-products. The estimation of the life cycle impacts of the processes was performed using the Global Warming Potential (GWP), Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and RECIPE methodologies which provide an assessment of the burdens through the associated LCA indicators. The outcome of this approach provides a range of LCA metrics emphasizing at the variation of the results according to the followed allocation methods and to identify those properties of products (physical, economic, thermal) and system factors (processes to be substituted from the renewable ones, degree of utilization of co- and by-products from the markets etc.) which dominate the LCA results...|$|R

Economic motivations for changing production systems are strong, but factors such as values (e. g., esthetic), knowledge (e. g., habits and knowledge of production methods), and legal conditions (e. g., cultivation licenses) are crucial for the change to energy crops. Finally, there are knowledge gaps in the literature as to why farmers decide to keep or change a production system. Since the Swedish government and the EU intend to encourage farmers to expand their energy crop production, this knowledge of such motivational factors should be enhanced.

40|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} {{milk fat}} {{conjugated linoleic acid}} (CLA) responses to supplements of fish oil were investigated using five lactating cows each fitted with a rumen cannula in a simple experiment consisting of two consecutive 14 -day experimental periods. During the first period cows were offered 18 kg dry matter (DM) per day of a basal (B) diet formulated from grass silage and a cereal based-concentrate (0. 6 : 0. 4; forage : concentrate ratio, on a DM basis) followed by the same diet supplemented with 250 g fish oil per day (FO) in the second period. The flow of non-esterified fatty acids leaving the rumen was measured using the omasal sampling technique in combination with a triple indigestible marker method based on Li-Co-EDTA, Yb-acetate and Cr-mordanted <b>straw.</b> Fish <b>oil</b> decreased DM intake and milk yield, but {{had no effect on}} milk constituent content. Milk fat trans- 11 C(18 : 1), total trans-C- 18 : 1, cis- 9 trans- 11 CLA, total CLA, C- 18 : 2 (n- 6) and total C- 18 : 2 content were increased in response to fish oil from 1. 80, 4. 51, 0. 39, 0. 56, 0. 90 and 1. 41 to 9. 39, 14. 39, 1. 66, 1. 85, 1. 25 and 4. 00 g/ 100 g total fatty acids, respectively. Increases in the cis- 9, trans- 11 isomer accounted for proportionately 0. 89 of the CLA response to fish oil. Furthermore, fish oil decreased the flow of C- 18 : 0 (283 and 47 g/day for B and FO, respectively) and increased that of trans-C- 18 : 1 fatty acids entering the omasal canal (38 and 182 g/day). Omasal flows of trans-C- 18 : 1 acids with double bonds in positions from delta- 4 to - 15 inclusive were enhanced, but the effects were isomer dependent and primarily associated with an increase in trans- 11 C(18 : 1) leaving the rumen (17. 1 and 121. 1 g/day for B and FO, respectively). Fish oil had no effect on total (4. 36 and 3. 50 g/day) or cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA (2. 86 and 2. 08 g/day) entering the omasal canal. Flows of cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA were lower than the secretion of this isomer in milk. Comparison with the transfer of the trans- 9, trans- 11 isomer synthesized in the rumen suggested that proportionately 0. 66 and 0. 97 of cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA was derived from endogenous conversion of trans- 11 C- 18 : 1 in the mammary gland for B and FO, respectively. It is concluded that fish oil enhances milk fat cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA content in response to increased supply of trans- 11 C- 18 : 1 that arises from an inhibition of trans C- 18 : 1 reduction in the rumen...|$|R
40|$|Huabei {{is a part}} {{of eastern}} China located between 32 ° N and 42 ° N latitude. Administratively it is a region {{including}} Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities, Hebei and Shanxi Provinces, and Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region. Over the past decades, the region has experienced dramatic changes in air quality and climate, and has become a major focus of environmental research in China. Here we present a new inventory of air pollutant emissions in Huabei for the year 2003 developed as part of the project Influence of Pollution on Aerosols and Cloud Microphysics in North China (IPAC-NC). Our estimates are based on the data from the statistical yearbooks of state and provinces as well as local districts including major sectors and activities of power generation, industrial energy consumption, industrial processing, civil energy consumption, crop <b>straw</b> burning, <b>oil</b> and solvent evaporation, manure, and motor vehicles. The emission factors are selected from a variety of literature and those from local measurements in China are used whenever available. The estimated total emissions in the Huabei administrative region in 2003 are 4. 73 Tg SO 2 , 2. 72 Tg NOx (in equivalent NO 2 ), 1. 77 Tg VOC, 24. 14 Tg CO, 2. 03 Tg NH 3 , 4. 57 Tg PM 10 , 2. 42 Tg PM 2. 5 , 0. 21 Tg EC, and 0. 46 Tg OC. For model convenience, we consider a larger Huabei region with Shandong, Henan and Liaoning Provinces included in our inventory. The estimated total emissions in the larger Huabei region in 2003 are: 9. 55 Tg SO 2 , 5. 27 Tg NOx (in equivalent NO 2 ), 3. 82 Tg VOC, 46. 59 Tg CO, 5. 36 Tg NH 3 , 10. 74 Tg PM 10 , 5. 62 Tg PM 2. 5 , 0. 41 Tg EC, and 0. 99 Tg OC. The estimated emission rates are projected into grid cells at a horizontal resolution of 0. 1 ° latitude by 0. 1 ° longitude. Our gridded emission inventory consists of area sources, which are classified into industrial, civil, traffic, and straw burning sectors, and large industrial point sources, which include 345 sets of power plants, iron and steel plants, cement plants, and chemical plants. The estimated regional NO 2 emissions are about 2 – 3 % (administrative Huabei region) or 5 % (larger Huabei region) of the global anthropogenic NO 2 emissions. We compare our inventory (IPAC-NC) with a global emission inventory EDGAR-CIRCE and an Asian emission inventory INTEX-B. While the total emissions in Huabei are comparable with each other, large differences up to a factor of 2 – 3 for local emissions in the areas such as the Beijing and Tianjin megacities are found. We expect that our inventory will provide more practical spatial distributions of air pollutant emissions in the Huabei region of China and can be applied for air pollution and chemistry research on this region in the future...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{control of}} Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges in seed potato production worldwide. PVY can cause substantial economic losses. It reduces the growth of potato plants and the quality and quantity of yield. Therefore, when virus incidence exceeds set thresholds, the potatoes cannot be sold as seed but have to be sold at a lower price for consumption. PVY is transmitted in a non-persistent manner by winged forms of many aphid species. This mode of transmission is characterised by short probing activity, which is sufficient for acquisition and transmission of the virus. Because of these underlying epidemiological factors, PVY is difficult to control. Around 2005, the High grade (HG) seed potato production area in Finland, which {{is one of the}} northernmost intensive crop production areas of the world, saw a marked increase in the incidence of PVY in potato seed lots. Therefore, it became necessary to investigate the epidemiology of PVY and establish measures of PVY control in this region. [...] - Aims: 1) To characterise the species composition and phenology of the aphid fauna. 2) To determine the incidence of aphid species with documented ability to transmit PVY and to use a modelling approach to determine their relative importance as vectors including timing of virus transmission. 3) To compare the application of <b>straw</b> mulch, mineral <b>oil</b> and birch extract with chemical practices for control of PVY vectors. Methods: The area under study was Tyrnävä-Liminka (latitude 64 °) in Finland. Studies were carried out in the potato growing seasons from 2007 to 2012. Aphid flight activity was monitored by yellow pan traps (YPT) placed in 4 8 seed potato fields per year and by one suction trap. Aphid identification was done by morphological characteristics and by DNA barcoding based on a 658 -bp long region of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). A cluster analysis was used to categorise phenology of species. Incidence of PVY was measured by testing leaves collected two weeks after plant emergence and in the progeny tubers after harvest by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To determine the most important time of transmission of PVY, and the main vectors, the seasonal increase in PVY incidence was modelled using aphid counts in traps, the relative vector efficiencies of the aphids, virus resistance of cultivars, and the initial infection rate of the seed tubers as explanatory variables in generalised linear mixed modelling. In addition, small scale experiments (SSE) were conducted in three years and large scale (LSE) field trials in two years. SSE were set up to compare applications of <b>straw</b> mulch, mineral <b>oil</b> and birch extract with chemical control of PVY vectors. LSE were conducted in growers fields to test efficacy of straw mulch to control PVY at farm scale. [...] Results: A total of 58, 528 winged aphid individuals were classified into 83 taxa based on morphology: Of these, 34 species were further characterised by DNA barcoding. Four phenology clusters were found. The late-peak cluster was dominated by heteroecious species and the mid-peak cluster was dominated by monoecious species feeding on herbaceous plants. Total abundance showed a recurring triennial cycle according to the catch of aphids using the suction trap in the years 2000 - 2010. The most abundant species was Rhopalosiphum padi. It occurred mainly at the end of the potato growing season. The highly polyphagous species, Aphis fabae and Aphis gossypii were found to peak at the beginning of the potato growing season. Results of the modelling approach showed that the incidence of seedborne PVY infection and the early-season flight of Aphis fabae are the most important factors contributing to the incidence of PVY in the yield. Other aphid species play a negligible role as vectors of PVY. In the SSEs, only straw mulch reduced of PVY incidence significantly in the progeny tubers, with the reduction ranging from 50 % to 70 % in all three years. Incidence of PVY was reduced by mineral oil in two years (by 43 % to 58 %) and by the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate by 29 % in one year. In the LSE, straw mulch significantly reduced PVY in the progeny tubers by 25 % to 47 %. Average tuber yield following the straw mulch treatment was generally but not significantly higher than that in the untreated control in all experiments. [...] Conclusion: The results demonstrate that early season flight activity of Aphis fabae determines PVY incidence in the HG seed potato production area of Finland with a generally low vector pressure. Furthermore, straw mulch emerges as a reliabe and effective measure in diminishing the spread of PVY in areas with early vector flight activity.

40|$|The Autonomous Province of Vojvodina is an {{autonomous}} province in the Republic of Serbia. It {{is located in}} the northern part of the country, in the Pannonia plain. Vojvodina is an energy-deficient province. The average yearly quantity of the cellulose wastes in Vojvodina amounts to about 9 millions tons barely in the agriculture, and the same potential on the level of Serbia estimates to almost 13 million tons. This study gives the analysis of energetic exploitation of straws from stubble cereals processed in different forms. Costs for the equipment that uses biomass in the EU are approximately two times higher with respect to those for the equipment for combustion of natural gas or of fuel oil. Costs of investments for combustion of biomass in Vojvodina if compared with the cited data are approximately for 40 - 50 % lower. The difference of the investment costs for the construction of such units is because units for straw combustion designed and constructed in our country, have neither the complicated devices for manipulation of fuels, nor the devices for the waste gasses processing. The definite conclusions about the economic justification of the energetic exploitation of stubble straws can be obtained only by comparison of costs of the so obtained energy, with the costs of energy obtained through the combustion of classical fuels. Previous comparisons were the most often based on the comparisons of value of prices of the equivalent straw quantity with the process of fuel oil of other classical fuels. Such the comparisons leaded to the very positive evaluations of the economical effects of straws, without taking into account the realizability of the named method. Namely, comparisons of <b>straw</b> and fuel <b>oil</b> hardly could lead to the conclusion that these two fuels are mutually substitutable. According to its physical properties, straw is most similar to firewood, but the preciousness and lacking of this the very resource excludes it from the comparative analysis, so that comparisons were performed with respect to coal. The basic reason for the application of coal as the alternative energent is the circumstance that coal represents very often-used energent whose technology of combustion is the most similar to those used for straw, and at the same time, it has not any other application.
