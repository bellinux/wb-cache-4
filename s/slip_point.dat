6000|$|This was the sum {{that brought}} about the only {{cleavage}} in our lives; and so, as he grew older, and trying to part from each other we no longer could, he ceased going to Scotland. But after that I often felt, and especially when we heard guns, how {{the best and most}} secret instincts of him were being stifled. But what was to be done? In that which was left of a clay pigeon he would take not the faintest interest--the scent of it was paltry. Yet always, even in his most cosseted and idle days, he managed to preserve the grave preoccupation of one professionally concerned with retrieving things that smell; and consoled himself with pastimes such as cricket, which he played in a manner highly specialised, following the ball up the moment it left the bowler's hand, and sometimes retrieving it before it reached the batsman. When remonstrated with, he would consider a little, hanging out a pink tongue and looking rather too eagerly at the ball, then canter slowly out to a sort of forward short leg. Why he always chose that particular position it is difficult to say; possibly he could lurk there better than anywhere else, the batsman's eye not being on him, and the bowler's not too much. As a fieldsman he was perfect, but for an occasional belief that he was not merely short leg, but <b>slip,</b> <b>point,</b> midoff, and wicket-keep; and perhaps a tendency to make the ball a little [...] "jubey." [...] But he worked tremendously, watching every movement; for he knew the game thoroughly, and seldom delayed it more than three minutes when he secured the ball. And if that ball were really lost, then indeed he took over the proceedings with an intensity and quiet vigour that destroyed many shrubs, and the solemn satisfaction which comes from being in the very centre of the stage.|$|E

This was first lit in September 1905; in 1916, a short square tower was built on the side of the building, its lantern housing a fourth-order clamshell Fresnel lens visible from the Canadian shore. This building sat at some distance from the keeper's dwelling, a 1½-story house rather larger than the lighthouse proper and situated on the other side of the point. Keepers had to cross a catwalk one-fifth of a mile in length to get from their quarters to the tend the light and fog building.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that <b>slip</b> <b>point</b> of subcutaneous (s. c.) adipose tissue lipids would predict beef carcass quality. To address our hypothesis, 79 M. longissimus dorsi (LD) steaks from cattle of unknown background {{were used to}} provide information on slip points, percentage intramuscular lipid, fatty acid composition, and MUFA:SFA ratios. Overlying s. c. adipose tissue was separated from the muscle lean, which contained intramuscular (i. m.) adipose tissue. Lipids were extracted from s. c. adipose tissue and muscle lean by a modified chloroform:methanol procedure and subjected to various analyses. The hypothesis was tested by developing regression equations to determine which fatty acid variables were most useful in predicting carcass composition. There was a high correlation between s. c. MUFA:SFA ratio and s. c. slip points (P < 0. 001) with an R 2 of 0. 557. Also, the MUFA:SFA fatty acid ratios of s. c. and i. m. adipose tissue were significantly correlated and an R 2 of 0. 440 was observed (P < 0. 001) when regressed against each other. The current data set observed s. c. MUFA:SFA ratios (0. 73) lower than previous studies, which suggests a population of young or unfinished cattle. This study demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to predict the intramuscular lipid (IML) MUFA:SFA ratio by measuring s. c. <b>slip</b> <b>point</b> (R 2 of 0. 097; P < 0. 01). However, our hypothesis of predicting amount of marbling, hence quality grade, from the melting temperature of s. c. adipose tissue lipids proved incorrect (R 2 = 0. 001). Nonetheless, these data indicate that LD fatty acid composition can be estimated by measuring s. c. adipose tissue <b>slip</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of age/weight and {{castration}} on the fatty acid composition and the qualities of pork and pork fat. Thirty hybrid male pigs (50 % Meishan x 50 % Large White) were used. Fifteen were castrated within {{the first two days}} of age and the other fifteen remained entire. At 12 weeks of age, the pigs were divided into three groups, each consisting of five castrates and five boars. Animals were fed a basic standard commercial pelleted diet for 30, 60 or 90 days and then slaughtered, so that the actual age of the pigs at slaughter was 114, 144 and 174 days respectively. Parameters considered for carcass quality were carcass weight, initial pH (pH 45) and ultimate (final) pH (pHu), and P 2 backfat thickness. For pork and pork fat qualities, the following parameters were considered: backfat firmness, <b>slip</b> <b>point,</b> sensory attributes and adipose tissue fatty acid composition. Increasing age/weight significantly increased carcass weight and P 2 backfat thickness (P< 0. 01) and had a greater influence on tenderness and juiciness than sex (P< 0. 001).

30|$|For dynamic rupture simulations, {{we use a}} {{boundary}} integral equation method in the frequency domain (Geubelle and Rice, 1995; Day et al., 2005). The bulk elastic properties are as follows: the Poisson’s ratio is 0.25, the S-wave velocity cu is 3.3 km/s, and the rigidity G is 30.5 GPa. Fault motion at each cell {{is controlled by the}} difference between loading stress τ lo and frictional strength τfs, obeying the equation of motion for a three-dimensional homogeneous elastic body. τ lo at each point changes due to <b>slip</b> at other <b>points.</b> In the conventional treatment, <b>slipping</b> <b>points</b> are distinguished from sticking points. When τ lo < τfs, the slip velocity v is fixed to be zero (sticking) and the shear stress τsh is fixed to be equal to τ lo. Once τ lo tends to exceed τfs, the slip velocity v takes a positive value and τ sh is equal to τfs. As an initial condition on each fault cell, τ sh = τi is set a priori. The distribution of τi used in the simulation is explained in the next subsection. To reduce computational costs, we fix the slip vector perpendicularly to the trench, because seismic inversion studies show that the To-hoku earthquake is basically a pure dip-slip event (e.g., Yagi and Fukahata, 2011).|$|R

Fat thickness, carcass weight, overall maturity, and yield grade of Angus steers were higher than those of Wagyu steers fed either corn (34 %, 22 %, 3 %, and 8 % higher, respectively) or hay diets (20 %, 8 %, 10 %, and 8 % higher, respectively) (P 0. 05). Adipocyte cellularity data demonstrated that both breeds have more cells per gram adipose tissue and smaller cell volumes in i. m. adipose tissue than in s. c. adipose tissue. In s. c. adipose tissue, saturated fatty acids tended to be lower in corn-fed Angus and Wagyu steers than in hay-fed steers (P < 0. 06). Similarly, monounsaturated fatty acids were higher in corn-fed Wagyu and Angus steers than in hay-fed Wagyu and Angus steers (P < 0. 01). <b>Slip</b> <b>point</b> was positively correlated with percentage stearic acid in corn-fed and hay-fed steers, and there was a negative correlation between <b>slip</b> <b>point</b> and the SCD index.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that subcutaneous (s. c.) adipose tissue would differ in monounsaturated (MUFA) and {{saturated fatty acid}} (SFA) composition among different depots throughout a beef carcass. To test this, 50 carcasses {{from a variety of}} breed types and backgrounds were sampled. External fat samples were collected from eight different carcass locations: round, sirloin, loin, rib, chuck, brisket, plate and flank. Samples were used to provide information on slip points, fatty acid composition and MUFA:SFA ratios. Lipids were extracted from s. c. adipose tissue by a modified chloroform:methanol procedure, and fatty acid composition and slip points were measured. The brisket was significantly lower in palmitic (16 : 0) and stearic (18 : 0) acid than the other seven sampling sites (P = 0. 001). The brisket demonstrated the highest values of MUFA (P = 0. 001) with the exception of possessing the lowest value of transvaccenic (18 : 1 t 11) acid (P = 0. 002). There were also significant differences in the amounts of PUFA among the eight sampling sites. The lowest values were from the brisket with a mean of 25. 1. The flank had the highest <b>slip</b> <b>point</b> with a mean of 39. 0 (P ? 0. 001). There was a high negative correlation shown between palmitoleic and stearic acid (R 2 = 0. 827).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that degummed crude canola oil (DCCO) will lower fat melting points (FMP) of both visceral and subcutaneous fats in lambs. Twenty-four lambs comprising purebred and first-cross Merino progeny from Dorset, White Suffolk and Merino sires mated to purebred Merino ewes were supplemented with varying levels of DCCO over a nine-week period. The experimental treatment groups were: Control (1 kg plain wheat-based pellets only), Medium (500 g plain wheat-based pellets + 500 g wheat-based pellets containing DCCO), and High (1 kg wheat-based pellets containing DCCO at a concentration of 50 ml/kg) supplementation levels. The flock comprised eight wether and ewe lambs per treatment. However, at the end of the trial, four Merino ewes were retained in the flock for breeding purposes, while the remaining twenty lambs were slaughtered in a commercial abattoir. Visceral fat samples were taken from the kidney region and subcutaneous fat samples were taken from the Longissimus dorsi muscle. FMP was determined using temperature <b>slip</b> <b>point</b> methodology in the laboratory. DCCO had significant effects on the FMP of both subcutaneous (p 0. 0002) and visceral (p< 0. 0001) fats, with the lowest FMP achieved at high levels of supplementation in both fat depots. Significant sire breed differences (p< 0. 0001) were also detected in which Dorset-sired progeny had the highest melting points in both fat depots. The results of this study indicate that within fat depots, DCCO supplementation produced softer fats with lower melting points, suggesting potentially healthier fats likely to contain higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comAn experiment examined Δ⁹ desaturase activity and FA composition in subcutaneous adipose tissue in two differing breeds of cattle. Jersey-sired cattle had significantly higher rates of desaturase activity than Limousin-sired cattle (1. 55 vs. 0. 75 nmol/mg protein/min). This difference was also demonstrated by a lower concentration of individual (e. g. 18 ∶ 0) and total saturated FA (38. 3 vs. 45. 1 wt%), and a higher concentration of individual (e. g., 16 ∶ 1) and total monounsaturated FA (58. 2 vs. 52. 7 wt%) in the Jersey animals. Other indices of desaturation calculated from the FA composition showed this same difference. The <b>slip</b> <b>point</b> of adipose tissue of Jersey cattle (36. 8 °C) was significantly lower than that of Limousin cattle (39. 2 °C), but Jersey adipose tissue had a greater content of β-carotene. The positive relationship between adipose tissue β-carotene and desaturation opposes the negative relationship between dietary β-carotene and desaturation determined elsewhere. These results, however, lead to the hypothesis that some cattle have a reduced capacity to metabolize β-carotene to various forms of vitamin A, a compound that can reduce Δ⁹ desaturase enzyme activity. In addition, the higher level of intramuscular fat in Jersey cattle (6. 97 vs. 3. 82 %) is possibly related to a lack of inhibition of the adipocyte differentiation genes by vitamin A. B. D.
