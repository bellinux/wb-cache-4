40|$|This paper {{looks to}} provide an {{exploratory}} review {{of the extent to}} which the world’s fastest growing retailers are publicly reporting on their environmental and <b>social</b> commitments and <b>programmes.</b> The paper begins with an outline discussion of corporate environmental and <b>social</b> <b>programmes</b> and on public reporting processes. The paper draws its empirical material from the most recent information on environmental and <b>social</b> commitments and <b>programmes</b> posted on the world’s top twenty fastest growing retailers’ corporate web sites. While the majority of the world’s top twenty fastest growing retailers provide some public information on their commitment to environmental and <b>social</b> <b>programmes</b> there is marked variation in the extent, the nature and the detail of that information. The findings suggest that the integration of environmental and <b>social</b> <b>programmes</b> is not one of the hallmarks of rapidly growing retailers and in part this reflects the fact that many of the selected retailers are trading within emergent markets where price and availability are the principal factors driving consumer buying behavior...|$|R
2500|$|During {{his early}} time as Conservative leader, the party's social policy {{was the most}} {{complicated}} and difficult to agree. In his opening speech as leader {{he said that the}} party would be one of principle, and would not be reactionary, instead sticking to their guns and holding firm policies. Despite this he left women's suffrage alone, leaving the party unwhipped and saying that [...] "the less part we take in this question the better". In terms of social reform (legislation to improve the conditions of the poor and working classes) Law was similarly unenthusiastic, believing that the area was a Liberal one, in which they could not successfully compete. His response to a request by Lord Balcarres for a <b>social</b> <b>programme</b> was simply [...] "As the [...] refuse to formulate their policy in advance we should be equally absolved". His refusal to get drawn in may have actually strengthened his hold over Conservative MPs, many of whom were similarly uninterested in social reform.|$|E

We suggest combining a functional data approach to age-profiles of labour market participation rates with information on education, marital status and other exogenous variables to improve long-term forecasts of labour supply...|$|R
