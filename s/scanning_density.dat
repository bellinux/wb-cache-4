30|$|Protuberances were {{processed}} on the Si surfaces {{under stress}} conditions both lower and {{higher than that}} where plastic deformation occurs. These processed areas were hardly etched by the KOH solution. For protuberances with plastic deformation, the damaged layers were more easily etched than those without plastic deformation. Protuberance formation without plastic deformation by mechanical pre-processing can realize less damaged mask patterning. Additionally, areas at pre-processed low load and <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> were easily etched. This implies that the various profiles obtained were possibly fabricated by the changing load and <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> of the mechanical pre-processing and by additional KOH solution etching. With {{the removal of the}} natural oxide layer and formation of a mechanochemical oxide layer without plastic deformation, the etching depth can be controlled by changing the etching time.

30|$|To {{realize the}} {{nanofabrication}} of silicon surfaces using {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), we investigated the etching of mechanically processed oxide masks using potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The dependence of the KOH solution etching rate on the load and <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> of the mechanical pre-processing was evaluated. Particular load ranges were found to increase the etching rate, and the silicon etching rate also increased with removal of the natural oxide layer by diamond tip sliding. In contrast, the local oxide pattern formed (due to mechanochemical reaction of the silicon) by tip sliding at higher load {{was found to have}} higher etching resistance than that of unprocessed areas. The profile changes caused by the etching of the mechanically pre-processed areas with the KOH solution were also investigated. First, protuberances were processed by diamond tip sliding at lower and higher stresses than that of the shearing strength. Mechanical processing at low load and <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> to remove the natural oxide layer was then performed. The KOH solution selectively etched the low load and <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> processed area first and then etched the unprocessed silicon area. In contrast, the protuberances pre-processed at higher load were hardly etched. The etching resistance of plastic deformed layers was decreased, and their etching rate was increased because of surface damage induced by the pre-processing. These results show that etching depth can be controlled by controlling the etching time through natural oxide layer removal and mechanochemical oxide layer formation. These oxide layer removal and formation processes can be exploited to realize low-damage mask patterns.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{address the}} problem of characterizing {{polygonal}} shapes that can be reconstructed from a class of scanners that have asymmetric resolution. We approach this problem using the methodology of non-interactive probing. Laser raster scanners provide very high precision along the direction of a scan, but it is not practical to place scans very close to each other. A system capable of generating an omni-directional scan pattern can make a series of directional measurements sufficient to permit the reconstruction of a scanned polygon based on the position of edge crossings and the path of the scanning beam between edge crossings. We provide a procedure to reconstruct a polygon from such a data set, as well as a characterization of the shapes that can be reconstructed given a particular <b>scan</b> <b>density.</b> Our system applies to both concave and convex polygons, as well as to polygons containing holes...|$|R

The thick mechanochemically oxidized layer formed suppressed etching by the KOH solution and decreased the etching rate without plastic deformation[19, 20].

These oxide layer removal and formation processes can be exploited to realize low-damage mask patterns[21].|$|E

The majority of images available must be digitized from film and electronically transferred to scientific users. This {{study examined the}} effect of scanning spatial resolution (1200, 2400 pixels per inch [21. 2 and 10. 6 microns/pixel]), <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> range option (Auto, Full) and compression ratio (non-lossy [TIFF], and lossy JPEG 10 : 1, 46 : 1, 83 : 1) on digital classification results of an orbital photograph from the NASA - Johnson Space Center archive. Qualitative results suggested that 1200 ppi was acceptable for visual interpretive uses for major land cover types. Moreover, Auto <b>scanning</b> <b>density</b> range was superior to Full density range. Quantitative assessment of the processing steps indicated that, while 2400 ppi scanning spatial resolution resulted in more classified polygons {{as well as a}} substantially greater proportion of polygons < 0. 2 ha, overall agreement between 1200 ppi and 2400 ppi was quite high. JPEG compression up to approximately 46 : 1 also did not appear to {{have a major impact on}} quantitative classification characteristics. We conclude that both 1200 and 2400 ppi scanning resolutions are acceptable options for this level of land cover classification, as well as a compression ratio at or below approximately 46 : 1. Auto range density should always be used during scanning because it acquires more of the information from the film. The particular combination of scanning spatial resolution and compression level will require a case-by-case decision and will depend upon memory capabilities, analytical objectives and the spatial properties of the objects in the image...|$|E

A laser beam scans laterally from left-to-right at a scanning frequency of ωx, then rapidly moves back to the left, and scans the next line. During this time, the vertical position increases steadily downward at a slow scanning frequency of ωy. The lateral and vertical scanning frequencies determine the line resolution and the frame rate, respectively. This raster scanning provides a rectangular FOV {{as well as a}} simple reconstruction of the scanned images by synchronizing the position of a scanning beam spot with the operational signals. However, raster MEMS scanners have some technical limitations due to high driving voltages or low mechanical stability for the slow axis. In other words, the fast and slow scanning can be often achieved by operating at either resonance or non-resonant frequency. However, the non-resonant motion requires relatively much higher operation voltage than the resonant motion [10]. Rivera et al. have orthogonally attached two piezoelectric bimorphs to a single mode fiber, which shows a resonant motion for the fast lateral axis and a non-resonant motion for the slow vertical axis. Piyawattanametha et al. have successfully demonstrated raster scanning with two resonant MEMS mirrors [11] but the MEMS mirror with a low resonant frequency is vulnerable to the external mechanical shock due to a small spring constant. Do et al. also presented raster scanning endomicroscope using a non-resonant tubular piezoelectric actuator [12].
