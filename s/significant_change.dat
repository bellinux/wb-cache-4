5|$|The {{concept of}} the conatus, as used in Baruch Spinoza's psychology, is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates {{principles}} that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed. One <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the conatus ad motum, (conatus to motion), is not mental, but material.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T. Seaborg.|$|E
5|$|When World War I ended, the German Revolution of 1918–19 {{brought a}} <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in social attitudes, {{including}} more rights for women.

5|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> at {{this time}} was that players were no longer {{required}} {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|During Hansen's tenure, the WRU {{implemented}} a <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> {{in the structure}} of the game domestically. Regional teams were introduced as a tier above the traditional club-based structures in 2003, and the five (then four) regional sides became the top level of domestic professional rugby in the principality. At the 2003 World Cup, Wales scored four tries in their 53–37 loss to New Zealand, and also lost to the eventual tournament winners, England, in their quarter-final, despite outscoring them by three tries to one.|$|E

This segment of the highway (now Gogebic CR519) was transferred back to the county in 1962. M-94 previously looped along Munising-Van Meer-Shingleton Road (now H-58 and H-15) north of M-28 between Munising and Shingleton. This routing was abandoned on November 7, 1963 {{in favor of the}} current concurrency. The last <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> to the M-28 routing occurred on March 3, 1989, when the eastern terminus was moved east to M-129.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch {{into any of the}} game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in {{response}} to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} suggest that he most likely did {{it as part of}} a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E

5|$|<b>Significant</b> <b>change</b> {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E

In 1938, the BBWAA raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote.

5|$|The {{belief and}} {{practices}} of the Hanzhong Celestial Masters had a profound legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism a philosophical pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first Celestial Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements, {{as well as the}} medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first Celestial Masters.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} de Saulles in 1903 {{had led to}} the {{abolition}} of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward's death in 1910, were subject to a design competition won by Bertram Mackennal, who also prepared the medal for the Coronation. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads GEORGIVS V DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND IMP, while no <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.|$|E
