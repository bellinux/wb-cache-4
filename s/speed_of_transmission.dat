25|$|In physiology, {{an action}} {{potential}} {{occurs when the}} membrane potential of a specific axon location rapidly rises and falls: this depolarisation then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarise. In the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model of Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of an action potential was undefined and {{it was assumed that}} adjacent areas became depolarised due to released ion interference with neighbouring channels. Measurements of ion diffusion and radii have since shown this to not be possible. Moreover, contradictory measurements of entropy changes and timing disputed the HH as acting alone. More recent work has shown that the HH action potential is not a single entity but is a coupled synchronised oscillating lipid pulse (action potential pulse) powered by entropy from the HH ion exchanges.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, {{cholesterol}} also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E

500|$|Several notable {{attempts}} {{are being}} made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world, or to eradicate it worldwide. In 2006, the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization plans to dissolve if that goal is accomplished. [...] Several malaria vaccines are in clinical trials, which are intended to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of the disease. , The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria. The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market. [...] Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict the spread of malaria based {{on the availability of}} habitat of malaria-carrying parasites. The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was formed in 2012, [...] "to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination".

2500|$|Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas {{had been}} {{developed}} at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. [...] Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying [...] "intelligence" [...] and the [...] "line speed" [...] at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation [...] (recalling Boltzmann's constant), where W is the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of intelligence, m {{is the number of}} different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and K is a constant. [...] Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as , where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, which has since sometimes been called the hartley in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.|$|E

We consider products that differ for storability, incidence of transportation costs and production technologies so we are able to generalize our findings to the whole EU F&V sector. We employed Granger-Causality tests and estimated Ravallion-type regressions to identify the markets that mainly influence the prices of other markets in the same Region. Finally we adopted an asymmetric threshold autoregressive model to assess the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> price transmisison.

40|$|A {{review of}} the current methods for testing for {{osteoporosis}} has been carried out, followed by porosity, to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and show how a new low-cost testing method could benefit the early onset detection of osteoporosis. The method has then been derived from a review of stress wave testing methods, which are primarily used to detect damage to trees or structures, measuring differences in the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound <b>transmission</b> through impulse or impact, {{as well as the}} resonant frequency of the sample (among other properties). Measurement methods are described {{that can be used to}} detect a change in the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound <b>transmission</b> caused by changes to porosity within a wooden dowel sample. A shaker and force transducer were first used to generate and measure a force applied transversally (perpendicular to the surface) to a solid sample, the transmitted wave was then captured by measuring acceleration on the surface of sample a set distance away from the impulse. Results showed that when the porosity was increased by drilling, the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound was reduced. Attachment via a screw meant that this method would be destructive to the sample, and so the shaker was replaced by an impact hammer. A National Instruments LabView system has been used to acquire the signals using a USB oscilloscope, reliably calculate the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound <b>transmission,</b> and save the data to file. Results for measurements taken with the impact hammer showed that an increase in porosity causes a reduction to the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound <b>transmission,</b> with an average change of - 19. 12 ± 5. 68 m/s per 1 % increase in the porosity of a pine wood sample, and a t-stat p-value of < 0. 05, showing a high statistically significant difference between the means. Regression analysis shows that the change is very close to linear, with an average r 2 value of r 2 = 0. 98931 across the 3 distances measured. The system could be improved in the future with more powerful acquisition hardware, and a more repeatable testing procedure, which could potentially be adapted for use on humans to detect variations in bone density caused by osteoporosis...|$|R
