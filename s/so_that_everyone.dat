25|$|It {{was judged}} good and proper, all {{questions}} and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers {{follow the example}} of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.|$|E
25|$|According to a hadith from Bukhari, an Ifrit {{tried to}} {{interrupt}} the prayers of Muhammed. Muhammed overpowered the Ifrit and wanted to fasten him to a pillar <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> can {{see him in the}} morning. Then, he remembered the statement of Solomon and he dismissed the Ifrit.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation of}} the sexual division of labor finds that males and females cooperate within pair bonds by targeting different foods <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> in the household benefits. Females may target foods that do not conflict with reproduction and child care, while males will target foods that females do not gather, which will reduce variance in daily consumption and provide a broader diet for the family. Foraging specialization in particular food groups should increase skill level and thus foraging success rates for targeted foods.|$|E

40|$|Global poverty, hunger, {{and lack}} of access to save water raise {{problems}} of how to organize human society <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone's</b> needs can be met. Philanthropic proposals, such as Peter Singer's and Peter Unger's, are based on a false analogy to duties of rescue and encourage philanthropic responses, thus closing the discourse to discussion of the causes and remedies of poverty. Radical criticism of capitalist social structures are put off the table, and this is a profound error...|$|R

25|$|Spices, called besamim in Hebrew, often {{stored in}} an artistically {{decorative}} spice container {{in order to}} beautify and honor the Mitzvah, are handed around <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> can smell the fragrance. In many Sephardi and Mizrahi communities, branches of aromatic plants are used for this purpose, while Ashkenazim have traditionally used cloves. A special braided Havdalah candle {{with more than one}} wick is lit, and a blessing is recited. If a special havdalah candle is not available, two candles can be used, and the two flames joined when reciting the blessing.|$|E
25|$|In many congregations it is {{customary}} to {{call all}} eligible {{members of the}} congregation for an aliyah to the Torah on Simhat Torah. To accommodate this the first five aliyot are reread <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> has an opportunity to recite the blessing. To save time, some congregations call people up in groups. Others hold a series of separate minyanim for the Torah reading. In a minority of Orthodox congregations women receive aliyot in single-gender tefillah groups (prayer groups consisting only of women, who pray together), and only men are called to the Torah {{in front of the whole}} congregation.|$|E
25|$|An arts festival {{called the}} Chennai Sangamam, which showcases not only various arts of Tamil Nadu {{but also from}} the {{neighbouring}} states, like kalari (from Kerala), which is a major attraction, is held in January every year. The Speciality of Chennai Sangamam is that the various programmes are held near or at the various famous landmarks in the city <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> in the city has access to the programmes and there is no fee charged for entry for any of the programmes. Pookolam, a form of art that uses coloured flour to create patterns and designs, comes from Kerala, but can be seen in abundance at the time of Onam.|$|E

25|$|The three {{children}} (Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto) who originally {{claimed to have}} seen Our Lady of Fátima also reported seeing a panorama of visions, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. In the fourth edition of her memoirs, written in 1941, Lúcia said that {{on the occasion of}} their third visit to the Cova da Iria, on 13 July 1917, she asked the Lady to tell them who she was, and to perform a miracle <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> would believe. The Lady told her that they should continue to come to the Cova each month until October, when the requested miracle would occur.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the {{segmentation}} approach {{relies on}} adequate fences between consumers <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> doesn't buy {{at the lowest}} price offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The fashion industry uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A backstage pass at a concert {{is a good example}} of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of price elasticity. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O (Origin & Destination) systems.|$|E
500|$|The epic Mahabharata {{states that}} Vishnu crowned Prithu as the {{sovereign}} {{and entered the}} latter's body <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> bows to the king as to god Vishnu.

Further, Dharma (righteousness), Shri (goddess of wealth, beauty and good fortune) and Artha (purpose, material prosperity) established themselves in Prithu.|$|E

On the other hand, Senator and PPD gubernatorial candidate Alejandro García Padilla blamed Fortuño and Pierluisi for the loss during a press conference.|$|E

40|$|Among English-speaking, non-aboriginal Canadians, {{there is}} such a thing as an ethnic Canadian identity. Frequently, {{biological}} ancestry is confused with social ethnicity, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone's</b> "true" identity is presumed to be rooted somewhere else. Yet most people who are born in Canada, or who immigrate to Canada at young ages, become ethnic Canadians. Against this view of Canadianness, illiberal multiculturalists argue for strong identification of Canadians with ancestral ethnic groups. By contrast, the public policy of liberal multiculturalism encourages private, individual choices of identity. Paradoxically, this liberal policy also encourages identification with Canada and Canadian citizenship, both vital to Canadian unity. Canada's multiculturalism policy should not change to the illiberal, group-oriented multiculturalism some critics demand...|$|R

500|$|Conversely, LA Weekly Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "It isn't that Spider-Man is {{inherently}} unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated." [...] Giving it 2.5/4 stars, Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element; [...] "Consider {{the scene where}} Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea." [...] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, [...] "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Rural Juror" [...] {{was filmed}} in early November 2006. Regarding the episode's title, Tina Fey {{explained}} that [...] "it {{came out of}} a discussion in the writers' room" [...] when she asked, [...] "you know what two words I cannot pronounce properly?" [...] After a few abortive efforts by Fey's co-writers, who also made [...] "rural juror" [...] sound akin to [...] "ruhhr-juhhrr," [...] everyone was so pleased that [...] " [...] wanted to hurry up and get it on the air before someone else did." [...] Jenna's film, The Rural Juror, was first mentioned three episodes earlier, in [...] "Tracy Does Conan", and referenced several times later. A running joke throughout the series was the difficulty in pronouncing the film's title, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> thought it was called something different. Throughout the episode, the film was called [...] "Roar Her, Gem Her" [...] by Liz; and also [...] "Oral Germ Whore" [...] and [...] "Roaring Junior" [...] by Pete. This episode also features the first mention of Mitch Lemon (Andy Richter), Liz's brother. Mitch has a form of amnesia, named Trauma Induced Niveaphasia, due to a skiing accident in December 1985.|$|E
