5|$|Fruit bodies {{contains}} a unique <b>sterol</b> molecule called volemolide, a derivative {{of the common}} fungal <b>sterol</b> ergosterol that may have application in fungal chemotaxonomy. A 2001 study identified a further nine sterols, three of which were previously unknown to science. According to the authors, these types of highly oxygenated compounds—similar to sterols found in marine soft coral and sponges—are rare in fungi. The mushroom also contains volemitol (D-glycero-D-mannoheptitol), a seven-carbon sugar alcohol first isolated from the species by the French scientist Émile Bourquelot in 1889. Volemitol occurs as a free sugar in many plant and brown algal species.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on the absorbabihity of individual <b>sterols</b> from a mixture of oyster <b>sterols</b> when administered intragastrically to rats with indwelling catheters in the left thoracic duct. In addition, the effect of oyster <b>sterols</b> on cholesterol absorption has been assessed using [4 -’ 4 C] cholesterol in the mixture, and comparison against absorption of cholesterol alone. The order of absorbabiity (percentage absorption) of individual <b>sterols</b> from the mixture of oyster sterohs was: cholesterol> 26 -carbon <b>sterols</b> dehydrocholesterol> 24 -methylene cholesterol> brassicasterol> plant <b>sterols.</b> The absorption of noncholesterol <b>sterols</b> was 8. 2 ± 0. 8 % of the fed dose, or {{less than half of}} that for an equivalent level of cholesterol alone. The presence of these <b>sterols</b> in mixtures containing cholesterol reduced lymphatic absorption of cholesterol by 25 to 40 % compared to absorption of the same amount of cholesterol administered alone, or to an amount of cholesterol equal to the total oyster <b>sterols,</b> respectively.

50|$|Plant <b>sterols</b> are cholesterol-like {{molecules}} {{found in}} all plant foods, with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils.

5|$|<b>Sterol</b> lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant <b>sterol</b> in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid.

40|$|Plant <b>sterols</b> and stanols {{are added}} to foods such as margarine, milk and bread, because of their {{cholesterol-lowering}} effect. Most foods with such additives are novel foods which must accordingly be assessed and approved {{in terms of their}} potential health risks. Plant <b>sterols</b> are found in low quantities in all fatty plant-based foods such as oils, nuts, seeds and cereals. For humans, they are not essential and are hardly used in the human metabolism. Plant stanols are hydrolysed plant <b>sterols</b> which are not naturally present in plant-based foods. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) below assesses a study from the Netherlands which provides valuable information on the unwanted effects of plant <b>sterols</b> on human retinal microvessels. Retinal vessels analysis is increasingly used for early diagnosis of cardiovascular risks. The findings of the study indicate that intake of plant <b>sterols</b> may entail cardiovascular risks for healthy persons who consume foods containing plant <b>sterols</b> in relatively large quantities and {{over a long period of}} time. Due to the amount of data available, the extent of this potential risk cannot currently be quantified. The BfR has already pointed out in earlier opinions that foods to which plant <b>sterols</b> or stanols are added are largely consumed by persons who do not have increased cholesterol levels as well as by children. The European Food Safety Agency currently recommends that daily consumption of plant <b>sterols</b> and stanols be limited to three grams. In view of the results of the Dutch study, the BfR is of the opinion that the use of plant <b>sterols</b> as a food additive should be reassessed at the European level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Coronary {{patients}} with low baseline ratios of serum cholestanol and plant <b>sterols</b> to cholesterol (indicating low cholesterol absorption) but not {{those with high}} ratios (high absorption) experienced reduced recurrences of coronary events during simvastatin treatment in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. Thus, in the present study, serum cholesterol, its precursor <b>sterols</b> (reflecting cholesterol synthesis), plant <b>sterols</b> (campesterol and sitosterol), and cholestanol were measured before and during a 5 -year period of placebo treatment (n 5433) and simvastatin treatment (n 5434) in patients from a subgroup of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study to determine whether changes in cholesterol synthesis and serum levels were related to cholesterol absorption. Serum cholesterol level was unchanged, the ratios of cholesterol precursor <b>sterols</b> to cholesterol were decreased, and the ratios of plant <b>sterols</b> to cholesterol were increased in relation to increasing baseline ratios of cholestanol quartiles. The latter predicted 5 -year ratios and simvastatin-induced reductions of the precursor <b>sterols,</b> with the lowering of the ratios (cholesterol synthesis reduction) being almost twice higher in the lowest versus the highest quartile. The ratios of plant <b>sterols,</b> especially campesterol, to cholesterol were markedly increased during simvastatin treatment, mostly in subjects with the highest baseline cholestanol quartiles. Simvastatin reduced serum cholesterol more (P 50. 003) in the lowest versus the highest cholestanol quartile during the 5 -year treatment period.

When cholesterol levels fall, SREBP is released from the membrane by proteolysis and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the SRE and transcription {{is enhanced}}. If cholesterol levels rise, proteolytic cleavage of SREBP from the membrane ceases and any proteins in the nucleus are quickly degraded.|$|E

40|$|Carbon isotopic {{composition}} of <b>sterols</b> in marine Holocene sediments, marine sinking particles, tree leaves, and soils were determined. δ 13 C values of algae-derived <b>sterols</b> such as 24 -methylcholesta- 5, 22 -dien- 3 β-ol and dinosterol {{in the marine}} sediments range from – 22. 1 to – 25. 2 ‰, while those of 24 -ethylcholest- 5 -en- 3 β-ol (24 -ethylcholesterol) range from – 22. 6 to – 24. 3 ‰. We conclude that 24 -ethylcholesterol in the marine sediments derives from marine algae, because their δ 13 C values are mark-edly {{different from those of}} the leaves of C 3 (~– 29 ‰) and C 4 (– 14 ‰) plants and similar to those of the algal <b>sterols.</b> spectrometry (GC-IRMS) is useful for tracing the sources of organic compounds.
