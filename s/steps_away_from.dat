5|$|The Royal Hotel in {{the area}} of Woodhill was {{designed}} and built to serve Brunel's railway line which finished a few <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a public authority during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

500|$|Now {{considered}} part of the Mao family, Luo lived with Mao Yichang and Wen Qimei at their home, but was publicly humiliated by her husband's disappearance; some locals considered her to be Yichang's concubine. Luo Yixiu died of dysentery on 11 February 1910, the day after Chinese New Year. Mao Zedong returned home; his father forgave him for his disobedience, and in the autumn of 1910 agreed to finance his son's studies at the Dongshan Higher Primary School, and so Mao left Shaoshanchong. When in 1936 Mao told Snow [...] "I do not consider her my wife", he made no mention of her death. Luo Yixiu's grave is located on the mountain facing Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshanchong, a few <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the tomb of his parents.|$|E

Instead, this series focuses more on Peter's life, Beatrice and her new baby (Petra), Lyle, and Gloria, the receptionist. Toward {{the end of the}} series Peter begins to suffer from small blackouts. He has some minor tests done to find out the cause of the problem. It is {{revealed}} in the last episode that Peter has Type 2 diabetes. When Peter asks the doctor whether he should tell Beatrice and Petra to get checked out, the doctor revealed that diabetes isn't the only thing they discovered.

500|$|The [...] "other poems", which Poe {{admitted}} [...] "perhaps savour {{too much}} of egotism; but they were written by one {{too young to have}} any knowledge of the world but from his own breast". These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event. Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics, beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, and pride in his later works. He would later rewrite one poem, [...] "Imitation", as [...] "A Dream Within a Dream" [...] and use images from [...] "Evening Star" [...] in [...] "Ulalume".|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the {{guidance}} of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: [...] "Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster [...] "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the [...] "Reds" [...] (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the [...] "Whites" [...] (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: [...] "The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world– it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people." ...|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|E

The letters were handwritten on toilet paper inside his cell and neatly folded. In the documentary film The Last Man Hanged Ryan's letter to The Anti-Hanging Committee is read out loud to the public. Ryan wrote; [...] "...I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder." ...|$|E

The tomb is enclosed by the 18th-century shrine, called the Aedicule (Edicule). The Status Quo, a 250-year old understanding between religious communities, applies to the site.|$|E

The Subaltern then commands No. 1 Guard to move into close order, and then dresses it.

2500|$|Lunger {{is perhaps}} most renowned for {{being one of the}} drivers, along with Guy Edwards, Arturo Merzario and Harald Ertl, who saved Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix. Lunger {{described}} Lauda's accident which occurred on the 2nd lap. He went off at a speed of between [...] and [...] [...] He had apparently crashed on exit, went through a couple of rows of catch fence, up a relatively steep bank, and back {{into the middle of the}} track, the Ferrari on fire. Lunger said that Edwards was able to get by Lauda's car to the left but Lunger was unable to avoid the wrecked Ferrari. He made contact about three quarters on because I was committed to a line and couldn't make it through the debris. Ertl followed, colliding with the Ferrari and knocking it into Lunger's Surtees. Lunger's fire extinguishers were set off by the collision which was fortunate and saved time in the rescue. Lunger got out of his Surtees which was tangled up with the Ferrari. The extinguishers going off had dampened the fire somewhat. Workers arrived and kept the fire down, eventually putting foam on the Ferrari. This enabled Lunger and Merzario to get close to the fire, although they could not free Lauda at first. Lauda was conscious, struggling to get free on his own. Again the fire flared up and kept the men back from the car's side. Lunger jumped on top of the Ferrari and grabbed Lauda by his shoulders. Merzario unbuckled the seatbelts and Lunger and Lauda tumbled out of the car as a portion of the cockpit broke apart. As Lauda and Lunger emerged corner workers put foam on them. They lay for a few seconds in the grass. The burning fuel was moving toward them so Lunger and Lauda walked 6 to 8 <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the fire.|$|E
