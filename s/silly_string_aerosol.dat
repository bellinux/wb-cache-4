5000|$|<b>Silly</b> <b>String</b> (generically {{known as}} <b>aerosol</b> <b>string)</b> is a toy of flexible, {{sometimes}} brightly colored, plastic [...] propelled as {{a stream of}} liquid from an aerosol can.

50|$|Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) is a colorless gas usually {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Freon-12, and a {{chlorofluorocarbon}} halomethane (CFC) used as a refrigerant and aerosol spray propellant. Complying with the Montreal Protocol, its manufacture was banned in developed countries (non-article 5 countries) in 1996, and developing countries (article 5 countries) in 2010 due to concerns about its damaging impact to the ozone layer. Its only allowed usage is as fire retardant in submarines and aircraft. It is soluble in many organic solvents. Dichlorodifluoromethane {{was one of the}} original propellants for <b>Silly</b> <b>String.</b> R-12 cylinders are colored white.|$|R

Most notably, they challenged Insane Clown Posse to a match but the two asked The Oddities to substitute for them before the Posse attacked Oddities and helped The Headbangers win.|$|R

Later, the teens throw such things as a bucket of chocolate, <b>Silly</b> <b>String,</b> water balloons and toilet paper at each other. In the end, the teens are covered with their stuff.

5000|$|Two {{teams of}} two {{are given the}} {{opportunity}} to [...] "raid the room" [...] across eight rooms and two rounds to find hidden objects, identified by clues read out by the host prior to raiding. Each room raid lasted 30 seconds and if the object was found, won the team 25 points in the first round, and 50 points in the second. If a team did not find their object, the points went to the other team. Each raid was hectic because the rooms had streamers, confetti and <b>Silly</b> <b>String</b> raining from the ceiling as the raids went on.|$|R
5000|$|There were a {{total of}} three super Madballs in the larger series. In addition, four of the first series of 8 Madballs were each made {{available}} as water-squirting and miniature wind-up variants during the 1980s. There was also a short series of Head-Popping Madballs, where bodies were attached. Each of the heads on the Head-Popping Madballs were interchangeable and were capable of being ejected from the body, creating more possibilities for enjoyment. There was also a vehicle made for the Madballs. It was called the [...] "Madballs Rollercycle". There were countless other licensed Madballs items, such as stickers (non trading), shampoos, Valentine's cards, tablecloths, <b>silly</b> <b>string,</b> party favours, and more along those lines.|$|R
5000|$|A key {{component}} in <b>Silly</b> <b>String</b> is its [...] and the propellant that ejects the product mixture from the can. The product originally used chlorofluorocarbon propellant [...] mixed with Freon 11, both {{part of a}} group of compounds believed to damage the ozone layer. In 1978, the United States banned the use of CFCs like Freon 11 and 12 in aerosol cans. The manufacturers then changed the formulation to use permitted propellants. Aerosol propellants are liquids with very low boiling points. When under pressure inside the can, the propellant is in liquid form, but when the nozzle is opened, it rapidly escapes - along with the compounds mixed in it - and evaporates as it enters the air. The string takes shape as the propellant evaporates.|$|R

After completing the dissection, Reed claims to have discovered the secret of how the Skrulls have been able to conceal their identities. Before he can elaborate, [...] "Hank Pym" [...] reveals himself to be a Skrull and shoots Richards with a weapon that violently leaves his elastic body in a state of chaotic disarray similar to <b>Silly</b> <b>String.</b> In Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four #1, it is shown that a Skrull assumed Reed's form in order to successfully ambush and capture Sue Richards, to facilitate an attack on the Fantastic Four's headquarters.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn {{signed a}} council-backed {{ordinance}} (LAMC Section 56.02) to ban <b>aerosol</b> <b>string</b> in Hollywood on Halloween night.

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the original <b>silly</b> <b>string</b> was accidental. In 1972, A United States Patent was issued to Leonard A. Fish, an inventor, and Robert P. Cox, a chemist, for a [...] "foamable resinous composition." [...] The partners initially {{wanted to create a}} can of aerosol that one would be able to spray on a broken/sprained leg or arm and use as an instant cast. Their invention worked, but when it came down to packaging the can, the two had to test 500 different kinds of nozzles. After having gone through about 30 or 40, Fish came upon one that produced a nice string, which shot about 30 feet across the room. This incident inspired Fish to turn the product into a toy. After altering the formula to be less sticky and adding colors, the pair decided to market their product. Because neither of them knew how to sell toys, they made an appointment with Wham-O in California. Fish describes how, during that meeting, he sprayed the can all over the person he was meeting with and all over his office. This person became very upset and asked him to leave the premises. One day later, Fish received a Western Union Telegram asking him to send 24 cans of [...] "Squibbly" [...] for a market test immediately, signed by the same individual who had kicked him out. He called them back and explained that, after he had finished cleaning up his office, the two owners of Wham-O had come back to talk to him, and one had noticed a piece of the string on a lamp shade—he had overlooked it while cleaning up. He explained where the string came from and the owners quickly asked him to send samples over for a market test. Two weeks later, Wham-O signed a contract with Fish and Cox to license the product now known as <b>Silly</b> <b>String.</b>|$|R
