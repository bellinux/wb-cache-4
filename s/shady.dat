5|$|Archaeologists {{have been}} aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s; early work {{occurred}} at Aspero on the coast, a site identified as early as 1905, and later at Caral further inland.

A 2001 paper in Science, providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in Nature, describing fieldwork and radiocarbon dating across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.|$|E

5|$|By 1969, WMATA {{had decided}} on the current routing and stations, except for the {{extension}} beyond Rockville to <b>Shady</b> Grove. Montgomery County officials opposed ending the Red Line in downtown Rockville, saying it would cause congestion {{in the area and}} use scarce vacant land for a storage yard. Metro decided to propose to extend the red line one more station to <b>Shady</b> Grove and the U.S. Department of Transportation conditionally approved funding for the extension on July 26, 1975. Construction on the Red Line began with a groundbreaking ceremony on December 9, 1969. Construction proved difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required that the Red Line tunnel under that valley, the tunnel in turn caused both the Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground. The Red Line was proposed to tunnel under Yuma Street from Connecticut Avenue to Wisconsin Avenue, but local residents sued and that court case delayed construction of the tunnel for two years, then WMATA finally won the right to build the tunnel there.|$|E
