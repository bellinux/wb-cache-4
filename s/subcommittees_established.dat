40|$|Washington State {{is about}} to {{complete}} a five-year effort to improve the environmental-permitting process for transportation projects. From its start in 2001, the Transportation Permit Efficiency and Accountability Committee (TPEAC) sought to streamline the environmental-permitting process for transportation projects in Washington State. Some {{of the goals of}} TPEAC are to reduce mitigation cost, increase environmental benefit, reduce the redesign of transportation projects, and reduce time required to obtain permits. Passage of the Transportation Streamlining Act by the Washington State Legislature in 2001 began the work of this committee. TPEAC has provided a valuable forum to bring together representatives of all entities involved in transportation permitting. TPEAC participants recognize the relationship between their individual roles and the importance of working together to bring about a more streamlined and integrated permitting process in order to use public resources more efficiently and achieve better environmental results. Several technical <b>subcommittees</b> <b>established</b> by TPEAC have developed some important transportationstreamlining tools and policies that help reduce costs and increase environmental benefits. TPEAC’s work to improve Washington State’s transportation permitting process serves as a model for collaborative, multi-stakeholder efforts to increase regulatory efficiency while maintaining high environmental standards...|$|E

5|$|Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, {{political}} activist, {{and journalist}} {{best known for}} her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as Six Red Months in Russia in 1918. During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate <b>subcommittee</b> <b>established</b> to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.|$|R

50|$|General {{requirements}} for <b>establishing</b> <b>subcommittees</b> are <b>established</b> in House or Senate rules, but specifics {{with respect to}} subcommittee assignments and their jurisdiction are left up to the parent committees. Committees have wide latitude to increase or decrease the number of subcommittees from one congress to the next, including renaming or reassigning jurisdiction among previous subcommittees. Some committees, like the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, often retain a predictable subcommittee structure from year to year, due to the set duties of each subcommittee in drafting annual spending bills. However, even these committees are not immune to organizational changes. New subcommittees on Homeland Security were created in 2003 to handle funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and underwent a joint reorganization during the 110th Congress to better coordinate annual appropriations between the House and Senate.|$|R

40|$|Examining the way low health {{literacy}} effects Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s multicultural communities, this report {{looks at the}} available resources, those that are still required and best practice strategies for enhanced {{health literacy}}. • In 2011, the Ethnic Communities 2 ̆ 7 Council of Victoria (ECCV) Health Policy Subcommittee was made aware of increasing concern, emerging from health service providers, regarding the often very low levels of health literacy present within CALD communities. After much discussion around the reasons why {{this may be the}} case and the impacts this may have, the ECCV Health Policy <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>established</b> the ECCV Health Literacy Working Group. This document is the outcome of the work and consultation undertaken by the ECCV Health Literacy Working Group. This paper aims to provide information and recommendations to the Victorian government, with a view to ensuring that the needs of CALD Victorians are considered in future policies and projects aimed at improving health literacy. Low health literacy is a nation-wide problem and it is extremely costly to all Australians, both in the burden it brings to bear on our healthcare systems and in terms of human costs, such as reduced quality of life for the many Australians who could, potentially, be healthier. For CALD Victorians, the problem of low-health literacy needs to be tackled via targeted strategies and resources, as {{this is the only way}} to overcome exacerbating factors such as language and literacy barriers, differing cultural perceptions of health, culturally unresponsive services and the lifestyle upheavals that can accompany migration and settlement. For the purposes of this paper the key issues identified have been divided into the following four core areas: Health literacy in the current policy context Language, literacy and health literacy Culture and health literacy Community capacity building for improved health literac...|$|R
