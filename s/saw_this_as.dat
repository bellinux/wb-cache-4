5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about {{sixty percent of}} government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of a}} British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of standardization.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{highlighted}} {{the failure of}} EMPG, the holding company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the potential impact on the Irish taxpayers of the loans given by Anglo Irish Bank to the investors in EMPG on 13 January 2010. Lee <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> another example for the urgent need of {{an investigation into the}} Irish banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Goffman <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> book <b>as</b> his magnum opus, {{but it was}} not {{as popular}} as his earlier works.|$|R
50|$|NBC President Brandon Tartikoff <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> series <b>as</b> {{inspired}} by the Lethal Weapon films and Battles was patterned after Pete Rose.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{supporters}} of Daniel O'Connell <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> agreement <b>as</b> {{a betrayal of}} their hopes for a repeal of the Act of Union.|$|R
5|$|Roman Polanski's 1971 {{film version}} of Macbeth {{contained}} many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women. Many critics <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a clear parallel to Macbeth's murders {{at the urging of}} the Three Witches within the film.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the reign}} of Septimius Severus, sun worship had {{increased}} throughout the Empire. Elagabalus <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity to install Elagabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon. The god was renamed Deus Sol Invictus, meaning God the Undefeated Sun, and honored above Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish royal legend, {{probably}} 11th-century, {{contains the}} story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as þunores hlæwe (Old English 'Thunor's mound'). Gabriel Turville-Petre <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god's name.|$|E
50|$|The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson, <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> {{institution}} <b>as</b> a way {{to introduce}} young Jewish women from secular backgrounds to observant Judaism through academic means.|$|R
50|$|In July 1798, the United States {{rescinded}} its {{treaties with}} France, beginning {{two years of}} low-level conflict known as the Quasi-War. L'Ouverture <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> breach <b>as</b> an opportunity.|$|R
50|$|Because polls close {{early in}} Kentucky, many analysts <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> race <b>as</b> a key {{indicator}} and it immediately {{became one of}} the most watched House races in the nation.|$|R
5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E
5|$|As freshmen {{struggled}} with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts {{in the field of}} the current work studied. In their dorms, the college students were known for their lack of respect for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets {{than the rest of the}} university. Meiklejohn <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was a major}} {{backlash}} {{from students}} who <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> event <b>as</b> segregation and [...] "reverse racism" [...] because it would split students into different rooms based on skin colours.|$|R
50|$|As Prime Minister, Lukšić {{remained}} a firm supporter of privatization and {{foreign direct investment}} in the Montenegrin economy, <b>as</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> path <b>as</b> the only one leading to a rapid modernization of the country.|$|R
5000|$|... 1925 - The company {{acquired}} a small, 500-watt radio station, WHO, with a broadcast range of 150 mi. George Kuhns <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> tool <b>as</b> {{a way to}} increase sales. Bankers Life ran WHO until 1930.|$|R
5|$|Dissatisfied {{with city}} politics, and in {{financial}} difficulty {{due to his}} failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on November 10, 1978. However, after {{a meeting with the}} Police Officers' association and the Board of Realtors, White announced that he wanted his seat back. Liberal Supervisors <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity to end the 6-5 split on the Board that blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, {{that he would not be}} reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.|$|E
5|$|Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh {{fell from}} power in 1232. His old rival, Peter des Roches, {{returned}} to England from the crusades in August 1231 and allied himself with Hubert's {{growing number of}} political opponents. He put the case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible {{for a series of}} riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a chance to take back the lands which they had lost to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5000|$|The Worst {{sees the}} band slowing down in {{relation}} to the speed-oriented Hate, and having a better grasp of drum programming. Minelli and Lamounier <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> record <b>as</b> a [...] "summation" [...] of their career.|$|R
50|$|Critics of {{the policy}} <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> {{principle}} <b>as</b> a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the 16th century, indicated the nation's brewing transition to modernity.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Greeks and Romans <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> object <b>as</b> a manger {{from which}} two donkeys, the {{adjacent}} stars Asellus Borealis and Asellus Australis, are eating; {{these are the}} donkeys that Dionysos and Silenus rode into battle against the Titans.|$|R
5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern. Montgomery <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a challenge to his authority and this, along with the lack of discipline in the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|The Xel'Naga then {{discovered}} the Zerg, small parasitic larvae that could control the nervous systems of other species. The Xel'Naga <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> purity of essence, and guided {{the evolution of}} the Zerg as well. However, the Zerg were animals, concerned only with self-preservation. To help further the Zerg as a species, the Xel'Naga created the Overmind, a central consciousness to organize the Zerg. They hid their existence from the Overmind, however. On becoming aware of their existence (after being filled with an overriding directive it could not fight off), the Overmind attacked the Xel'Naga, infesting and destroying the greater whole of the race. In StarCraft II Wings of Liberty, Xel'Naga watchtowers provide vision in a large circular radius around the tower.|$|E
50|$|In January 2004, {{cannabis}} prohibition in the UK was relaxed. Cannabis {{had been}} a class B substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, but became a Class C substance, and some <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> change <b>as</b> approaching decriminalisation.|$|R
50|$|John Calvin <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> verse <b>as</b> {{evidence}} {{that if one}} obeyed God's commands, as Joseph did when he fled to Egypt, and remained steadfast and patient, as Joseph did by staying in Egypt, that one would eventually be rewarded.|$|R
5000|$|Whorf <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> notion <b>as</b> {{derived from}} the Standard Average European {{languages}} in which these thinkers thought: [...] "Newtonian space, time, and matter are no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language. That is where Newton got them." ...|$|R
5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Although the Song dynasty {{was able}} {{to hold back the}} Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), {{initially}} invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and pay tribute to the Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces. The Mongols also invaded Korea, the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle East and the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the pipelines. The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
500|$|Sarcófago's {{fourth and}} final album, The Worst (1997), sees the band slowing down in {{relation}} to the speed-oriented Hate, and having a better grasp of drum programming. Minelli and Lamounier <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> record <b>as</b> a [...] "summation" [...] of their career.|$|R
50|$|Cable {{companies}} <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> regulation <b>as</b> an unlawful intrusion by {{the federal}} government into their business practices, and immediately started challenging the legality of these new rules. Two important United States Supreme Court cases involved a company known as Midwest Video.|$|R
50|$|The tournament was {{sponsored}} by an online gambling consortium, who <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> tournament <b>as</b> a way to gain publicity for itself. Hosted in the Hamburg borough of St. Pauli, Germany, this tournament enabled disputed political entities to play in international competition.|$|R
