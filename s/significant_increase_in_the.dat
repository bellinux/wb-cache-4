An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E
5|$|In Sydney, fear of an {{impending}} Japanese invasion caused {{people to move}} west; housing prices in the Eastern Suburbs dropped, while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly.

At the 2 nd -, 3 rd - and 4 th -week post-IM immunizations (WPIMI), the supplemented V with N (VN) induced the most significant IgM response unlike N alone. At the 2 nd WPIMI, V or VN induced the highest significant IgG levels. At the 2 nd -week post-IP immunization (WPIPI), E and VN induced the most significant IgG levels.

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of plebeian senators.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of diamonds.

After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But {{by the end of}} his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1538, {{the current}} walls of Jerusalem were {{completed}} on {{the orders of}} Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. These walls, along with the internal walls built by the Armenians, determined {{the outline of the}} quarter. In the 1562–63 record, only 189 Armenians were counted, whereas 640 were counted by the Ottomans in 1690, an increase of 239%. According to the chronicler Simeon Lehatsi only some twelve Armenian families lived in Jerusalem in 1615–16. The <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population in 1690 is attributed to urbanization experienced by the Armenians and other Christians. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community.|$|E
40|$|Leisure {{externalities}} across {{households have}} potentially very {{important implications for}} labor market regulations, but they have proven difficult to identify. This paper exploits the unique features of school holidays and regulations about paid leave in France to identify how changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> timing of work and leisure activities for individuals living with children affect the time use decisions of individuals living in other households. We find that exogenous <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> holidays for individuals living with children actually induce very <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> demand for holidays from individuals living in other households. These positive interactions across households are all the more striking as exogenous <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of individuals on holidays are also shown {{to be associated with}} very <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> costs of holidays...|$|R

5|$|In artistic terms, {{there was}} a revival in mosaic, and {{regional}} schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew {{on a range of}} cultural influences. During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression. In philosophy, there was resurgence of classical learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publication of commentaries on classical works. In addition, the first transmission of classical Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean civilization {{originated}} and {{evolved from}} the society {{and culture of the}} Early and Middle Helladic period in mainland Greece under influences from Minoan Crete. Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society, while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of megaron buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.|$|E
5|$|The Kaan dynasty was not {{originally}} {{established at}} Calakmul but rather re-located {{there in the}} 7th Century from another city.

Yuknoom Che'en II was 36 years old {{when he came to the}} throne of Calakmul in AD 636. A <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of stelae at the city began with his reign and 18 stelae were commissioned by the king. Yuknoom Che'en II was probably responsible for the construction of the palace complexes that form a major part of the site core.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E
