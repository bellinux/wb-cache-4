40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to provide {{empirical}} evidence on the growth rates of maize production in three sub - periods in Nigeria namely pre - <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> period, <b>Structural</b> Adjustment Program period and post - <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> period. Secondary data on maize production in Nigeria during the Pre - <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> period (1970 to 1985), Structural Adjustment period (1986 to 1994) and post - <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> period (1995 to 2007) were employed in this study. A growth rate model was used to estimate the growth rates of maize in the three sub - periods. The results of the analysis showed that the instantaneous growth rates of maize production are - 0. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 4 % and the compound rates of growth of maize production are - 0. 001 %, 0. 059 % and 0. 024 % for the pre - <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme,</b> <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> and post - <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> periods respectively. The higher compound growth rate of maize production in the <b>Structural</b> Adjustment <b>Programme</b> period implies that the policy reforms in the period was more effective in ensuring increased growth of maize production over that of other periods in Nigeria. Therefore, despite the myriads of {{problems associated with the}} programme in Nigeria, it was beneficial to maize production in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|A conference {{paper on}} the {{implications}} for social work practice in Africa due to the IMF/World Bank sponsored economic <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>programmes.</b> The main elements involved in the African economic crisis include deteriorating levels of public and private investment, mounting foreign debt:, inflationary budget deficits, incapability of maintaining public expenditure on social services (in particular health and education) and the maintenance of infrastructure generally. This is made worse by drastic declines in production in key sectors and increasing rates of unemployment and overall poverty. <b>Structural</b> adjustment <b>programmes</b> (SAPs) are only the most recent in a long series of similar attempts at resolving this economic crisis in Africa {{during the course of the}} last three decades of post-independence. <b>Structural</b> adjustment <b>programmes</b> (and previous policies, eg those termed "stabilisation programmes" and "economic reform programmes") have had immense impact on the countries undertaking the reforms, and in many cases have created further hardships for vulnerable groups within these countries, however these groups are defined. This paper considers the issue of the implementation of <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>programmes</b> in African countries. The aftermath of these programmes is so profound that almost every aspect of life is affected. As such it is important that social workers become aware of the resulting consequences and consider the implications for their own practice. It is also necessary to consider ways in which knowledge about structural adjustment and its social effects can be incorporated in the curriculum of schools of social work in Africa...|$|R

40|$|For {{close to}} two decades the leading {{international}} financial organizations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have imposed their <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>programme</b> on Third World countries, notably in Sub-Saharan African, creating forms of neoclassical financial management at an unsurpassed rate. However, the thesis argues that this approach does not distinguish adequately between policies favourable to the growth and prosperity of developed countries and those pertaining to developing countries {{in part because the}} paradigm has an impoverished notion of information, communication, and culture. By fostering this economic paradigm in developing countries, these organizations may, in effect, be imposing an inconsistent model on them in many respects. This thesis explores this conundrum with particular reference to the model's concepts of information, communication, and culture and the consequences of these concepts on the application of the model in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Ghana. The thesis employs case studies to demonstrate the impact of cultural imperatives on the neoclassical economic concepts of efficiency of competition, trade liberalization, currency devaluation, public expenditure reduction, and privatization promoted by the <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>programme.</b> It suggests that some of the failures of the programme may be ascribed to the great differences between the imperatives of neoclassical economics and the cultural realities of Sub-Saharan Africa. The thesis takes the position that the incorporation of an understanding of culture and economy {{similar to that of the}} communicologists' holistic and wider perspective on economics and economic systems would ameliorate many weaknesses of the <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>programmes</b> of the IMF and the World Bank and enhance the effectiveness of future <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
