If <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{was coming in}} for a fortune I should believe her; and if <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to have}} misfortunes I should believe her." ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (her lips trembling). <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> mustn't {{forget to}} shield my mouth with my {{handkerchief}} when I cough.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said her}} husband, with a confirmatory nod. [...] "Wonderful is no name for it. I 'ad my fortune told once when I was a boy, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should marry the prettiest, and the nicest, and the sweetest-tempered gal in Poplar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was, sir. When she handled {{her silver}} ornament, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> might depend {{on her to}} forget nothing, and {{to be afraid of}} nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'No, ma'am, I {{came for}} some things Mrs. Grover's got for us. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to. <b>I</b> don't beg.' And up rose the sopping thing with great dignity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sylvia will {{go home to}} her mother, so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yesterday. <b>I</b> {{was present}} at the dissolution. I think she will {{probably}} come to the city this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Drink it; Daddy! Don't {{you know}} that Leila would never forgive me if I let you go home looking like that. Besides, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was to eat. Drink it. You can send her a nice present. Drink it!" [...] And she stamped her foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we'll be in soon, Sara," [...] I said impatiently. But we didn't {{go in for}} an hour, {{and when}} we did Sara was cross, and after Walter had gone <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was a very silly girl to be so {{reckless}} of my health and risk getting pneumonia loitering out in the dew with a sentimental boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Mrs Null, with a laugh, [...] "she {{was not at}} {{home when}} I arrived, but when she {{returned}} nothing could be too good for me. Why, she had been here scarcely half an hour, and hadn't taken off her sun-bonnet, before <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was to marry Junius and we two were to have this farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} last night," [...] said <b>I,</b> [...] "that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> {{was the only}} man in all this earth that she could ever bring herself to love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, smiling; [...] "my work's out yonder. I couldn't sit idle. I think Miss Gladwyne hit it when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> {{was one of}} the pioneers." ...|$|R
60|$|But when Hester {{returned}} {{and found out}} about Hugh she was very angry--and grieved, which hurt <b>me</b> far more. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> had forgotten myself and that Hugh's visits must cease.|$|R
6000|$|... "A feller {{who would}} bother {{a good woman}} like Aunt Hannah deserves to be kicked. She's {{made up her mind}} to give me a chance jest 'cause she thinks it's {{something}} that ought'er be done; but I ain't goin' to play mean with her. It's lucky I happened to hear what was said, else I'd have jumped at the chance of stayin' when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> might." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Foster, [...] "Carmen {{once said}} {{something}} like that, but she was blunt. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> wasn't quite such a fool as I look. However, I haven't much ground for boasting about my exploits. The main results were that I got myself suspected by the police, warned off Daly, and made Lawrence's father think I had murdered him. Now I'd much rather look a simpleton than a homicide!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Nimmie Amee did {{not mention}} her friend's name, and I did not ask her. She took with her all that she could carry of the goods {{that were in the}} Witch's house, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> could have the rest. But when I went there I found nothing worth taking except some magic powders that I {{did not know how to}} use, and a bottle of Magic Glue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'No,' he replied, alarmed, 'I {{would not}} have her know it for worlds. Only {{yesterday}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> reminded her of a fellow she had met at Yarmouth, and my heart was in my mouth.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{exactly what}} <b>I</b> should say. She gave me {{elaborate}} answers to every possible observation of his.|$|R
60|$|This was all--literally all--that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of herself. <b>I</b> {{have never}} {{discovered}} {{more of her}} sad story from that day to this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I told her," [...] {{continued}} Foret, [...] "that if {{he lived}} so long, Cathelineau would reach the hospital {{on the following}} day, and then I hurried on to you. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should find you here. It was then dark, but I reached Chatillon that night, for they sent a guide with me from St. Laurent. I left Chatillon again at the break of day, and have not lost much time in arriving here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Hemphill. [...] "Don't say that! Not for {{the world}} would I give up the memory of hearing her say she once loved me! I don't care how many years ago it was. I am glad you let me come here. I am glad <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> shall never forget the {{happiness}} I have had in this house. And now, Mrs. Easterfield, {{let me ask you}} one thing--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was curious}} to know who the people were who were always {{in the same place}} at the same time, so one day I took my telescope. I could see you plainly. You were reading and had your hat off. When I went back to the hotel I asked Mrs. Allardyce if she knew who the {{boarders}} at Fir Cottage were and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> had heard Connie speak of you, and I determined to make your acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} all that; I haven't seen her. She's staying with Mrs. Steuben. She only came {{a day or two}} ago, and Mrs. Steuben's to bring her. When she wrote to me to ask leave <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>I</b> tell you. They haven't come yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> believe," [...] he said, after a {{brief period}} of hesitation, during which he {{considered}} how best to handle this peculiar artist, [...] "that I will allow you to see your wife at once, that you may learn her plans from her own lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} he has a house in London," [...] the child said. [...] "I really do not know {{anything}} more. You could send to Madame Richard at the Convent St. Argueil. I suppose she knows all about him. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> was to consider him my guardian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I was {{on guard}} {{one day when}} the Queen gave one of her tea-parties to the blind. Awful affair. But the {{children}} are awfully nice children. Prince of Wales awfully nice, almost too nice. Prince Henry smart boy, too--oh, a smart boy. Queen Mary poured the tea, and I handed round bread and butter. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> made a very good waiter. I said, Thank you, Madam. But I like the children. Very different from the Battenbergs. Oh!--" [...] he wrinkled his nose. [...] "I can't stand the Battenbergs." ...|$|E
60|$|FALDER. [Turning to the jury] I {{was having}} my breakfast when she came. Her dress was all torn, {{and she was}} gasping and couldn't seem to get her breath at all; there were the marks of his fingers round her throat; her arm was bruised, and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully. It frightened me, and then when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> felt--I felt--well--it {{was too much for}} me! [Hardening suddenly] If you'd seen it, having the {{feelings}} for her that I had, you'd have felt the same, I know.|$|E
6000|$|One {{day last}} week she distracted me between the {{extremes}} of joy [...] and sorrow. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should see you shortly, and that my [...] coming son would grow {{to be one of}} the most remarkable men in [...] England and Scotland, for his power of foresight; but that I [...] should speedily lose her, and meet with difficulties in my own [...] country, in the same manner as my father, meaning you, sir, had [...] done before me, and on the same account, viz., of civil broils, [...] and intestine wars in Scotland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> afore that <b>I</b> should hear'n; and so I did. They say she's {{clever and}} deep, and perhaps she charmed 'en to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. And I know she's of New England ancestry, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. What <b>I</b> can't {{make out}} is, why {{she joined the}} I.W.W. That seems so contradictory." ...|$|R
60|$|Men {{looked and}} loved {{her as she}} grew, And she was won, alas for me; <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing, but <b>I</b> knew, And saw that sorrow was to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "What she concealed, {{rather than}} what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> believe," [...] {{answered}} Atherton. He ran over the main points of their interview, and summed up his own conjectures. [...] "I know from things Halleck has let drop that they haven't always lived happily together; Hubbard has been speculating with borrowed money, and he's in debt to everybody. She's been alone in her house for a fortnight, and she only came to me because people had begun to press her for money. She's been pretending to the Hallecks that she hears from her husband, and knows where he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} judge {{of that when}} I saw them. I told her I was sorry {{to tell her that}} I feared I must be her lowest-rated customer. 'And perhaps, madam,' said I, 'you will make me the less welcome upon that account.' 'No, not at all,' said she; 'for where I have one of the third sort I have two of the second, and four to one of the first, and I get as much by them in {{proportion}} as by any; but if you doubt my care of you, I will allow any friend you have to overlook and see if you are well waited on or no.' ...|$|E
60|$|Nan here came forward, {{and desired}} him {{to carry her}} commendations and thanks to Madame sa mere, and he bowed, evidently much gratified. She durst not go the length of {{offering}} her good wishes, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to have been}} thankful to her for the forbearance, when, under a strong sense of duty, I reproved her. Technically he was only Maitre Darpent, and his mother only would have been called Mademoiselle. Monsieur and Madame were much more jealously limited to nobility than they are now becoming, and the Darpents would not purchase a patent of nobility to shelter themselves from taxation. For, as Eustace said, the bourgeoisie had its own chivalry of ideas.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{her ability}} was not {{sufficient}} to induce me {{to give up my}} idea. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that after <b>I</b> had known her six months I should detest her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She bade me remember, {{that those}} who dare to love must dare to suffer. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that the wounded stag, 'that from the hunter's aim has ta'en a hurt,' must endure to live, 'left and {{abandoned}} of his velvet friends.'--And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> true. <b>I</b> have not all her courage; but I will take a lesson from her, and learn to suffer--quietly, without a word, if that be possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{always keep}} the peace with me. Isabel even made us a wedding present--a pair of miniatures of my father and mother, that I am very glad to rescue, though, as <b>she</b> politely <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> was welcome to them, for they were hideously dressed, and she wanted the frames for two sweet {{photographs}} of Garibaldi and the Queen of Naples." ...|$|R
