500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E
2500|$|Among Steiner's {{non-traditional}} views, in {{his autobiography}} titled Errata from 1997, Steiner relates his sympathetic stance towards {{the use of public}} houses since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner states, [...] "My virginity offended Alfie (his college room-mate). He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... He <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> fear in me with disdain. And marched me off to Cicero, Illinois, a town justly ill famed but, by virtue of its name, reassuring to me. There he organized, with casual authority, an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness, the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass, that blesses me still." ...|$|E
