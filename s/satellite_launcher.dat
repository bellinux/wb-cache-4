40|$|Data logging applications, such {{as those}} {{deployed}} in <b>satellite</b> <b>launchers</b> to acquire telemetry data, may require compression algorithms to cope with large amounts of data as well as limited storage and communication capabilities. When commercial-off-the-shelf hardware components are used to implement such applications, radiation-induced soft errors may occur, especially during the last stages of the launcher cruise, potentially affecting the algorithm execution. The purpose of this work is to analyze two compression algorithms using fault injection to evaluate their robustness against soft errors. The main contribution {{of the work is}} the analysis of the compression algorithm susceptibility by attacking their data structures (also referred as program variables) rather than the memory elements of the computing platform in charge of the algorithm execution. This approach is agnostic of the downstream implementation details. Instead, the intrinsic robustness of compression algorithms can be evaluated quickly, and system-level decisions can be taken before the computing platform is finalize...|$|R

40|$|Techniques {{for error}} {{detection}} and fault tolerance for distributed real-time systems using fixed priority scheduling {{will be developed}} and studied. Specifically, techniques for node-level transient fault tolerance, and system-level replica determinism will be considered. Error detection and fault tolerance mechanisms will be implemented in a small real-time kernel and evaluated using both VHDL-based fault injection and fault injection in a real system. Fixedpriority scheduling is selected because its use in fault-tolerant systems has not been researched extensively (which {{is the case with}} static scheduling). The real-time kernel will be implemented for the THOR microprocessor developed by Saab Ericsson Space AB, who will supply a detailed VHDL simulation model of THOR and computer boards. 1 Problem statement Embedded hard real-time systems are often used in application where system failures may pose a threat to human lives or cause significant economic loss.

40|$|The Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA), a {{division}} of the Space Operations and Astronaut Training Department of the German Aerospace Center, has developed and flown sounding rocket rate and attitude control systems since 1972. For determining position and attitude, some of the past missions have used a DMARS-R (Digital Miniature Attitude Reference System) roll stabilized platform produced by the Inertial Science Company. The DMARS-R is a high-precision, roll-stabilized IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) comprising accurate angular rate and acceleration sensors and mounted on a roll-stabilized platform. Standard IMUs are inherently subject to drift in inertial position, velocity and attitude. By the fusion of GPS and with DMARS-R data, one can achieve a long-term drift-corrected IMU enabling for longer duration flight applications, such as <b>satellite</b> <b>launchers,</b> spin stabilized rockets and balloons. The main experiment of the MAIUS mission, initially planned for autumn 2015, requires accurate pointing to the Earth’s gravitational center. The required accuracy will be obtained by the fusion of DMARS-R and GNS data to produce “drift free” attitude data for the cold gas attitude control system of the payload. The attitude correction and control algorithm will be implemented in the DMARS-R processor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>launchers</b> are {{submitted}} to severe acoustic loads mainly during lift-off where SPL achieve, {{at the upper}} parts, values {{within the range of}} 140 - 160 dB. Such an excitation can damage embedded elements, if energy attenuation measures are not adopted. In view of managing the PLF vibro-acoustic environment, numerical techniques are applied to predict elasto-acoustic behavior. This manuscript presents a numerical study on the design of acoustic insulation for the VLS- 1 fairing compartment. An excitation profile based on the literature is applied on a SEA coupled model of this structural-acoustic system and absorbing materials are added to the model. Two parameters of the absorbing material layer are analyzed: thickness and covered area. Two NCT modeling approaches are used to simulate the effect of blanketing the VLS- 1 fairing: acoustic materials Biot's parameters, given by the manufacturer, and material samples absorption coefficient, measured in a Kundt Tube. Results show that an increase in the blanket thickness from 7. 62 to 12. 7 cm results in a TL of 1. 7 dB OSPL, while variations of up to 3. 0 dB OSPL are calculated if the fairing cavity blanketed area varies from 30 % to 100 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the robust {{behavior}} in some piece-wise affine systems with minimally spaced transition times is studied. Such systems are found e. g. in <b>satellites</b> and <b>satellite</b> <b>launchers.</b> On-off thrusters are frequently used as actuators for attitude control and are typically subject to switching constraints. In these systems, persistent motions of different nature may occur, such as limit cycles, quasi-periodic-like and chaotic motions. In {{the presence of}} model uncertainties, the emergence of bifurcations in these systems can seriously affect performance. In this contribution, model uncertainties in the actuation device are evaluated in both a structured and an unstructured fashion. Then, Tsypkin’s method is used to investigate the robustness of the condition for of limit cycles. Robustness frontiers {{in the space of}} control parameter are identified. These frontiers are verified via simulation and compared to that given by the describing function method, revealing the difficulties of this latter method to address the robustness analysis in this system. Moreover, we present a design method for robust controllers based on the Hamel locus. An evaluation of performance requirements such as fuel consumption, limit cycle amplitude and transient response is carried out in the identified regions of robust behavior. Thus, we are able to design robust controllers that efficiently exploit the switching-constrained actuators. I...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{identification}} of large aerospace structures like <b>satellites,</b> <b>launcher</b> components or aircraft prototypes, requires a great experimental effort {{in order to}} assure high quality test results. At the same time, {{because of the high}} development costs, a reduction of the test time is needed. In this paper, a test strategy capable to reduce the overall time required to perform dynamic tests aimed to the estimate of the Frequency Response Functions, FRFs, is introduced. A sine sweep excitation is the key point of the approach because of the good compromise between the excitation level and the testing time. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the dynamic identification strongly depends on the non-parametric estimation method used to compute the FRFs from the sine-sweep input-output data. In this paper, the accuracy of the estimates of both the frequency response functions and the modal parameters due to different sweep rates and different FRF estimation methods will be analyzed. These methods include: harmonic estimator, single-block Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), frequency averaging technique, Welch’s method and Reduced Discrete Fourier Transform (RDFT). The performance of the different estimators is critically assessed by a numerical analysis performed on a lumped parameter system and by experimental investigations carried out on both a GARTEUR aircraft scaled model and the Lambert aircraft M 212. ...|$|R
