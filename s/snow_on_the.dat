5|$|Snow affects human {{activity}} in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow {{as a source}} of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.|$|E
5|$|The International Classification for Seasonal <b>Snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ground {{describes}} snow crystal classification, {{once it is}} {{deposited on}} the ground, that include grain shape and grain size. The system also characterizes the snowpack, as the individual crystals metamorphize and coalesce.|$|E

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Boston. The {{probable}} cause of the accident was degraded aerodynamic performance beyond the flight capabilities of the aircraft resulting from an accumulation of ice and <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when the aircraft was flown into moderate to severe icing conditions following takeoff. Contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and passengers on board, there were seven fatalities with one seriously injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E

25|$|A new {{expedition}} organised by Tom Holzel was due {{to explore}} the upper slopes of Everest in December 2011, presumably {{with a view to}} determining the nature of this possible object.

25|$|Lake Erie {{was covered}} by a deep, powdery snow; January's unusually cold {{conditions}} limited the usual thawing and refreezing, so the <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frozen lake remained powdery. The drifted snow on roadways was difficult to clear because the strong wind packed the snow solidly. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists {{had to deal with}} vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds and blowing snow.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} of the tram drivers {{at the time was}} the rolling stock used. When the city's {{railroad}} stock holder Lazar Brodsky died, the stocks were transferred to the Belgian auction firm, and the tram system began running on the Belgian Pullman wagons, with soft, sail-type cloth seats. But not these, nor the earlier seats on the German wagons, gave the tram drivers any comfort while standing in wind, rain, or <b>snow,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's platform on the tram.|$|E
25|$|The {{ocean is}} at its coldest in February or early March, thus around coastal areas February is often the coldest month, but inland {{there is little to}} choose between February and January as the coldest. Temperatures tend to drop lowest on late winter nights inland, in the {{presence}} of high pressure, clear skies, light winds and when there is <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. On occasions, cold polar or continental air can be drawn in over the United Kingdom to bring very cold weather.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December 2010, 'heavy' (9cm, {{according}} to the Heathrow Winter Resilience Enquiry) snowfall caused {{the closure of the}} entire airport, causing one of the largest incidents at Heathrow of all time. 4,000 flights were cancelled over five days and 9,500 passengers spent the night at Heathrow on 18 December following the initial snowfall. The problems were caused not only by <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> runways, but also by snow and ice on the 198 parking stands which were all occupied by aircraft.|$|E
