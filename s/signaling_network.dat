50|$|A {{prime example}} of bistability in {{biological}} systems is that of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a secreted signaling molecule, which plays {{a critical role in}} development. Shh functions in diverse processes in development, including patterning limb bud tissue differentiation. The Shh <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> behaves as a bistable switch, allowing the cell to abruptly switch states at precise Shh concentrations. gli1 and gli2 transcription is activated by Shh, and their gene products act as transcriptional activators for their own expression and for targets downstream of Shh signaling. Simultaneously, the Shh <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> is controlled by a negative feedback loop wherein the Gli transcription factors activate the enhanced transcription of a repressor (Ptc). This <b>signaling</b> <b>network</b> illustrates the simultaneous positive and negative feedback loops whose exquisite sensitivity helps create a bistable switch.|$|E

40|$|<b>Signaling</b> <b>networks</b> mediate {{environmental}} {{information to the}} cell nucleus. To perform this task effectively they {{must be able to}} integrate multiple stimuli and distinguish persistent signals from transient environmental fluctuations. However, the ways in which <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> process environmental noise are not well understood. Here we outline a mathematical framework that relates a network’s structure to its capacity to process noise, and use this framework to dissect the noise-processing ability of <b>signaling</b> <b>networks.</b> We find that complex networks that are dense in directed paths are poor noise processors, while those that are sparse and strongly directional process noise well. These results suggest that while cross-talk between signaling pathways may increase the ability of <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> to integrate multiple stimuli, too much cross-talk may compromise the ability of the <b>network</b> to distinguish <b>signal</b> from noise. To illustrate these general results we consider the structure of the <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> that maintains pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells, and find an incoherent feedforward loop structure involving Stat 3, Tfcp 2 l 1, Esrrb, Klf 2 and Klf 4 is particularly important for noise-processing.

40|$|The {{engineering}} of <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> {{is critical}} as all resulting delays directly affect {{the quality of}} the supported services. In a first step, a generic modelling methodology for the signalling load {{as a result of the}} various communication services is extended in order to include certain implementation-dependent particularities. The approach allows the derivation of virtual processor models, which in a further step are mapped onto the implementation according to individual architectures. The allows the analysis of <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> in a multivendor environment. The consideration of IN applications requires an extension of these concepts. The procedures for ISDN and mobile communications are described in the recommendations and the corresponding signalling scenarios follow straightforwardly. This is not the case for the Intelligent Networks. The IN concept represents a new approach by network providers to the design and provision of new services. A service is defined as a sequence of standaridzed functions (SIBs) and the related signalling scenarios depend on the service definition. In the model derived for the IN level, the <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> is first considered in a higher abstraction level. The information flow in the IN is obtained from a detailed view of the standardized SIBs. This yields the determination of the IN signalling carried by the <b>signalling</b> <b>network.</b> A hierarchical decomposition is applied on the <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> and the IN signalling is mixed with the signalling traffic of supported non-IN networks, e. g., ISDN and mobile communications. Using these principles, a <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> planning tool concept has been developed, which provides the distinct loading of all hard- and software <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> resources in ISDN, IN and mobile communication networks. The results of the hierarchical performance analysis and planning procedures allow the support to the planning of <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> according to given service, load, and grade of service figures.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{applicability}} of computational models inspired by the structure and dynamics of <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> to the control of complex control problems. In particular, this thesis presents two different abstractions that aim to capture the signal processing abilities of biological cells: a stand-alone <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> and a coupled <b>signalling</b> <b>network.</b> While the former mimics the interacting relationships amongst the components in a signalling pathway, the latter replicates the connectionism amongst signalling pathways. After initially investigating the feasibility of these models for controlling two complex numerical dynamical systems, Chirikov's standard map and the Lorenz system, this thesis explores their applicability to a difficult real world control problem, the generation of adaptive rhythmic locomotion patterns within a legged robotic system. The results highlight that the locomotive movements of a six-legged robot could be controlled in order to adapt the robot's trajectory {{in a range of}} challenging environments. In this sense, <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> are responsible for the robot adaptability and inter limb coordination as they self-adjust their dynamics according to the terrain's irregularities. More generally, the results of this thesis highlight the capacity of coupled <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> to decompose non-linear problems into smaller sub-tasks, which can then be independently solved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAltered {{growth factor}} {{responses}} in phospho-protein-driven <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> {{are crucial to}} cancer cell survival and pathology. Profiles of cancer cell <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> might therefore identify mechanisms by which such cells interpret environmental cues for continued growth. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we monitored phospho-protein responses to environmental cues in acute myeloid leukemia at the single cell level. By exposing cancer cell <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> to potentiating inputs, rather than relying upon the basal levels of protein phosphorylation alone, we could discern unique cancer network profiles that correlated with genetics and disease outcome. Strikingly, individual cancers manifested multiple cell subsets with unique network profiles, reflecting cancer heterogeneity {{at the level of}} signaling response. The results revealed a dramatic remodeling of <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> in cancer cells. Thus, single cell measurements of phospho-protein responses reveal shifts in signaling potential of a phospho-protein network, allowing for categorizing of cell network phenotypes by multidimensional molecular profiles of signaling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Signalling</b> <b>network</b> {{inference}} is {{a central}} problem in system biology. Previous studies investigate this problem by independently inferring local <b>signalling</b> <b>networks</b> and then linking them together via crosstalk.

Preferably, a cell-scale <b>signalling</b> <b>network</b> should be inferred as a whole. However, the holistic approach suffers from three practical issues: scalability, measurement and overfitting.

40|$|Molecular <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> are {{believed}} to determine cancer robustness. Although cancer patient survivability was reported to correlate with the heterogeneous connectivity of the <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> inspired by theoretical studies on the increase of network robustness due to the heterogeneous connectivity, other theoretical and data analytic studies suggest an alternative explanation: the impact of modular organization of networks on biological robustness or adaptation to changing environments. In this study, thus, we evaluate whether the modularity [...] robustness hypothesis is applicable to cancer using network analysis. We focus on 14 specific cancer types whose molecular <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> are available in databases, and show that modular organization of cancer <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> {{is associated with the}} patient survival rate. In particular, the cancers with less modular <b>signaling</b> <b>networks</b> are more curable. This result is consistent with a prediction from the modularity [...] robustness hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that the network modularity is a better descriptor of the patient survival rate than the heterogeneous connectivity. However, these results do not contradict the importance of the heterogeneous connectivity. Rather, they provide new and different insights into the relationship between cellular networks and cancer behaviors. Despite several limitations of data analysis, these findings enhance our understanding of adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms of cancer cells. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
