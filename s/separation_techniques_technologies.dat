40|$|Proteins are {{involved}} in every aspects of life: structure, motion, catalysis, recognition and regulation. Today's highly sophisticated science of the modifications of proteins has ancient roots. The tailoring of proteins for food and medical uses precedes {{the beginning of what}} is called biochemistry. Chemical modification of proteins was pursued early in the twentieth century as an analytical procedure for side-chain amino acids. Later, methods were developed for specific inactivation of biologically active proteins and titration of their essential groups. Enzymatic modifications were mainly developed in the seventies when many more enzymes became economically available. Protein engineering has become a valuable tool for creating or improving proteins for practical use and has provided new insights into protein structure and function. The actual and potential use of milk proteins as food ingredients has been a popular topic for research over the past 40 years. With today's sophisticated analytical, biochemical and biological research tools, the presence of compounds with biological activity has been demonstrated. Improvements in <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> and enzyme <b>technology</b> have enabled efficient and economic isolation and modification of milk proteins, which has made possible their use as functional foods, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals and medical foods. In this review, some chemical and enzymatic modifications of milk proteins are described, with particular focus on their functional and biological properties...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of {{spermatozoa}} <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> on sperm quality and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) results for cryopreserved bovine semen. Sephadex, glass wool and Percoll gradient <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> were used for sperm separation and sperm motility, morphology and membrane integrity were evaluated before and after separation. Also, cleavage and blastocyst developmental rate were investigated after IVF with sperm recovered by each <b>separation</b> <b>technique.</b> The motility of samples obtained by the three <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> were greater compared to the control samples (p < 0. 05). The percentage of spermatozoa with intact plasma-membrane integrity, identified by 6 -carboxyfluoresceindiacetate/propidium iodide fluorescent staining and the hypo-osmotic swelling test, was highest in the glass wool filtration samples (p < 0. 05). The cleavage and blastocyst rate of total oocytes produced from glass wool filtration samples were also higher than the control and Sephadex filtration samples (p < 0. 05), but were not significantly different from Percoll separation samples. However, a significantly greater number of cleaved embryos produced by glass wool filtration developed to blastocyst stage than those produced by Percoll separation (p < 0. 05). These results indicate that spermatozoa with good quality can be achieved by these three <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> and can be used for bovine IVF. In particular, it suggests that glass wool filtration would be the most effective method of the three for improving sperm quality and embryo production for cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This work {{presents}} an on-chip ground <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> for power amplifiers. The ground <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> {{is based on}} separating {{the grounds of the}} amplifier stages on the chip and thus any parasitic feedback paths are removed. Simulation and experimental results show that the technique makes the amplifier less sensitive to bondwire inductance, and consequently improves the stability and performance. A two-stage CMOS RF power amplifier for WCDMA mobile phones is designed using the proposed on chip ground <b>separation</b> <b>technique.</b> The power amplifier is fabricated in a 0. 25,utm CMOS process. It has a measured 1 -dB compression point between 1920 MHz and 1980 MHz of 21. 3 ± 0. 5 dBm with a maximum PAE of 24 c.

In order to effectively design the EMI filter a suitable Common Mode/Differential Mode (CM/DM) <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> has been used.

The effectiveness of the proposed CM/DM <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> and the EMI filter features/performance have been assessed by experimental tests, carried out with a 1. 1 kW PWM inverter-fed induction motor drive, supplied by a 48 V DC power grid...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{wide variety}} of audio source <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> exist and can already tackle many {{challenging}} industrial issues. However, in contrast with other application domains, fusion principles were rarely investigated in audio source separation despite their demonstrated potential in classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a general fusion framework which {{takes advantage of the}} diversity of existing <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> in order to improve separation quality. We obtain new source estimates by summing the individual estimates given by different <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> weighted by a set of fusion coefficients. We investigate three alternative fusion methods which are based on standard non-linear optimization, Bayesian model averaging or deep neural networks. Experiments conducted for both speech enhancement and singing voice extraction demonstrate that all the proposed methods outperform traditional model selection. The use of deep neural networks for the estimation of time-varying coefficients notably leads to large quality improvements, up to 3 dB in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) compared to model selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate sound scattering by an object using a two-surface measurement technique that separates the incident field and the scattered field. The <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> is developed in cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. The decomposition method in the cartesian coordinate system is based on the principle that any wave form can be decomposed into plane-wave components by using a two dimensional spatial Fourier transform. For the cylindrical coordinate system, a two plane <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> is based on decomposing the sound field into cylindrical waves. Numerical simulations are performed and the effect of various parameters are investigated. Specifically, the distance between two measurement surfaces, the distance between measurement points, and the aperture size are investigated. In addition, experimental studies were conducted inside an anechoic chamber with a baffled loudspeaker as a source, illuminating four different scatterers. The decomposed scattered field is then used to estimate the far-field target strength. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the field <b>separation</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|R

40|$|Re-Os {{molybdenite}} geochronology {{relies on}} the aliquant analysis taken from a mineral separate. Although suitable for coarse-grained molybdenite samples, traditional mineral <b>separation</b> <b>techniques</b> are not ideally suited for samples possessing fine-grained molybdenite (< 50 mm) and thus hamper the application of Re-Os geochronology for such samples. Here, we demonstrate a room-temperature hydrofluoric acid (HF) chemical <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> {{that is capable of}} isolating ultrafine molybdenite (i. e., < 50 mm) for Re-Os geochronol-ogy. Six Re-Os molybdenite model ages from four molybdenite in-house control and NIST reference material (RM 8599) samples exposed to concentrated HF are indistinguishable from the Re-Os molybdenite model ages for aliquants not exposed to HF. Thus, HF exposure at room temperature has no effect on Re-Os molybdenite systematics. Our HF chemical <b>separation</b> <b>technique</b> was then applied to six ultrafine molybdenite samples from the Lupa goldfield, southwest Tanzania. Three samples from the Kenge deposit provide a weighted average Re-Os molybdenite model age of 1953 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 0. 6; n = 3), whereas three samples and one repeat analysis from the Porcupine deposit provide a weighted average Re-Os molybdenite model age of 1886 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 1. 5; n = 4). Our proposed analytical protocol has allowed us to determine reproducible ages from ultrafine molybdenite samples within the Lupa goldfield that were previously unsuitable for molybdenite Re-Os geochronology using conventional mineral <b>separation</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

When the vapor pressure reaches its surrounding pressure, the liquid mixture boils and distillation occurs because of the differences of volatility in the mixture.|$|R
