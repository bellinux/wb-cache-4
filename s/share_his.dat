These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, they broke from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E

5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and <b>share</b> <b>his</b> views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E

5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not <b>share</b> <b>his</b> caution.|$|E

The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father, Brahmins or the gods and who destroys jewels is punished here. This hell is a 100,000 yojana lake filled with worms. The sinful person is reduced to a worm, who feeds on other worms, who in turn devour his body for 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not <b>share</b> <b>his</b> religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace {{in the minds of the}} British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E

Symeon wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of experiencing directly the grace of God, often talking about his own experiences of God as divine light. Another common subject in his writings was the need of putting oneself under the guidance of a spiritual father. The authority for many of his teachings derived from the traditions of the Desert Fathers, early Christian monks and ascetics. Symeon's writings include Hymns of Divine Love, Ethical Discourses, and The Catechetical Discourses.|$|E
