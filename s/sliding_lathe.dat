"Being {{left open}} to general use, an {{invention}} so vastly important in its character could {{not fail to}} be sought after, {{not only in the}} public at large, but also by agents of the government engaged in the fabrication of arms of various descriptions; and hence we find the gauge and <b>sliding</b> <b>lathe</b> was early introduced and made use of by all the arsenals and armories of the United States." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{experimental}} research findings related to static stiffness of a prototype, heavy vertical lathe KDC 700 / 800 N. Double column heavy, turning and boring lathe (KDC 700 / 800 N) was constructed {{according to a}} planer mill system. The gate overall dimensions are 11200 x 11000 mm. The lathe is also equipped with a sliding carriage beam, with two <b>sliding</b> <b>lathe</b> carriages installed on it. The lathe carriages slide with maximum line feed of 3000 mm. Stiffness research included tests using two methods of static stiffness determination: conventional and dynamic. The article is concluded with {{an analysis of the}} obtained results, which was summarized with conclusions related to properties of the tested machine tool...|$|E
5000|$|In 1862, Thwaites and Carbutt {{exhibited}} {{a selection of}} machine tools at the London Exhibition. These included a seven hundredweight double-action self-acting steam hammer; a four hundredweight double-action single standard hammer; a pillar radial drilling machine; a six-inch centre slide and screw cutting lathe; a [...] "very powerful" [...] planing machine; and a ten-inch centre double-geared <b>slide</b> <b>lathe.</b>|$|R
50|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah {{for the production of}} high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe.</b> Maudslay perfected the <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe,</b> which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw. Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. The <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe</b> was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea.|$|R
25|$|He invented several machine tools, such as {{the first}} fully documented, all metal <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe,</b> around 1751 (Though Derry & Williams place this {{invention}} around 1768). It was described in the Encyclopédie.|$|R
2500|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of Jan Verbruggen. In 1774 Jan Verbruggen had installed a horizontal boring machine in Woolwich {{which was the first}} industrial size Lathe in the UK. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.

50|$|A {{critical}} factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe,</b> screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One {{of the most important}} and versatile of these machine tools was David Wilkinson's lathe, for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.|$|R
50|$|The first fully documented, {{all-metal}} <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe</b> {{was invented}} by Jacques de Vaucanson around 1751. It was described in the Encyclopédie {{a long time before}} Maudslay invented and perfected his version. It is likely that Maudslay was not aware of Vaucanson's work, since his first versions of the slide rest had many errors that were not present in the Vaucanson lathe.|$|R
50|$|The foundry was {{originally}} located on Flinders Lane between King and Spencer streets. Their sole machine tool, when they commenced business, {{was a small}} <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe</b> turned by foot In about 1865 they moved to {{the south side of}} the river, to the Yarra bank near the Spencer Street Bridge, (now occupied by the Robur Tea building), and then in about 1886 they moved to Grant Street, South Melbourne, (later occupied by a subsidiary of the British steel firm Dorman Long & Company.|$|R
5000|$|Interchangeability {{of parts}} was {{achieved}} by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several machine tools, such as the <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe,</b> screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check {{the accuracy of the}} finished parts. [...] Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating line shaft drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible. Modern machine tools often have numerical control (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.|$|R
5000|$|Important early {{machine tools}} {{included}} the <b>slide</b> rest <b>lathe,</b> screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which {{were all in}} use before 1840. [...] With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized. An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts. Before about {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable. [...] Methods were developed to cut screw thread to a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used. This led to the bar length standards of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
40|$|In {{the sensor}} a {{triangulation}} method of displacement measurement has been used. A method of sensor calibration using interferometric distance measurements has been elaborated. Linearity and resolution investigations {{have been performed}} for different parameter sets of sensor transmitting-receiving head. An accuracy of displacement measurements depends on parameters of a beam illuminating a surface being displaced, parameters of a position sensitive detector and on a signal-to-noise ratio of a signal analog processing block. Results of investigations of uncertainties of <b>lathe</b> <b>slide</b> shifts are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Face {{turning of}} optical {{surfaces}} on precision lathes needs high precision tool height adjustment, {{which may be}} a difficult and time-consuming task. In this paper we present a new tool adjustment mechanism based on varying the bearing gap height of the hydrostatic bearings present in precision <b>lathe</b> <b>slides.</b> Slide height variation is realised by influencing the flow to the bearing chambers. This is obtained by adding adjustable restrictions into the oil supply tubes. The bearing stiffness change is limited and stays high in comparison with other machine elements. The realised system has a fine adjustment range of 20 urn, a resolution better than 0. 1 µm and a repeatability error lower than 0. 1 µm...|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1568, a {{separate}} fly wheel powered a lathe via a drive belt. A master {{would cut the}} wood while an apprentice turned the crank on a huge wheel, often several feet in diameter. This was a continuous revolution lathe, which led to adaptation to external power sources such as water, steam, and electricity. This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which {{made it possible to}} turn parts for other machinery. The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic <b>slide</b> rest. These <b>lathes</b> worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony. They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{present study}} {{presents}} {{the influence of}} welding current, welding voltage, welding speed and external magnetic field on hardness of shielded metal arc welded mild steel joints. Mild steel plates of 6 mm thickness were used as the base material for preparing single pass butt welded joints. Speed of welding was provided by cross <b>slide</b> of a <b>lathe</b> machine, external magnetic field was obtained by bar magnets. Hardness properties of the joints fabricated by E- 6013 electrodes as filler metals were evaluated {{and the results were}} reported. From this investigation, {{it was found that the}} hardness of weld decreased if either voltage or current increased, and it increased if either of speed of welding or external magnet field increased. An artificial neural network technique was used to predict the hardness property of the weld for the given welding parameters after training the network. The study reveals that the artificial neural network technique is an efficient tool to predict the hardness correctly if welding parameters are known.

40|$|The {{weld bead}} {{geometry}} influences the mechanical {{properties of the}} weld. The reinforcement height and bead width are important factors of the bead geometry. This study {{is concerned with the}} multi-response optimization of Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) process for an optimal parametric combination to yield favorable weld bead width and reinforcement height of welded joints produced on 5 mm thick mild steel plates using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). To disperse molten droplets of the electrode, a longitudinal external magnetic field was created by a bar magnet which was mounted on the tailstock side of a lathe machine {{with the help of a}} wooden structure. Speed of welding was made constant with the help of the cross <b>slide</b> of the <b>lathe</b> machine. Eighteen experimental data sets were used to train the ANN. Seven experiments were conducted to get other seven sets of data to compare the results obtained with the corresponding prediction made by ANN. It was found that the predictions made by the ANN were very close to the experimental values...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study {{in view of the}} latest {{development}} and revolutionary changes taking place in CNC field through the world, Mechanical elements have to be designed and manufactured to precision, which is perfectly and easily possible through these modern CNC machines. This work is based on the capacity and capability of vertical machining Centre (VTC) with auto tool changer. The top slide which was part programmed can be machined using VTC. And Machining Time is compared in between carbide and hardened tools. The “Top <b>slide</b> ” of <b>lathe’s</b> called for powerful NC programming technique were used absolute position type data input system using G codes, M codes, polar coordinate programs, circular and linear interpolation, canned cycles etc. The above mentioned component – top slide being manufactured by using various Conventional machine tools like horizontal milling, vertical milling, surface grinding, boring machine and slotting machines. This involved a considerable lead time and usually delayed the assembly schedule. it has been modified and adopted for regular production on this machine, in two setups there by boosting their productivity and ensuring quality in each and every piece. Finally, we can establish for regular production...|$|R
50|$|During the First World War {{the firm}} {{supplied}} the Allies {{with an estimated}} 150,000 Ruby-type self-loading pistols. Ironically, the company had first introduced this design in 1911 as the Victoria, a pistol based on the Browning M1903 with improvements patented by Pedro Careaga in 1911, and by the Esperanza y Unceta company in 1912. These patents may have covered the dual-purpose frame-mounted safety (instead of a grip safety), and the method of machining the serrations on the <b>slide</b> using a <b>lathe.</b> The Victoria was in turn copied by Gabilondo y Urresti in 1914, the only real improvement being to increase the magazine capacity to 9 shots and fit a military style lanyard ring. In 1915 Gabilondo sent examples of the pistols to the French government, and after testing was completed in May 1915, the French decided to accept the Ruby as the Pistolet Automatique, Type Ruby. Substantial contracts were awarded to Gabilondo and eight partner companies, and eventually desperation led to over 40 Spanish arms makers, including Esperanza y Unceta receiving contracts totaling at least 710,000 and perhaps as high as 950,000 pistols. Esperanza y Unceta marked their Ruby-types Model 1914, Model 1915, Model 1916, Astra, Brunswig, and Victoria. They were also stamped with the French military identification mark EU on the frame and {{on the base of}} the magazine.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a digital {{position}} control servomechanism, which {{had previously been}} developed by the author and a co-worker, has been fitted to the saddle of a copy turning lathe so that the positioning of the servo ram controls {{the setting of the}} lathe tool relative to the main spindle axis. In this way required workpiece diameters may be preset by means of the input to the digital servo, and it is intended to further develop the system to full numerical control of the machine. The subject of the thesis is the analysis of the performance of the digital servo, both theoretically and practically, the mounting of the servo on the lathe and subsequent accuracy checks on workpieces machined according to preset commands at the input to the servo. Analysis of the performance of the digital servo involved the use of a general purpose digital computer to simmulate the non-linear response characteristics of the system, and the performance tests were carried out using a data sampling technique which is fully described. Since in operation the complete system involves the use of two position servomechanisms in series, and since no overall feedback link is provided, it was also necessary to investigate the performance of the hydraulic positioning system already fitted to the copying <b>slide</b> of the <b>lathe.</b> A series of experiments was therefore set up to measure the lag and response of the hydraulic servo under typical working conditions, in order to establish that this lag could be ignored compared to the lag in the digital system in deciding the overall accuracy of the combined equipment. This work complete with the experimental results obtained is also included...|$|R
