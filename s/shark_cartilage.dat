40|$|Nanomechanical {{testing methods}} that are {{suitable}} {{for a range of}} hydrated tissues are crucial for understanding biological systems. Nanoindentation of tissues can provide valuable insights into biology, tissue engineering and biomimetic design. However, testing hydrated biological samples still remains a significant challenge. <b>Shark</b> jaw <b>cartilage</b> is an ideal substrate for developing a method to test hydrated tissues because it is a unique heterogeneous composite of both mineralized (hard) and non-mineralized (soft) layers and possesses a jaw geometry that is challenging to test mechanically. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a novel method for obtaining multidirectional nanomechanical properties for both layers of jaw cartilage from a single sample, taken from the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). A method for obtaining multidirectional data from a single sample is necessary for examining tissue mechanics in this shark because it is a protected species and hence samples may be difficult to obtain. Results show that this method maintains hydration of samples that would otherwise rapidly dehydrate. Our study is the first analysis of nanomechanical properties of great white <b>shark</b> jaw <b>cartilage.</b> Variation in nanomechanical properties were detected in different orthogonal directions for both layers of jaw cartilage in this species. The data further suggest that the mineralized layer of <b>shark</b> jaw <b>cartilage</b> is less stiff than previously posited. Our method allows multidirectional nanomechanical properties to be obtained from a single, small, hydrated heterogeneous sample. Our technique is therefore suitable for use when specimens are rare, valuable or limited in quantity, such as samples obtained from endangered species or pathological tissues. We also outline a method for tip-to-optic calibration that facilitates nanoindentation of soft biological tissues. Our technique may help address the critical need for a nanomechanical testing method that is applicable to a variety of hydrated biological materials whether soft or hard...|$|R
50|$|Meckel's {{cartilage}} is a {{piece of}} cartilage from which the mandibles (lower jaws) of vertebrates evolved. Originally it was the lower of two cartilages which supported the first gill arch (nearest the front) in early fish. Then it grew longer and stronger, and acquired muscles capable of closing the developing jaw. In early fish and in chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish such as <b>sharks),</b> Meckel's <b>cartilage</b> continued to be the main component of the lower jaw. But in the adult forms of osteichthyans (bony fish) and their descendants (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) the cartilage was covered in bone - although in their embryos the jaw initially develops as the Meckel's cartilage. In tetrapods the cartilage partially ossifies (changes to bone) at the rear end of the jaw and becomes the articular bone, which forms part of the jaw joint in all tetrapods except mammals.|$|R
40|$|Sharks {{have greater}} risk for {{bioaccumulation}} of marine toxins and mercury (Hg), because they are long-lived predators. <b>Shark</b> fins and <b>cartilage</b> also contain β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA), a ubiquitous cyanobacterial toxin linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Today, {{a significant number of}} shark species have found their way onto the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Many species of large sharks are threatened with extinction {{due in part to the}} growing high demand for shark fin soup and, to a lesser extent, for <b>shark</b> meat and <b>cartilage</b> products. Recent studies suggest that the consumption of shark parts may be a route to human exposure of marine toxins. Here, we investigated BMAA and Hg concentrations in fins and muscles sampled in ten species of sharks from the South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. BMAA was detected in all shark species with only seven of the 55 samples analyzed testing below the limit of detection of the assay. Hg concentrations measured in fins and muscle samples from the 10 species ranged from 0. 05 to 13. 23 ng/mg. These analytical test results suggest restricting human consumption of shark meat and fins due to the high frequency and co-occurrence of two synergistic environmental neurotoxic compounds...|$|R

40|$|Human hyaluronidases {{have been}} {{considered}} to be the enzymes acting at the initial step in the catabolism of chondroitin sulfate (CS) in vivo. However, human hyaluronidase- 1 digests CS more slowly than hyaluronan (HA), and its preferred substrate is HA rather than CS. We have identified a chondroitin hydrolase in Caenorhabditis elegans, which effectively degrades chondroitin but depolymerizes HA to a much lesser extent (Kaneiwa T, Yamada S, Mizumoto S, Montaño AM, Mitani S, Sugahara K. 2008. J Biol Chem. 283 : 14971 - 14979), suggesting the existence of CS-specific endoglycosidases in mammalian systems. In this study, human hyaluronidase- 4 was demonstrated to be a CS-specific endo-β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This is the first demonstration of a CS hydrolase in higher organisms. The specificity of a purified recombinant form of the enzyme was investigated in detail through the characterization of degradation products. The best substrate of the CS hydrolase was the galactosaminidic linkage in the sequence of a trisulfated tetrasaccharide GlcUA(2 -O-sulfate) -GalNAc(6 -O-sulfate) -GlcUA-GalNAc(4 -O- or 6 -O-sulfate), where GlcUA and GalNAc represent D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, respectively. The disaccharide unit on the nonreducing side, GlcUA(2 -O-sulfate) -GalNAc(6 -O-sulfate) (D unit), is rich in <b>shark</b> fin <b>cartilage</b> CS-D among various CS isoforms. CS hydrolase will be a useful tool for investigating CS-specific functions in tissues and cells. In addition, it may well be applicable to the treatment of acute spinal cord injuries as in the case of, or instead of, the bacterial CS lyase which has been used for recent clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of {{characterization}} of low molecular weight proteins in cartilage, we have isolated a protein from reef <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus springeri) <b>cartilage</b> that bears {{a striking resemblance to}} the tetranectin monomer originally described by Clemmensen et al. (1986, Eur. J. Biochem. 156, 327 - 333). The protein was isolated by extraction of neural arch cartilage with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, dialysis of the extract to bring the guanidine to 0. 4 M (reassociating proteoglycan aggregates), followed by cesium chloride density gradient removal of the proteoglycans. The amino acid sequence had 166 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 18, 430. The shark protein was 45 % identical to human tetranectin, indicating that it was in the family of mammalian C-type lectins and that it was likely to be a shark analog of human tetranectin. The function of tetranectin is unknown; it was originally isolated by virtue of its affinity for the kringle- 4 domain of plasminogen. Sequence comparison of human tetranectin and the shark-derived protein gives clues to potentially important regions of the molecule...|$|R

40|$|Cartilaginous jaws have {{historically}} been considered primitive in comparison to those of bony fishes. Yet sharks are capable of cutting through materials, such as bone and sea turtle shells, which are paradoxically harder than the jaws themselves. To examine feeding mechanisms in sharks, I used finite element analysis (FEA) to digitally reconstruct the jaws of four shark species: the sandtiger (Carcharias taurus), great white (Carcharodon carcharias), tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). I developed a new method for material testing <b>shark</b> jaw <b>cartilage.</b> Using this method I obtained multi-directional species-specific mechanical properties for jaw cartilage and incorporated these data into the models. I also examined differences between species and ontogenetic changes in mechanical properties of jaw cartilage. The data show several adaptations of shark jaws that are discussed in relation to feeding mechanics. Comparison of the jaws of macropredatory species to the crushing jaws of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) show that there are directional differences in the material properties of jaw cartilage {{that are consistent with}} feeding behaviour in sharks. Furthermore, the data suggest that the jaws of subadult great whites are mechanically vulnerable when handling large prey. Ontogenetic mineralisation of the jaws is thus considered necessary to feed on large marine mammals. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the jaws of the bull shark stiffen with age. As with the great white, the bull shark undergoes dietary shifts to large mammalian prey. Surprisingly, the data reveal that the jaws of sharks are an order of magnitude less stiff than previously believed. This flexibility is exemplified by the highly compliant jaws of the tiger shark, which are here hypothesised to conform to the shape of turtle shells during biting. Close contact between the jaws and teeth may enhance sawing through hard materials by the uniquely shaped teeth of the tiger shark...|$|R
