5|$|Iron ships {{had first}} been {{proposed}} for military {{use in the}} 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> wood.|$|E
5|$|The British Army during World War I was {{the largest}} {{military}} force that Britain had put into the field up to that point. On the Western Front, the British Expeditionary Force ended the war as the strongest fighting force, more experienced than the United States Army and its morale was in better <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the French Army.|$|E

5|$|Blount responded {{fairly well}} to the suspension, {{improving}} his attendance in both academic and athletic pursuits. He was reinstated by newly appointed head coach Chip Kelly in March. He attended some, but not all, voluntary workouts during the off-season, but was praised for an improved attitude by fellow members of the football program. He arrived at training camp in better physical <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> in 2008. At , he was somewhat above his optimal weight, but was slimming down, and aiming for a 2,000 yard season. Blount {{was named to the}} watchlists for the Walter Camp Award and the Doak Walker Award for the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2016, the MassDOT Board {{approved}} {{spending an}} additional $19 million {{to finish the}} station {{by the end of}} September, bringing the total cost of the extension to $93.3 million. The additional cost included replacement for several Pan Am Southern-owned bridges which were in poorer <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> originally thought, and night and weekend work to speed completion. Service to the station had to begin by September 30, or the state risked a revocation of the $59.2 million in federal funds. Limited service began on September 30, 2016, with two weekday round trips; full service began with the schedule change on November 21, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Around 1990 a new {{construction}} technique was invented: in-mould micro shell. A very thin shell was incorporated during the moulding process. This rapidly became the dominant technology, allowing for larger vents {{and more complex}} <b>shapes</b> <b>than</b> hard shells.|$|R

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} had {{infectious}} saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded. All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it {{being used as a}} method of predation is disputable.|$|E
5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

As the British burned Arnold's flagship, the Royal Savage, to the east, the Americans rowed past the British lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is made up}} of the glenoid and humeral head. The humeral head is ball shaped but the glenoid is more dish <b>shaped</b> <b>than</b> cup <b>shaped.</b> To aid stability of the joint, the glenoid has a soft tissue bumper around its edge (the labrum) which acts as a bumper preventing dislocation of the head from the glenoid.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} adaptation to mouth shapes associated with different spoken sounds (sustained /m/ or /u/) on visual perception of lip speech. Participants {{were significantly more likely}} to label ambiguous faces on an /m/-to-/u/ continuum as saying /u/ following adaptation to /m/ mouth <b>shapes</b> <b>than</b> they were in a preadaptation test. By contrast, participants were significantly less likely to label the ambiguous faces as saying /u/ following adaptation to /u/ mouth <b>shapes</b> <b>than</b> they were in a preadaptation test. The magnitude of these aftereffects was equivalent when the same individual was shown in the adaptation and test phases of the experiment and when different individuals were presented in the adaptation and test phases. These findings present novel evidence that adaptation to natural variations in facial appearance influences face perception, and they extend previous research on face aftereffects to visual perception of lip speech...|$|R

However, he injured his knee in the off-season, which could have limited his performance in the 2006 Tour, had he participated (see below).|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×kentuckiense {{is a small}} fern, whose fronds grow in upright, {{spreading}} tufts. The stem is a shiny dark brown, {{the color}} extending well into the leaf blade. The blades are cut into pinnae near the base, which diminish into lobes in the upper part and eventually to teeth {{on the sides of}} a long, drawn-out tip. The fronds are dimorphic, with the fertile fronds much longer and of a different <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the sterile fronds.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape and}} {{position}} of the skull has been perceived {{to be linked to}} how tyrannosaurines would bite, which by extension, probably also links to feeding and killing. This observation suggests that Lythronax had a style of biting rather different from other tyrannosaurines. This has been suggested even though the position of some skulls of tyrannosaurines have been noticed to alter quite considerably. The discovery of Lythronax suggests a very different pattern of evolution for skull <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> has previously been considered.|$|E

He originally planned to keep the exact location a secret to prevent anyone from claiming prizes from it. He considered the site a cemetery, and refused to desecrate it by removing artifacts.|$|E
50|$|In one variation, {{the game}} starts with no blocks on the field. Blocks fall {{down to the}} playing field, and must be removed {{before they reach the}} top.
