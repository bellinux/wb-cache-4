5000|$|Prior to the renovation, the {{original}} floor at Maples {{had a very}} <b>springy</b> <b>feel</b> to it. Designed by Stanford graduate John Carl Warnecke (1919-2010), it was installed when the Pavilion opened in 1969. Nine inches (23 cm) of crosshatched wood and air was supposed to create a coil-spring effect preventing injuries, but often had the opposite effect. [...] It caused a [...] "Missed Stair Effect," [...] a phenomenon that occurs when the body senses where the floor should be upon landing after a jump. With the springy feeling of the floor, often the level would be different from when the player jumped, causing a strange sensation throughout the body.|$|E
6000|$|No {{doubt this}} grief on coming home {{increased}} {{the effect of}} this year of trial. Indeed even on the voyage there had been this admission, 'Somehow I don't feel right with all this holiday; I have worked really very hard, but [...] "change of work is the best holiday." [...] I don't <b>feel</b> <b>springy.</b> I am not so young as I was, that's the truth of it, and this life {{is not likely to be}} a long one. Yet when used up for this work, absence of continual anxiety and more opportunity of relaxation may carry a man on without his being wholly useless!' ...|$|R
50|$|Skookum is {{the name}} of a breed of cat.. It is a small, short-legged cat, very similar to a related breed called the Munchkin, but with curls similar to its other parent breed, the LaPerm. Its head is a broad {{modified}} wedge shape with rounded contours and medium large walnut shaped eyes. The head shows no extremes of features, but the eyes are large for its head and expressive. The neck and body are moderate in type but thickish with a rounded chest and good solid musculature structure. The body should not appear elongated, but tends slightly more towards cobby type. The short yet well proportioned legs have medium boning. The upper and lower forelegs are approximately even in length, as are the thighs and lower legs of the slightly longer hind legs. The feet are well rounded and compact and well planted. The coat {{is the result of the}} LaPerm gene so has a similar soft light airy texture. It should not be overly thick and should stand away from the body on fuzzy ringlets and curls or waves. The curls should not ripple close to the body but should spiral randomly out away from the skin. They can be long haired or short haired and the short coated variety has a coat which is closer to the body but still <b>springy</b> in <b>feel.</b> Regardless of hair length the Skookum should have very prominent curled whiskers and eyebrows. They are fun loving and kittenish cats, playful and athletic and fond of jumping and climbing.|$|R
40|$|Much {{critical}} {{evaluation of}} artist's books {{has been based}} on the review models of art and literature, yet the artist's book is more often than not a physical object - an artefact. Its physical presence and materiality is integral to its reading which invites a haptic reading and evaluation of the book. Haptic communication is communicating by touch. Touch is often intimate, like the reading of a book, and can be used as an act of domination or friendship, depending on the context. Young children and old people use more touching than people in the middle years. We seem to lose our ability to interpret the world by touch as our ability to read the world visually begins to dominate, by learning to read, watching television and using computer technology. Yet we touch materials everyday, but rarely consider that we are unconsciously evaluating the world by touch. Conservators and curators of collections of material culture evaluate artefacts by their materiality, the way the object is made, its material and handling. The book is hand held, we can lift it, it can <b>feel</b> <b>springy</b> on opening, solid or fragile on closing. The shape of the book, its weight, the surface texture of its pages, the way it reacts and moves on opening unconsciously aid our sensory understanding of its contents. Should we consider critically evaluating an artists book by its tactile qualities and its physical handling in conjunction with its conceptual and visual qualities...|$|R
