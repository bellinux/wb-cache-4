5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany in 1899, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization; work lasted until 1902. She was stricken from the naval register on 17 February 1914 {{and used as}} a mine hulk. She was initially based in Danzig, but later moved to Kiel and Wilhelmshaven. On 26 November 1921, Prinzess Wilhelm was sold for 909,000Marks. She was broken up the following year in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|From 1 December 1924, until 1 September 1925, she was {{in reserve}} at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 25 November <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> reduced commission, {{returning}} to full commission 1 September 1926. In early 1927, Mercy was painted white with no hospital markings, {{but by the time}} of a 1931 visit to Vancouver, the markings had been restored.|$|E
5|$|Another fleet {{operation}} {{took place}} on 18–19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Unit training in the Baltic was then conducted, and on the return voyage the III Squadron was diverted {{to assist in the}} recovery of a pair of U-boats stranded on the Danish coast. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including König Albert, were transferred to IV Squadron. König Albert saw no major operations {{in the first half of}} 1917, and on 18 August <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 23 September.|$|E

5|$|Born in East Troy, Wisconsin to a {{dressmaker}} and a dairy-farmer, Hickok had {{an unhappy}} childhood marked by isolation and abuse. After her mother's death when Hickok was fourteen, she left home, worked on her own, and {{completed high school}} {{with the help of}} a cousin. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> journalism after failing out of college, and soon became a successful reporter for the Minneapolis Tribune and the Associated Press (AP), achieving several firsts for American women journalists. By 1932, she had become the nation's best-known female reporter.|$|E
5|$|By 20 October, the {{fighting}} on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On 27 October, Friedrich der Grosse was detached from the Baltic and returned to the North Sea. Upon her return, she resumed guard duties. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23–25 April 1918. Afterward, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> drydock for extensive maintenance, which lasted from 26 July to 28 September.|$|E

5|$|Despite her out-dated design, Démocratie {{served with}} the French Mediterranean Fleet {{throughout}} her career, including during World War I. She participated in the Battle of Antivari in late August 1914, and spent {{the majority of the}} war based on the coast of Greece, in Corfu and Mudros, to keep the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman navies bottled up in port, though she saw no further action. After the end of the war, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the Black Sea to assist in the enforcement of the terms of the Armistice with Germany. Démocratie was stricken in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Z31 was {{transferred}} to Great Britain. Following testing in August 1945, she was passed on to France, being transferred to the French Navy at Cherbourg on 2 February 1946, and was commissioned as Marceau on 1 April. From 1948–1950, Marceau underwent a major refit, in which the forward 10.5cm gun was replaced by a 15.0cm gun, the ship's anti-aircraft outfit changed to eight Bofors 40 mm guns and US radar fitted. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> reserve in 1953, and on 1 February 1954 was laid up as a hulk. She was stricken on 2 January 1958 and sold for scrap later that year, being broken up in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1864 the Beetons again visited the Goubauds in Paris—the couple's third visit to the city—and Isabella was {{pregnant}} during the visit, {{just as she had}} been the previous year. On her return to Britain she began working on an abridged version of the Book of Household Management , which was to be titled The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery. On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day. Isabella began to feel feverish the following day and died of puerperal fever on 6 February at the age of 28.|$|E

5|$|Kaiserin Augusta served abroad between 1897 and 1902, {{primarily}} in the East Asia Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Otto von Diederichs. During this time, the ship's crew assisted in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. In 1902, she returned to Germany for an extensive overhaul that lasted until 1907, after which <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> reserve. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Kaiserin Augusta was mobilized to serve as a gunnery training ship. She served in this role throughout the war; the ship was ultimately sold for scrapping in October 1919 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, {{a second}} child, Kate, was born. Green again {{returned}} to her studies after maternity leave, and by 1985 had completed her fellowship. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> private practice in hematology and oncology while Farrar finished {{the last year of}} his cardiology fellowship. Later Green and Farrar both joined established medical practices in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. After a year, Green started her own private practice, which prospered until she became pregnant and took time off work for another maternity leave. The couple's third child, Kelly, was born on December 13, 1988.|$|E

Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the Mediterranean Sea, stopping in Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, and Villefranche, France. She departed France on 30 November, and arrived in New York on 15 December. There, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914.

5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

5|$|Representing Russia at the Olympics in August, Kuznetsova {{reached the}} quarterfinals before losing to silver-medallist Amélie Mauresmo. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the US Open seeded ninth. There, she {{defeated}} 14th seed Petrova in the quarterfinals, {{and in her}} first Grand Slam semifinal, defeated fifth seed and former champion Davenport, ending the American's 22-match winning streak. In the final, Kuznetsova defeated sixth seed Dementieva. Kuznetsova was the first female Russian to win the US Open and the third to win a Grand Slam singles title, following the successes of Myskina and Maria Sharapova earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Kuznetsova teamed with Likhovtseva to reach {{the final of the}} doubles tournament before losing there to Suarez and Ruano Pascual, marking Kuznetsova's fourth consecutive defeat by the pair in Grand Slams.

5|$|The Yugoslav monitor Vardar was a Sava-class river monitor {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy as SMS Bosna, but was renamed SMS Temes (II) before <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> service. During World War I she was the {{flagship}} of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian Army, the Romanian Navy and Army, and the French Army. She reverted to the name Bosna in May 1917, after the original SMS Temes was raised and returned to service. After brief service with the Hungarian People's Republic {{at the end of}} the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Vardar. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission.|$|E
5|$|To {{avoid having}} to scrap Hiei {{under the terms of}} the Washington Treaty, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to convert her into a demilitarized {{training}} ship. On 15 October 1929, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> drydock at Kure Naval Arsenal. Her aft 14-inch gun turrets were removed, and she was stripped of all eight of her submerged torpedo tubes, as well as her 6-inch guns and armor belt. All but nine of her boilers were taken out, reducing her speed to , and one of her three funnels was removed. She was reclassified as a reserve ship at the end of November 1929. On 24 April 1930, reconstruction was halted due to the signing of the London Naval Treaty, which further restricted battleship construction and possession amongst the great naval powers, and preservation work was begun at Sasebo. Reconstruction would not resume until July 1931.|$|E
5|$|After Jutland, Deutschland and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned to picket duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, Deutschland had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.|$|E
