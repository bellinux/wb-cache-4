50|$|Alternately, musicians may use in-ear monitors, {{which are}} essentially headphones that {{also serve as}} earplugs by {{attenuating}} <b>surrounding</b> <b>sound.</b> In order for in-ear monitors to double up as hearing protection, custom earpieces should be used. The process for having custom earpieces made {{is similar to that}} or the custom musician's earplug and, similarly, the earpiece will be made of silicone or vinyl. While using an in-ear monitor can help protect hearing, the amount of protection provided by the monitor depends on the listening level that the musician chooses. Because of this, if the musician sets the monitor to a high level, the monitor may attenuate <b>surrounding</b> <b>sound</b> while still providing a potentially harmful level of sound directly to the musician's ear and therefore no longer serve a protective function.|$|R

40|$|Hearing {{conservation}} programs (HCPs) often take an atheoretical, information-based approach to reducing noise-induced hearing loss. This research assesses HCPs through a Theory of Planned Behavior lens, {{with the goal}} of understanding subjective norms in children <b>surrounding</b> <b>sound</b> exposure and hearing conservation. Twelve participants engaged in one individual, structured interview. Data analysis consisted of three concurrent activities: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing/verification. This research ensured trustworthiness through the criterion of neutrality, which was achieved through the incorporation of both truth value and consistency. Four major themes emerged from the analysis of interview data: (1) knowledge regarding sound exposure and hearing conservation; (2) stigmatization surrounding the use of hearing protection devices in social settings; (3) emotional responses relating to sound; and (4) situational control influencing behaviour change. The perceived subjective norms <b>surrounding</b> <b>sound</b> exposure and hearing conservation reported by participants reflect an environment inimical to healthy hearing behaviours...|$|R
