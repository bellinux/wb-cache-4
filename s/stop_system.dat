5|$|The Holborn rail crash {{occurred}} on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, standing at the westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency train <b>stop</b> <b>system</b> because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed to stop in time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver failing to control his train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train <b>stop</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Day by day {{the number}} of {{vehicles}} on roads is growing, increasing also {{the number of}} accidents, traffic jams and carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason, the European Union has adopted an action plan for improving urban mobility where the public transport is the main key. To present day, solutions as special bus lanes, electrical and hydrogen buses and rail-guided buses have been tested and implemented in several cities as London and Madrid. In this article an automated <b>stopping</b> <b>system</b> for electrical buses is presented. <b>Stopping</b> <b>system</b> have been implemented by the AUTOPIA program on an electric minibus and tested on a private circuit with satisfactory results.

500|$|The {{labeling}} of the drawbar {{derives from the}} <b>stop</b> <b>system</b> in pipe organs, in which the physical length of the pipe corresponds to the pitch produced. Most Hammonds contain nine drawbars per manual. The drawbar marked [...] "8′" [...] generates the fundamental of the note being played, the drawbar marked [...] "16′" [...] is an octave below, and the drawbars marked [...] "4′", [...] "2′" [...] and [...] "1′" [...] are one, two and three octaves above, respectively. The other drawbars generate various other harmonics and [...] subharmonics of the note. While each individual drawbar generates a relatively pure sound similar to a flute or electronic oscillator, more complex sounds can be created by mixing the drawbars in varying amounts.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the next}} {{regularly}} scheduled Metrolink board meeting after the accident, the board {{decided not to}} wait for PTC {{to be ready for}} deployment before making system safety improvements; instead Metrolink will expand the existing automated train <b>stop</b> <b>system</b> used on [...] of Metrolink track in Orange County across its [...] system. Metrolink's automated train <b>stop</b> <b>system</b> will automatically apply the brakes to stop a train if the engineer fails to respond to a warning within eight seconds. It was originally installed in the 1950s by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to allow trains to operate at speeds of over 79mph under regulations imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a former federal regulatory body whose safety functions have since been assumed by the Federal Railroad Administration. Metrolink also added a second engineer to some trains to improve safety in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to this event, other commuter railroads made statements to reassure their passengers of {{the safety of their}} operations, and these responses provided some perspective on how other operators mitigate related risks. A spokesman for the nation's largest commuter rail operation, the Long Island Rail Road in New York, said that it had studied positive train control, but decided to stick with its [...] "automatic speed control system," [...] a form of cab signaling with automatic train stop using technology that is more than 50 years old. The San Diego's Coaster commuter line also has an automatic train <b>stop</b> <b>system</b> that a spokesman said will stop the train automatically if the engineer fails to stop at a red stop signal.|$|E

50|$|Network {{failures}} typically {{start when}} a single network node fails. Initially, the traffic {{that would normally}} go through the node is <b>stopped.</b> <b>Systems</b> and users get errors {{about not being able}} to reach hosts. Usually, the redundant systems of an ISP respond very quickly, choosing another path through a different backbone. The routing path through this alternative route is longer, with more hops and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered.|$|R
50|$|Sweden is {{the only}} country with which Norway shares railway borders.

There are four border crossings: the Østfold Line-Norway/Vänern Line, the Kongsvinger Line-Värmland Line, the Meråker Line-Central Line and the Ofoten Line-Iron Ore Line.
