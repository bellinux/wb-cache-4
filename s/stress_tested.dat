The crisis contained a wave of bank nationalizations, including those associated with Northern Rock of the UK and IndyMac of the U.S. This crisis was caused by low real interest rates stimulating an asset price bubble fuelled by new financial products that were not <b>stress</b> <b>tested</b> and that failed in the downturn.|$|E
5000|$|To {{determine}} a processors clock speed, the processor is <b>stress</b> <b>tested</b> {{to determine the}} maximum speed that the processor can run before {{the maximum amount of}} power allowed is reached, which is called thermal design power or TDP. It has been reported that customers would complain that the processors rarely consumed the rated TDP, which meant that most consumers do not come close to the power consumed during maximum stress testing. [...] A parameter called Average CPU Power or ACP is used to address this issue. ACP defines the average power expected to be consumed with regular use, whereas TDP gives the top power consumed. Power consumed is an important factor when considering thermal limits and determining CPU power dissipation.|$|E

Those designing <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> must literally imagine possible futures that the financial system might face. As an exercise of the imagination, the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> is limited by the imaginative capacities of those designing the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> scenarios. Sometimes, the <b>stress</b> <b>test's</b> designers fail to imagine plausible future scenarios, possibly because of professional peer pressure or groupthink within a profession or trade (witness the failure of the great majority of financial [...] "experts" [...] to envisage the crash of 2008) or because some things are just too horrible to imagine. The successive financial <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> conducted by the European Banking Authority and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in 2009, 2010 and 2011 illustrate this dynamic. The 2009 and 2010 <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> assumed even in their adverse scenarios a relatively benign macro-economic environment of -0.6% economic growth in the Euro area; by 2011 it was clear that such assumptions were no longer just plausible, they were almost certain to happen; the adverse scenario had to be adjusted to a -4.0% growth scenario.
