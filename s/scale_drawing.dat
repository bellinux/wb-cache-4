50|$|Architectural legend often {{refers to}} designs {{made on the}} back of an envelope/napkin/cigarette packet. Initial {{thoughts}} are important, even if they have to be discarded along the way, because they provide the central idea around which the design can develop. Although a sketch is inaccurate, it is disposable and allows for freedom of thought, for trying different ideas quickly. Choice becomes sharply reduced once the design is committed to a <b>scale</b> <b>drawing,</b> and the sketch stage is almost always essential.|$|E
5000|$|Scale {{drawings}} enable {{dimensions to}} be [...] "read" [...] off the drawing, i.e. measured directly. Imperial scales (feet and inches) are equally readable using an ordinary ruler. On a one-eighth inch to one foot <b>scale</b> <b>drawing,</b> the one-eighth divisions on the ruler {{can be read}} off as feet. Architects normally use a scale ruler with different scales marked on each edge. A third method, used by builders in estimating, is to measure directly off the drawing and multiply by the scale factor.|$|E
5000|$|A jazz {{scale is}} any musical scale used in jazz. Many [...] "jazz scales" [...] are common <b>scales</b> <b>drawn</b> from Western European {{classical}} music, including the diatonic, whole-tone, octatonic (or diminished), and {{the modes of}} the ascending melodic minor. All of these scales were commonly used by {{late nineteenth and early}} twentieth-century composers such as Rimsky-Korsakov, Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky, often in ways that directly anticipate jazz practice. [...] Some jazz scales, such as the bebop scales, add additional chromatic passing tones to the familiar diatonic scales.|$|R

50|$|A divider caliper is {{also used}} to measure a {{distance}} between two points on a map. The two caliper's ends are brought to the two points whose distance is being measured. The caliper's opening is then either measured on a separate ruler and then converted to the actual distance, or it is measured directly on a <b>scale</b> <b>drawn</b> on the map. On a nautical chart the distance is often measured on the latitude scale appearing {{on the sides of the}} map: one minute of arc of latitude is approximately one nautical mile or 1852 metres.|$|R

50|$|On {{a deeper}} level the meaning and value of the {{community}} concept in ecology is up for debate. Communities have traditionally been understood on a fine scale in terms of local processes constructing (or destructing) an assemblage of species, such as the way climate change is likely to affect the make-up of grass communities. Recently this local community focus has been criticised. Robert Ricklefs has argued {{that it is more}} useful to think of communities on a regional <b>scale,</b> <b>drawing</b> on evolutionary taxonomy and biogeography, where some species or clades evolve and others go extinct.|$|E

Coupling this strategy with the proposed early jump scheme, adaptive particle window generation, and efficient preprocessing, we demonstrate that the proposed method runs 34. 5 {{times faster than the}} conventional DPM to detect objects in images, and is able to efficiently detect vehicles and pedestrians in on-road videos.
