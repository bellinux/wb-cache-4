The monitor measures the O 2 uptake and CO 2 production, and calculates the maximum O 2 uptake and anaerobic threshold during an exercise stress test. The system uses two flowmeters in series to achieve a completely automatic calibration, and uses breath-by-breath compensation for sample line-transport delay. The monitor was evaluated using two laboratory methods and was shown to be accurate. The system's block diagram and the bench test <b>setup</b> <b>diagram</b> are included...|$|E
40|$|The SpaceHab 1 flight on STS- 57 {{served as}} a test {{platform}} for evaluation of two space station payloads. The first payload evaluated a space station maintenance concept using a sweep signal generator and a 48 -channel logic analyzer to perform fault detection and isolation. Crew procedures files, test <b>setup</b> <b>diagram</b> files, and software to configure the test equipment were created {{on the ground and}} uplinked on the astronauts' voice communication circuit to perform tests in flight. In order to use these files, the portable computer was operated in a multi-window configuration. The test data transmitted to the ground allowing the ground staff to identify the cause of the fault and provide the crew with the repair procedures and diagrams. The crew successfully repaired the system under test. The second payload investigated hand soldering and de-soldering of standard components on printed circuit (PC) boards in zero gravity. It also used a new type of intra-vehicular foot restraints which uses the neutral body posture in zero-g to provide retention of the crew without their conscious attention...|$|E

The uses of diagrams are studied by examining {{their role in}} Galileo’s work on kinematics and the computational benefits of reasoning with diagrams are investigated by comparing computational models of conventional and diagrammatic approaches to discovery. Diagrams provide a convenient form of representation for experimental setups that preserve valuable topological information about the <b>setups.</b> <b>Diagrams</b> allow the ready-made and powerful inference machinery of Euclidean geometry {{to be used for}} reasoning. When suitable standardization techniques exist, diagrams furnish a basis for reasoning about the magnitudes of dissimilar properties. Diagrams can be deliberately organized to provide perceptual clues to aid the making of inferences, and to act as structured records of the available information. The consequences of this are computational savings in the processes of search and recognition. Finally, the efficiency of inferences can also be improved by replacing expensive forms of reasoning with cheaper perceptual inferences...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Understanding the {{radiative}} {{properties of}} clouds {{is important to}} obtain a more complete understanding of earth's radiation budget. While adequate theoretical models exist for the single scattering properties of ice crystals at solar wavelengths, thermal infrared properties are difficult to obtain because exact solutions of Maxwell's equations are often needed. Laboratory measurements of ice cloud radiative properties are useful for improving the understanding of thermal infrared transfer, and for evaluation of newly developed numerical methods (Yang, et. al., 1997). 2. EXPERIMENTAL <b>SETUP</b> A <b>diagram</b> of the experimental setup {{is shown in figure}} 1. The growth chamber and cloud chambers were both cooled to- 20 C.

USP and CAFS use ultrasound directed through liquid precursors to the surface where capillary wave action from the ultrasound results {{in the formation of}} fine droplets (diameters < 5 μm). 4, 5 A photograph of ultrasonic nebulization of water is shown in Figure 1 a. As shown in Figure 1 b and 1 c, the droplets are carried into a heated furnace where they undergo various reactions, and the products are collected by bubblers or other particle collectors (e. g. cyclonic, electrostatic, etc). Using these techniques submicrometer particles and nanoparticles of metals, 1 metal nitrides, 6 metal oxides, 7 metal chalcogenides, 8, 9 and carbon 10, 11 with novel applications and morphologies have been produced.

40|$|In {{the design}} of a large {{adaptive}} deformable membrane mirror, variable reluctance actuators are used. These consist of a closed magnetic circuit in which a strong permanent magnet provides a static magnetic force on a ferromagnetic core which is suspended in a membrane. By applying a current through the coil which is situated around the magnet, this force is influenced, providing movement of the ferromagnetic core. This movement is transferred via a rod imposing the out-ofplane displacements in the reflective deformable membrane. In the actuator design a match is made between the negative stiffness of the magnet and the positive stiffness of the membrane suspension. If the locality of the influence functions, mirror modes as well as force and power dissipation are taken into account, a resonance frequency of 1500 Hz and an overall stiffness of 1000 N/m for the actuators is needed. The actuators are fabricated and the dynamic response tested in a dedicated <b>setup.</b> The Bode <b>diagram</b> shows a first eigenfrequency of 950 Hz. This is due to a lower magnetic force than expected. A Helmholtz coil setup was designed to measure the differences in a large set of permanent magnets. With the same setup the 2 nd quadrant of the B-H curve is reconstructed by stacking of the magnets and using the demagnetization factor. It is shown that the values for Hc and Br of the magnets are indeed lower than the values used for the initial design. New actuators, with increased magnet thickness, are designed and currently fabricated. Center for Systems and ControlMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{soft matter}} systems exhibit complex {{behaviour}} at the microscopic level. However, at macroscopic length scales the relevant {{degrees of freedom}} are often purely geometrical. Classical differential geometry of curves and surfaces constitutes the most appropriate framework to study the interplay between physical properties and geometry. If one or two dimensions of the material are rnuch srnaller than the others, one can apply an effective description {{in terms of an}} elastic theory for low-dimensional continua. Representative examples are polymers such as DNA, biological fluid membranes, solid shells, elastic sheets, and growing soft thin tissues. However, in some cases internal degrees of freedom, such as the concentration of molecules cornposing the material or the thickness variation due to structural mismatch between surface domains rnust be also considered in the description in order to characterize sorne physical properties in which these microscopic features deeply influence the physical and biological behavior of the material. This thesis is focused on the study of fluid and elastic membranes (surfaces, interfaces), their physical and mathematical features and their possible ability to describe sorne properties of biologicallow-dimensional objects, like lipid vesicles (in the case of fluid surfaces), growing animal and vegetal tissues or other slender structures (in the case of elastic surfaces) or flexible confined sheets. To achieve our purpose we have used mainly theoretical techniques, but also numerics and experimental tools. From the theoretical point of view, a common point on the description of fluid and elastic membranes is the use of variational methods to determine the shape of these low-dimensional objects. In our problems, it will always be possible to write a free energy incorporating their principal elastic features and consequently, their shapes can be obtained using a variational procedure. We discuss how this geometric characteristic may strongly influence several aspects of physical and mechanical properties of these biological objects. This thesis is organized as follows. In Chap. 1 we describe the fundamental properties of natural and synthetic objects in which the theoretical frarnework of fluid and elastic surfaces may be applied. We review sorne previous results involving phase separation of the components of lipid vesicles, the growth of thin elastic structures like soft biological tissues or elastic plates and the confinernent of low-dimensional elastic structures. In Chap. 2 we introduce the theoretical framework that will be used to treat the elastic and rnechanical properties of membranes during the thesis. For this purpose the differential geometry of surfaces and curves is the most appropriate formalism. The principal energy contributions of fluid and elastic interfaces are presented and analyzed. Previous calculations will be generalized incorporating microscopic degrees of freedom in a continuous description. Formulations and results that are presented for fluid surfaces can be easily extended to elastic membranes. In Chap. 3 we use this framework to present a revision of the usual description of inhomogeneous lipid vesicles, incorporating into the continuous formalism elastic microscopic degrees of freedom. The consequences of this modification is analyzed in the budding process occurring in a biphasic axisymmetric vesicle, through the behavior of the line tension and the stability of this process in the final shape of the vesicle. In Chap. 4 we describe the geometry and elasticity of growing slender structures with constant Gaussian curvature. A Hamiltonian description of the evolution of a closed curved in three dimensional space describing a surface with this property is interpreted as a growth process in which the evolving curve is the boundary of the growing surface. This model is used to study isometric embeddings of the pseudosphere and examples of tissues that are observed in nature are analyzed. In Chap. 5 the packing of flexible structures in confined geometries is studied using a simple experimental <b>setup.</b> A phase <b>diagram</b> describing the strength of confinement on the elastic sheets is described and the cascade of bifurcations leading to the preferred spiral structure that minimizes the pressure within the container are also presented. Numerical simulations confirm all the scenarios in the earliest stages of confinement. Typical soft matter systems exhibit complex behaviour at the microscopic level. However, at macroscopic length scales the relevant degrees of freedom are often purely geometrical. Classical differential geometry of curves and surfaces constitutes the mos...|$|R
