5|$|Contrary to all expectations, a {{significant}} amount of support for the young Queen came from Hungary. Her coronation as queen of Hungary took place in St. Martin's Cathedral, Pressburg on 25 June 1741 after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> months honing the equestrian skills necessary for the ceremony and negotiating with the Diet.|$|E

5|$|Seeadler {{remained}} in East Africa {{for the next}} nine years, returning to Germany finally in January 1914. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> over thirteen years abroad since her 1899 modernization, the longest period of continuous overseas service of any major German warship. After arriving in Germany, she was decommissioned. She was not mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, being {{too old to be}} of any fighting value. She was instead used as a mine storage hulk outside Wilhelmshaven. On 19 April 1917, her cargo of mines exploded and destroyed the ship, though there were no casualties. Her wreck was never raised for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When {{the night was}} {{interrupted}} by a neighbour, Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them. Des's fiancée assumed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> the night and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1914, Seeadler {{departed}} East Africa for {{the last}} time, bound for Germany. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> nearly thirteen {{and a half years}} abroad, the longest uninterrupted period of overseas service of any major German warship. Her replacement, her sister , had not yet arrived but was en route. Seeadler stopped in Aden on 22 January, and arrived in Kiel on 18 March. She was then moved to Danzig and decommissioned. On 6 May 1914, she was reclassified as a gunboat. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines since she was no longer fit for active service. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven and anchored in the outer roadstead. On 19 April 1917, her cargo exploded while she was moored in the Jade outside Wilhelmshaven. The explosion destroyed the ship, but there were no casualties; her wreck was never raised.|$|E

25|$|While Lord Sugar {{indicated}} that he thought Andrew should have been brought back into the boardroom instead of Navdeep, since the cakes he baked were deemed to be unimpressive, Navdeep was warned that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> {{too much time in}} the background, and needed to step up in the following task.|$|E

25|$|Tan {{lines on}} her upper body led {{investigators}} {{to believe that}} she had come to the Caledonia area from a distant, warmer locale. While most evidence at the scene had been washed away by heavy rain that night, forensic palynology, or the analysis of pollen on her clothing, suggested <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> time in Florida, southern California, Arizona or northern Mexico prior to her death. Later analysis of isotopes in her bones lent further support to this geographic clue.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Emin had {{her first}} solo {{exhibition}} in the United States at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, entitled Every Part of Me's Bleeding. Later that year, she was a Turner Prize nominee and exhibited My Bed– a readymade installation, consisting of her own unmade dirty bed, in which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> several weeks drinking, smoking, eating, sleeping and having sexual intercourse while undergoing a period of severe emotional flux. The artwork featured used condoms and blood-stained underwear.|$|E
25|$|The second ransom drop was successful. On December 20, Krist {{called and}} gave to a {{switchboard}} operator of the FBI vague directions to Mackle's burial place. The FBI {{set up their}} base in Lawrenceville, Gwinnett’s county seat, and more than 100 agents spread out through the area {{in an attempt to}} find her, digging the ground with their hands and anything they could find to use. Mackle was rescued dehydrated but otherwise unharmed. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> more than three days underground.|$|E
25|$|In May 2004 it was {{reported}} that Outeniqua was soon to be decommissioned. The Navy stated that the ship was to be removed from service as she was becoming increasingly expensive to operate, and was not suitable for supporting the new Valour-class frigates as she was too slow and could not provide them with enough fuel. Outeniqua was subsequently decommissioned on 30 July 2004 and offered for sale. At this time, it {{was reported}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> only a third of her operational career at sea. The ship was eventually sold for R40 million.|$|E

25|$|In a {{scene in}} a bar, the {{character}} of Paul Marrane tells Gloria {{the tale of a}} soldier who goes off to war, first giving his wife a bill of divorce that becomes official if he doesn’t return within 12 months, but then retroactively takes effect from the moment he left; should he not return, this would mean that she would have been divorced during the last 12 months, despite the fact <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> those months married to that very same man. This is a paradox and a contradiction to the law of noncontradiction.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September 1779, Pearl {{engaged the}} 28-gun Santa Monica off the Azores. Pearl left Fayal on 13 September where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> two days taking on {{drinking}} water. At 6:00 the following morning, the Spanish frigate was spotted to the north-west and {{was brought to}} action after a 3½-hour chase. The Santa Monica surrendered after a two-hour engagement, having 38 men killed and 45 wounded. Pearl had 12 killed and 19 wounded. The Santa Monica was a larger frigate than Pearl, at 956 tons burden, but not as well armed; she was rerated as a 36-gun when taken into British service.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} made was that Lois {{did not fall}} in love with just Superman, {{although}} she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The Adventures of Superman #460–463 and Action Comics #650.|$|E
