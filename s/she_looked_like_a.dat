25|$|Durova's {{youthful}} appearance {{hurt her}} chances for promotion. In {{an era when}} Russian officers were expected to grow a mustache <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boy of sixteen. She transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment {{in order to avoid}} the colonel's daughter who had fallen in love with her. Durova saw action again during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. She fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the Battle of Borodino a cannonball wounded her in the leg, yet she continued serving full duty for several days afterward until her command ordered her away to recuperate. She retired from the army in 1816 with the rank of stabs-rotmistr, the equivalent of captain-lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Investigators and the {{prosecution}} suggested during pre-trial motions that Muhammad intended to kill his second ex-wife Mildred, who had estranged him from his children. According to this theory, the other shootings were intended {{to cover up the}} motive for the crime, since Muhammad believed that the police would not focus on an estranged ex-husband as a suspect if <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> random victim of a serial killer. Muhammad frequented the neighborhood where she lived during the attacks, and some of the incidents occurred nearby. Additionally, he had earlier made threats against her. Mildred herself made the claim that she was his intended target. However, Judge LeRoy Millette, Jr. prevented prosecutors from presenting that theory during the trial, saying that a link had not been firmly established.|$|E
500|$|Disappointed at the failure, Catherine {{returned}} to Rome {{and entered the}} Secular Franciscan Order, probably inspired by a monk at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. Shortly before her death, in 1478, Catherine was visited by Nicholas of Ilok, the puppet king of Hungarian-controlled parts of Bosnia. He proposed that she recognize him as legitimate king and attempted to win her favor for several days. Nicholas recorded that the ailing Queen became [...] "so infuriated that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sharp sabre".|$|E

500|$|Between 26 April {{and early}} July 1999, Kouao visited Ealing social {{services}} 18 times for housing and financial purposes. Climbié {{was with her}} on at least ten occasions. The staff there noted Victoria's unkempt appearance, with one staff member, Deborah Gaunt, thinking that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child from an ActionAid advertisement. However, they did not take any action and may have assumed that Victoria's appearance was a purposeful attempt to [...] "persuade the authorities to hand out money". On 8 June 1999, Kouao {{got a job at}} Northwick Park Hospital. During her first month, no effort was made by Kouao or Ealing social services to enroll Climbié in educational or daycare activities.|$|E
500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all you could see, she was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Hairography" [...] in which Rachel is badly made-over by Kurt, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for {{negatively}} highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters. He {{said that while}} he understood this stance, he generally disagreed with it as the show treats male characters equally poorly. However, he wrote that [...] "it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic." [...] Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh has deemed Rachel's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck, commenting: [...] "when we saw Rachel fall for them, she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A, uber-talented, self-involved know-it-all who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships." ...|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} [...] "Diamonds" [...] at the 2013 American Music Awards on November 24, 2013, {{during the}} acceptance of the Icon Award. The performance featured the singer wearing a long black dress plunged down to her navel and diamond adornments in her hair. She was joined by an orchestra that included a conductor which accompanied her as a rock band produced the beat. Kory Grow of Rolling Stone magazine labeled the performance as [...] "stunning". Additionally, out of a total sixteen performances at the ceremony, he placed Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Diamonds" [...] at number one writing, [...] "she gave a performance that showed she could live up to the honor". Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood stated that during the performance Rihanna dominated the stage pointing that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> young version of Grace Jones. The single was included on the set list of Rihanna's joint 2014 tour with rapper Eminem, The Monster Tour. Rihanna performed [...] "Diamonds" [...] on November 11, 2014 during the Concert for Valor held in Washington, D.C. Rihanna performed the single during her concerts part of the Anti World Tour in 2016.|$|E

As a senior at Richard Montgomery High School, she co-wrote [...] "Baltimore" [...] with her brother Mike Amos for a {{competition}} involving the Baltimore Orioles. The song won the contest and became her first single, released as a 7" [...] single pressed locally {{for family and friends}} during 1980 with another Amos-penned composition as a B-side, [...] "Walking With You". Before this, she had performed under her middle name, Ellen, but permanently adopted Tori after a friend's boyfriend told her <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Torrey pine, a tree native to the West Coast.|$|E

2500|$|While Christina may {{not have}} been alone in her own time for {{choosing}} masculine dress (Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, for example, was known for dressing the same way), she also had physical features some described as masculine. According to Henry II, Duke of Guise, [...] "she wears men's shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine". When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a toque and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she [...] "was sunburnt, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and more alarming than attractive".|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on her legacy, William Dalrymple {{writes that}} [...] "it's {{wrong for the}} West simply to mourn Benazir Bhutto as a martyred democrat since her legacy was far murkier and more complex". Despite her western and {{positive}} image in the world, Bhutto's controversial policies and support have made her legacy much more complicated. Benazir Bhutto failed to revert the controversial Hudood Ordinance — a controversial presidential ordinance which suppressed women's rights, making them subordinate to men. In 2009, the CBS News, described her legacy as [...] "mixed", and commented that: [...] "it's only in death that she will become an icon—in some ways people will look at her accomplishments through rose-tinted glasses rather than remembering the corruption charges, her lack of achievements or how much she was manipulated by other people." [...] The Guardian, writing about Benazir, termed her [...] " [...] a victim, {{as well as in}} part a culprit, of its [...] chronic instability". Writing her obituary, The New York Times referred her as [...] "a woman of grand aspirations with a taste for complex political maneuverings". Journalist Adele M. Stan published an article on The American Prospect after her death calling Bhutto [...] "An Imperfect Feminist" [...] and noted [...] "Though <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> walking holy card, Bhutto was hardly a saint. Said to have presided over something of a kleptocracy during her two terms as prime minister, Bhutto also, for all her railing against the mullahs, cut her deals with the religious parties and supported the Taliban's rise to power in neighboring Afghanistan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, {{about everything}} from her appearance (Wyler thought <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, {{but this time she}} held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E

5000|$|The self-schema {{can also}} be self-perpetuating.
