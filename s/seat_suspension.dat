40|$|Many {{off-road}} {{machines are}} equipped with a <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> intended to minimize the vibration exposure of the operator to vertical vibration. The optimization of the isolation characteristics of a <b>suspension</b> <b>seat</b> involves consideration of the dynamic responses of the various components of the seat. Ideally, the seat components would be optimized using a numerical model of the <b>seat.</b> However, <b>seat</b> <b>suspensions</b> are complex with non-linear characteristics {{that are difficult to}} model; the development of <b>seat</b> <b>suspensions</b> is therefore currently more empirical than analytical. This paper presents and compares two alternative methods of modelling the non-linear dynamic behaviour of two <b>suspension</b> <b>seats</b> whose dynamic characteristics were measured in the laboratory. A ‘lumped parameter model’, which represented the dynamic responses of individual seat components, was compared with a global ‘Bouc–Wen model’ having a non-linear degree-of-freedom. Predictions of the vibration dose value for a load placed on the seats were compared with laboratory measurements. The normalized r. m. s. errors between the predictions and the measurements were also determined. The median absolute difference between the measured and predicted seat surface vibration dose values over all test conditions for both models was less than 6 % of the measured value (with an inter-quartile range less than 20 %). Both models were limited by deficiencies in the simulation of top end-stop impacts after the load lifted from the seat surface. The lumped parameter model appears best suited {{to the development of the}} overall design of a <b>suspension</b> <b>seat.</b> The Bouc–Wen model can provide a useful simulation of an existing seat and assist the optimization of an individual component in the seat, without measuring the dynamic properties of components in the seat except those of the component being optimized...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is one of}} very {{important}} components to provide ride comfort, in particular, commercial vehicles, to reduce driver fatigue due to long hours driving. This paper presents a study on active control of <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> to reduce vertical vibration transmitted from uneven road profile to driver body. The control problem will be firstly studied by proposing an integrated <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> model which includes vehicle chassis suspension, <b>seat</b> <b>suspension,</b> and driver body model. This is a new concept {{in the field of}} study because most of the current active and semi-active <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> studies only consider <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> or <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> with human body model, and road disturbance is generally assumed to be applied to the cabin floor directly. Controller design based an integrated model will enable the <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> to perform in a scenario where vibration caused by road disturbance is transmitted from wheel to seat frame and ride comfort performance is evaluated in terms of human body instead of seat frame acceleration. A static output feedback controller is then designed for the <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> with using measurement available signals. Driver mass variation and actuator saturation are also considered in the controller design process. The conditions for designing such a controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. It is shown from the driver body acceleration responses under both bump and random road disturbances that the newly designed <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> can improve vehicle ride comfort regardless of driver body mass variation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} active <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> system for vehicles is presented. This <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> prototype is built with two low cost actuators {{each of which}} has one rotary motor and one gear reducer. A H∞ controller with friction compensation is designed for the <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> control system where the friction is estimated and compensated based on the measurement of seat acceleration. This principal aim of this research was to control the low frequency vibration transferred or amplified by the vehicle (chassis) suspension, and to maintain the passivity of the <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> at high frequency (isolation vibration) while taking into consideration the trade-off between the active <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> cost and its high frequency performance. Sinusoidal excitations of 1 - 4. 5 Hz were applied to test the active <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> both when controlled and when uncontrolled and this is compared with a well-tuned passive heavy duty vehicle <b>seat</b> <b>suspension.</b> The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm within the tested frequencies. Further tests were conducted using the excitations generated from a quarter-car model under bump and random road profiles.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{a method for}} improving vertical whole body vibration isolation through optimal <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> parametric design. The primary thrusts of this investigation are: (1) {{the development of a}} simple model that captures the essential dynamics of a seated human exposed to vertical vibration, (2) the selection and evaluation of several standards for assessing human sensitivity to vertical vibration, and (3) the determination of the linear and nonlinear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> parameters that yield optimal vibration isolation. For the linear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension,</b> results show that the optimal seat damping coefficient depends very much on the selection of the vibration sensitivity standard, on the lower bound of the stiffnesses used in the constrained optimization procedure, and on vibration environments. In all cases, however, the optimal seat damping obtained here is significantly larger (a factor of 2 to 10) than that obtained using existing <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> design methods or from previous optimal suspension studies. This research also indicates that the existing means of assessing vibration in suspension design (ISO 7096) requires modification. For the nonlinear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension,</b> results show that different vibration environments alter the optimal values of all seat parameters, especially the optimal nonlinear damping value; different initial conditions have significant effects on the optimal values of the nonlinear part of the damping; and different human properties have little effect on the optimal values of all seat parameters. In all nonlinear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> cases, the optimal values of the objective function are much smaller than those of the linear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension.</b> The analysis shows that the optimal nonlinear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> is much better than the optimal linear <b>seat</b> <b>suspension</b> and can be realized using a mechanism consisting of linear springs and dampers...|$|E
