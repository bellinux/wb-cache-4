5|$|In {{his first}} cabinet decision, Modi {{set up a}} team to {{investigate}} black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects {{on a number of}} small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced. Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% and <b>Self</b> <b>assessment</b> tax collections rose by 34.25%.|$|E
25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think {{that this can be}} because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (<b>self</b> <b>assessment</b> and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores an {{application}} of an online tool SPARKPLUS (<b>Self</b> and Peer <b>Assessment</b> Resource Kit) for the <b>self</b> and peer <b>assessment</b> on the group-based Honours’ research projects. The Honours’ research projects in School of Civil, Environmental Engineering at University of Adelaide are running in {{a small group of}} students (typically four students or less) working with an academic supervisor in a selected area for one year. Since the research project is self-directed study, {{it is very difficult to}} fairly assess the contribution of individual students to the group-based research project. The paper-based method of <b>self</b> and peer <b>assessment</b> for the Honour’s research projects was used in the previous years. The same mark was often distributed and no feedback was given. Both the students and academic staff were not satisfied with the paper-based method of <b>self</b> and peer <b>assessment.</b> Thus an online tool SPARK PLUS together with a set of assessment criteria was used for the <b>self</b> and peer <b>assessment</b> of the Honours’ research projects in 2010. Thirty-seven groups participated in the <b>self</b> and peer <b>assessment</b> of using SPARK PLUS in semester one 2010 and a series of results from the online <b>self</b> and peer <b>assessment</b> were obtained and analysed. Feedback sessions were held and substantial feedback was received from students.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} for affective characterization of movie scenes {{based on the}} emotions that are actually felt by spectators. Such a representation {{can be used to}} characterize the emotional content of video clips in application areas such as affective video indexing and retrieval, and neuromarketing studies. A dataset of 64 different scenes from eight movies was shown to eight participants. While watching these scenes, their physiological responses were recorded. The participants were asked to self-assess their felt emotional arousal and valence for each scene. In addition, content-based audio- and video-based features were extracted from the movie scenes in order to characterize each scene. Degrees of arousal and valence were estimated by a linear combination of features from physiological signals, as well as by a linear combination of content-based features. We showed that a significant correlation exists between valence-arousal provided by the spectator's self-assessments, and affective grades obtained automatically from either physiological responses or from audio-video features. By means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the variation of different participants' <b>self</b> <b>assessments</b> and different gender groups <b>self</b> <b>assessments</b> for both valence and arousal were shown to be significant (p-values lower than 0. 005). These affective characterization results demonstrate the ability of using multimedia features and physiological responses to predict the expected affect of the user in response to the emotional video content...|$|R

30|$|Many of the {{measures}} {{used to assess the}} components were developed in low-stakes settings, such as research studies or <b>self</b> <b>assessments,</b> where there were few, if any, consequences attached to a particular score. These measures may not be appropriate in high-stakes settings, where scores could substantially affect a program’s bottom line (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999). At the very least, such studies must be conducted; they may show that new measures need to be developed. Some quality components, such as parent involvement, have not been subjected to careful empirical assessment. Nor has the way in which components are weighted and combined into summary measures been studied.|$|R
