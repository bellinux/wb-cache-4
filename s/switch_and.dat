Secondly, the phenomenon of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing that happens in SMPN 40 Surabaya was not observed before by English department student, in fact it frequently happens both intentionally and unintentionally. Moreover, researcher is also curious about the reason why the teachers use code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing in the teaching learning process in the class. The result of the research shows that there were some types of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing which were used by teachers in a class.

The positive response of Indonesians toward English as lingua franca {{of the world}} has made the use of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing common in public such as in television advertisements, so the researcher thinks that it is very interested to analyze the code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing in the advertisements. The objectives of this study are to find out (1) the types of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing in Indonesian television advertisements, (2) the reasons of using code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing, and (3) the contributions of this study to language teaching. This study is a descriptive qualitative study. The researcher observed and collected the advertisements from the non civil national television. The total number of the data is 74 utterances from 63 kinds of advertisements. After being documented, the researcher classified them based on the types of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing and explained the reasons why the code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing were used. The last step was identifying the contributions of this study to language teaching. The findings of the analysis are as follow. First, there are three types of code switching found in the seven non civil national televisions. They are intra sentential switching (9), inter sentential <b>switching</b> (15), <b>and</b> tag <b>switching</b> (3). While the types of code mixing are intra sentential mixing (45), involving a change (1), and intra lexical mixing (1). Second, there are seven reasons why code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing were used in the television advertisements. Those are talking about topic (3), express solidarity (2), interjection (6), repetition (19), intention of clarifying the speech of content (10), expressing group identity (4), to soften or strengthen request (7), and because real lexical need (27). Third, this study has some contributions to language teaching: (1) this study becomes one of examples of language teaching for example teacher can formulate code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing instructions in teaching advertisements through four aspect of language skill, (2) this study could build up a system of language teaching and elaborate teaching and learning material for being used in second language teaching classes, (3) the teachers’ code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing is important in a providing psychologically conducive learning environment for the learners, (4) this study gives pedagogical implication: increasing students’ inclusion, participation and understanding in language learning process, conveying ideas more easily and accomplishing lessons...|$|R
