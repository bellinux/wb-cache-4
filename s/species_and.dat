40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Mexican cactus diversity {{to determine}} those states with high <b>species</b> richness, endemism, <b>and</b> endangerment, {{which may be}} important {{for the conservation of}} these plants. Relationships between environmental factors <b>and</b> <b>species</b> richness <b>and</b> endemism were also examined. <b>Species</b> richness <b>and</b> number of endemic <b>and</b> endangered <b>species</b> were recorded for each state, along with its total area, temperature, and precipitation. Data were analyzed with simple and multiple linear regressions, and complementarity analysis. Results showed that San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Zacatecas, Tamaulipas, and Sonora had more than 100 species. There were significant relationships between <b>species</b> richness <b>and</b> endemism, <b>and</b> <b>species</b> richness <b>and</b> number of endangered species. Nine states had higher species richness than expected according to their total area. The aridity of each state was the environmental factor most significantly correlated with <b>species</b> richness <b>and</b> endemism. Eight states are needed to preserve 80 % of the total cactus diversity...|$|R

40|$|How {{relevant}} are {{the concepts}} of <b>species</b> diversity <b>and</b> <b>species</b> richness?* Biodiversity is a science that {{is still in its}} infancy or, in the words of Ernst Mayr (1997), at the ‘what’ stage. The inventorying and monitoring of biological diversity have just started for a few taxonomic groups and have yet to be initiated for most taxa. As biodiversity equals variety at the species level of biological organization, the terms <b>species</b> richness <b>and</b> <b>species</b> diversity have become key concepts in conservation biology. Both concepts are important characteristics of community structure. Therefore, much has been published on the measurement of the <b>species</b> richness <b>and</b> <b>species</b> diversity o...|$|R

Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the banded darter, and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E
