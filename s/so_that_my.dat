500|$|General d'Arco now ordered de la Colonie's French {{grenadiers}} into reserve {{on top of}} the Heights (above the breastworks {{manned by}} the Bavarians), ready to plug any gaps in their defences at the appropriate time. However, due to the flatness of the summit this position offered his men limited protection from the Allied guns. This exposure was noted by Colonel Blood who, sighting his artillery upon the summit, was able to inflict serious casualties upon de la Colonie's men. De la Colonie later recorded– [...] "They concentrated their fire upon us, and with their first discharge carried off Count de la Bastide... <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> coat was covered with brains and blood." [...] Notwithstanding this barrage, and despite losing five officers and 80 grenadiers before firing a shot, de la Colonie insisted his French regiment stayed at their post, determined as he was to maintain discipline and ensure his troops would be in good order when called into action.|$|E
2500|$|Naomi Mitchison, in her autobiographic book [...] "You {{may well}} ask", relates an {{experience}} during a walking tour in Sweden: [...] "Over in Gotland I walked again, further than I {{would have if}} I had realized that the milestones were in old Swedish miles, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> disappointing three-mile walk along the cold sea edge under the strange ancient fortifications was really fifteen English miles".|$|E
2500|$|Charles has {{expressed}} scepticism that his father's genuine {{intention was to}} disinherit him dynastically, [...] "Without doubt, he had a mood swing, exploited by conservative elements in his entourage with whom I have long clashed.... I am fighting <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> family ceases to be the victim of attempted manipulation." [...] Moreover, Prince Charles denies {{that his father had}} the authority, by law or tradition, to exclude him from the order of succession: [...] "Even if I accept their premise, referring me to the Senatus Consultus of Napoleon III, divorce did not exist under the Second Empire, so it cannot be taken into account for the succession.... Moreover, the hypocrisy of this argument is exposed by the dates: My father's will was written in May 1996. I only re-married in October. All that matters is the Bonaparte tradition, which makes the eldest son the natural heir of his father." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 6, 2010, Palin {{spoke with}} reporters and fielded a {{question}} about Social Security. She stated, [...] "e {{are going to have}} to make some tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be in my day, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E
2500|$|How do I {{write in}} the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and {{unexpected}} inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as [...] "me myself" [...] instead of [...] "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E

5000|$|Reid was {{previously}} a guitarist in indie-math rock band Colour. He has cited minimal American hip hop by The Neptunes, {{as well as}} Lil Wayne, as inspirations.
