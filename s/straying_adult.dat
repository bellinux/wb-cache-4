40|$|A lack of {{published}} information documenting {{problems with the}} microchip data for the reclaiming of stray animals entering Australian shelters limits improvement of the current microchipping system. A retrospective study analysing admission data for <b>stray,</b> <b>adult</b> dogs (n = 7258) and cats (n = 6950) entering the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) Queensland between January 2012 and December 2013 was undertaken to determine the character and frequency of microchip data problems {{and their impact on}} outcome for the animal. Only 28 % of dogs and 9 % of cats were microchipped, and a substantial proportion (37 %) had problems with their data, including being registered to a previous owner or organisation (47 %), all phone numbers incorrect/disconnected (29 %), and the microchip not registered (14 %). A higher proportion of owners could be contacted when the microchip had no problems, compared to those with problems (dogs, 93 % vs. 70 %; cats, 75 % vs. 41 %). The proportion of animals reclaimed declined significantly between microchipped animals with no data problems, microchipped animals with data problems and non-microchipped animals— 87 %, 69 %, and 37 %, respectively, for dogs and 61 %, 33 %, and 5 %, respectively, for cats.

40|$|<b>Adult</b> salmon that <b>stray</b> {{when they}} escape into non-natal streams to spawn {{is a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that promotes population growth and genetic diversity, but excessive <b>stray</b> rates impede <b>adult</b> abundance restoration efforts. Adult San Joaquin River (SJR) Basin fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that return to freshwater to spawn migrate through the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta (Delta). The Delta has been heavily affected by land development and water diversion. During the fall time-period for the years 1979 to 2007 Delta pumping facilities diverted on average 340 % of the total inflow volume that entered the Delta from the SJR. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that river flow and Delta exports are not significantly correlated with SJR salmon <b>stray</b> rates. <b>Adult</b> coded-wire-tagged salmon recoveries from Central Valley rivers were used to estimate the percentage of SJR Basin salmon that strayed to the Sacramento River Basin. SJR salmon stray rates were negatively correlated (P = 0. 05) with the average magnitude of pulse flows (e. g., 10 d) in mid- to late-October and positively correlated (P = 0. 10) with mean Delta export rates. It {{was not possible to}} differentiate between the effects of pulse flows in October and mean flows in October and November on stray rates because of the co-linearity between these two variables. Whether SJR-reduced pulse flow or elevated exports causes increased stray rates is unclear. Statistically speaking the results indicate that flow is the primary factor. However empirical data indicates that little if any pulse flow leaves the Delta when south Delta exports are elevated, so exports in combination with pulse flows may explain the elevated stray rates. For management purposes, we developed two statistical models that predict SJR salmon stray rate: (1) flow and export as co-independent variables; and (2) south Delta Export (E) and SJR inflow (I) {{in the form of an}} E:I ratio. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{temporal}} changes in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations from the vulnerable {{periphery of the}} species range (northern Spain). Using microsatellite markers to assess population structuring and introgression of exogenous genes in four different temporal samples collected across 20 years, we have determined the relative weights of climate and stocking practices in shaping contemporary regional population genetic patterns. Climate, represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, was identified as the main factor for determining the level of population genetic differentiation. Populations within the region have become homogenized through gene flow enhanced by <b>straying</b> of <b>adult</b> salmon from natal rivers and subsequent interchange of genes among rivers due to warmer temperatures. At the same time, and in line with documented changes in stock transfer strategies, evidence of genetic introgression from past stock transfers has decreased throughout the study period, becoming a secondary factor in erasing population structuring. The ability to disentangle the effects of climatic changes and anthropogenic factors (fisheries management practices) is essential for effective long-term conservation of this iconic species.

40|$|Abstract. -To {{preserve}} and recover evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of anadromous salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. in the Pacific Northwest, long-term and short-term ecological processes that create and maintain freshwater habitats must be restored and protected. Aquatic ecosystems {{throughout the region}} are dynamic in space and time, and lack of consideration of their dynamic aspects has limited the effectiveness of habitat restoration programs. Riverine-riparian ecosystems used by anadromous salmonids were naturally subjected to periodic catastrophic disturbances, after which they moved {{through a series of}} recovery states over periods of decades to centuries. Consequently the landscape was a mosaic of varying habitat conditions, some that were suitable for anadromous salmonids and some that were not. Life history adaptations of salmon, such as <b>straying</b> of <b>adults,</b> movement of juveniles, and high fecundity rates, allowed populations of anadromous salmonids to persist in this dynamic environment. Perspectives gained from natural cycles of disturbance and recovery of the aquatic environment must be incorporated into recovery plans for freshwater habitats. In general, we do not advocate returning to the natural disturbance regime, which may include large-scale catastrophic processes such as stand-replacing wildfires. This may be an impossibility given patterns of human development in the region. We believe that it is more prudent to modify humanimpose...|$|R

However, the recommendation to provide 60 % of unimpaired flows in the San Joaquin River at Vernalis from February through June ignores several important flow requirements of Chinook salmon. First, there is very little discussion of the importance of water temperature, as affected by flow management, during the spring when most juvenile salmon undergo smoltification as a highly important determinant affecting juvenile salmon survival and adult salmon production.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A {{plan for}} the reestablishment of {{anadromous}} salmonid stocks into waters above the Pelton Round Butte Hydroelectric Project (PRB) located on the Deschutes River, Oregon has been under development since 1996. The PRB complex, starting at river kilometer (Rkm) 103, blocks the further upstream migration of anadromous salmonids into upper river basin waters. Part of the process for evaluating the passage plan was {{the development of a}} Fish Health Management Program. The program is, in part, designed to minimize and communicate the magnitude of risk associated with passing serious fish pathogens upstream of the PRB until evaluation of the fish passage effort confirms that the reestablishment of anadromous fish species can be successful. With the goal of minimizing the risk of passing serious fish pathogens along with evaluating the magnitude of risk, several potential pathogens of concern were identified. At the forefront of concern is the fish pathogen Myxobolus cerebralis which is responsible for whirling disease in salmonids. Annual, or at least periodic, introduction of M. cerebralis into the lower DRB has occurred since at least 1984 as a result of infected <b>stray</b> <b>adult</b> salmonids spawning and dying there. These are primarily hatchery summer steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), {{and to a lesser extent}} spring Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), from the Snake River system. Because of its' potential to cause significant mortality, the risk associated with M. cerebralis establishment in the DRB needed to be addressed. The risk of the parasite being transmitted and established upstream of the PRB with the renewal of fish passage at the PRB, and the potential for M. cerebralis to affect survival of reintroduced anadromous fish species required investigation. To evaluate these potential risks, we conducted multi-year studies (1998 - 2007) that informed a risk-assessment model. Tailored specifically for M. cerebralis, this model was used to identify key characteristics that will influence pathways of M. cerebralis introduction, the potential for establishment, and the consequences of establishment. The three steps involved in the risk assessment model are the release, exposure and consequence assessments. Using this model we evaluated the probability of introduction and establishment of M. cerebralis in the lower Deschutes River Basin (DRB) as well as in waters above the PRB with future passage of anadromous fish. The current study gives evidence that M. cerebralis is established in the lower DRB. The current study also gives evidence not all areas of the DRB can be classified as having the same likelihood for establishment and the potential impact the parasite poses will not be identical from one location to another. It is clear, however, that M. cerebralis could become established above the PRB if infected fish carry the myxospore into these waters...|$|R

40|$|Giardia duodenalis is an {{intestinal}} protozoal parasite {{capable of}} causing both clinical and subclinical disease {{in a broad}} range of species, including humans and cats. The parasite has a ubiquitous distribution and infection occurs worldwide in nearly all mammals. Giardia infection in cats may not be associated with any clinical signs, but affected cats most commonly exhibit acute small bowel diarrhea with or without weight loss. Estimates of the prevalence in cats fall within a broad range (between 1 - 10 %), with higher rates generally reported for group housed cats. Confusion exists regarding the significance of Giardia in cats and the need for surveillance and treatment of cats in animal shelters as data regarding the zoonotic potential of Giardia-infected cats are lacking. Cysts of the various genotypes are morphologically indistinguishable by light microscopy and advanced molecular techniques are required to determine their assemblage type. Little information exists regarding the differences among the various assemblages, with the principal distinction being host range and possibly geographic location. Assemblages A and B have the widest host range and cause disease in humans. Assemblages C and D are found mainly in dogs, E in livestock, F in cats, and G in rodents. Mixed infections are possible. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the prevalence of Giardia in cats available for adoption at an animal shelter in central New York, assess zoonotic risk by determining the assemblage type(s) found in cats shedding Giardia cysts, and determine risk factors for infection. Once monthly for 5 months a single fecal sample was collected from all cats available for adoption; samples were tested for the presence of Giardia antigen using a commercially available ELISA and all ELISA positive samples were processed for genotype analysis. There was significant variation in the overall prevalence of Giardia from month to month, with more than a two-fold increase between spring (April, May: 6. 7 %) and summer months (June, July, August: 13 %). <b>Stray</b> <b>adult</b> cats and those with outdoor access were more likely to be infected than ownersurrendered cats and those that were kept indoors only. Among adult cats, increasing age was associated with decreasing risk of Giardia infection. Cats in colony housing, particularly at high densities and for prolonged periods of time, were also more likely to be shedding Giardia cysts. A total of 61 fecal samples that tested ELISA positive for Giardia were submitted for molecular analysis. Both zoonotic and host-adapted assemblages were identified; 75 % of samples were the host-adapted assemblage F while 25 % of samples (assemblages A and B) had zoonotic potential based on reported host ranges. Cats with potentially zoonotic assemblages were significantly more likely to be adults and to have soft stools or diarrhea than those cats infected with the host-adapted genotype. These results confirm that cats can not be discounted as a potential source of human Giardia infection, but identification of cats that pose a risk is not possible without advanced molecular diagnostics. Despite a greater understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the disease, the question as to whether or not 3 asymptomatic cats found to be shedding Giardia cysts should be treated in order to protect public health cannot be answered. Further work is needed with larger numbers of cats, both owned and from animal shelters, from various geographic locations to better understand the importance of various risk factors and to establish the true zoonotic potential of Giardia...|$|R
40|$|Annually, welfare shelters admit many dogs, {{including}} those whose caregivers sur-render them or dogs who are strays. This article analyzes admission data from 3 met-ropolitan Australian shelters.

The study tracked more than 20, 000 admissions during this period. To facilitate reclamation, the local Code of Practice requires a mandatory holding period for stray dogs; assessment for suitability for rehoming then occurs. Dogs failing the assessment are euthanized. Sur-rendered dogs can be assessed immediately. The Code of Practice also recommends that unsold dogs be euthanized 28 days postassessment. Typically, shelter dogs in Melbourne are <b>strays,</b> sexually entire, <b>adult,</b> small, and—usually—male. The major-ity of admissions are reclaimed or sold.

Five helminths, comprising three nematode and two cestode species were identified and the majority of cats harboured two of these species. The most prevalent was the cestode Taenia taeniaeformis (75. 8 %), followed by the cestode Diplopylidium sp. (42. 8 %), and the nematodes Ancylostoma tubaeforme (17. 0 %), Physaloptera sp. (6. 6 %) and Toxocara cati (0. 8 %). All five species were found to be typically overdispersed in their distribution. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, the prevalence and abundance of infections were primarily influenced by host gender and season, with females tending to harbour higher levels of infection during the summer. No significant differences were found relative to site except in the case of Physaloptera sp. Using bivariate Pearson product moment correlations, significant positive co-occurrences were identified between Diplopylidium sp. and T. taeniaeformis and also between A. tubaeforme and T. taeniaeformis.

Twenty four (40 %) of the captured dogs were positive (40. 62 % male and 39. 28 % female) for spirocercosis having oesophageal nodular lesions. One to three broad based nodular lesions with an average diameter of 2. 104 &# 177; 0. 139 cm were observed in the caudal oesophagus of spirocerca positive dogs.

40|$|Many {{hatchery}} {{programs for}} steelhead pose genetic or ecological risks to natural populations because those programs release or outplant fish from non-native stocks. The goal of many steelhead programs {{has been to}} simply provide 'fishing opportunities' with little consideration given to conservation concerns. For example, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) has widely propagated and outplanted one stock of winter-run steelhead (Chambers Creek stock) and one stock of summer-run steelhead (Skamania stock) throughout western Washington. Biologists and managers now recognize potential negative effects can occur when non-native hatchery fish interact biologically with native populations. Not only do non-native stocks pose genetic and ecological risks to naturally spawning populations, but non-native fish <b>stray</b> as returning <b>adults</b> {{at a much higher}} rate than do native fish (Quinn 1993). Biologists and managers also recognize the need to (a) maintain the genetic resources associated with naturally spawning populations and (b) restore or recover natural populations wherever possible. As a consequence, the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the NOAA Fisheries have been recommending a general policy that discourages the use of non-native hatchery stocks and encourages development of native broodstocks. There are two primary motivations for these recommendations: (1) reduce or minimize potential negative biological effects resulting from genetic or ecological interactions between hatchery-origin and native-origin fish and (2) use native broodstocks as genetic repositories to potentially assist with recovery of naturally spawning populations. A major motivation for the captive-rearing work described in this report resulted from NOAA's 1998 Biological Opinion on Artificial Propagation in the Columbia River Basin. In that biological opinion (BO), NOAA concluded that non-native hatchery stocks of steelhead jeopardize the continued existence of U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) -listed, naturally spawning populations in the Columbia River Basin. As a consequence of that BO, NOAA recommended - as a reasonable and prudent alternative (RPA) - that federal and state agencies phase out non-native broodstocks of steelhead and replace them with native broodstocks. However, NOAA provided no guidance on how to achieve that RPA. The development of native broodstocks of hatchery steelhead can potentially pose unacceptable biological risks to naturally spawning populations, particularly those that are already listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. The traditional method of initiating new hatchery broodstocks of anadromous salmonid fishes is by trapping adults during their upstream, spawning migration. However, removing natural-origin adults from ESA listed populations may not be biologically acceptable because such activities may further depress those populations via 'broodstock mining'. In addition, trapping adult steelhead may be logistically unfeasible in many subbasins due to high water flows in the spring, when steelhead are moving upstream to spawn, that will often 'blow out' temporary weirs. Additional risks associated with trapping adults include genetic founder effects and difficulties meeting minimum, genetic effective number of breeders without 'mining' the wild population to potential extinction. As a result, alternative methods for developing native broodstocks are highly desired. One alternative for developing native broodstocks, particularly when the collection of adults is logistically unfeasible or biologically unacceptable, is captive rearing of natural-origin juveniles to sexual maturity. In this approach, pre-smolt juveniles are collected from the stream or watershed for which a native broodstock is desired, and those juveniles are raised to sexual maturity in a hatchery. Those hatchery-reared adults then become the broodstock source for gametes and initial progeny releases. Such a captive rearing program offers many genetic advantages over traditional adult-trapping programs for developing native broodstocks: (1) Large numbers of juveniles can be collected from the wild with only minimal impacts to naturally spawning populations because juvenile (age 0 +parr) -to-adult survivals are typically very small (< 1 %) under natural conditions. (2) The genetic base of the broodstock (i. e. genetic effective population size) can be substantially larger for juveniles than adults because juveniles can theoretically represent the offspring of all adults that spawned successfully within a stream or watershed, as opposed to trapping {{only a small portion of}} returning adults for broodstock. (3) Collecting juveniles for broodstock can substantially reduce the risk of genetically 'swamping' naturally spawning populations with hatchery-origin fish (i. e. via a 'Ryman-Laikre effect') as occurs when hatchery-released fish represent the progeny of a relatively small number of trapped adults...|$|R
