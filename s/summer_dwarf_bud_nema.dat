40|$|Terminal buds of dark-grown pea (Pisum sativum) {{seedlings}} have an indole- 3 -acetic acid oxidase {{which does}} not require Mn 2 + and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol as cofactors. Oxidase activity is at least 50 times higher in buds of tall peas than in dwarf seedlings. Administration of gibberellic acid to dwarf peas stimulates both growth and indoleacetic acid oxidase activity to the same levels as in tall seedlings. By contrast, indoleacetic acid oxidation assayed {{in the presence of}} Mn 2 + and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol proceeds at similar rates regardless of gibberellin application. Treatment of tall peas with the growth retardant AMO- 1618 reduces growth and oxidase activity. Such treated seedlings are indistinguishably dwarf. The enzyme {{does not appear to be}} polyphenol oxidase, nor do the results suggest that reduced activity in <b>dwarf</b> <b>buds</b> is due to higher levels of a dialyzable inhibitor.

40|$|We {{present the}} colors and {{activity}} of ultracool (M 7 -L 8) dwarfs from the Tenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We combine previous samples of SDSS M and L dwarfs with new data obtained from the Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (BOSS) to produce the BOSS Ultracool <b>Dwarf</b> (<b>BUD)</b> sample of 11820 M 7 -L 8 dwarfs. By combining SDSS data with photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Wide-Field Infrared Sky Explorer mission, we present ultracool dwarf colors from i-z to W 2 -W 3 {{as a function of}} spectral type, and extend the SDSS- 2 MASS-WISE color locus to include ultracool dwarfs. The i-z, i-J, and z-J colors provide the best indication of spectral type for M 7 -L 3 dwarfs. We also examine ultracool dwarf chromospheric activity through the presence and strength of Hα emission.

40|$|Dwarf sperm whales, Kogia sima, {{are among}} the most {{commonly}} stranded yet least known pelagic cetaceans. I assessed seasonal and spatial variation in dwarf sperm whale group size and abundance off Great Abaco Island, the Bahamas. After correcting for survey effort and variation in sighting efficiency among sea states, I found that dwarf sperm whale group size and habitat use varied seasonally. In <b>summer,</b> <b>dwarf</b> sperm whale groups were small (median = 2. 5, range = 1 - 8) and were found only in the two deep habitats within the study area (slope 400 - 900 m, deep 900 - 1600 in). In winter, group sizes increased (median = 4, range = 1 - 12) and sightings were almost six times higher in the slope habitat, where vertical relief is highest, than other habitats. My results suggest that studies of pelagic cetaceans and conservation plans must explicitly account for seasonal variation in group size and habitat use...|$|R

40|$|A {{virus was}} {{isolated}} from soybean (Glycine max) plants with symptoms of <b>dwarfing</b> and <b>bud</b> blight in Wenceslau Braz County, Paraná, Brazil. The host range and properties resembled those of Tobacco streak virus (TSV). The purified virus showed three peaks in a frozen sucrose gradient. Antiserum was produced and the virus was serologically related to TSV. Electron microscopy detected 28 nm spherical particles. Coat protein (CP) had a Mr of 29. 880 Da. A fragment of 1028 nt was amplified, cloned and sequenced. One {{open reading frame}} with 717 nt was identified and associated to the CP. The CP gene shared 83 % identity with the sequence of TSV CP from white clover (Trifolium repens) (GenBank CAA 25133).

40|$|Polar auxin {{transport}} (PAT) plays {{a crucial}} role in the regulation of many aspects of plant growth and development. We report the characterization of a semidominant Arabidopsis thaliana bushy and <b>dwarf</b> 1 (<b>bud</b> 1) mutant. Molecular genetic analysis indicated that the bud 1 phenotype is a result of increased expression of Arabidopsis MAP KINASE KINASE 7 (MKK 7), a member of plant mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase group D. We showed that BUD 1 /MKK 7 is a functional kinase and that the kinase activity is essential for its biological functions. Compared with the wild type, the bud 1 plants develop significantly fewer lateral roots, simpler venation patterns, and a quicker and greater curvature in the gravitropism assay. In addition, the bud 1 plants have shorter hypocotyls at high temperature (29 °C) under light, which is a characteristic feature of defective auxin action. Determination of tritium-labeled indole- 3 -acetic acid transport showed that the increased expression of MKK 7 in bud 1 or the repressed expression in MKK 7 antisense transgenic plants causes deficiency or enhancement in auxin transport, indicating that MKK 7 negatively regulates PAT. This conclusion was further substantiated by genetic and phenotypic analyses of double mutants generated from crosses between bud 1 and the auxin-related mutants axr 3 - 3, tir 1 - 1, doc 1 - 1, and atmdr 1 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Emerging evidences exhibit that mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK/MPK) {{signaling}} pathways are connected with {{many aspects of}} plant development. The complexity of MAPK cascades raises challenges not only to identify the MAPK module in planta but also to define the specific role of an individual module. So far, our knowledge of MAPK signaling has been largely restricted to a small subset of MAPK cascades. Our previous study has characterized an Arabidopsis bushy and <b>dwarf</b> 1 (<b>bud</b> 1) mutant, in which the MAP Kinase Kinase 7 (MKK 7) was constitutively activated, resulting in multiple phenotypic alterations. In this study, we found that MPK 3 and MPK 6 are the substrates for phosphorylation by MKK 7 in planta. Genetic analysis showed that MKK 7 -MPK 6 cascade is specifically responsible for the regulation of shoot branching, hypocotyl gravitropism, filament elongation, and lateral root formation, while MKK 7 -MPK 3 cascade is mainly involved in leaf morphology. We further demonstrated that the MKK 7 -MPK 6 cascade controls shoot branching by phosphorylating Ser 337 on PIN 1, which affects the basal localization of PIN 1 in xylem parenchyma cells and polar auxin transport in the primary stem. Our results not only specify {{the functions of the}} MKK 7 -MPK 6 cascade but also reveal a novel mechanism for PIN 1 phosphorylation, establishing a molecular link between the MAPK cascade and auxin-regulated plant development...|$|R
50|$|The {{collared}} grosbeak {{ranges from}} fairly common to scarce within its range. The species summers and breeds at {{an elevation of}} 2700 to 4200 m. It engages in altitudinal movements, by winter traveling to as low as 1800 m or even to 1060 m. This grosbeak occurs in mixed and coniferous forests, commonly around stands of maple, oak or rhododendron. It also may occur during the <b>summer</b> in <b>dwarf</b> juniper above the tree line in the mountains. Pairs or small parties usually perch near the tops of tall trees but forage often in lower vegetation or even on the ground. The collared grosbeak flies in tight flocks in a fast, direct but sometimes undulating flying style. The breeding behavior of this species is unknown. The grosbeak feeds {{on a variety of}} seeds and pine cones as well as buds or shoots, nuts, fruits (including crab apples). A variety of this tough plant life is plucked with the strong bill. It may also feed on insects, mainly caterpillars, as well as snails.|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{forms of}} witch's broom {{caused by a}} virus, were {{observed}} in Crotalaria spp. and other leguminous crops in Indonesia, and in Rubus idaeus and some herbaceous ornamentals, mainly Trqpaeolum majus, in the Netherlands. A {{detailed analysis of the}} abnormalities in Crotalaria and Tropaeolum was given. A plant infected during its early stages of development became a bushy <b>dwarf.</b> All potential <b>buds</b> developed into negatively geotropic sprouts and no flowers formed. A plant infected late had an almost normal growth habit, but inflorescences grew into complex leafy structures, thus producing broomy branch extremities. The younger their buds at the moment of infection, the more abnormal were the flowers. Thus a series of progressive floral abnormalities from a normal flower up to a completely vegetative leafy branch could be selected. The series of deviations was called antholysis. These abnormalities supported the theory that morphologically the flower must be regarded as a modified leafy branch. Large-scale virus-induced antholysis demonstrated the morphogenetic antagonism between floral initiation and vegetative growth. Many similar virus diseases were brought together in a group of witch's broom virus diseases. Other factors may cause related aberrations: certain parasitic plants, fungi, bacteria, mites and insects. However, they only incited restricted symptoms of witch's broom. The morphological analysis of witch's broom phenomena provided arguments that growth-hormonal disturbances were involved. <p/...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{emphasis}} on ecosystem approaches to fisheries management renews interest in, {{and the need}} for, trophic information about fish communities. A program was started in 1980 at the National Marine Fisheries Service Galveston Laboratory to develop a trophic database for continental shelf fishes. Collections were made during 1982 - 1983 that were processed but never published, yet the data remain valid today for historical purposes and for delimiting food web components within ecosystem assessments. I examined spring, summer, and fall foods in offshore populations of nine common species of trawl-susceptible fishes, with particular reference to predation on commercial penaeid shrimps (Farfantepenaeus and Litopenaeus). Diets were evaluated with the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) which combines the occurrence, number, and weight of each food item. Bank sea bass (Centropristis ocyurus) and bighead searobin (Prionotus tribulus) primarily consumed crabs, more so by larger than smaller fish. Inshore lizardfish (Synodus foetens) was almost entirely piscivorous. Ocellated flounder (Ancylopsetta ommata) consumed fishes, crabs, and stomatopods. Dwarf sand perch (Diplectrum bivittatum), blackwing searobin (Prionotus rubio), rock sea bass (Centropristis philadelphica), southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) fed mainly on shrimps. Most fish diets varied with respect to size (age), time of day, area sampled, depth, or season. Rimapenaeus and Sicyonia were the most frequently identified shrimp genera - only five Farfantepenaeus and no Litopenaeus were identified in almost 4, 300 fish stomachs. I also examined gonadal development and documented fish length-weight relationships. Ripe gonads were most frequently found during <b>summer</b> in <b>dwarf</b> sand perch, during fall in ocellated flounder and bighead searobin, and during spring for other species, except no ripe red snapper or bank sea bass were collected. Rock sea bass {{was found to be}} a protogynous hermaphrodite, while dwarf sand perch is a synchronous hermaphrodite. Only ocellated flounder and southern kingfish exhibited sex-related differences in length-weight relationships. (PDF contains 40 pages. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} at Lincoln University during the 1999 - 2000 growing season to investigate the effect of crop species and sowing density on weed dynamics, productivity and species composition. Crops with a spreading (narrow-leafed lupin, Lupimus augustifolius and dwarf French bean, Phaseolus vulgaris), rosette (turnip, Brassica campestris and forage rape, Brassica napus) and upright (maize, Zea mays and ryecorn, Secale cereale) growth habits were sown at 0. 0. 0. 5. 1. 0.. 2. 0 and 4. 0 times their optimum population. No other weed control measures were applied. The six crops were sown on 8 September 1999 (early spring) : narrow-leafed lupin, ryecorn and forage rape on and 4 November 1999 (early <b>summer)</b> : <b>dwarf</b> French bean, maize and turnip. The weed seed bank prior to sowing was predominated by Coronopus didymus. There were {{significant differences in the}} suppressive ability of the different crop species and different crop populations (p < 0. 001). Weed dry matter (DM) was lowest in turnip (0. 58 g/m²) and highest in dwarf French bean (123. 50 g/m²) at final harvest. By final harvest crop density had a marked effect on weed DM production. There was decreased weed DM at higher plant populations in all crop species, except turnip, at all plant populations. However, there were differences between 0. 5 and 4. 0 x optimum populations in bean (397 and 12 g/m²), rape (189 and 26 g/m²), lupin (125 and 7 g/m²), maize (106 and 0 g/m²) and ryecorn (51 and 18 g/m²). Weed suppression as affected by the different crop treatments was directly related to leaf area index (LAI), radiation interception and radiation use efficiency (RUE). The highest LAI’s were recorded in turnip (4. 1) at 60 DAS. While other crops such as bean and maize attained LAI's of only 0. 66 and 1. 1 respectively by the same time. Leaf area index increased with increased plant population in all crops. Leaf area index in turnip at 60 DAS ranged from 3. 5 at 0. 5 x optimum population to 5. 1 at 4. 0 x optimum population. In maize LAI ranged from 0. 4 to 2. 0 at the same plant populations at the same time. Canopy closure occurred at 50 DAS in turnip at 4. 0 x optimum population, at 60 DAS for lupin, ryecorn and rape and at 83 DAS for maize and bean. Canopy closure was never attained at 0. 5 x optimum population in lupin, rape, ryecorn, bean and maize. Turnip intercepted the most solar radiation (SR) at 1068 MJ/m² which was 354 MJ/m² more than bean, which intercepted the least photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Total intercepted PAR also increased with increased plant population. There was a strong linear relationship between cumulative intercepted PAR and cumulative DM yield in all crops. Maize produced more DM per MJ of intercepted PAR than all the other crops at 3. 4 g DM MJ PAR⁻¹ whereas lupin, ryecorn, rape, bean and turnip produced 1. 7. 1. 2. 0. 98 and 0. 37 g DM PAR⁻¹ respectively. Crops with large leaf size and rapid growth were effective in reducing the weed seed bank, weed species and numbers in the following growing season. The most effective reduction occurred with turnip followed by maize (55 and 66 x 103 seed/m² respectively) compared with lupin and rape which contained the highest (158 and 130 x 103 seeds/m² respectively). Weed seed production was markedly affected by plant population (p < 0. 05). Higher plant populations (2. 0 and 4. 0 x optimum population) of lupin, rape, ryecorn and maize effectively suppressed weed seed production. Lower plant populations (0. 5 and 1. 0 x optimum population) contained higher weed seed numbers/m² in lupin, rape, ryecorn, bean and maize plots. Coronopus didymus was the most abundant species in the weed seed bank in the 2000 -growing season. Weed seedling emergence in the 2000 -growing season also reflected previous crop treatments. Bean contained the highest weed seedling density (1. 163 weed seedlings/m²) and turnip the least (109 weed seedling/m²). As plant population increased from 0. 0 to 4. 0 x optimum population weed density decreased. The decrease was most pronounced in lupin (1. 128 to 466 weed seedlings/m²), rape (1. 082 to 319 weed seedlings/m²) and ryecorn (1. 308 to 362 weed seedlings/m²). Chenopodium album was the most abundant weed species to emerge during the 2000 growing season. A mechanistic model of crop and weed growth was tested for its ability to simulate DM accumulation of weed and crop in lupin, rape and ryecorn and used SR and LAI data. The model accurately predicted crop and weed DM for lupin, rape and ryecorn grown at the 4 crop densities. The model could be of practical value in predicting the potential weed DM yield under different crop species at different plant densities. The results suggested that inclusion of large leaf size and rapid growth in selection of crop as competitors to suppress weeds by using crops such as turnip, maize and ryecorn should be feasible in a weed management program...|$|R
