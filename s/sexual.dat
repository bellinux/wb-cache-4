40|$|Social parasitism, one of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} phenomena in ants, has evolved to various levels, the most extreme form being parasites that have lost the worker caste and rely completely on the host's worker force to raise their brood. A remarkable feature of workerless social parasites is the small size of <b>sexuals.</b> It has been suggested that reduced size evolved as a means {{to take advantage of the}} host's caste-determination system, so that parasite larvae develop into <b>sexuals</b> with less food than is required to produce host workers. An important consequence of size reduction is that it might restrict the host workers' ability to discriminate between the brood of the social parasite and their own brood and might protect parasite <b>sexuals</b> from elimination. We found that <b>sexuals</b> of the workerless inquiline ant Plagiolepis hene were significantly smaller than the <b>sexuals</b> of their host Plagiolepis pygmaea, but remarkably similar to the host workers. The size variance of parasite <b>sexuals</b> was much lower than that of their host; this result possibly suggests that there is very stabilizing selection acting on size of the parasite <b>sexuals.</b> Comparison of the primary (egg) and secondary (adult) sex ratios of the parasite and host showed that miniaturization of their <b>sexuals</b> has been accompanied by their ability to develop into <b>sexuals</b> even when the host P. pygmaea actively prevents production of its own <b>sexuals.</b> These results suggest that the inquiline's size and caste threshold have been reduced such that all individuals in a parasite brood will develop into <b>sexuals.</b> We also found that the adult sex ratio of P. xene was heavily female-biased. This bias probably stems from local mate competition that arises from <b>sexuals</b> mating within the nest. There was no significant difference between the proportion of haploid eggs and adult males produced; this observation indicates that a female-biased sex ratio is achieved by queens producing a higher proportion of diploid eggs rather than by a higher mortality of haploid males...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{remarkable}} {{ability of}} slave-making ants to integrate chemically {{in the colonies}} of their host species makes them useful model systems for investigating the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in chemical recognition. The purpose of our {{study was to examine}} the influence of the rearing host species on the cuticular hydrocarbon profile and on the mating behaviour of <b>sexuals</b> of the slave-making ant Chalepoxenus muellerianus. <b>Sexuals</b> from a population parasitizing exclusively the host species Temnothorax unifasciatus were reared in the laboratory either with their natural host or another potential host species, Temnothorax recedens. C. mueller-ianus males reared with T. unifasciatus investigated and mounted female <b>sexuals</b> reared with the same host significantly more often than female <b>sexuals</b> reared with T. recedens. Similarly, C. muellerianus males reared with T. unifasciatus discriminated against female <b>sexuals</b> from natural T. recedens colonies. Males experimentally or naturally reared with T. recedens did not clearly discrim-inate between female <b>sexuals</b> reared by the two host species and only rarely engaged in mating attempts with either type of female <b>sexuals.</b> Chemical analyses showed that host species affect the chemical profile of C. muellerianus <b>sexuals</b> and vice versa. Our findings indicate that cuticular hydrocarbons might be important in the mating success of this ant species...|$|R
40|$|In the Argentine ant Linepithema humile (=Iridomyrmex humilis) only males {{disperse}} whereas female <b>sexuals</b> (unmated winged queens) stay {{in their}} mother nest where they mate. This study investigated (1) whether dispersing males are accepted into foreign colonies, (2) whether they can mate with resident female <b>sexuals,</b> and (3) whether the propensity of males to disperse {{is affected by the}} expectation of mating in their mother nest. Field experiments demonstrated that males were accepted into foreign colonies only when these colonies contained female <b>sexuals</b> or queen pupae. Before and after the time of (sic) female <b>sexuals,</b> workers attacked and killed most of the foreign males. Laboratory experiments snowed that males that successfully enter foreign colonies can mate with resident female <b>sexuals.</b> The propensity of males to disperse was significantly influenced by the presence of female <b>sexuals</b> in their nest. Males were more likely to fly out from colonies containing no female <b>sexuals</b> than from those with them. These results are consistent with males preferentially dispersing when {{there is little or no}} opportunity to mate in their mother nest. Thus there are two mating strategies available for males: staying in their mother nest when an opportunity to mate arises or dispersing and attempting to mate in a foreign nest when there are no female <b>sexuals</b> in their mother nest. This latter behaviour could mediate gene flow between colonies and account for the lack of significant inbreeding previously documented in this species...|$|R

40|$|Cardiocondyla elegans is a Mediterranean ant that nests on river banks.

Using microsatellite analysis, we investigated the genetic structure of 21 colonies from three different locations {{as well as the}} parentage of <b>sexuals</b> of two colonies of C. elegans. We show that C. elegans is strictly monogynous, and that its nests can contain foreign <b>sexuals.</b> The presence of alien <b>sexuals</b> inside ant nests is described {{for the first time and}} probably counteracts inbreeding resulting from matings between siblings. In the laboratory, aggression tests showed that workers only allow alien males to enter their nests, while all winged female <b>sexuals</b> attempting to enter were attacked.

40|$|In 20 {{colonies of}} Apis cerana in {{northern}} Vietnam, colony growth, production of drones and queens (<b>sexuals),</b> and swarming and supersedure {{were related to}} available flower forage and climate. Despite the tropical setting of the study with year-round forage, production of <b>sexuals</b> was restricted to two periods from March to July and from September to December. Most swarming occurred in May when forage was most abundant. Positive correlations between available forage, colony growth, and production of <b>sexuals</b> suggest that the synchronized production of drones and queens is defined by nutrient flow into the colony. If flow is high, the colony starts growing; when the colony is large enough drones and queens are produced, and eventually the colony swarms. Production of <b>sexuals</b> is synchronized because foraging conditions are sufficient to allow growth for {{only part of the}} year.

40|$|Arriving {{earlier in}} the {{breeding}} area than his rivals may be beneficial for a male when females mate only once or during a short time span. The timing of a male's entrance is usually determined by the male himself, e. g., through returning early from his winter quarters or through accelerated larval development [1 - 3]. Here, we document a surprisingly simple way of "first come, first served" in a species with local mate competition. In multiqueen colonies of a Cardiocondyla ant, mother queens {{make sure that their}} own sons are the first to monopolize mating with a large harem of female <b>sexuals</b> by producing extremely long-lived males early in colony life. Whereas queens in newly founded single-queen colonies started to produce male and female <b>sexuals</b> only several weeks after the eclosion of their first worker off spring, queens in multiqueen colonies precociously reared sons long before the first female <b>sexuals</b> and even before the emergence of their first workers. These early males killed all later emerging males in the nest and mated with all female <b>sexuals</b> subsequently produced. Our data document that the patterns of growth and productivity of insect colonies are surprisingly flexible and can be turned upside down under appropriate selection pressures...|$|R

We classified colonies as either ‘pure’ or containing hybrids by determining their allozyme pattern at GPI, an enzyme that is fixed for different alleles in the two parental species, and quantified their reproductive output. Most colonies with hybrid workers had a T. crassispinus queen. Colonies with heterozygous, hybrid workers produced more young workers than colonies of the parental species but similar numbers of male and female <b>sexuals.</b> Female <b>sexuals</b> from colonies with heterozygous workers had a significantly lower weight than female <b>sexuals</b> from pure colonies. Only a single reproductive queen was found to be heterozygous, suggesting reduced fitness of hybrid queens.

40|$|Classical cost-of-sex models {{predict the}} rapid {{fixation}} of asexual reproduction. Coexistence of <b>sexuals</b> and asexuals is common among hermaphrodite plants, however, providing asexuals {{with access to}} sex via their male function; some of the sexually reproduced progeny they sire will be asexual. The ability of asexuals to sire progeny is often hindered by the production of poor quality pollen. Using cellular automata, it is shown that decreases in pollen quality in asexuals can greatly increase the period of coexistence of <b>sexuals</b> and asexuals and, consequently, the cumulative contribution of sex to asex. Extensive periods of coexistence are only likely, however, if pollen and seed are dispersed locally, in which case coexistence over thousands of generations can be achieved. It is argued that, with local dispersal, the negative relationship between pollen quality and the period of coexistence of sex and asex will result in patterns of geographic parthenogenesis in which asexuals that coexist with <b>sexuals</b> will exhibit a poor male function, whereas asexuals with a very efficient male function will occur in exclusively asexual population...|$|R

There was, however, no evidence that one male might be particularly successful in fathering a disproportionally high proportion of female <b>sexuals</b> relative to the proportion of workers.

40|$|Background: According to the {{classical}} model of Macevicz and Oster, annual eusocial insects should show a clear dichotomous "bang-bang" strategy of resource allocation; colony fitness is maximised when a period of pure colony growth (exclusive production of workers) {{is followed by a}} single reproductive period characterised by the exclusive production of <b>sexuals.</b> However, in several species graded investment strategies with a simultaneous production of workers and <b>sexuals</b> have been observed. Such deviations from the "bang-bang" strategy are usually interpreted as an adaptive (bet-hedging) response to environmental fluctuations such as variation in season length or food availability. To generate predictions about the optimal investment pattern of insect colonies in fluctuating environments, we slightly modified Macevicz and Oster's classical model of annual colony dynamics and used a dynamic programming approach nested into a recurrence procedure for the solution of the stochastic optimal control problem. Results: 1) The optimal switching time between pure colony growth and the exclusive production of <b>sexuals</b> decreases with increasing environmental variance. 2) Yet, for reasonable levels of environmental fluctuations no deviation from the typical bang-bang strategy is predicted. 3) Model calculations for the halictid bee Lasioglossum malachurum reveal that bet-hedging {{is not likely to be}} the reason for the graded allocation into <b>sexuals</b> versus workers observed in this species. 4) When environmental variance reaches a critical level our model predicts an abrupt change from dichotomous behaviour to graded allocation strategies, but the transition between colony growth and production of <b>sexuals</b> is not necessarily monotonic. Both, the critical level of environmental variance as well as the characteristic pattern of resource allocation strongly depend on the type of function used to describe environmental fluctuations. Conclusion: Up to now bet-hedging as an evolutionary response to variation in season length has been the main argument to explain field observations of graded resource allocation in annual eusocial insect species. However, our model shows that the effect of moderate fluctuations of environmental conditions does not select for deviation from {{the classical}} bang-bang strategy and that the evolution of graded allocation strategies can be triggered only by extreme fluctuations. Detailed quantitative observations on resource allocation in eusocial insects are needed to analyse the relevance of alternative explanations, e. g. logistic colony growth or reproductive conflict between queen and workers, for the evolution of graded allocation strategies...|$|R

40|$|Social parasites {{exploit the}} {{socially}} managed resources of their host's society. Inquiline social parasites {{are dependent on}} their host throughout their life cycle, {{and so many of}} the traits inherited from their free-living ancestor are removed by natural selection. One trait that is commonly lost is the worker caste, the functions of which are adequately fulfilled by host workers. The few inquiline parasites that have retained a worker caste are thought to be at a transitional stage in the evolution of social parasitism, and their worker castes are considered vestigial and non-adaptive. However, this idea has not been tested. Furthermore, whether inquiline workers have an adaptive role outside the usual worker repertoire of foraging, brood care and colony maintenance has not been examined. In this paper, we present data that suggest that workers of the inquiline ant Acromyrmex insinuator {{play a vital role in}} ensuring the parasite's fitness. We show that the presence of these parasite workers has a positive effect on the production of parasite <b>sexuals</b> and a negative effect on the production of host <b>sexuals.</b> This suggests that inquiline workers play a vital role in suppressing host queen reproduction, thus promoting the rearing of parasite <b>sexuals.</b> To our knowledge, these are the first experiments on inquiline workers and the first to provide evidence that inquiline workers have an adaptive role...|$|R

40|$|The {{ecological}} and evolutionary opportunities of apomixis {{in the short}} and the long term are considered, based on two closely related apomictic genera: Taraxacum (dandelion) and Chondrilla (skeleton weed). In both genera apomicts have a wider geographical distribution than <b>sexuals,</b> illustrating the short-term eco-logical success of apomixis. Allozymes and DNA markers indicate that apomictic populations are highly polyclonal. In Taraxacum, clonal diversity can be generated by rare hybridization between <b>sexuals</b> and apomicts, the latter acting as pollen donors. Less extensive clonal diversity is generated by mutations within clonal lineages. Clonal diversity may be maintained by frequency-dependent selection, caused by biological interactions (e. g. competitors and pathogens). Some clones are geographically widespread and probably represent phenotypically plastic ‘general-purpose genotypes’. The long-term evolutionary success of apomictic clones may be limited by lack of adaptive potential and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Although apomictic clones may be considered as ‘evol-utionary dead ends’, the genes controlling apomixis can escape from degeneration and extinction via pollen in crosses between <b>sexuals</b> and apomicts. In this way, apomixis genes are transferred to a new genetic background, potentially adaptive and cleansed from linked deleterious mutations. Consequently, apomixis genes can be much older than the clones they are currently contained in. The close phylogenetic relationship between Taraxacum and Chondrilla and the similarity of their apomixis mechanisms suggest that apomixis in these two genera could be of common ancestry...|$|R
