5|$|In modern Qatar, Blackout {{attacks and}} destroys a United States {{military}} base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark. A team of Army Rangers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert, pursued by Blackout’s drone Scorponok. They fight Scorponok off, aided by aerial reinforcements, and travel home with Scorponok’s stinger, discovering <b>sabot</b> rounds damaged its armor. At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense John Keller leads {{the investigation into the}} attack. Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon, Frenzy, hacking into the U.S. military network while onboard Air Force One. While the hack is thwarted, Frenzy downloads files on Archibald’s glasses, tracking down Sam with Barricade, disguised as a police car.|$|E

Attempting to run in <b>sabots</b> I do not recommend to the beginner.|$|R
25|$|At first, {{bird strike}} testing by {{manufacturers}} involved firing a bird carcass from a gas cannon and <b>sabot</b> system into the tested unit. The carcass was soon replaced with suitable density blocks, often gelatin, to ease testing. Current testing is mainly conducted with computer simulation, although final testing usually involves some physical experiments (see birdstrike simulator).|$|E
25|$|Green Mace was the Rainbow Code {{assigned}} to the QF 127/58 SBT X1 during its development. The original specifications were for a 5-inch gun with water-cooled barrel, firing folding-fin discarding <b>sabot</b> dart projectiles. Two rotary magazines, each holding 14 rounds, would allow for {{a high rate of}} fire on the order of 75 rounds per minute (RPM).|$|E
25|$|Sub-caliber {{training}} {{in this context}} refers to attaching a smaller weapon into a bigger one to reduce wear on the actual weapon. In case of 57 55 J the gun, stripped of mounting and most other equipment, was attached into a barrel of a heavy gun. 57 55 J was located outside the actual gun and fired normal ammo; thus this does not refer to modern <b>sabot</b> ammunition or inner tube mounts.|$|E

25|$|The {{hull and}} the turret {{are made of}} welded steel fitted with modular armour, which can be {{replaced}} easily for repair or upgraded over the years. In the late 1970s, the French army rejected Chobham armour as being overly specialised in its optimisation to defeat hollow charge-weapons; it, therefore, opted to develop its own composite arrangement to defeat both hollow charge and <b>sabot</b> rounds. Due {{to the introduction of}} modernised threats, batch 3 vehicles have a new armour package, including composite armour, titanium insert and {{on the sides of the}} turret, ERA blocks.|$|E
25|$|The Chilean Army up-gunned their M24s in {{the mid-1980s}} to the IMI-OTO 60mm Hyper Velocity Medium Support (HVMS) gun, with roughly {{comparable}} performance to a standard 90mm gun. Chile operated this version until 1999. Uruguay continues to use the M24, modernized with new engines and 76mm guns which can fire armor-piercing, fin stabilised, discarding <b>sabot</b> (APFSDS) rounds. In the mid-1950s, {{in an attempt to}} improve the anti-tank performance of the vehicle, some French M24s had their turrets replaced with those of the AMX-13 light tank. AMX-13 variants with Chaffee turret also existed.|$|E

25|$|A 30mm 2A72 autocannon {{is mounted}} {{coaxially}} with the 2A70 rifled gun. The turret of the BMD-4 contains {{a total of}} 500 rounds ready {{to be used by}} its autocannon with 245 of them being high explosive and the remaining being armor-piercing discarding <b>sabot.</b> This autocannon fires projectiles with a muzzle velocity of 1120m/s and a cyclic rate of fire of 350–400 rds/min. The rounds fired can penetrate 22mm of Rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) from a range of 2000 m while impacting at an angle of 60°. Minimum gas contamination of the turret is achieved by a delayed unlocking due to single-barrel long recoil action and forward case ejection. The 7.62mm PKT machine gun is mounted coaxially with 100mm and 30mm weapons. 2000 rounds are carried in the turret for the PKT machine gun; all combined into one tape to eliminate reloading.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War meant Iraq had military equipment from almost every major arms-selling country. This {{resulted in a}} lack of standardization in this large heterogeneous force, which additionally suffered from poor training and poor motivation. The majority of Iraqi armoured forces still used old Chinese Type 59s and Type 69s, Soviet-made T-55s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some T-72s from the 1970s in 1991. These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders, and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and the <b>sabot</b> rounds used by the M1 Abrams, Challenger 1 and the other Coalition tanks. This equipment enabled Coalition tanks to effectively engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from {{more than three times}} the distance that Iraqi tanks could engage.|$|E
25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding <b>sabot</b> (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E

25|$|Against Me! {{was formed}} in 1997 by singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace as a solo act, amidst the breakup of her {{previous}} band(s). The first Against Me! release was an eponymously titled demo tape in 1997. It was self-released in very limited numbers. With the addition of drummer Kevin Mahon, a second demo, Vivida Vis! (1998), was released in limited numbers by Misanthrope Records. The band started their first tour in March 1999, a month-long tour of the East coast, during which they met Jordan Kleeman in Baltimore, Maryland. The band's first EP, Against Me!, was released twice through Crasshole Records, (once in 1999 and 2000). James Bowman joined the band in 2000 somewhere around this time. Grace, Bowman, and Mahon supported the EP on a month - and - a - half- long tour of the West coast that year. The band toured in Grace's 1976 Buick LeSabre, of which the engine blew {{up at the end}} of the tour. Their first widely distributed release was the EP Crime as Forgiven by Against Me! (2001), released by Plan-It-X Records and <b>Sabot</b> Productions (run by longtime Against Me! tour manager Jordan Kleeman). On April 23, 2001, while heading south on I-75, returning home from their first tour as a four-piece band, their van was struck by a semi truck. They landed upside-down in a ditch. No one was harmed, but the van and equipment were destroyed, after which Bowman and Mahon left the band. The band broke up for a few months that year. A third EP, a self-titled acoustic recording by Grace and bassist Dustin Fridkin, was released in November 2001.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, most armies were fielding light anti-tank guns firing 3.7cm (37mm) ammunition. The guns were usually mounted on two-wheeled carriages {{so they could be}} towed into position, then withdrawn and repositioned rapidly. Since they weighed only a few hundred pounds on average, they could also be manhandled into position. All fired high-explosive and solid armor-piercing shot effective at relatively medium range, and an increasing number were manufactured with protective gun shields in addition to a split rail mounting. They were able to destroy tanks fielded by both sides during {{the first two years of}} the war, but soon proved impotent against the heavier tank armor which debuted in 1940. Introducing improved ammunition and increasing muzzle velocity initially helped compensate for their mediocre performance, but it was clear that small caliber anti-tank guns would soon be overtaken by yet more heavily armored tanks. Medium caliber guns in the 40mm to 50mm range began to appear, some of which simply utilised rebored 37mm barrels. Although they too were soon approaching obsolescence, most remained in use with infantry units until the end of the war. Anti-tank guns remained ineffective against sloped armor, as demonstrated by an incident in 1941 when a single Soviet T-34 tank was impacted over thirty times by a battalion-sized contingent of German 37mm and 50mm anti-tank guns. The tank survived intact and was driven back to its own lines a few hours later. This helped earn the Pak 36 the moniker of Panzeranklopfgerät ("tank door knocker") because its crew simply revealed their presence and wasted their shells without damaging the T-34's armor. Anti-tank gunners began aiming at tank tracks, or vulnerable margins on the turret ring and gun mantlet, rather than testing their lighter cannon against bow and turret armor. These difficulties resulted in new types of ammunition being issued, namely high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and armor-piercing discarding <b>sabot</b> (APDS) projectiles.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} rounds have been {{developed}} for Rheinmetall's tank gun. For example, a long line of armor-piercing discarding <b>sabot</b> (APDS) rounds was developed by Rheinmetall. Originally, the Leopard 2 was outfitted with the DM23 kinetic energy penetrator, based on the Israeli M111 Hetz. The DM23 was eventually replaced by the DM33, which was also adopted by Japan, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland. The DM33 has a three-part aluminum <b>sabot</b> and a two-part tungsten penetrator, and is said to be able to penetrate [...] of steel armor at a range of [...] [...] The DM43 is a further development of this round, co-developed between Germany and France. The introduction of the longer barrel came {{hand in hand with the}} introduction of a new kinetic energy penetrator, the DM53. With the projectile including <b>sabot</b> weighing in at 8.35 kilograms with a 38:1 length to diameter ratio and with a muzzle velocity of , the DM53 has an effective engagement range of up to [...] A further development, called the DM63, improved upon the round by introducing a new temperature-independent propellant, which allows the propellant to have a constant pattern of expansion between ambient temperatures inside the gun barrel from [...] to [...] The new propellant powders, known as surface-coated double-base (SCDB) propellants, allow the DM63 to be used in many climates with consistent results. The new ammunition has been accepted into service with the Dutch and Swiss, as well as German, armies.|$|E
5000|$|The H&R {{design was}} the most advanced. It mounted the dart between three plastic <b>sabots</b> in a {{triangular}} plastic cartridge. When fired, the <b>sabots</b> were discarded early in small [...] "sub-barrels" [...] while the dart continued down the main barrel. Although the rounds were lightweight the weapon itself was not, at 24 lb loaded, and the weapon was quickly eliminated from the contest.|$|R

500|$|Charles Louis Critchfield (June 7, 1910 – February 12, 1994) was an American {{mathematical}} physicist. A {{graduate of}} George Washington University, where {{he earned his}} PhD in Physics {{under the direction of}} Edward Teller in 1939, he conducted research in ballistics [...] at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and received three patents for improved <b>sabot</b> designs.|$|E

500|$|The United States {{developed}} its own {{kinetic energy}} penetrator (KEP) tank {{round in the}} form of an Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding-Sabot (APFSDS) round, using a depleted uranium (DU) alloy long-rod penetrator (LRP), designated as the M829, followed by improved versions. An immediate improvement, known as the M829A1, was called the [...] "Silver Bullet" [...] after its good combat performance during the Gulf War against Iraqi T-55s, T-62s and T-72 tanks. The M829 series centers around the depleted uranium penetrator, designed to penetrate enemy armor through kinetic energy and to shatter inside the turret, doing much damage within the tank. In 1998, the United States military introduced the M829A2, which has an improved depleted uranium penetrator and composite <b>sabot</b> petals. In 2002, production began of the ($10,000 per round) M829A3 using a more efficient propellant (RPD-380 stick), a lighter injection-molded <b>sabot,</b> and a longer (800mm) and heavier (10kg / 22lb) DU penetrator, which is said to be able to defeat the latest versions of Russian Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA). This variant is unofficially referred to by Abrams tank crews as the [...] "super sabot". In response to the M829A3, the Russian army designed Relikt, the most modern Russian ERA, which is claimed to be twice as effective as Kontakt-5. A further improved M829E4 round with a segmented penetrator to defeat Relikt has been under development since 2011 and was to be fielded as the M829A4 in 2015.|$|E
