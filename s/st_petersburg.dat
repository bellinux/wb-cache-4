5|$|Giselle {{was first}} {{performed}} in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> on 18 December 1842. Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> Imperial Theatres, sent his ballet master Antoine Titus to Paris {{to find a}} new ballet for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose Giselle. The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg.</b> Perrot produced Giselle in <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E
5|$|Before Kudirka's death, {{the first}} {{performance}} of the poem occurred at a concert in <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> Russia in 1899.

The anthem was first performed in Lithuania during the Great Seimas of Vilnius on December 3, 1905.|$|E

5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After {{a lull in}} hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems that}} he returned to <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> as a war hero.|$|E
5|$|For Carlotta Grisi's {{performances}} as Giselle {{with the}} Imperial Ballet in <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni {{to score a}} new pas de cinq for the ballerina that {{was added to the}} first tableau. This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg.</b> Marius Petipa would also commission an additional piece for the first tableau of the ballet. This was a pas de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. As with Pugni's 1850 pas de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 pas de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.|$|E
