5|$|Having <b>stepped</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> exiled {{cabinet in}} 1941, Koht {{lived in the}} United States for the {{remainder}} of the war. There he continued his literary production; however, the books Norway Neutral and Invaded (1941) and The Voice of Norway (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in Swedish in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.|$|E

Nichols purchased the rights for his production company Icarus Productions for $250,000, with an additional $750,000 to come later from a studio interested in pursuing the project. Smith’s manuscript of A Simple Plan was optioned for development at an independent film studio, Savoy Pictures.

5|$|Following record attendances at State of Origin {{fixtures}} in Melbourne of 87,161 in 1994 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground), the Australian Rugby League (ARL) {{had planned}} to establish a Melbourne-based team in the Premiership by 1998. However, the disruption caused by the Super League war caused great change to the game in Australia. By May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot pushed for a Melbourne-based club for his competition, which was the rival of the ARL. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot <b>stepped</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> head of Super League {{to set up the}} club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then Super League announced that the new team would be named the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher <b>stepped</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal {{wanted a}} physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone {{took up the}} post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into {{a small amount of}} uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs.
