"Social e-shopping" merges shopping and social networking activities through social media online. Retailers employ social media to target teens and young adult consumers making {{social networking sites}} an essential venue to marketing practices and have begun to use Facebook commerce as it helps businesses facilitate and execute sales transactions. The research objectives were to investigate (1) whether personality traits (i. e., openness to experience, material resource needs, arousal needs) affected psychographic characteristics (i. e., market mavenism, social browsing, value consciousness) and intentions to social e-shop apparel, (2) whether psychographic characteristics affected gratifications (i. e., socializing, information-seeking) and intentions to social e-shop apparel, (3) whether gratifications affected intentions to social e-shop apparel, and (4) whether tie strength and homophily moderated the links between gratifications and intentions to social e-shop apparel within the Meta-Theoretical Model of Motivation and Personality developed by Mowen (2000). Participants (n = 601) were Facebook users from 18 to 44 years of age who had social shopping experience. They were drawn from a consumer panel. Data was collected through an online self-administered survey. Participants who were likely to social e-shop using Facebook {{for the purpose of}} information-seeking and socializing gratifications indicated that they intended to social e-shop apparel. Participants who were market mavens intended to social e-shop apparel. They were also likely to social e-shop for the purpose of socializing. Participants who were <b>social</b> <b>browsers</b> also intended to social e-shop apparel. They were also likely to social e-shop for the purposes of information-seeking and socializing. Participants who were value conscious intended to social e-shop apparel. They were also likely to social e-shop for the purpose of information-seeking. Participants who were open to experience were likely to be market mavens. Participants who needed arousal were likely to be <b>social</b> <b>browsers.</b> Participants who needed material resources were likely to be market mavens, <b>social</b> <b>browsers,</b> and to be value conscious. Tie strength and homophily moderated the links between both types of gratifications (socialization, information-seeking) and intentions to social e-shop apparel. Theoretical and managerial implications and suggestions for future research based on the findings were provided...|$|R

40|$|This book {{highlights}} {{recent developments}} in the field, presented at the Social Simulation 2015 conference in Groningen, The Netherlands. It covers advances both in applications and methods of social simulation. Societal issues addressed range across complexities in economic systems, opinion dynamics and civil violence, changing mobility patterns, different land-use, transition in the energy system, food production and consumption, ecosystem management and historical processes. Methodological developments cover how to use empirical data in validating models in general, formalization of behavioral theory in agent behavior, construction of artificial populations for experimentation, replication of models, and agent-based models that can be run in a web <b>browser.</b> <b>Social</b> simulation is a rapidly evolving field. Social scientists are increasingly interested in social simulation {{as a tool to}} tackle the complex non-linear dynamics of society. Furthermore, the software and hardware tools available for social simulation {{are becoming more and more}} powerful. This book is an important source for readers interested in the newest developments in the ways in which the simulation of social interaction contributes to our understanding and managing of complex social phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The Conversation Map {{system is}} a Usenet {{newsgroup}} browser that analyzes the text of an archive of newsgroup messages and outputs a graphical interface {{that can be used}} to search and read the messages of the archive. The system incorporates a series of novel text analysis procedures that automatically computes (1) a set of social networks detailing who is responding to and/or citing whom in the newsgroup; (2) a set of “discussion themes ” that are frequently used in the newsgroup archive; and, (3) a set of semantic networks that represent the main terms under discussion and some of their relationships to one another. The text analysis procedures are written in the Per 1 programming language. Their results are recorded as HTML, and the HTML is displayed with a Java applet. With the Java-based graphical interface one can browse a set of Usenet newsgroup articles according to who is “talking ” to whom, what they are “talking ” about, and the central terms and possible emergent metaphors of the conversation. In this paper it is argued that the Conversation Map system is just one example of a new kind of content-based browser that will combine the analysis powers of computational linguistics with a graphical interface to allow network documents and messages to be viewed in ways not possible with today’s, existing, formatbased browsers which do not analyze the contents of the documents or messages.

40|$|Abstract—Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is {{an attack}} {{outlined}} in the OWASP Top 10 whereby a malicious website will send a request to a web application that a user is already authenticated against from a different website. This way an attacker can access functionality in a target web application via the victim's already authenticated browser. Targets include web applications like <b>social</b> media, in <b>browser</b> email clients, online banking, and web interfaces for network devices. As browser holds valid session information of each request, a browser is {{the first place to}} look for attack symptoms and take actions. Current client side detection methods allow performing request to a trusted website by white listed third party websites. These approaches are not effective if policies are specified incorrectly, they do not focus on all the requests and cross check of response content type. To overcome these limitations, we acquaint a client side detection mechanism for the CSRF attack. Our approach relies on concept of a unique CSRF token which tends to change for each and every request. We can do that by using a unique number generator to generate the token. Then we try to match the token in the user's session data and invalidate it when we see it as a match or no token at all. This makes the token a used once. This protects us against repeated attacks. Moreover to overcome an attacker’s attempt to circumvent form visibility checking, we compare the response content type of a suspected request wit...|$|R
