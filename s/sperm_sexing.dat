It evaluates if they contain the larger X chromosome (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller Y chromosome (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm. The so-called Beltsfield <b>Sperm</b> <b>Sexing</b> Technology was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes. Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called Hoechst 33342 which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the [...] "female" [...] (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.|$|E

40|$|Sex {{allocation}} theory {{predicts that}} mothers {{would benefit from}} sex-biased differential investment into offspring {{in relation to their}} current local condition when it maximizes their lifetime reproductive return. In mammals, however, the extent of the sex bias at birth is often unpredictable, suggesting that mothers may be constrained in their ability to adjust sex ratios. None of the current hypothesized mechanisms of peri-conceptual mammalian maternal sex allocation fully explain the amount of variation observed, and as such I suggested three possible physiological constraints on maternal sex allocation. Firstly, mothers may be constrained by variation in physiological traits, particularly mediated during their own early development through in utero effects, such as testosterone levels and responsiveness to stress. I tested the effects of physiological changes caused by down-regulated stress during in utero development, and showed significant physiological changes in females, as a result of mismatching pre- and post-natal environments, that skewed sex ratios in the next generation. However, artificially lowering the stress of these females at conception will cause the sex ratio to return to parity, as the pre- and postnatal environments match again. Secondly, their physiology may be influenced more proximally, by not only their current condition or ability to invest, but by clinically asymptomatic disease and parasitic infection, particularly manipulative parasites. Lastly, paternal influences such as <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> ratios and seminal plasma constituents have been largely overlooked but may influence and constrain maternal ability to adjust sex ratios. I showed evidence of variations in <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> ratios, both in the literature and through observational studies where we would expect parity as a result of meiosis during sperm production. I also presented the first evidence of paternal sex allocation, through changes in <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> ratios and seminal plasma constituents in relation to coital rate, as a proxy of male attractiveness. The possibility of complementary or antagonistic interactions between maternal and paternal sex allocation should now be accounted for in future research. Overall, my thesis has provided explanations into previously unexplained variation in sex allocation research, and may assist with improvements to conservation breeding and livestock industries, as well as human health developments...|$|R

Considerable research has been undertaken worldwide on the Beltsville <b>sperm</b> <b>sexing</b> technology, the only effective method for pre-selection of sex of offspring.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} concern that the {{environmental}} contaminants, such as POPs, may contribute to sex ratio changes in offspring of exposed populations. Accidental exposure to TCDD {{has been shown to}} be associated with fewer sons in men who were exposed in adolescence or earlier in life. However, it is not known whether POPs could change the proportion of X- and Y-sperm. A variety of studies have indicated that POPs possess sex steroid-mimicking actions and/or AHR binding affinity. The aim of this thesis was to examine whether 1) the exposure to the POPs affects sperm Y:X ratio; 2) the endocrine disrupting action of POPs, in relation to observed changes in <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome ratio, may be modulated by genes involved in androgen and dioxin-mediated pathways; and 3) the functional interaction between AHR and the AR, which may play a part in regulation of sperm Y:X ratio, occurs in cultured Sertoli cells. The current study indicates that exposure to POPs may be involved in changing the proportion of Y-sperm. However, these findings were subject to modification, most likely due to varying exposure profiles and exposure levels, as indicated by diverging serum concentrations of CB- 153 and p,p´-DDE in different cohorts (Sweden, Greenland, Warsaw and Kharkiv) studied. Moreover, our findings lend support to the notion that polymorphisms in genes involved in androgen and dioxin-related pathways may predispose to augmented effects of POPs in increasing the sperm Y:X ratio. Thus, p,p´-DDE levels were associated with Y-sperm proportion in Swedish fishermen carrying < 22 CAG repeats in the AR and the AHRR P 185 A G-allele, but not in those missing one or both of these variants. We obtained, however, no evidence unambiguously demonstrating the mechanistic action of TCDD in interfering with androgen-dependent Pem reporter gene transcription in the SK 11 Sertoli cells. A larger series of experiments or another study design may be required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the anti-androgenic capability of TCDD in testis. In conclusion, high exposure to POPs could affect <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome ratio. These findings were subject to inter-country differences, likely dependent on differing blood levels and composition of POPs. The AR/AHRR genotypes may act as effect modifiers predisposing to <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> ratio changes.

40|$|The {{last several}} decades have seen an {{increase}} in male infertility concomitant with {{a decline in the}} birth sex ratio. The conditions are believed to be linked to increased exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including the persistent organic pollutants or lifestyle factors e. g. smoking. The mechanism behind the lowered birth sex ratio is unknown, but might be due to an EDC-induced skewing of the proportions of Y to X chromosome bearing sperms. The aims of this thesis were: to elucidate possible associations between the sperm Y:X ratio and EDCs in several highly exposed populations, to evaluate any relationships that might exist between the Y:X ratio and sperm parameters in subfertile men, and to investigate the effect of smoking on androgen regulation in vivo as well as in vitro. The <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome ratio was investigated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in n= 449 men from the Faroe Islands and compared to n= 414 men from Greenland, Ukraine and Poland. Infertile men n= 190 were enrolled at a fertility clinic in Denmark and androgenicity in smoking men was measured in n= 2156 men recruited for several previous epidemiological studies. The effect of smoking was assessed in a reporter system with the prostate specific antigen promoter driving a luciferase gene, in {{the presence or absence of}} various concentrations of the cigarette smoke constituent Benzo[α]Pyrene (BaP). In men from the Faroe Islands, the Y:X ratio was lower than in other highly exposed populations and a negative association between the <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome ratio and both dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane (DDE) and selected polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the somewhat older, proven fertile men was found. A positive trend between the Y:X ratio and perfuorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in a combined population of men from Greenland, Ukraine and Poland was found. The opposite association was observed in the Greenland Inuit alone. In subfertile men, a positive association between the Y:X ratio and progressive motility was noted. In two cohorts of smoking men, positive trends between groups of men with increasing exposure to cigarette smoke and androgen insensitivity was found. The in vitro experiments showed a significant deactivation of the AR at the highest BaP concentration. To conclude, high concentrations of EDCs influence the Y:X ratio in highly exposed populations i. e. men from Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The inter-population differences in Y:X ratio might be genetic or due to lifestyle factors such as diet. Men with low progressive motility had lower Y:X ratio, possibly explaining the low birth sex ratio seen following intra cytoplasmic sperm injection. Indications that smoking has adverse effects on the androgenicity were observed both in vivo and in vitro...|$|R

Immature oocytes recovered from ovaries of slaughtered animals and matured in vitro in TCM- 199 containing 20 % estrus cow serum and additional granulosa cells were fertilized in vitro with fresh or frozen-thawed fractions of sorted sperm. Simultaneously, control, fresh or frozen/thawed sperm was used for IVF. A total number of 2712 IVM oocytes were fertilized with sorted and control sperm of 6 bulls. Embryo cleavage rates were significantly affected by bull (P< 0. 0001), <b>sperm</b> <b>sexing</b> (P< 0. 0001) and sperm freezing (P< 0. 01). Blastocysts development was affected by sperm freezing (P< 0. 04) and <b>sperm</b> <b>sexing</b> (P< 0. 01). The significant differences were shown between unsorted and sorted sperm, however no differences in embryo cleavage rates and blastocysts rates were observed between X- and Y-sperm fractions, both fresh and frozen/ thawed.

Non mosaic 47,XXY Klinefelter patients (12 subjects) show a significantly lower percentage of normal Y-bearing sperm and slightly higher percentage of normal X-bearing sperm. Consistent with the hypothesis that 47,XXY germ cells may undergo and complete meiosis, aneuploidy rate for XX- and XY-disomies is also increased with respect to controls, whereas the percentage of YY-disomies is normal. Aneuploidy rates in men with mosaic 47,XXY/ 46,XY (11 subjects) are lower than those observed in men with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome, and only the frequency of XY-disomic sperm is significantly higher with respect to controls. Although the great majority of children born by intracytoplasmic sperm injection from Klinefelter subjects are chromosomally normal, the risk of producing offspring with chromosome aneuploidies is significant. Men with Y chromosome microdeletions (14 subjects) showed a reduction of normal Y-bearing sperm, and an increase in nullisomic and XY-disomic sperm, suggesting an instability of the deleted Y chromosome causing its loss in germ cells, and meiotic alterations leading to XY non-disjunction.

To investigate the sperm surface proteins, proteomic investigation using 2 dimensional gel (2 D-gel) electrophoresis technique has been applied. The initial step, protein extraction is very important. Thus, the suitable strategies for sperm surface protein extraction from unsorted boar spermatozoa surface were considered for further use in 2 D-gel analyses. The sperm surface proteins were extracted and then purified using Con-A Sepharose beads. After 22 h incubation, 2. 625 mg/ml and 0. 186 mg/ml of the total protein can be obtained using extraction solution with and without 0. 5 % Triton X- 100, respectively. The small-sized proteins (~ 13 - 16 kDa) were the major products which can be extracted immediately in extraction solution containing Triton X- 100. Almost all of the proteins, especially the small-sized products (~ 13 and 16 kDa), were tightly bound to the Con-A Sepharose beads even in the presence of 800 mM D-glucopyranoside.

Use of GSH at both concentrations (1 and 5. mM) resulted in greater mitochondrial activity as compared with findings for the Control, TRX 1 and TRX 5 groups. Results {{of this study indicate that}} GSH is a suitable supplement for electroejaculated red deer sperm. It would be necessary to conduct fertility trials (in vivo and in vitro), to assess whether GSH supplementation of thawed red deer sperm could improve fertility rates.

40|$|Now {{there are}} three ways to select {{the sex of the}} fetus before {{implantation}} (1, 2). Two of these methods are scientifically proven that are used in the fertility and infertility centers (3). Two types of pre implantation methods (PGD and Ericsson method) used for social sex selection. Both of them are based on actively rendering the second sex chromosome to be either a Y chromosome (resulting in a male), or an X chromosome (resulting in a female). Another way to determine the sex of an embryo before implantation is called PGD (pre implantation genetic diagnosis). In this procedure, after ovarian stimulation multiple oocytes are removed from the mother. The eggs are fertilized in the laboratory using the father's sperm in a technique called in vitro fertilization (IVF). As the embryos develop through cleavage, a blastomere is removed from each embryo and then assessed for the presence of Y and X chromosome and separated by sexual chromosome. Embryos of the desired gender are transferred back in the mother's uterus (4). There are two ways to select the sperm sex; Micro Sort and Ericsson method (5, 6). In this way the sperm that contain the desired sex chromosome can be selected and used for fertilization of female gametes. In Ericsson as sperm passes through albumin gradient, the differences in mass between the X and Y chromosomes cause the females dragged down by the weight of the extra "leg " of the X sex chromosome. The method has a 70 - 72 % success rate for boys and a 69 - 75 % success rate for girls (2). The third method is the determination of <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes in <b>sperm</b> sorting by flow cytometry.

40|$|Single Layer Centrifugation is {{a useful}} {{technique}} to select sperm with good quality. The use of selection methods such as Androcoll could become an important tool {{to improve the quality}} of sperm samples and therefore to improve other artificial reproductive techniques such as <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> sorting, in vitro fertilization or AI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a Single Layer Centrifugation with Androcoll-S on the sperm quality of red deer sperm samples of two different origins, electroejaculated samples and epididymal samples obtained post-mortem, after thawing and after an incubation for 2. h at 37. °C. Sperm motility, viability, membrane permeability, mitochondrial activity, acrosomal status and DNA fragmentation were determined for all samples. The samples selected by Androcoll-S showed an improvement in sperm kinematics compared to unselected samples after thawing and after incubation. The same effect was observed in parameters such as viability, mitochondrial activity or acrosomal status which were improved after the selection. In contrast, no difference was found in DNA fragmentation between selected and unselected samples within the same sperm type. We conclude that sperm selection by SLC with Androcoll-S after thawing for red deer sperm of both types is a suitable technique that allows sperm quality in both types of sperm samples to be improved, thereby improving other assisted reproductive techniques. Further studies (IVF and in vivo fertilization) are required to determine whether this improvement can increase fertility, as has been shown for other species.

40|$|Abstract. Effective {{preselection}} of sex {{has been}} accomplished in several species of livestock and also in humans using the flow cytometric sperm sorting method. A guaranteed high sorting accuracy is a key prerequisite for {{the widespread use of}} <b>sperm</b> <b>sexing.</b> The standard validation method is flow cytometric remeasurement of the DNA content of the sexed sperm. Since this method relies on the same instrument that produced the original sperm separation, it is not truly independent. Therefore, to be able to specifically produce either male or female offspring in the dog, we developed a method of direct visualization of sex chromosomes in a single sperm using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a validation method. Denaturation of canine spermatozoa by immersion in 1 M NaOH for 4 min yielded consistent hybridization results with over 97 % hybridization efficiency and a good preservation of sperm morphology. There {{was no significant difference between}} the theoretical ratio (50 : 50) and the observed ratio of X- and Y-chromosome-bearing spermatozoa in any of the three dogs. In addition, the mean purities of flow-sorted sex chromosomes in spermatozoa of the three dogs were 90. 8 % for the X chromosome fraction and 89. 6 % for the Y chromosome fraction. This sorting was evaluated by using the dual color FISH protocol. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the FISH protocol worked reliably for both unsorted and sexed sperm samples.

40|$|Millions of {{preselected}} progeny {{have been}} born since the development of The Beltsville <b>Sperm</b> <b>Sexing</b> Technology 1986. The method is based on flow cytometry and sorting is done {{on the basis of}} DNA difference of the X- and Y-chromosomes. Preselection of progeny provides an opportunity to obtain genetic gain and increased production as well as increased animal welfare and decreased environmental impact. However, the method is associated with low fertility, high costs and uncertainty whether the sorting process contributes to DNA damage and thereby results in genetically impaired progeny. Today, sex sorted sperm is only commercially available in the bovine industry, {{due to the fact that}} bull sperm is more suitable for selection than sperm from other species. Application of sex selected sperm leads to high fertility results in sheep and a commercialization might soon be available but the profitability of the production is questioned. The sorting process is too slow to sort the high amount of sperm that is needed for successful insemination of pigs. However, deep intrauterine insemination (DUI) with a Fireflex® catheter might be a future alternative for application of sex sorted sperm in the swine industry. Insemination of stallion sperm with hysteroscopy has been proven successful but the method is limited due to high costs and low fertility results. For commercialization of sex sorted sperm on any other animal species than bovine, the technology of the sorting process has to be simplified and made more effective, and more studies have to be done to investigate the impact of the sorting process on the sperm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{environmental}} pesticide exposures, such as pyrethroids, {{and their relationship}} to sperm abnormalities are not well understood. This study investigated whether environmental exposure to pyrethroids was associated with altered frequency of <b>sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome disomy in adult men. Methods A sample of 75 subjects recruited through a Massachusetts infertility clinic provided urine and semen samples. Individual exposures were measured as urinary concentrations of three pyrethroid metabolites ((3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 PBA), cis- and trans- 3 -(2, 2 -Dichlorovinyl) - 1 -methylcyclopropane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylic acid (CDCCA and TDCCA)). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 was used to determine XX, YY, XY, 1818, and total sex chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between aneuploidy rates and pyrethroid metabolites while adjusting for covariates. Results Between 25 - 56 % of the sample were above the limit of detection (LOD) for the pyrethroid metabolites. All sex chromosome disomies were increased by 7 - 30 % when comparing men with CDCCA and TDCCA levels above the LOD to those below the LOD. For 3 PBA, compared to those below the LOD, those above the LOD had YY 18 disomy rates 1. 28 times higher (95 % CI: 1. 15, 1. 42) whereas a reduced rate was seen for XY 18 and total disomy (IRR[*]=[*] 0. 82; 95 % CI: 0. 77, 0. 87; IRR[*]=[*] 0. 93; 95 % CI: 0. 87 - 0. 97), and no association was seen for XX 18 and 1818. Conclusions Our findings suggest that urinary concentrations of CDCCA and TDCCA above the LOD were associated with increased rates of aneuploidy. However the findings for 3 BPA were not consistent. This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between pyrethroid metabolites and aneuploidy can be fully defined...|$|R
40|$|Recent reports {{suggest that}} {{children}} born after {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}} performed for male factor infertility {{are at increased risk}} of congenital malformations and chromosome aberrations. To explain these observations, we hypothesized that infertile men may be more likely than fertile men to have genetic abnormalities. We studied 750 severely oligozoospermic men (sperm count < 5 million/ml) who were candidates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and 303 fertile men. We analyzed the peripheral blood karyotype, the Y chromosome long arm for detection of microdeletions in the azoospermia factors, and mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene and the androgen receptor gene. We also analyzed sperm for chromosome aneuploidies among the 421 men who subsequently entered the in vitro fertilization program. A total of 104 genetic abnormalities were diagnosed, corresponding to a frequency of 13. 9 % (104 of 750). Chromosomal aberrations were present in 5. 6 % (42 of 750) of infertile men and 0. 3 % of controls (one of 295), and they were in most cases alterations of the sex chromosomes. Y chromosome long-arm microdeletions were detected in 6. 0 % (45 of 750) of infertile men and most frequently included the azoospermia factor c, whereas no cases were found in controls (zero of 210). Mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene were diagnosed in 1. 2 % (nine of 750) of infertile men and 1. 0 % of controls (three of 303), and mutations in the androgen receptor gene were found in 1. 1 % (eight of 750) of infertile men and none of the 188 controls. <b>Sperm</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome aneuploidies were increased in men with karyotype anomalies and Y chromosome microdeletions as well as in subjects without constitutional genetic abnormalities. This study shows that the frequency of genetic alterations is increased among men with severe spermatogenic impairment. Genetic tests and genetic counseling should therefore be considered in oligozoospermic men who are candidates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection...|$|R
