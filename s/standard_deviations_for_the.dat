40|$|A 13 mJ NdYAG 1064 nm, 4 ns, {{laser pulse}} was {{employed}} to produce ultrasonic plate waves in 20 percent porous SiC/SiC composite tensile specimens of three different architectures. An air coupled 0. 5 MHz transducer was used to detect and collect the waveforms which contained first antisymmetric plate wave pulses for determining the shear wave velocity (VS). These results were compared to VS values determined on the same specimens with 0. 5 MHz ultrasonic transducers with contact coupling. Averages of four noncontact determinations on each of 18 specimens were compared to averages of four contact values. The noncontact VS's fall in the same range as the contact. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> noncontact VS's averaged 2. 8 percent. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> contact measurements averaged 2. 3 percent, indicating similar reproducibility.

40|$|A {{directional}} spherical wavelet {{analysis is}} performed {{to examine the}} Gaussianity of the WMAP 1 -year data. Such an analysis is facilitated {{by the introduction of}} a fast directional continuous spherical wavelet transform. Significant deviations from Gaussianity are detected in the skewness and kurtosis of spherical elliptical Mexican hat and real Morlet wavelet coefficients for both the WMAP and Tegmark foreground removed maps. In particular, the skewness of spherical real Morlet wavelet coefficients on wavelet scale 550 ' (corresponding to an effective size on the sky of approximately 26 degrees) and at an azimuthal orientation of 72 degrees, deviates by 5. 88 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> WMAP map and by 6. 72 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tegmark map.
