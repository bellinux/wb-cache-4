5|$|Mulder—on {{his way to}} England {{investigating}} heart chakra-shaped crop circles—calls Scully {{and asks}} her to meet a contact of his, Colleen Azar (Colleen Flynn), to obtain some information. As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her. When she later arrives {{at the house of}} Azar, <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive.|$|E

From the demand side, there is diverse evidence that peacekeeping missions are deployed in the countries who need it the most, this is where the risk of a recurring war is high.|$|E

She refuses and gets jealous when <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> Luke flirting with Jennifer. Scotty tells Laura she has to quit her job at the disco. On her last night, she shares a romantic kiss with Luke. Horrified, she slaps him. Later she accidentally gets locked in his office, overhearing Luke and Frank {{discussing}} mob business. When Frank discovers her, he forces her to continue to work at the disco. She tells Luke not to marry Jennifer. He traps Laura on a sailboat and forces her to admit she loves him. Again he orders her to turn him in for raping her. She refuses. He realizes he is in too deep with the mob to ever be with Laura. She writes him a letter expressing her feelings, which Scotty finds on the day of Luke and Jennifer's wedding. Scotty interrupts the ceremony on Frank's yacht and knocks Luke overboard, leading everyone to believe he was dead.|$|E

25|$|The {{second season}} had {{fourteen}} roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven {{were part of}} the first season's main cast. The season sees the promotion of three former guest stars, who begin acting as series regulars from the season's first episode. The series is narrated by Brenda Strong, {{from the point of view}} of the deceased Mary Alice Young, as <b>she</b> <b>observes,</b> from a unique perspective, the lives of the Wisteria Lane residents and her former best friends. Susan Mayer, portrayed by Teri Hatcher, is divorcée and single mother, who, in her continuous search for a romantic commitment, ends up in bed with her former husband. Felicity Huffman portrayed Lynette Scavo, who starts neglecting her responsibilities as a mother, after the realization of her undeniable talent for advertising results in her going back to work after a six-year absence. Marcia Cross portrayed Bree Van de Kamp, whose flawless life is shaken after she starts dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, while trying to overcome her guilt for having dated the man who killed him. Former model Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria, who suffers a miscarriage just as she starts accepting upcoming motherhood. Nicollette Sheridan portrayed Edie Britt, whose commitment issues and numerous one night stands have made her an iconic character. Ricardo Antonio Chavira played Gabrielle's husband, Carlos Solis, who has to cope with the revelation of his wife's affair with their gardener, while trying to get out of jail. Mark Moses continues his role of widower Paul Young, who tries to cover up the murder of his adoptive son's biological mother. Zach Young, portrayed by Cody Kasch, finally learns about his true identity, but refuses to be a part of his father's life, whereas Julie Mayer, Susan's daughter portrayed by Andrea Bowen, deals with her parents' unexpected reconciliation. James Denton portrayed Mike Delfino, who has to deal with both his break-up with Susan Mayer, and his recently discovered biological son. Previously a recurring character throughout the last episodes of the previous season, Betty Applewhite, portrayed by Alfre Woodard, was conceived as a new resident of Wisteria Lane, whose mysterious arc is the season's main storyline. Also promoted from guest stars to series regulars were Doug Savant and Richard Burgi, who portrayed Tom Scavo and Karl Mayer, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Gertrude Bell's biographer, Georgina Howell, {{writes of}} Lowthian Bell that through his {{writings}} such as The Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting {{he was seen}} as the [...] "high priest of British Metallurgy". <b>She</b> <b>observes</b> that he was noted also for his wealth and for the innovations he made, {{such as the use of}} steel-making slag as phosphate fertilizer, and that he was arguably Britain's [...] "foremost industrialist". Among his friends were famous Victorians such as Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, William Morris and John Ruskin. However, Howell writes, [...] "Lowthian was admired rather than loved, and appears to have been dictatorial and harsh towards his family." [...] <b>She</b> <b>observes</b> that [...] "There is to this day no biography of the man who was as famous in his day as Isambard Kingdom Brunel." ...|$|E
500|$|Dickson Wright also {{comments}} on the early signs in Modern Cookery of what she considers the increasing dullness of Victorian cookery. Although she finds Acton [...] "in most respects an admirable cookery writer", <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> that {{between the first and}} the third editions Acton has gone from using garlic sparingly to avoiding it entirely. She is equally scathing about Acton's [...] "Burlington Whimsey" [...] which she calls [...] "basically a dish of brawn"; she argues that the Victorians were too fond of it, and that Acton's recipe is [...] "the epitome of dull food dressed up to look whimsical." ...|$|E

[...] <b>She</b> <b>observes</b> that long hair is natural, like the [...] "elegant plumage" [...] of male birds ("My Conviction"). [...] She opens her coat to reveal that she's a man in drag.

500|$|On the film's 10th anniversary, Alyssa Rosenberg {{wrote in}} The Washington Post that Miranda {{anticipated}} female antiheroines of popular television {{series of the}} later 2000s and 2010s such as Scandals Olivia Pope and Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones. Like them, <b>she</b> <b>observes,</b> Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters, despite her moral failings, that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it, to [...] "prov, as a creature of sentiment, that she never belonged {{there in the first}} place." [...] In doing so, however successfully to herself and others, [...] "she has zipped herself into a life as regimented and limited as a skintight pencil skirt." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". <b>She</b> <b>observes</b> that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E

500|$|Christine Mitchell, {{reviewing}} the Chawton House reprint in 2010 for the Jane Austen Society of North America, [...] wrote that Eliza Smith's book [...] "met the growing {{need for a}} text to assist women with their task of maintaining a household." [...] She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system that brings us out-of-season produce. Yet, <b>she</b> <b>observes,</b> the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as [...] " [...] chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." [...] Reflecting that the recipes would [...] "probably never" [...] be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers {{a glimpse into the}} world of Jane Austen and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.|$|E
500|$|Stefani's vocals {{range from}} {{innocent}} to seductive, sometimes transitioning {{from one to}} the other within a song. Her lyrics are based on her relationship with Rossdale, whom she married less than a year after the album's release. Stefani is openhearted and unreserved as on Return of Saturn, but her approach becomes more immediate and instinctive. The lyrics are more youthful than those on Return of Saturn and detail partying and feelings of lust. An overarching theme on the album is Stefani's impatience in the couple's long-distance relationship. She discusses wanting to see Rossdale on [...] "Making Out" [...] and [...] "Waiting Room", and she reveals her distrust in Rossdale on [...] "In My Head". On [...] "Hey Baby" [...] she gives an innocuous account of the debauchery between her bandmates and their groupies during parties, as <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> the party. The lyrics of [...] "Underneath It All" [...] question whether or not Rossdale is a good match for her, an issue resolved in the chorus, which was written based on a journal entry where Stefani wrote the line [...] "You're lovely underneath it all" [...] about Rossdale.|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon is {{touring the}} city, with guides. Factory workers present {{her with a}} small model {{elephant}} which, she delightedly informs them, is {{the symbol of the}} Republican Party which her husband leads. [...] She visits a commune where she is greeted enthusiastically, and is captivated by the children's games that <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> in the school. [...] "I used to be a teacher many years ago", she sings, [...] "and now I'm here to learn from you". She moves on to the Summer Palace, where in a contemplative aria ("This is prophetic") she envisages a peaceful future for the world. [...] In the evening the presidential party, as guests of Mao's wife Chiang Ch'ing, attends the Peking Opera for a performance of a political ballet-opera The Red Detachment of Women. This depicts the downfall of a cruel and unscrupulous landlord's agent (played by an actor who strongly resembles Kissinger) at the hands of brave women revolutionary workers. The action deeply affects the Nixons; at one point Pat rushes onstage to help a peasant girl she thinks is being whipped to death. As the stage action ends, Chiang Ch'ing, angry at the apparent misinterpretation of the piece's message, sings a harsh aria ("I am the wife of Mao Tse-tung"), praising the Cultural Revolution and glorifying her own part in it. A revolutionary chorus echoes her words.|$|E

500|$|Wishology {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Eileen Cruz of Toon Zone mainly praised it. Specifically, <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> that it [...] "manages {{to remain}} largely fresh {{the entire time}} for an animated comedy episode over two hours long". Aaron Bynum of The Animation Insider, however, gave a more negative review. He suggested it was only [...] "moderately entertaining", saying it is [...] "just another over-exerted animated epic of an over-extended property." [...] Cruz commented positively on the show's usage of a mix of standard and computer animation; however, she noted the blend between special 3D objects and their surroundings was [...] "not perfect", though [...] "not distracting either". Bynum stated the animated trilogy's usage of computer animation was [...] "rather needless", and its cultural parodies were [...] "tired and forgettable". While he finds [...] "The Final Ending" [...] interesting {{enough to keep the}} viewer engaged, he also criticized the series as a whole. He said, [...] "it would appear that the cartoon is no longer an exclusive journey into one child's ever-changing imagination; now, it's just a fanciful what-if". Cruz praised the role of the band Kiss. She cannot think of too many other bands that [...] "could exist in such a universe with such an exaggerated reality". However, she criticized the voice portrayal of Turbo Thunder, finding it to be [...] "entirely unattractive" [...] and [...] "off-putting," [...] and thus [...] "it simply didn't work for me." [...] Bynum, however, had a more positive reaction to the character. He noted Turbo Thunder was [...] "hilariously pretentious and self-serving", and he [...] "ultimately makes the second chapter [...] a whole lot better by acting as a frenemy with similar goals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{homosexual}}ity, Ali, {{says that}} the belief that “exclusively homosexual desire is innate in some individuals” has been adopted “even among some relatively conservative Western Muslim thinkers.”100 Homosexual Muslims believe their homosexuality to be innate and view “their sexual orientation as God-given and immutable.”123 <b>She</b> <b>observes</b> that [...] “queer and trans people are sometimes treated as defective or deviant,” and she adds that it is “vital not to assume that variation implies imperfection or disability.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Lisa Silberman Brenner contradicts this view. She {{returns to}} the {{intentions}} expressed by Samson Raphaelson, on whose play the film's script was closely based: [...] "For Raphaelson, jazz is prayer, American style, and the blackface minstrel the new Jewish cantor. Based on the author's own words, the play is about blackface {{as a means for}} Jews to express a new kind of Jewishness, that of the modern American Jew." [...] <b>She</b> <b>observes</b> that during the same period, the Jewish press was noting with pride that Jewish performers were adopting aspects of African American music.|$|E

She harbors a collection of firearms that shoot snow-based ammo such as ice bullets. In the second season of the anime, she and Kurumu's mother have an ongoing rivalry, originating from their days at Yokai. In the Japanese anime, Tsurara is voiced by Yuko Minaguchi. In the English dub, her voice is provided by Cynthia Cranz.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff VanderMeer has {{described}} The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman as [...] "the finest surrealist {{novel of the}} past 30 years.

In the New York Times, William Hjortsberg recommended Carter's novel, noting its attention to detail and maintaining that while reading [...] "We soon forget that the terrain <b>she</b> <b>observes</b> with such care is the interior of her own imagination, for the world she describes becomes as real as any naturalist's report." [...] However, he criticised Carter's wordiness and her overuse of abstraction, simile, and metaphors.
