40|$|Recently we {{developed}} supervisor localization, a top-down approach to distributed control of discrete-event systems (DES) with finite behavior. Its essence is {{the allocation of}} monolithic (global) control action among the local control strategies of individual agents. In this report, we extend supervisor localization to study the distributed control of DES with infinite behavior. Specifically, we first employ Thistle and Wonham's supervisory control theory for DES with infinite behavior to compute a <b>safety</b> <b>supervisor</b> (for safety specifications) and a liveness supervisor (for liveness specifications), and then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the <b>safety</b> <b>supervisor</b> into a set of safety local controllers, one for each controllable event, and decompose the liveness supervisor into a set of liveness local controllers, two for each controllable event. The localization procedure for decomposing the liveness supervisor is novel; in particular, a local controller is responsible for disabling the corresponding controllable event on {{only part of the}} states of the liveness supervisor, and consequently, the derived local controller in general has states number no more than that computed by considering the disablement on all the states. Moreover, we prove that the derived local controllers achieve the same controlled behavior with the safety and liveness supervisors. We finally illustrate the result by a Small Factory example...|$|E

40|$|The {{concern for}} workers’ safety in {{construction}} industry {{is reflected in}} many studies focusing on static safety risk identification and assessment. However, studies on real-time safety risk assessment aimed at reducing uncertainty and supporting quick response are rare. A method for real-time safety risk assessment (RTSRA) to implement a dynamic evaluation of worker safety states on construction site has been proposed in this paper. The method provides construction managers who {{are in charge of}} safety with more abundant information to reduce the uncertainty of the site. A quantitative calculation formula, integrating the influence of static and dynamic hazards and that of <b>safety</b> <b>supervisors,</b> is established to link the safety risk of workers with the locations of on-site assets. By employing the hidden Markov model (HMM), the RTSRA provides a mechanism for processing location data provided by the real-time location system (RTLS) and analyzing the probability distributions of different states in terms of false positives and negatives. Simulation analysis demonstrated the logic of the proposed method and how it works.

40|$|Despite {{repeated}} {{calls from}} scientists and practitioners alike, industrial and organizational psychologists {{have been reluctant}} to substantively address workplace health and safety issues. Human and financial costs would seem to mandate that social-organizational processes which may affect or minimize injury occurrence receive significant empirical attention. ^ The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the influence of subordinate involvement in safety issues upon subordinates 2 ̆ 7 intentions to approach and correct co-workers engaged in unsafe acts, subordinates 2 ̆ 7 likelihood of performing unsafe acts themselves, and subordinate injuries. A secondary objective of the present study was to examine the role of supervisor involvement in safety issues as a potential cross-level moderator variable in the subordinate safety involvement-subordinate safety outcome relationship. It was expected that the relationships between subordinate involvement in safety and approach intentions, unsafe behaviors and injuries would be stronger among subordinates with supervisors with high safety involvement as compared to subordinates with supervisors with low safety involvement. ^ Data were collected via questionnaire from 27 units responsible for light industrial work in three organizations. Principal components analysis indicated that subordinate involvement in safety was comprised of four distinct factors: (1) safety training, (2) responsibility for safety, (3) safety importance, and (4) control of <b>safety.</b> <b>Supervisor</b> involvement in safety appeared to be a unitary construct. ^ Predictions were tested through the use of moderated multiple regression. Results indicated that each of the four subordinate safety involvement factors was an effective predictor of subordinate approach intentions, unsafe behaviors or both. The subordinate safety involvement factors were relatively ineffective with respect to predicting subordinate injuries. The relationship between subordinate control of safety and two subordinate safety outcomes, (approach intentions and serious injuries) was moderated by supervisor involvement in safety, although not in the direction predicted. ^ The results of this study provide preliminary evidence regarding the linear and interactive influences of subordinate and supervisor involvement in safety on workplace safety outcomes.

Although fentanyl (1 – 3  µg kg− 1) and etomidate (0.3  mg kg− 1) were the preferred pre-treatment and induction agents, the operators selected the sedatives and dosages after considering each patient’s condition. A sedative was administered 2  min after pre-treatment agent injection, and tracheal intubation was performed 20 – 30  s later. The operators chose either a curved Macintosh laryngoscope with metal reusable blade or a GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA) as the initial device. Tracheal intubation was supervised by an experienced operator when performed by an inexperienced operator. If the second intubation attempt was unsuccessful, the experienced operator performed the third attempt. However, for the patient <b>safety,</b> <b>supervisors</b> tended to intubate directly if the patient was expected to have difficult airway or hemodynamically unstable. It is presumed that relatively less severe patients were intubated by inexperienced operators and with direct laryngoscopy for the training purpose. Correct tracheal tube placement was assessed using careful auscultation, end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement, and chest radiography. The end-tidal carbon dioxide level was measured using an EMMA Emergency Capnograph (Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA). After each tracheal intubation, intubation-related information was recorded on a data collection sheet by MET nurses, and all tracheal intubations were reviewed in regular weekly meetings.|$|R

40|$|The present master thesis has {{the purpose}} to analyze Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) {{regarding}} their potential to improve traffic safety of autonomous vehicles. First {{the characteristics of}} the automated driving levels are described and ADAS as active safety systems are differentiated from other systems. Several ADAS are defined based on their functionality and are categorized based on the automation levels. A New Era in safety technology is exceeded by the introduction of partially automated driving concepts since 2016. Although the number of fatalities is decreasing, the number of accidents is increasing year-after-year, whereby nearly 90 % are caused by human mistakes. Studies for the theoretical potential of collision avoidance and the consumer acceptance revealed, that the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) systems is superior to the other ADAS. By conducting a market analysis on the new German car market about the availability of ADAS, it was found, that AEB systems are superior too. AEB systems are offered for 69 % of all models. In general, two versions are distinguished: AEB city for small speed ranges, and AEB interurban up to the top speed, whereby both can be offered in combinations to the customer. ACC LKA and PA are available for around the half of the models. An in-depth analysis of the AEB examined technical details on how the risk assessment of AEB systems is done by a patent search and with published information of the OEM. Thereby, it is found that most of the OEM seems to work with risk assessment metrics TTC and ETTC and today's AEB is designed to prevent human failure. But in case of autonomous systems, system failure must be prevented from the system itself and therefore, the system architecture has to be changed in the design. In {{the state of the art}} the most important closed and still ongoing projects in the field of autonomous driving and safety, as well as strategic partnerships of companies for collaborating research and finally some concept cars of well-established OEM and the vehicles of new entrants are described. Main fields of research affect the concepts to combine the human driver and the autonomous driving system and the application of AI. Finally, the <b>Safety</b> <b>Supervisor</b> (SSV) concept, a framework for runtime safety monitoring of autonomous systems, is explained and exemplified on a platooning system in Matlab/Simulink. This is done by implementing an AEB system with three risk assessment metrics TTC, ETTC and TTB. Results of simulations have shown, that the AEB is able to avoid, if TTC or ETTC are used, or mitigate, if TTB is used and therefore, the SSV can provide a useful framework for future research...|$|E
40|$|A {{multi-level}} safety {{climate model}} was {{tested in the}} Australian construction industry. Subcontracted workers' perceptions of the organizational safety response (OSR) and <b>supervisor</b> <b>safety</b> response (SSR) in their own organization {{and that of the}} principal contractor were measured using a safety climate survey administered at a large hospital construction project in Melbourne. One hundred and fourteen construction workers completed the survey, representing nine subcontractors engaged at the project. Two requisite conditions for the existence of group-level safety climates, i. e. (1) within-group homogeneity; and (2) between-group variation were satisfied for perceptions of subcontractors' OSR and SSR. This supports the contention that subcontractors working in a single construction project exhibit a unique group-level safety climate. Subcontracted workers also discriminated between group-level safety climates (i. e. the SSR) in their own and in the principal contractor's organizations. The results suggest some cross-level influence. Perceptions of the SSR were positively predicted by perceptions of the OSR in both the principal and subcontractor organizations. Perceptions of the OSR of the principal contractor were also a significant predictor of the perceived OSR and SSR in the subcontractor organizations. Perceptions of the subcontractors' SSR were a significant predictor of the rate of lost-time and medical treatment incidents reported by the subcontractor. Although perceptions of the principal contractor's SSR were not directly related to subcontractors' injury rates, they were a significant predictor of subcontractors' SSR, revealing an indirect link. The results suggest that supervisory personnel (e. g. foremen and leading hands) {{play an important role in}} shaping safety performance in subcontracted workgroups.

40|$|Intrusion (unauthorized stepping-into/staying-in a {{hazardous}} area), {{as a common}} type of near-miss, is the prime cause {{of the majority of}} incidents on construction sites including fall from heights, and striking against or being struck by moving objects. Accidents often occur because workers take shortcuts moving about the site without fully perceiving the potential dangers. A number of researches have been devoted to developing methods to prevent such behaviors mainly based on the theory of Behavior-Based Safety (BBS), which aims to cultivate safety behaviors among workers in accordance with safety regulations. In current BBS practice, trained observers and <b>safety</b> <b>supervisors</b> are responsible for safety behavior inspections following safety plans and operation regulations. The observation process is time-consuming and its effectiveness depends largely on the observer’s safety knowledge and experience, which often results in omissions or bias. This paper presents a reformed safety behavior modification approach by integrating a location-based technology with BBS. Firstly, a detailed background is provided, covering current intrusion problems on site, existing use of BBS for behavior improvement, difficulties in achieving widespread adoption and potential technologies for location tracking and in-time feedback. Then, a conceptual framework of positioning technology-enhanced BBS is developed, followed by details of the corresponding on-line supporting system, Real Time Location System (RTLS) and Virtual Construction System (VCS). The application of the system is then demonstrated and tested in a construction site in Hong Kong.

The three-step risk assessment was performed in 35 ship recycling yards through questionnaire surveys and door-to-door communication. Thus, 35 data sets from field personnel at the ship recycling yards, each data set with 8 risk indexes (4 risk indexes each, before and after implementing corrective actions) were collected. In addition, 9 data sets were collected to document the perceptions of experts. In all, a total of 44 data sets were collected and used to validate the risk assessment method. Validation of the three-step method, essentially addresses the differences (or similarities) in "perception of risk" by several health, safety and environment (HSE) managers who volunteered for the risk assessment exercise. In order to validate the risk assessment method, three validation protocols were developed. Consistency check on the data sets was also performed and {{it was found that the}} relationship was linear with the slope close to unity. The example illustrating the application of Three Step Method in identifying and minimizing risks provides clear understanding for, the users of this method.

Results Pharmacist’s drug safety practice in regions with higher per capita GDP and more abundant medical resources was still better than that in regions with lower per capita GDP and less abundant medical resources. In all districts of China, pharmacist’s drug safety knowledge, drug safety attitude, self-perceived pressure and fatigue, hospital management quality, and hospital regulation were major influencing factors for pharmacist’s drug safety practice, while only in regions with higher per capita GDP and more abundant medical resources, hospital drug <b>safety</b> culture, <b>supervisor’s</b> work team management, cooperation atmosphere of work team, and drug safety culture of work team were major influencing factors for pharmacist’s drug safety practice.

Next, using survey data collectedfrom 1342 employees in 32 Italian organizations, we found that employee-level <b>supervisor</b> enforce-ment, organizational-level <b>safety</b> climate, and autocratic, bureaucratic, and technocratic safety culturedimensions all predicted individual-level safety compliance behaviors. However, the cross-level moder-ating effect of safety climate was bounded by certain safety culture dimensions, such that <b>safety</b> climatemoderated the <b>supervisor</b> enforcement-compliance relationship only under the clan-patronage culturedimension. Additionally, the autocratic and bureaucratic culture dimensions attenuated the relation-ship between supervisor enforcement and compliance. Finally, when testing the effects of technocraticsafety culture and cooperative safety culture, neither safety culture nor climate moderated the relation-ship between <b>supervisor</b> enforcement and <b>safety</b> compliance. The results suggest a complex relationshipbetween organizational safety culture and safety climate, indicating that organizations with particularsafety cultures {{may be more likely to}} develop more (or less) positive safety climates. Moreover, employeesafety compliance is a function of <b>supervisor</b> <b>safety</b> leadership, as well as the safety climate and safetyculture dimensions prevalent within the organization...|$|R
