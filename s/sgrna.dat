It was not known, however, if these movement proteins are expressed from one or two subgenomic (sg) RNAs. Here we employ RNA ligase-mediated RACE to show that the Beet yellows virus (BYV), a prototype Closterovius, produces separate <b>sgRNAs</b> encoding p 6 and Hsp 70 h. This result is further supported by generation of the recombinant BYV in which the truncated variants of these <b>sgRNAs</b> are resolved by Northern analysis.

Inactivation of the first start codons in these <b>sgRNAs</b> abolished translation of the each product. The polyclonal antibodies raised to synthetic C-terminal peptides of p 6 and Hsp 70 h specifically recognized corresponding translation products, as well as p 6 and Hsp 70 h produced in BYV-infected plants.

25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (cas9) is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene {{of interest in the}} form of <b>sgRNA</b> and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the <b>sgRNA</b> are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the E. coli target DNA based on the <b>sgRNA</b> complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific <b>sgRNA</b> and then the next plasmid containing the specific <b>sgRNA</b> target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E
25|$|The PTET {{promoter}} {{plays an}} integral {{role in the}} expression of both plasmids. It drives transcriptional expression of both the <b>sgRNA</b> of interest and cas9 in the host cell upon induction with anhydrotetracycline (aTc). In {{the absence of the}} inducer, the PTET promoter is repressed by the constitutively expressed tetracycline repressor protein (TetR). Therefore, the presence of TetR in the host cell prior to the introduction of both <b>sgRNA</b> and cas9 is a measure to avoid cell lethality.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} transformation efficiency, transformed cells are grown in super optimal broth to expedite the recovery process after transformation. In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both Cas9 and <b>sgRNA</b> were expressed {{at the same time}} without the linear DNA to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption of the crucial gene. Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and <b>sgRNA</b> were kept under strict control and transformed stepwise to reduce cell lethality.|$|E

Here, we created reporter and conditional mutant mice by coinjection of zygotes with Cas 9 mRNA and different guide RNAs (<b>sgRNAs)</b> as well as DNA vectors of different sizes. Using this one-step procedure we generated mice carrying a tag or a fluorescent reporter construct in the Nanog, the Sox 2, and the Oct 4 gene as well as Mecp 2 conditional mutant mice. In addition, using <b>sgRNAs</b> targeting two separate sites in the Mecp 2 gene, we produced mice harboring the predicted deletions of about 700  bps.

30|$|In this study, we used BE 3 and BE 4 max to edit mouse genome by {{introducing}} stop codon (i-stop) in coding region of specific genes. We tested a multiple <b>sgRNAs</b> strategy {{and the results}} indicated that multiple <b>sgRNAs</b> dramatically increase the efficiencies of BE 3 -mediated and BE 4 max-mediated editing in mouse embryos and successfully generated DKO (double knockout) mice by BE 3 -mediated i-stop targeting Tyr and Pdcd 1.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, {{methods for}} {{harnessing}} this system {{for use in}} editing mutations or insertions of specific E. coli sequences were published. This method includes constructing a plasmid consisting of the cas9 gene and CRISPR loci containing the matching target DNA, called single guide RNA (<b>sgRNA).</b> After expression is induced, Cas9 is {{able to identify the}} target DNA sequence of the cellular genome by finding the <b>sgRNA</b> complement and initiate strand breaks in the E. coli genome. This allows a transfected, linear DNA sequence to be incorporated into the genome, relying on the cellular machinery to use the linear DNA flanked by homologous regions specific to the cleaved location as a template to rebuild using homology directed repair.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different <b>sgRNA</b> can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose <b>sgRNA</b> is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and <b>sgRNA</b> was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{current system}} {{is not able to}} {{simultaneously}} select against more than one target [...] as a result of difficulties in DNA synthesis and ligation independent cloning methods. Essentially this means that the highly repetitive sequences necessary for multiple <b>sgRNA</b> in a single plasmid are constrained by flaws in the biological machinery necessary to express them and target them to more than one target. Future improvements are necessary to allow simultaneous genomic manipulations using several distinct <b>sgRNA</b> in a single plasmid.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{circuits}} require many regulatory {{parts in}} order to implement signal processing or execute algorithms in cells. A potentially scalable approach is to use dCas 9, which employs small guide RNAs (<b>sgRNAs)</b> to repress genetic loci via the programmability of RNA:DNA base pairing. To this end, we use dCas 9 and designed <b>sgRNAs</b> to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform computation in living cells. We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic Escherichia coli σ[subscript 70] promoters that are repressed by corresponding <b>sgRNAs,</b> and these interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These <b>sgRNAs</b> exhibit high on‐target repression (56 ‐ to 440 ‐fold) and negligible off‐target interactions (< 1. 3 ‐fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the Boolean‐complete NOR gate and a 3 ‐gate circuit consisting of four layered <b>sgRNAs.</b> The synthetic circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by designing output <b>sgRNAs</b> to target an E. coli transcription factor (malT). This converts the output of a synthetic circuit to a switch in cellular phenotype (sugar utilization, chemotaxis, phage resistance). United States.

2500|$|Transformed oligonucleotides are {{incorporated}} into the cellular DNA through λ-red- and Cas9 endonuclease-mediated homologous recombination.
