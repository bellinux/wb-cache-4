50|$|W&E {{felt that}} the maximum payload for their {{three-wheeled}} float was 30 cwt, and such a model {{was known as the}} Major. Bigger payloads required a four-wheeled float, and the Freighliner was showcased at the 1966 Royal Dairy Show. It came as a 50 cwt model and twin tyres were fitted on the rear axle. In order to retain the manoeuvrability of the three-wheeled vehicles, the front springs and <b>steering</b> <b>drag</b> link were placed inside the frames, which allowed a kerb-to-kerb turning circle of 30 ft to be achieved. The wheelbase was 7.75 ft, with the cab located in front of the front wheels, to give easy access to the driving position. Three models were available, with top speeds of 14 mph, 17 mph and 20 mph. The working range was from 30 to 40 mi, and a series resistance controller was fitted as standard, although the model at the Dairy Show had a thyristor control unit.|$|E

40|$|The Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) is {{a crucial}} {{component}} in any sample return campaign. In this paper we present a universal model for a two-stage MAV along with the analytic equations and simple parametric relationships necessary to quickly estimate MAV mass and performance. Ascent trajectories can be modeled as two-burn transfers from the surface with appropriate loss estimations for finite burns, <b>steering,</b> and <b>drag.</b> Minimizing lift-off mass is achieved by balancing optimized staging and an optimized path-to-orbit. This model allows designers to quickly find optimized solutions {{and to see the}} effects of design choices...|$|R
50|$|There are two wheels, {{the larger}} driving wheel for {{travelling}} in a forward direction, and a trailing {{steering wheel and}} 90 degrees to this one. Both the drive wheel and the steering wheel however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' wheels that allow the wheel to be moved laterally. When moving forward the main wheel will be powered and the smaller planet wheels {{on the steering wheel}} will rotate to avoid the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>dragging.</b> To turn the steering wheel is rotated. To balance from side to side, or to self-balance laterally, the planet wheels on the drive wheel will be powered appropriately.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{tracks are}} adapted from {{existing}} mountain roads and paths. Artificially banked curves are not permitted. The track's surface should be horizontal. They are naturally iced. Tracks can get rough from the braking and steering action. Athletes use a <b>steering</b> rein and <b>drag</b> {{their hands and}} use their legs in order to drive around the tight flat corners. Braking is often required in front of curves and is accomplished {{by the use of}} spikes built {{on the bottom of the}} shoes.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the inter-rater {{reliability}} of an observational instrument, the Mouse-Personal Computer Style instrument (M-PeCS), which assesses the stereotypical postures and movements of the upper body and upper extremity associated with computer mouse use. Two trained raters independently rated the video clips of 10 computer users completing three mouse tasks (pointing, <b>steering,</b> and <b>dragging)</b> for a total of 30 video clips to determine the inter-rater reliability. All but two items on the M-PeCS had good to excellent reliability (ICC= 0. 75 to 1. 00). These results suggest that most items on the M-PeCS can be used to reliably document computer mouse use style between trained raters. Potential applications of this study include identifying and quantifying the exposure to postural risk factors that may contribute to hand and forearm musculoskeletal pain associated with intensive computer mouse use...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of steering wheel torque {{in a truck}} is a challenging subject due to the many components connecting the driver to the front wheels. In order to accurately predict the steering wheel torque a highly detailed model is required. Steering systems in commercial vehicle handling simulation models found in literature are often modeled in a simple way while literature on passenger vehicles suggests {{the necessity of a}} higher model complexity. In this research a highly detailed model with four states, friction, stiffness, hydraulic assistance and the necessary kinematic relations is developed. This model could assist {{in the development of the}} steering system in the early stages of the design. The model is able to accurately predict the <b>steering</b> wheel torque, <b>drag</b> link force and king pin angles. The parameters for this model are estimated by means of dedicated tests and the steering system model is validated outside of the vehicle...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{examples}} of what data, at the time not yet called “big” data, can do when properly collected and analyzed is from the area of sports and refers to the Oakland Athletics baseball team and their coach Billy Beane, {{who was able to}} use statistics and player data to revamp the team from an unsuccessful one into a pretty successful one within a limited time span. The story is well documented in [12] and a movie based on that book. The already mentioned Doug Laney gives a more recent example from sports, namely from the Indy 500 race happening in the USA every year on Memorial Day weekend. According to Laney, a present-day Indy 500 race car is on the inside “smattered with nearly 200 sensors constantly measuring the performance of the engine, clutch, gearbox, differential, fuel system, oil, <b>steering,</b> tires, <b>drag</b> reduction system, and dozens of other components, as well as the drivers’ health. These sensors spew about 1  GB of telemetry per race to engineers poring over them during the race and data scientists crunching them between races. According to McLaren, “its computers run a thousand simulations during the race. After just a couple laps they can predict the performance of each subsystem with up to 90  % accuracy. And since most of these subsystems can be tuned during the race, engineers, pit crews and drivers can proactively make minute adjustments throughout the race as the car and conditions change”. Further details can be found on Laney’s blog, 4 and {{it is obvious that the}} situation for Formula 1 cars 5 or the NASCAR series is similar.|$|R
40|$|Cascading menus {{are used}} in almost all {{graphical}} user interfaces. Most current cascade widgets implement an explicit delay between the cursor entering/leaving a parent cascade menu item and posting/unposting the associated menu. The delay allows users to make small <b>steering</b> errors while <b>dragging</b> across items, and it allows optimal diagonal paths from parent to cascade items. However, the delay slows the pace of interaction for users who wait for the delay to expire, and it demands jerky discrete movements for experts who wish to pre-empt the delay by clicking. This paper describes Enlarged activation area MenUs (EMUs), which have two features: first, they increase {{the area of the}} parent menu associated with each cascade; second, they eliminate the posting and unposting delay. An evaluation shows that EMUs allow cascade items to be selected up to 29 % faster than traditional menus, without harming top-level item selection times. They also have a positive smoothing effect on menu selections, allowing continuous sweeping selections in contrast to discrete movements that are punctuated with clicks.
