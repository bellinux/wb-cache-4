40|$|This paper {{depicts the}} Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS) {{system as a}} global central office switch. The ground portion {{of the system is}} the {{collection}} of earth stations or T 1 -VSAT's (T 1 very small aperture terminals). The control software for the T 1 -VSAT's resides in a single CPU. The software consists of two modules, the modem manager and the call manager. The modem manager (MM) controls the RF modem portion of the T 1 -VSAT. It processes the orderwires from the satellite or from signaling generated by the call manager (CM). The CM controls the Recom Laboratories MSPs by receiving signaling messages from the stacked MSP shelves ro units and sending appropriate setup commands to them. There are two methods used to setup and process calls in the CM; first by dialing up a circuit using a standard telephone handset or, secondly by using an external processor connected to the CPU's second COM port, by sending and receiving signaling orderwires. It is the use of the external processor which permits the ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) <b>Signaling</b> <b>Processor</b> to implement ISDN calls. In August 1993, the initial testing of the ISDN <b>Signaling</b> <b>Processor</b> was carried out at ACTS System Test at Lockheed Marietta, Princeton, NJ using the spacecraft in its test configuration on the ground...|$|E
