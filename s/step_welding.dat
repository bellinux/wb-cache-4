40|$|Aircraft engine {{components}} are often an assembly of several parts that are manufactured using various processes: deep drawing, machining, among others. Sheet metal forming requires expensive tooling and is performed in numerous steps, increasing lead-time. Furthermore, with the ever increasing costs of raw material, machining parts out of forged or cast rings is becoming less cost effective as up to 90 % {{of the material}} can be wasted. For these reasons, the use of near net shape manufacturing methods is becoming inevitable.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for {{automatic}} recognition and separation between defected radiographic images of welds and correct ones is introduced. The method applies local image information together with adaptive feature extraction parameters and neural network classifier. In practical weld inspection of gas pipelines, {{more than sixty}} percent of radiographic images are not faulty, but need to be separated in visual check by a certified expert. This is a time consuming process for interpreter and reduces the eye sensitivity and reliability of inspection especially for defected parts of radiographic image. The introduced pattern classifier is designed to solve this problem. In first step, preprocessing is done through image enhancement and noise reduction techniques proper for poor quality and low contrast radiographic images. Preprocessing step is applied through median filtering and adaptive histogram equalization, together with preserving grayscale image information. In next <b>step</b> <b>weld</b> is extracted from background image and adaptive thresholding is applied using local binarization operators with maintaining critical image information.

It is made based on the manufacturers desire to improve and make the clamp easier to manufacture and to reduce its price to their customers. This should be done either by manufacturing the clamp in one piece without an expensive and work intensive welding process, or by generating ideas of how to develop a brand new type of clamp.

40|$|International audienceA new hybrid welding {{technique}} {{has recently been}} developed in order to answer to the industry needs to gather high thickness steel sheets. The combination of a laser beam and a gas metal arc enables to develop welds with a high added metal rate and low porosity. Moreover lower deformation and residual stresses are observed after cooling. Nevertheless the mastery of this technique is still in development due to the various physical phenomena which occur and interact during the welding process. A three dimensional finite element model has been developed to simulate this welding process. Metal and air gas domains are both meshed. A Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is used in which the interface between the metal and the surrounding air or plasma is defined by a level set function. Fluid flow phenomena and temperature evolution in the weld pool are simulated. Two moving heat sources are considered at {{the surface of the}} metal. As the arc plasma and laser beam are not modeled in the level set framework, the 'Continuum Surface Force' approach is used: a volumetric heat source distribution is applied to the immediate neighbourhood of the interface. The added metal represents an additional heat source. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the weld pool regarding the surface Marangoni force, the volumetric buoyancy. After solving the momentum conservation equation, metal / air interface is tracked through the resolution of a convection equation with the calculated velocity field as input. As the hybrid {{welding technique}} is usually a multi-pass process applied on high thickness piece with high chamfer, it is of primary importance to develop a correct modeling of solid / solid contact interfaces. It is shown that the present level set approach coupled with an adaptative remeshing tool enables to follow these interfaces to simulate the entire process <b>steps.</b> <b>Weld</b> geometry on a specific steel alloy is shown and compared to the expected result...|$|R

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} has {{developed}} theoretical models to predict the microstructural behaviour of weld materials. Three different types of boiler shell weld materials from nuclear power plants have been investigated. The materials considered differ mainly in the manganese concentration and their microstructure after different temperature exposures during industrial use. Element segregation can be predicted according to the typical reactor conditions and therefore the influence of longer life times can be evaluated. Sufficient experimental data have been taken by application of advanced transmission electron microscopes which offer images of high quality. The application of a thermodynamic software package MTDATA to predict the free concentration of each element for model prediction has been. Phosphorus, of great interest because it causes embrittlement, is enhanced at the grain boundary and increases with operating temperature and life time. Its interaction with carbon and manganese is of interest. Site-competition between carbon, phosphorus and manganese has to be applied. These site-competition model prediction results fit best to the experimental data. The final grain boundary segregation consists of various segregation types during the thermal history and {{is the sum of}} each single <b>step.</b> <b>Weld</b> materials have a very complex microstructure, resulting in coarse and fine grains. For each grain boundary type in coarse grain (prior-austenite and ferrite grain boundaries) and fine grain (ferrite grain boundaries), the final segregation level has been predicted and a good agreement to practical results has been shown. Phosphorus segregation is found to be mainly influenced by equilibrium segregation at 600 deg C during holding for 2. 5 hours and segregates independent of the grain size in a narrow highly-enriched equilibrium type form. On the other hand manganese is mainly influenced by non-equilibrium segregation during the quenching process after welding, and depends strongly on welding temperature. It shows a typical wide non-equilibrium segregation profile at all boundary types. The grain boundary concentration of manganese is dependent on the grain size. Hardness investigations have been done on each material and microstructure. A hardness dependence on the quantity of carbides, grain boundaries, precipitates and microstructure has been found.

FNSS Defense Systems initiated a project in order to further vehicle fatigue strength evaluation capabilities on the way to design more reliable and lighter vehicles. The project is called “Design and manufacturing methods improving fatigue strength of welded joints”, which is financially supported by TUBITAK. In this paper, the work accomplished and the results obtained in the framework of the project are presented. In this scope, fatigue test samples are manufactured from 5 XXX series aluminium armour plate with the selected welded joints configurations. Post-weld fatigue improvement methods; TIG dressing, hammer peening and shot peening, are applied to test samples. Residual stress measurements on selected configurations are accomplished per X-Ray Diffraction technique to evaluate the effect of post-weld treatments on residual stresses, which is a major factor affecting fatigue life. Welding process is simulated with finite element method to be able to compute welding induced residual stresses. As input to simulations, temperature dependent thermo-mechanical and mechanical properties of utilized aluminium are determined on a forming dilatometer.

The range of ideas aiming to conform island medical Faculties to the progress of science, gave life to the critique of a teaching model, still ruled by the Galenic authority and by metaphysical etiological explanations, which ignored the physiological and pathological reality revealed by the anatomical study methodically on performed corpses. The new programme of studies admitted the teaching of surgery, which had completely disappeared in the university ruled by Jesuites, and increased the value of anatomy teaching, that will be chosen as a subject for the speech made during the solemn opening of the medical Faculty of Sassari in 1765. The need for an empirical testing which had to follow theorical studies in wards, where teachers had to give lessons at patients' bedside, was considered of such importance that it was codified in the Regulations of the reformed University. It was the very first <b>step</b> towards the <b>welding</b> between medical-surgical studies and nosocomial practice which was about to revolutionize the teaching framework of medical studies...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{structural}} efficiency while reducing manufacturing costs are key objectives when making future heavy-lift launchers more performing and cost efficient. The main enabling technologies are {{the application of}} advanced high performance materials as well as cost effective manufacture processes. This paper presents the status and main results of a joint industrial research & development effort to demonstrate TRL 6 of a novel manufacturing process for large liquid propellant tanks for launcher applications. Using high strength aluminium-lithium alloy combined with the spin forming manufacturing technique, this development aims at thinner wall thickness and weight savings up to 25 % {{as well as a}} significant reduction in manufacturing effort. In this program, the concave spin forming process is used to manufacture tank domes from a single flat plate. Applied to aluminium alloy, this process allows reaching the highest possible material strength status T 8, eliminating numerous <b>welding</b> <b>steps</b> which are typically necessary to assemble tank domes from 3 D-curved panels. To minimize raw material costs for large diameter tank domes for launchers, the dome blank has been composed from standard plates welded together prior to spin forming by friction stir welding. After welding, the dome blank is contoured {{in order to meet the}} required wall thickness distribution. For achieving a material state of T 8, also in the welding seams, the applied spin forming process allows the required cold stretching of the 3 D-curved dome, with a subsequent ageing in a furnace. This combined manufacturing process has been demonstrated up to TRL 6 for tank domes with a 5. 4 m diameter. In this paper, the manufacturing process as well as test results are presented. Plans are shown how this process could be applied to future heavy-lift launch vehicles developments, also for larger dome diameters...|$|R
