5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{planned to}} upgrade the route to main line {{standards}} and extend the line to Oxford, creating the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite {{the backing of the}} wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1955, before Memorial Parkway was constructed, Governors Drive was two {{separate}} streets.

Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built {{it would have been the}} <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between Oxford and the City of London.|$|E
5|$|Several {{possible}} routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A bridleway winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.|$|E

5|$|State Route 139 (SR 139) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. Running from SR 36 in Susanville north to Oregon Route 39, it forms part of the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between Reno, Nevada, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. SR 139 cuts through much Modoc National Forest and passes near Antelope Mountain and Tule Lake. North of SR 299, the highway was built by the federal {{government}} and turned over to the state in about 1940; the remainder was built by a joint highway district of Lassen and Modoc Counties, completed in 1956, and given to the state in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The second route {{would have}} {{originated}} in Fort Hamilton {{at the south}} end of the line. Similar to the 1890 proposal, it would have followed the routing of the current Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (constructed from 1959 to its opening in 1964). The Fort Hamilton proposal was the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> of the two, though it would require tunneling through deeper waters. As part of the proposal, it was suggested that the Fourth Avenue Line be extended past its original terminal at 86th Street in Bay Ridge to a temporary ferry terminal at 95th Street (now the 95th Street Station).|$|E
5|$|There {{is a major}} bus {{terminus}} on the Kowloon side, {{which is}} conveniently situated close to the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier. Thousands of residents passed through this principal gateway to Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon Peninsula daily from 1957 until 2006. However, the inauguration of the Cross Harbour Tunnel in 1972 popularised vehicular travel across the harbour and reduced the flow of passengers. From 1972 to 2006, the ferry was still used {{by many as the}} <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> from Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) to Central District, and a daily average of 74,000 passenger trips were made across the harbour in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the <b>shortest</b> <b>route.</b> However, Amangkurat II {{proposed}} that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|Although Snake Pass {{is still}} the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between Manchester and Sheffield, the more northerly Woodhead Pass, which is less steep and at a lower altitude, is now the primary road link between the two cities. Unlike Snake Pass, the Woodhead route is a trunk road. Traffic levels on both passes {{remained}} similar until the 1980s, but the Woodhead Pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to the M1, while Snake Pass leads into the centre of Sheffield. Despite Sheffield and Manchester being among the largest UK cities by population, {{there is no direct}} motorway link between the two. A Manchester to Sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966, and a small section bypassing Denton and Hyde has been built, now the M67. The Woodhead Tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement, but linking the cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across the Peak District. Consequently, the plans were shelved, but reports in December 2014 announced a revival of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating a through route from Aylesbury to Oxford. If built, the line {{would have been the}} <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by the costly tunnelling proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed, in which the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid tunnelling. In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one of their two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E

5|$|Other {{options were}} explored, {{including}} the Kalmyk Project, a Soviet plan {{to launch a}} surprise attack on the north-west frontier of India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states such as Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Thailand, and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyk people. The intention was to use these places as a staging ground for revolution in India, as they offered the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> to the revolutionary heartland of Bengal. Historians suggest that the plan may have been prompted by Mahendra Pratap's efforts and advice to the Soviet leadership in 1919 when—along with other Indian revolutionaries—he pressed for a joint Soviet-Afghan campaign into India. Under {{the cover of a}} scientific expedition to Tibet headed by Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, the plan was to arm the indigenous people in the North-East Indian region with modern weaponry. The project had the approval of Lenin.|$|E
5|$|The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built {{it would have been the}} <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between Oxford and the City of London. The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1December 1899, and from then on the MR (the Metropolitan line of the London Underground from July 1933) operated all services on the line. Throughout the operation of the Brill Tramway the track and stations remained in the ownership of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company; the MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.|$|E
5|$|The MR grew steadily, {{extending}} its {{own services}} and acquiring other local railways {{north and west}} of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated {{to take control of}} the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and although still roundabout, the scheme would have formed the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant main-line termini in around 1840. Construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed its Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he had a vision of unifying a string of railways to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France.
