40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies on the rain regimen of the <b>South</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Region and, consequently, in the local hydrographic basins. An analytical function based on a combination of two Gaussian distribution in space and one distribution in time was applied to the climatology of SST of the Community Atmosphere Model version 2. 02 (CAM 2. 02) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in order to simulate an SAO SST anomaly. The Gaussian analytical function was adjusted to the February and March of 2005 observed anomaly in the SAO, on the region near 58 W and 40 S where those anomalies reached 20 C. In this period a rain anomaly in the <b>South</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Region took place, with pluviometric deficits of about 100 mm in the Uruguai (SC) and Iguaçu (PR) rivers basins. In the subsequent months the SAO SST anomaly intensity was diminished but it was increased up in area reaching 20 S in September, persisting until October. In these last two months the rain levels in the south region of Brazil basins exceeded the historical values in more than 100 mm. Data mining techniques applied to some computed indexes obtained from the model results revealed some <b>South</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Region circulation anomalies patterns in response to the SAO/SST anomaly forcing. The vertical structure of the model atmosphere was strongly affected by the forcing, the humidity and latent heat flux was augmented and the planetary bondary layer height was shortened in the anomaly forced region. These preliminary results emphasize the importance of the prognostics of SST in seasonal climatic forecast, demonstrating the need of a coupled ocean-atmophere modeling system for this kind of forecast.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigated}} self-reported {{attitudes of}} 148 <b>South</b> <b>Brazilian</b> sheep farmers to animal welfare and sentience. Many farmers (73. 0 %) knew animal welfare superficially. Farmers {{that worked for}} longer in the sheep industry and that raised sheep for commercial purposes mentioned more commonly that they had knowledge about animal welfare (P< 0. 05). Terms related to freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition were the most used to define animal welfare, cited 24. 9 % of the times. The majority claimed that their animals experience good levels of welfare (93. 2 %), especially farmers that kept bigger flocks (P< 0. 05). However, many respondents believed that sheep welfare could be improved on their farms (71. 6 %), mainly farmers with less experience in the sheep industry (P< 0. 01). High scores of sentience were attributed to sheep by farmers with frequent contact with their animals (P< 0. 05). According to the farmers, castration causes {{the highest levels of}} suffering to sheep (32. 4 %) and shearing, the lowest (50. 0 %). <b>South</b> <b>Brazilian</b> farmer knowledge about animal welfare, attitudes to sentience and recognition of suffering need improvement...|$|R

Nests were constructed of twigs, branches, and lianas sometimes interlaced with leaves. Nest volume was 30 - 50 cm³ and average nest height was approximately 9. 5 m. Nests were found in open "cerrado" vegetation, along forest edges, or in interior "cordilheiras" forest. The reasons why coatis build such nests are unclear, but may relate to inter or intraspecific competition for nesting sites, litter size, thermoregulation, and predation avoidance...|$|R
