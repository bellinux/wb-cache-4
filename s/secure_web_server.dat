50|$|As {{an example}} of a double tagging attack, {{consider}} a <b>secure</b> <b>web</b> <b>server</b> on a VLAN called VLAN2. Hosts on VLAN2 are allowed access to the web server; hosts from outside VLAN2 are blocked by layer 3 filters. An attacking host on a separate VLAN, called VLAN1(Native), creates a specially formed packet to attack the web server. It places a header tagging the packet as belonging to VLAN2 under the header tagging the packet as belonging to VLAN1. When the packet is sent, the switch sees the default VLAN1 header and removes it and forwards the packet. The next switch sees the VLAN2 header and puts the packet in VLAN2. The packet thus arrives at the target server as though it was sent from another host on VLAN2, ignoring any layer 3 filtering that might be in place.|$|E

40|$|TLS is the {{protocol}} {{of choice for}} securing today’s e-commerce and online transactions but adding TLS to a <b>Web</b> <b>server</b> imposes a significant overhead relative to an insecure <b>Web</b> <b>server</b> on the same platform. We perform a comprehensive study of the performance costs of TLS. Our methodology is to profile TLS <b>Web</b> <b>servers</b> with trace-driven workloads, replace individual components inside TLS with no-ops, and measure the observed increase in server throughput. We estimate the relative costs of each TLS processing stage, identifying the areas for which future optimizations would be worthwhile. Our results show that while the RSA operations represent the largest performance cost in TLS <b>Web</b> <b>servers,</b> they do not solely account for TLS overhead. RSA accelerators are effective for e-commerce site workloads since they experience low TLS session reuse. Accelerators appear to be less effective for sites where all the requests are handled by a TLS server {{because they have a}} higher session reuse rate. In this case, investing in a faster CPU might provide a greater boost in performance. Our experiments show that having a second CPU is at least as useful as an RSA accelerator. Our results seem to suggest that, as CPUs become faster, the cryptographic costs of TLS will become dwarfed by the CPU costs of the nonsecurity aspects of a <b>Web</b> <b>server.</b> Optimizations aimed at general purpose <b>Web</b> <b>servers</b> should continue to be a focus of research and would benefit <b>secure</b> <b>Web</b> <b>servers</b> as well...|$|R
