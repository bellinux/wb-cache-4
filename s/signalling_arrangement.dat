50|$|A passing loop (UK usage) or {{passing siding}} (North America) (also called a {{crossing}} loop, crossing place or, colloquially, a hole) {{is a place}} on a single line railway or tramway, often located at a station, where trains or trams travelling in opposite directions can pass each other. Trains/trams going {{in the same direction}} can also overtake, providing that the <b>signalling</b> <b>arrangement</b> allows it. A passing loop is double-ended and connected to the main track at both ends, though a dead end siding known as a refuge siding, which is much less convenient, can be used. A similar arrangement is used on the gauntlet track of cable railways and funiculars, and in passing places on single-track roads.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{modification}} to the <b>signalling</b> <b>arrangement</b> came in 1976, {{when the}} multi-panel London Bridge signal box became operational. [...] This allowed the reversible {{operation of the}} Down Chislehurst Loop. [...] The 1959-"power box" [...] remained the primary control point for these lines in this area until 12 June 1983. [...] This date saw the expansion of Victoria Signalling Centre's scope of control {{as far as the}} boundary of Rochester signal box. [...] Chislehurst Junction signal box retained control over the South Eastern Main Line until 1993, when it was taken over as part of the gradual implementation of Ashford Signalling Centre. [...] Meanwhile, in 1992/1993, the [...] "Up" [...] and [...] "Down" [...] Bickley Loops were doubled to accommodate Eurostar operations, which began in earnest on 14 November 1994. The new Down Slow Bickley Loop shares the same alignment as the Up Chislehurst where they pass under the South Eastern Main Line. This created a new junction named Hawkwood Junction.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{the aim was}} to probe the {{distribution}} and functions of galanin type 2 receptor (GalR 2) in the rodent brain. In order to overcome the lack of a reliable antibody to localize GalR 2 by immunohistochemistry, we generated a construct which expresses GalR 2 tagged with enhanced GFP (EGFP). We first studied the trafficking and function of this fusion protein in cell lines, including PC 12 cells [...] The results showed that GalR 2 -EGFP is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane with some intracellular fluorescent structures (vesicles), mainly in the perinuclear region. After activation by galanin, the GalR 2 -EGFP is able to induce a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca 2 + level, suggesting that the conjugate is functional. The results also indicate that GalR 2 undergoes constitutive endocytosis and recycling, using the clathrin-dependent endocytic recycling pathway. Then we examined the localization of the GalR 2 -EGFP in a transgenic mouse brain expressing the same GalR 2 -EGFP construct under the GalR 2 promoter, using a GFP antibody. The immunostaining was mainly found in cell bodies and to a limited extent also in presumable nerve terminals. GalR 2 -EGFP positive processes and cell bodies were located in many brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, certain limbic cortical areas, the basal forebrain, amygdala, subregions of the hippocampal formation, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, locus coeruleus, and some further areas in the midbrain and medulla oblongata. Using double-staining we analyzed some cell groups giving rise to major ascending systems, and could demonstrate presence of the GalR 2 -EGFP construct in noradrenergic/galaninergic locus coeruleus neurons. The GalR 2 -EGFP was also detected in calcium-binding protein- and GAD-positive cell bodies in the basal forebrain, but not in cholinergic neurons in this area, or in the 5 -hydroxytryptamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Our results support the concept that GalR 2 primarily is a presynaptic autoreceptor in noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons. Galanin is presumably involved {{in a wide range of}} brain functions, which are partly executed through GalR 2. Plasticity is an important characteristic of galanin signaling. The expression levels of galanin and its receptors are highly dynamic in various circumstances. In vitro electrophysiological study was done with hippocampal slices obtained from mice overexpressing galanin under the promoter for the platelet-derived growth factor-B (GalOE mice). Slices from young adult wild-type (WT) animals showed significant paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the 2 nd excitatory postsynaptic field potential (fEPSP) evoked with paired-pulse stimuli, while PPF was less strongly expressed in slices from young adult GalOE mice, as well as aged WT mice, but were not observed at all in slices from aged GalOE animals. The results indicate that galanin is involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in particular in age-related reduction of synaptic plasticity in the lateral perforant path input to the dentate gyrus. Hypertrophic galanin-containing fibers engulf cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in Alzheimer’s disease, a phenomenon that has been interpreted as a region-specific innate neuroprotection. We have developed an en masse cell isolation strategy based on the p 75 NTR to establish 90 - 95 % homogenous cholinergic neuron cultures from dissociated embryonic basal forebrains. We exploited this in vitro system to dissect the cellular mechanisms of how galanin impacts cholinergic neurons. Cultured cholinergic neurons express GalR 2 that is located in the soma and distributed to the axonal growth cone. Stimulation of cultured cholinergic neurons with galanin or GalR 2 agonist ARM 1896 induces ERK phosphorylation. Stimulation of GalR 2 by galanin and its synthetic analogue resulted in increased neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GalR 2 stimulation can protect cholinergic neurons against β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity in vitro. Therefore, we speculate that the hypertrophy of galaninergic nerve endings in the basal forebrain of Alzheimer’s patients may represent a <b>signalling</b> <b>arrangement</b> poised to activate specific GalR 2 -dependent intracellular signaling cascades to induce neuroprotection in situ as proposed previously. In summary, the study with PC 12 cell line elucidated the subcellular distribution and trafficking pattern of GalR 2; this gave us some idea how the GalR 2 receptor exerts its function at the cellular level. The immunohistochemical study with GalR 2 -EGFP transgenic animal provided the information about the distribution pattern of GalR 2 in the brain, including its relation to some ascending systems. The study about the effect of galanin signaling in the aged mice and GalOE mice showed plasticity of the galanin signaling system and the effect of overexpressed galanin on neurotransmission at the presynaptic site. With the newly developed target-specific-isolated cholinergic basal forebrain neuron culture, we provide further evidence for a trophic effect of GalR 2 activity and the plasticity of GalR 2 related to Aβtoxicity. These studies may provide a basis for further discussion about the function of galanin signaling and potential therapeutic applications...|$|E

50|$|Yolland was not {{satisfied}} with the <b>signalling</b> <b>arrangements</b> at Llantrisant junction, which did not bring all the points and signals to a central interlocking.

Accordingly Yolland declined to pass the line for passenger operation. Moreover the L&TVJR had not provided signalling at Maesaraul Junction, intending to leave it until after the inspection. Inevitably therefore the inspection there failed and the opening of both the Cowbridge Railway and the L&TVJR section was refused also.|$|R

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{signs of the}} railway not {{developing}} as expected were the series of changes made to the <b>signalling</b> <b>arrangements</b> in 1921. Privett signal box was effectively closed and the line was changed from being worked as a single-track main line to operating as a single-track branch line, with longer signal blocks and fewer passing loops (the 'down' platform at Privett was closed, the second line through the station now being only used for shunting). At the southern end the rail connections at Knowle Junction were relaid. This allowed trains from Fareham heading to Eastleigh to use both the original and the deviation lines but {{the layout of the}} junctions meant that MVR trains could still only use the original single-track route.

Whereas P 2 is known to promote tetracycline resistance and to be inactivated by HindIII cleavage, P 1 is able to transcribe DNA integrated at that site and probably contributes to the expression of the beta-lactamase gene in pBR 322. In pACYC 184, besides P 1, P 2, and the cat (chloramphenicol resistance) promoter (P 5), two initiation sites (P 3 and P 4) were mapped in a region that appears to be part of insertion sequence 1.
