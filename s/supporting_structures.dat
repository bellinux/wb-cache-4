The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polgár cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, {{was discovered in}} Ślęza, Wrocław County. It consisted of a central long trapezoidal house accompanied by several post-built <b>supporting</b> <b>structures.</b> Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel culture from the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brześć Kujawski, and another one in Osłonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Osłonki settlement nearly 30 trapezoidal houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities of the communities centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area. 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polgár culture were located in Podłęże, Wieliczka County.|$|E

Eight fortified secondary artillery positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts' artillery. In addition, 40 bunkers for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the Second World War anti-tank gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometres of dragon's teeth were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing {{to the end of the}} Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the Soviet Union, Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to be decommissioned. The last fort of the complex was decommissioned on 31 December 1998, and is now used as a tourist attraction. All five forts as well as some of the <b>supporting</b> <b>structures</b> have been declared historic buildings, to be preserved for the future, by the Swedish government.|$|E

Nevertheless, the raids continued, at great cost to both sides. The impact of the German offensive on RAF airfields and Fighter Command is disputed.

5|$|Until the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to begin {{operations}} over the mainland, {{the first phase of}} the German air offensive targeted British shipping in the Channel. The raids rarely involved attacks against RAF airfields inland, but encouraged RAF units to engage in battle by attacking British Channel convoys.

Mine laying from aircraft had proved more profitable, sinking 38,000 tons. The impact on Fighter Command was minimal. It had lost 74 fighter pilots killed or missing and 48 wounded in July, but British strength rose to 1,429 by 3 August, leaving it only short of 124 pilots. Still, the attacks succeeded in forcing the British to abandon the Channel convoy route and to redirect shipping to ports in north-eastern Britain.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The lack {{of jobs in}} South Africa and eMalahleni {{has caused}} many young people to seek their own job {{opportunities}} {{in the form of}} setting up their own business. Despite this, many young business people fail in their ventures due to low capital. In response to this, organisations such as the National Youth Development Agency have created <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> to <b>support</b> young business owners in their local area. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the extent to which the structures and programmes to support youth development – as far as entrepreneurship is concerned – help to cultivate the creation of businesses among the black youth in eMalahleni. Thirty participants who are young entrepreneurs (under 35 years) participated in interviews that helped to elucidate qualitative information about the <b>support</b> <b>structures.</b> They were asked how the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> had helped them if they participated, or the reasons why they chose not to use the <b>support</b> <b>structure.</b> They were also asked to identify potential bottlenecks or issues with the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> that may be preventing them from being fully accessible. The results showed that a lack of trust in the <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> particularly those created by the National Youth Development Agency, was a major reason for non-participation or choice not to use. Additionally, many felt that the hierarchy and unwelcoming atmosphere of the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> prevented young people from applying. Other reasons given were the fact that the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> may not always be geographically accessible and the fact that staff members were not fully trained to be as helpful as possible. There are several ways in which these <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> could be improved that are detailed in this research document. The most important recommendation relates to ensuring that the red tape is removed to make the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> more helpful to a larger number of young black entrepreneurs.

40|$|By {{accounting}} for almost 25 % {{of the capital}} cost of an OWT (offshore wind turbine), optimisation of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> provides {{an efficient way to}} reduce the currently high cost of offshore wind energy. In this paper, a structural optimisation model for OWT <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> has been developed based on a coupled parametric FEA (Finite Element Analysis) and GA (Genetic Algorithm), minimising the mass of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> under multi-criteria constraints. Contrary to existing optimisation models for OWT <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> the proposed model is an integrated structural optimisation model, which optimises the components of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> (i. e. tower, transition piece, grout and monopile) simultaneously. The outer diameters and section thicknesses along the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> are chosen as design variables. A set of constraints based on multi-criteria design assessment is applied according to standard requirements, which includes vibration, stress, deformation, buckling, fatigue and design variable constraints. The model has been applied to the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) 5 MW OWT on an 00 (Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration) monopile. The results of the application of the integrated optimisation methodology show a 19. 8 % reduction in the global mass of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> while satisfying all the design constraints. It is demonstrated that the proposed structural optimisation model is capable of effectively and accurately determining the optimal design of OWT <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> which significantly improves their design efficiency.
