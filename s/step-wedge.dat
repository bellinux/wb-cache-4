40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} filmless quality assurance (QA) tools for helical tomotherapy by using the signals from the on-board megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) detector and applying a dedicated <b>step-wedge</b> phantom. The <b>step-wedge</b> phantom is a 15 cm long step-like aluminum block positioned on the couch. The phantom was moved through the slit beam and MVCT detector signals were analyzed. Two QA procedures were developed, with gantry fixed at 0 degrees: 1) <b>step-wedge</b> procedure: to check beam energy consistency, field width, laser alignment with respect to the virtual isocenter, couch movement, and couch velocity; and 2) completion procedure: to check the accuracy of a field abutment made by the tomotherapy system after a treatment interruption. The procedures were designed as constancy tool and were validated by measurement of deliberately induced variations and comparison with a reference method. Two Hi-Art II machines were monitored over a period of three years using the <b>step-wedge</b> procedures. The data acquisition takes 5 minutes. The analysis is fully automated and results are available directly after acquisition. Couch speed deviations up to 2 % were induced. The mean absolute difference between expected and measured couch speed was 0. 2 % +/- 0. 2 % (1 standard deviation SD). Field width was varied around the 10 mm nominal size, between 9. 7 and 11. 1 mm, in steps of 0. 2 mm. Mean difference between the <b>step-wedge</b> analysis and the reference method was < 0. 01 mm +/- 0. 03 mm (1 SD). Laser (mis) alignment relative to a reference situation was detected with 0. 3 mm precision (1 SD). The <b>step-wedge</b> profile was fitted to a PDD in water. The PDD ratio D 20 /D 10, measured at depths of 20 cm and 10 cm, was used to check beam energy consistency. Beam energy variations were induced. Mean difference between <b>step-wedge</b> and water PDD ratios was 0. 2 % +/- 0. 3 % (1 SD). The completion procedure was able to reveal abutment mismatches with a mean error of - 0. 6 mm +/- 0. 2 mm (1 SD). The trending data over a period of three years showed a mean deviation of 0. 4 % +/- 0. 1 % (1 SD) in couch speed. The spread in field width was 0. 15 mm (1 SD). The sagittal and transverse lasers showed a variation of 0. 5 mm (1 SD). Beam energy varied 1. 0 % (1 SD). A mean abutment mismatch was found of - 0. 4 mm +/- 0. 2 mm (1 SD) between interrupted treatments.

Treatment outcomes in the intervention (n= 2232) and baseline (n= 1856) arms were compared using a multilevel regression model. Unfavourable outcomes were frequent in both arms, mainly due to loss to follow-up (16 %). Overall unfavourable outcomes were not reduced in the intervention arm (29. 6 % versus 31. 7 %, OR= 0. 93; 95 %CI= 0. 79 - 1. 08). However, the overall TB-attributed death rate was lower in the intervention arm (2. 3 % vs. 3. 8 %). Adjusted for HIV status, age group and city, the intervention resulted in a 35 % decrease in TB-attributed deaths (OR= 0. 65, 95 %CI= 0. 44 - 0. 97). The proportion of patients successfully treated did not increase with Xpert MTB/RIF implementation, with high loss to follow-up rates in both arms. We did observe a 35 % reduction in TB-related mortality, which we hypothesize may be explained by less advanced disease among the smear-negative patients diagnosed by Xpert.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in health system performance and recently WHO launched a report on health systems strengthening emphasising the need for close monitoring using system-wide approaches. One recent method is the balanced scorecard system. There is limited application of this method in middle- and low-income countries. This paper applies the concept of balanced scorecard to describe the baseline status of three intervention districts in Zambia. METHODOLOGY: The Better Health Outcome through Mentoring and Assessment (BHOMA) project is a randomised <b>step-wedged</b> community intervention that aims to strengthen the health system in three districts in the Republic of Zambia. To assess the baseline status of the participating districts we used a modified balanced scorecard approach following the domains highlighted in the MOH 2011 Strategic Plan. RESULTS: Differences in performance were noted by district and residence. Finance and service delivery domains performed poorly in all study districts. The proportion of the health workers receiving training in the past 12 months was lowest in Kafue (58 %) and highest in Luangwa district (77 %). Under service capacity, basic equipment and laboratory capacity scores showed major variation, with Kafue and Luangwa having lower scores when compared to Chongwe. The finance domain showed that Kafue and Chongwe had lower scores (44 % and 47 % respectively). Regression model showed that children's clinical observation scores were negatively correlated with drug availability (coeff - 0. 40, p = 0. 02). Adult clinical observation scores were positively association with adult service satisfaction score (coeff 0. 82, p = 0. 04) and service readiness (coeff 0. 54, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSION: The study applied the balanced scorecard to describe the baseline status of 42 health facilities in three districts of Zambia. Differences in performance were noted by district and residence in most domains with finance and service delivery performing poorly in all study districts.

40|$|A bench-top dual cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) system was developed {{consisting of two}} orthogonally placed 40 x 30 cm 2 flat-panel detectors and two conventional X-ray tubes with two individual high-voltage generators sharing the same rotational axis. The X-ray source to detector distance is 150 cm and X-ray source to rotational axis distance is 100 cm for both subsystems. The objects are scanned through 200 ° of rotation. The dual CBCT (DCBCT) system utilized 110 ° of projection data from one detector and 90 ° from the other while the two individual single CBCTs utilized 200 ° data from each detector. The system performance was characterized in terms of uniformity, contrast, spatial resolution, noise power spectrum and CT number linearity. The uniformity, within the axial slice and along the longitudinal direction, and noise power spectrum were assessed by scanning a water bucket; the contrast and CT number linearity were measured using the Catphan phantom; and the spatial resolution was evaluated using a tungsten wire phantom. A skull phantom and a ham were also scanned to provide qualitative evaluation of high- and low-contrast resolution. Each measurement was compared between dual and single CBCT systems. Compared with single CBCT, the DCBCT presented: 1) a decrease in uniformity by 1. 9 % in axial view and 1. 1 % in the longitudinal view, as averaged for four energies (80, 100, 125 and 150 kVp); 2) comparable or slightly better contrast to noise ratio (CNR) for low-contrast objects and comparable contrast for high-contrast objects; 3) comparable spatial resolution; 4) comparable CT number linearity with R 2 &# 8805; 0. 99 for all four tested energies; 5) lower noise power spectrum in magnitude. DCBCT images of the skull phantom and the ham demonstrated both high-contrast resolution and good soft-tissue contrast. One of the major challenges for clinical implementation of four-dimensional (4 D) CBCT is the long scan time. To investigate the 4 D imaging capabilities of the DCBCT system, motion phantom studies were conducted to validate the efficiency by comparing 4 D images generated from 4 D-DCBCT and 4 D-CBCT. First, a simple sinusoidal profile was used to confirm the scan time reduction. Next, both irregular sinusoidal and patient-derived profiles were used to investigate the advantage of temporally correlated orthogonal projections due to a reduced scan time. Normalized mutual information (NMI) between 4 D-DCBCT and 4 D-CBCT was used for quantitative evaluation. For the simple sinusoidal profile, the average NMI for ten phases between two single 4 D-CBCTs was 0. 336, indicating the maximum NMI {{that can be achieved}} for this study. The average NMIs between 4 D-DCBCT and each single 4 D-CBCT were 0. 331 and 0. 320. For both irregular sinusoidal and patient-derived profiles, 4 D-DCBCT generated phase images with less motion blurring when compared with single 4 D-CBCT. For dual kV energy imaging, we acquired 80 kVp projections and 150 kVp projections, with an additional 0. 8 mm tin filtration. The virtual monochromatic (VM) technique was implemented, by first decomposing these projections into acrylic and aluminum basis material projections to synthesize VM projections, which were then used to reconstruct VM CBCTs. The effect of the VM CBCT on metal artifact reduction was evaluated with an in-house titanium-BB phantom. The optimal VM energy to maximize CNR for iodine contrast and minimize beam hardening in VM CBCT was determined using a water phantom containing two iodine concentrations. The linearly-mixed (LM) technique was implemented by linearly combining the low- (80 kVp) and high-energy (150 kVp) CBCTs. The dose partitioning between low- and high-energy CBCTs was varied (20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % for low-energy) while keeping total dose approximately equal to single-energy CBCTs, measured using an ion chamber. Noise levels and CNRs for four tissue types were investigated for dual-energy LM CBCTs in comparison with single-energy CBCTs at 80, 100, 125 and 150 kVp. The VM technique showed a substantial reduction of metal artifacts at 100 keV with a 40 % reduction in the background standard deviation compared with a 125 kVp single-energy scan of equal dose. The VM energy to maximize CNR for both iodine concentrations and minimize beam hardening in the metal-free object was 50 keV and 60 keV, respectively. The difference in average noise levels measured in the phantom background was 1. 2 % for dual-energy LM CBCTs and equivalent-dose single-energy CBCTs. CNR values in the LM CBCTs of any dose partitioning were better than those of 150 kVp single-energy CBCTs. The average CNRs for four tissue types with 80 % dose fraction at low-energy showed 9. 0 % and 4. 1 % improvement relative to 100 kVp and 125 kVp single-energy CBCTs, respectively. CNRs for low contrast objects improved as dose partitioning was more heavily weighted towards low-energy (80 kVp) for LM CBCTs. For application of the dual-energy technique in the kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) range, we acquired both MV projections (from gantry angle of 0 ° to 100 °) and kV projections (90 ° to 200 °) with the current orthogonal kV/MV imaging hardware equipped in modern linear accelerators, as gantry rotated a total of 110 °. A selected range of overlap projections between 90 ° to 100 ° were then decomposed into two material projections using experimentally determined parameters from orthogonally stacked aluminum and acrylic <b>step-wedges.</b> Given attenuation coefficients of aluminum and acrylic at a predetermined energy, one set of VM projections could be synthesized from two corresponding sets of decomposed projections. Two linear functions were generated using projection information at overlap angles to convert kV and MV projections at non-overlap angles to approximate VM projections for CBCT reconstruction. The CNRs were calculated for different inserts in VM CBCTs of a CatPhan phantom with various selected energies and compared with those in kV and MV CBCTs. The effect of overlap projection number on CNR was evaluated. Additionally, the effect of beam orientation was studied by scanning the CatPhan sandwiched with two 5 cm solid-water phantoms on both lateral sides and an electronic density phantom with two metal bolt inserts. Proper selection of VM energy (30 keV and 40 keV for low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polymethylpentene (PMP), 2 MeV for Delrin) provided comparable or even better CNR results as compared with kV or MV CBCT. An increased number of overlap between kV and MV projections demonstrated only marginal improvements of CNR for different inserts (with the exception of LDPE) and therefore one projection overlap was found to be sufficient for the CatPhan study. It was also evident that the optimal CBCT image quality was achieved when MV beams penetrated through the heavy attenuation direction of the object. In conclusion, the performance of a bench-top DCBCT imaging system has been characterized and is comparable to that of a single CBCT. The 4 D-DCBCT provides an efficient 4 D imaging technique for motion management. The scan time is reduced by approximately a factor of two. The temporally correlated orthogonal projections improved the image blur across 4 D phase images. Dual-energy CBCT imaging techniques were implemented to synthesize VM CBCT and LM CBCTs. VM CBCT was effective at achieving metal artifact reduction. Depending on the dose-partitioning scheme, LM CBCT demonstrated the potential to improve CNR for low contrast objects compared with single-energy CBCT acquired with equivalent dose. A novel technique was developed to generate VM CBCTs from kV/MV projections. This technique has the potential to improve CNR at selected VM energies and to suppress artifacts at appropriate beam orientations. Dissertatio...|$|R

Materials and methodsMM-Seal (MicroMega, Besancon, France) and Diaket (3 M Espe, Seefeld, Germany) were packed into a polytetrafluoroethylene ring mold with an internal diameter of 10 mm and a depth of 1 mm. Five discs of each material were imaged alongside an aluminum <b>step-wedge.</b> Sets of radiographs were obtained using storage phosphor plates (SPPs). The SPPs were exposed at 60, 65, or 70 kVp, 7 or 8 mA for 0. 12 or 0. 16 s. Radiographic densities of the sealers and each step of the <b>step-wedge</b> were analyzed with Image Tool 3. 0 SDK software (University of Texas Health Sciences Center, TX, USA). Three readings were made for each image. The mean was calculated to give the radiographic density expressed as mean gray values. Three-way ANOVA was used to test the differences in radiopacity of sealers with respect to kilovoltage, milliampere, exposure time, and the interaction of the three factors. ResultsNo significant difference in sealers’ radiopacity was found with change in three exposure parameters (p> 0. 05). However, standard deviations of the measurements for lower exposures were greater; MM-Seal was significantly more radiopaque than Diaket (p< 0. 0001) at any parameter. ConclusionsDifferences in kilovoltage, milliampere, and exposure time do not affect the radiopacity measurements of sealers on SPP images. However, choosing the proper exposure parameters may optimize the gray value range of the sealers allowing for better discrimination of the sealer and surrounding structures thereby providing better clinical guidance...|$|E

40|$|During the 2014 Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD) outbreak, {{policy-makers}} were confronted with difficult decisions {{on how best}} to test the efficacy of EVD vaccines. On one hand, many were reluctant to withhold a vaccine that might prevent a fatal disease from study participants randomized to a control arm. On the other, regulatory bodies called for rigorous placebo-controlled trials to permit direct measurement of vaccine efficacy prior to approval of the products. A stepped-wedge cluster study (SWCT) was proposed as an alternative to a more traditional randomized controlled vaccine trial to address these concerns. Here, we propose novel "ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial" (OSWCT) designs to further mitigate tradeoffs between ethical concerns, logistics, and statistical rigor. We constructed a spatially structured mathematical model of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. We used the output of this model to simulate and compare a series of stepped-wedge cluster vaccine studies. Our model reproduced the observed order of first case occurrence within districts of Sierra Leone. Depending on the infection risk within the trial population and the trial start dates, the statistical power to detect a vaccine efficacy of 90 % varied from 14 % to 32 % for standard SWCT, and from 67 % to 91 % for OSWCTs for an alpha error of 5 %. The model's projection of first case occurrence was robust to changes in disease natural history parameters. Ordering clusters in a <b>step-wedge</b> trial based on the cluster's underlying risk of infection as predicted by a spatial model can increase the statistical power of a SWCT.

A 30 Å Cu/Ni <b>step-wedge</b> (30, 60, 90, and 150 Å) / 600 Å Cu buffer/ Si(001) structure has been used to study the Ni thickness-dependent strain and magnetic moment. A decreased magnetic moment with decreasing Ni thickness is observed. A 30 Å Cu/ 50 Å Ni/step-wedged (600, 1000, 1500, and 2000 Å) Cu buffer/Si(001) was used to vary the degree of strain as determined by in situ RHEED measurements in the same Ni film by varying the Cu buffer layer thickness.

40|$|Considering {{ultrasound}} propagation through complex composite {{media as}} {{an array of}} parallel sonic rays, a comparison of computer simulated prediction with experimental data has previously been reported for transmission mode (where one transducer serves as transmitter, the other as receiver) {{in a series of}} ten acrylic <b>step-wedge</b> samples, immersed in water, exhibiting varying degrees of transit time inhomogeneity. In this study, the same samples were used but in pulse-echo mode, where the same ultrasound transducer served as both transmitter and receiver, detecting both ‘primary’ (internal sample interface) and ‘secondary’ (external sample interface) echoes. A transit time spectrum (TTS) was derived, describing the proportion of sonic rays with a particular transit time. A computer simulation was performed to predict the transit time and amplitude of various echoes created, and compared with experimental data.

40|$|Osteoporosis {{is common}} in the elderly and the dentist is often the only {{healthcare}} professional that they visit regularly. Since dental panoramic radiographs (DPRs) are widely used for routine examinations when planning treatment, this study evaluated whether the presence of osteoporosis might be apparent in a population of patients who underwent DPR. The mandibular cortical index (MCI) and a new method of measuring the mandibular radiographic density (m-RD), which used DPR that incorporated an aluminium <b>step-wedge,</b> were compared with the total vertebral bone mineral density (v-BMD) of the lumbar vertebrae measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 25 osteoporotic women. Although {{there was only a}} weak correlation between m-RD and v-BMD, significant correlation was found between MCI and v-BMD. Since both m-RD and MCI were related to v-BMD, dental radiographic density and MCI may be useful in clinical dental practice to identify osteoporotic women with previously undetected low BMD...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{ultrasound}} transit time spectroscopy (UTTS) is an alternative method to describe ultrasound wave propagation through complex samples as an array of parallel sonic rays. This technique has the potential to characterize bone properties including volume fraction and may be implemented in clinical systems to predict osteoporotic fracture risk. In contrast to broadband ultrasound attenuation, which is highly frequency dependent, we hypothesise that UTTS is frequency independent. This study measured 1 MHz and 5 MHz broadband ultrasound signals through a set of acrylic <b>step-wedge</b> samples. Digital deconvolution of the signals through water and each sample was applied to derive a transit time spectrum. The resulting spectra at both 1 MHz and 5 MHz were compared to the predicted transit time values. Linear regression analysis yields agreement (R 2) of 99. 23 % and 99. 74 % at 1 MHz and 5 MHz respectively indicating frequency independence of transit time spectra...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{reductions}} in malaria in sub-Saharan Africa {{have been associated}} with increased coverage with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Pyrethroids are currently the only insecticide class used for treating nets, and the rapid increase in resistance to pyrethroids in vector mosquitoes may jeopardise future vector control. Nets containing a novel combination of permethrin, a pyrethroid, and pyriproxyfen, an insect juvenile hormone mimic, (PPF-LLIN) may enhance malaria control, as well as reducing the spread of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. This trial will determine whether PPF-LLINs provide incremental protection against malaria over current best practice of LLINs and prompt treatment in an area with pyrethroid-resistant vectors.; A 2 armed cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Burkina Faso to assess whether PPF-LLIN (containing 2 % permethrin and 1 % pyriproxyfen w/w) provide better protection against clinical malaria in children than 2 % permethrin-treated LLINs. Study subjects will be recruited and provided with LLINs {{at the start of the}} study. The LLINs will be exchanged for PPF-LLIN by cluster in a <b>step-wedge</b> fashion so 3 months before the end of the 2 year trial all participants will have a PPF-LLIN. The primary endpoint will be clinical malaria incidence measured by passive case detection in a cohort of children, aged 6 months to 5 years. Anaemia and parasite prevalence will also be measured in children during cross-sectional surveys. Exposure to malaria parasites will be assessed using light traps followed by identification of common vector species and their sporozoite infection rates. Safety evaluation will include recording of adverse events and pregnancy outcomes. The main endpoint analysis will include adjusting for distance between village clusters with different types of nets, as the impact of PPF-LLIN is likely to increase as larger areas are dominated by PPF-LLIN, reducing the spill over of mosquitoes from villages with LLINs; The <b>step-wedge</b> design is to measure the impact of an incrementally delivered environmental intervention where we expect the degree of control to be improved as more people use PPF-LLIN over a larger area.

40|$|We used microdensitometry (MD) and dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) {{to evaluate}} impaired bone metabolism in 79 {{patients who had}} undergone gastrectomy. With MD, radiographs are simultaneously taken of the second metacarpal bone and an aluminum <b>step-wedge,</b> and the images were analyzed by computer. DXA {{was used to measure}} the bone mineral density of the second through fourth vertebrae and the estimated volumetoric bone mineral density (EstVBMD) was assessed. Significant positive correlations were obtained between EstVBMD as determined by DXA and metacarpal index (MCI) (r= 0. 413, P< 0. 01), peak of the cortex (GSmax) (r= 0. 362, P< 0. 05), peak of the middle portion of the bone marrow (GSmin) (r= 0. 412, P< 0. 01), and metacarpal bone mineral density (mBMD) (r= 0. 413, P< 0. 01) as determined by MD. When EstVBMD was compared with MCI, GSmax, GSmin, and mBMD according to sex, age, type of operation, and interval after operation, generally similar trends were obtained. We conclude that the determination by MD of various indices of bone metabolism is useful in the diagnosis of osteopathy after gastrectomy...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Proper patient {{treatment}} planning {{depends on}} correct diagnosis of its disease {{which could be}} achieved by taking high quality radiographs. Densitometric stability and film processing have important effect on the radiographs quality. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the densitometric stability of intra oral E+ and Insight film, which were processed by Champion and Teifsaz solutions. Materials and methods: A lab trial study was conducted. Radiographic images were taken of 56 E and Insight through lead <b>step-wedge.</b> Films were processed by new and in aging Champion and Teifsaz solutions every four days. After 56 days, the radiographic density of each film was calculated by Photoshop software. The contrast of each image was calculated by distracting maximum and minimum density. The resultant data were coded in SPSS software and analyzed by two-way variance analysis. Results: There is significant difference between the mean of density of processed films with the two different chemicals (Champion & Teifsaz) (P-value + and Insight films (P- value = 0. 717). Conclusion: Densitometric stability of new Insight film is as the same as currently used E+ film and is better preserved with Champion chemicals than Teifsaz solutions...|$|E
40|$|For {{inspection}} of thick-walled (50 mm) copper canisters for final disposal of {{spent nuclear fuel}} in Sweden, ultrasonic inspection using phased array technique (PAUT) is applied. Because thick-walled copper is not commonly used as a structural material, previous experience on Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing {{for this type of}} application is limited. The paper presents the progress in understanding the amplitudes and attenuation changes acting on the Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing {{inspection of}} copper canisters. Previous studies showed the existence of a low pass filtering effect and a heterogeneous grain size distribution along the depth, thus affecting both the detectability of defects and their “Probability of Detection” determination. Consequently, the difference {{between the first and second}} back wall echoes were not sufficient to determine the local attenuation (within the inspection range), which affects the signal response for each individual defect. Experimental evaluation of structural attenuation was carried out onto <b>step-wedge</b> samples cut from full-size, extruded and pierced & drawn, copper canisters. Effective attenuation values has been implemented in numerical simulations to achieve a Multi Parameter Probability of Detection and to formulate a Model Assisted Probability of Detection through a Monte-Carlo extraction model...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the correlation between}} maxillomandibular alveolar bone density and systemic bone mineral density (BMD). METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the anterior and posterior maxillomandibular alveolar bone, of the standard sites for the measurement of BMD (lumbar spine and femur) and the third cervical vertebra was performed on 23 middle-aged women. Periapical radiographs were also obtained, with an aluminum <b>step-wedge</b> as reference for the digital reading of apical bone density of the upper incisors. RESULTS: Spearman's correlations coefficients revealed that density in the apical region was correlated {{with that of the}} femoral neck (r = 0. 433; p < 0. 05); BMDs of the posterior regions of the mandible and maxilla were significantly correlated with that of the cervical vertebra (r = 0. 554, p < 0. 01 and r = 0. 423, p < 0. 05, respectively); and the anterior maxilla was correlated with the posterior mandible (r = 0. 488, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Bone density of the maxillary alveolar bone was significantly correlated with that of the femoral neck. Among the bone densities of the alveolar regions, only the anterior maxilla and the posterior mandible were significantly correlated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the addition of three radiopaque agents to an experimental adhesive on conversion kinetics, flexural strength and radiodensity. Methods: The model adhesive was formulated by mixing 50 wt% Bis-GMA, 25 wt% TEGDMA and 25 wt% HEMA. Barium sulfate, Titanium dioxide and Zirconium in 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 6 wt% were added separately resulting in 15 experimental groups and 1 control group. The conversion kinetics of the model adhesive was evaluated using real time Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The flexural tests were performed on 5 specimens (12 ?? 2 ?? 2 mm) for each group (total n = 80) in a universal testing machine. The radiodensity was evaluated by using an aluminum <b>step-wedge</b> and VistaScan phosphorous plates radiographs digital system with 0. 6 s exposure and focal distance of 40 cm. Results: No statistical difference (P > 0. 05) was found in flexural strength among all groups. The values of degree of conversion ranged from 45. 51 % e 62. 46 %. All groups showed higher values than 0. 54 mm of aluminum for the evaluation of radiopacity.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the radiopacity of silorane and methacrylate resin composites, comparing them to the enamel, dentin, and aluminum penetrometer using a digital image. From six resin composites (Filtek™ P 90, Filtek Z 350, Filtek Z 350 XT flow, Tetric Ceram, TPH Spectrum, and SureFil SDR flow) cylindrical disks (5 × 1 [*]mm) were made and radiographed by a digital method, together with a 15 -step aluminum <b>step-wedge</b> and a 1 [*]mm slice of human tooth. The degree of radiopacity of each image was quantified using digital image processing. The mean values of the shades of gray of the tested materials were measured and the equivalent width of aluminum was calculated for each resin. The results of our work yielded the following radiopacity values, given here in descending order: Tetric Ceram > TPH > SDR > Z 350 > Z 350 flow > P 90 > enamel > dentin. The radiopacity of the materials was different both for the enamel and for the dentin, except for resin P 90, which was no different than enamel. In conclusion, silorane-based resin exhibited a radiopacity higher than dentin and closest to the enamel; a large portion of the methacrylate-based flow and conventional resins demonstrated greater radiopacity in comparison to dentin and enamel...|$|E
40|$|Background. Image {{post-processing}} gives computed radiography (CR) {{a considerable}} advantage over film-screen systems. After digitisation {{of information from}} CR plates, data are routinely processed using manufacturer-specific software. Agfa CR readers use MUSICA software, and an upgrade with significantly different image appearance was recently released: MUSICA 2. Aim. This study quantitatively compares the image quality of images acquired without post-processing (flatfield) with images processed using these two software packages. Methods. Four aspects of image quality were evaluated. An aluminium <b>step-wedge</b> was imaged using constant mA at tube voltages varying from 40 to 117 kV. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and contrast-to-noise Ratios (CNRs) were calculated from all steps. Contrast variation with object size was evaluated with visual assessment of images of a Perspex contrast-detail phantom, and an image quality figure (IQF) was calculated. Resolution was assessed using modulation transfer functions (MTFs). Results. SNRs for MUSICA 2 were generally higher {{than the other two}} methods. The CNRs were comparable between the two software versions, although MUSICA 2 had slightly higher values at lower kV. The flatfield CNR values were better than those for the processed images. All images showed a decrease in CNRs with tube voltage. The contrast-detail measurements showed that both MUSICA programmes improved the contrast of smaller objects. MUSICA 2 was found to give the lowest (best) IQF; MTF measurements confirmed this, with values at 3. 5 lp/mm of 10...|$|E
