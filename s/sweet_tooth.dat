5|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>Tooth</b> is a {{novel by}} the English writer Ian McEwan, {{published}} on 21 August 2012. It deals with the experiences of its protagonist, Serena Frome, during the early 1970s. After graduating from Cambridge she is recruited by MI5, and becomes involved in a covert program to combat communism by infiltrating the intellectual world. When she becomes romantically involved with her mark, complications ensue.|$|E
5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Tooth</b> is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he did play a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>Tooth</b> {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E

The cap is dry, colored yellow to light orange to brown, and often develops an irregular shape, especially when it has grown closely crowded with adjacent fruit bodies. The mushroom tissue is white with a pleasant odor and a spicy or bitter taste. All parts of the mushroom stain orange with age or when bruised.|$|E

500|$|McEwan {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a novel about the 1970s, a {{formative}} period in his life he refers to as [...] "the time of my life." [...] For the United Kingdom it was a turbulent period, with striking miners, energy crisis, escalation of the conflict over Northern Ireland, repeated states of emergency and several shifts of government. It was also the period of the Cold War, when Western governments were trying to win the war of ideas against a highly radicalised intelligentsia. Operation <b>Sweet</b> <b>Tooth</b> is entirely fictional, but the story is inspired by the actual scandal affecting the conservative literary magazine Encounter, which in 1967 was revealed to have received covert funding from the CIA. McEwan uses this back-story to explore the relationship between artist and government, and the need for literature to remain independent. According to McEwan, the problem was not the anti-Communist crusade itself, but the secrecy with which it was conducted. [...] "All that's really required is that anything the state does in relation to the arts is laid on the table where we can see it." ...|$|E

[...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it... it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E

At the execution, Arthur watches from a distance as Mordred taunts him for his failures; he is torn between upholding his law and doing his duty as a king, or sparing Guinevere, whom he still loves in spite of everything. At the last moment, Lancelot arrives with an army, rescues Guinevere and takes her off with him to France. But in the process, Lancelot has been forced to kill some of the other knights, leaving the survivors vowing revenge.|$|E

40|$|Background An inverse {{relationship}} between religiosity and adolescent health-related behaviour has been repeatedly documented, but evidence regarding gender is scarce. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the association between a wide range of adolescent health-related behaviours and religiosity as well as gender differences in these associations. Methods Data were collected in 2010 in Slovakia on 3674 adolescents, with mean age of 14. 9 years (response: 79. 5 %). ORs for levels of religiosity, measured by religious attendance and religious salience, were calculated for 15 behaviours, such as the use of various substances, nutritional behaviour and violent behaviour. The authors then assessed the interactions of religiosity and gender on these behaviours. Results Religiosity was inversely associated with health-risk behaviour in smoking, drunkenness, cannabis use, having breakfast, soft drinks consumption, screen-based activities and sexual intercourse among both genders and in truancy among girls only. This association was significantly stronger among girls than among boys in smoking, drunkenness and cannabis use. Religiosity was unrelated to the consumption of fruits, vegetables and <b>sweets,</b> physical inactivity, <b>tooth</b> brushing, fighting and bullying others in both genders. Conclusions An {{inverse relationship}} between religiosity and health-risk behaviour was found in several behaviours (especially use of substances) but not in other behaviours (violent behaviours in particular). Gender seems to moderate this relationship in smoking, drunkenness and cannabis use. Further research is needed on the mechanisms leading to an association between religiosity and health behaviour and on the strength of this association in other countries and cultures...|$|R

Patients and methods: A representative stratified cluster {{random sample of}} 1335 Saudi Arabian male adolescents {{living in the city}} of Riyadh answered a questionnaire on health-related behaviors. Poisson regression models were constructed separately for younger (13 - 14 -years-old) and older (17 - 19 -years-old) adolescents to assess variations between explanatory psychosocial variables and the clustering of six health-compromising behaviors, adjusting for father's education. Results: Older adolescents who perceived high levels of life satisfaction had a lower rate of clustering of multiple health-compromising behaviors compared to those reporting lower levels (RR: 1. 22; 95 %CI: 1. 09 – 1. 37), and the respective difference between those with high and those with middle levels of satisfaction was marginally non-significant (RR: 1. 08; 95 %CI: 0. 98 – 1. 19). Younger adolescents who reported that they felt “less than always” self-confident {{were more likely to have}} high clustering of health compromising behaviors compared to those who were always confident (RR: 1. 08; 95 %CI: 1. 01 – 1. 21).

In further analysis which analyzed the factors related to caries {{in the community of}} Indonesia. Several factors associated with caries are characteristics of respondents, <b>sweet</b> eating, and <b>tooth</b> brushing habits. Instruments taken from the questionnaires of Riskesdas 2007 : RKD 07. RT (Block I, Block IV), RKD 07. IND (Teeth and mouth: B 25, 26, 27, 28), hygienic behavior: (D 10 a, 10 b), behavior of consumption: (d 35 a), and Measurement and Inspection-Dentogram. Methods: The data analysis performed using Univariate, Bivariate, and Logistic Regression. Before the analysis, it has conducted weigth. Based on research results, indicated that individual characteristics (age, education, housing, social and economic) associated with the occurrence of caries, therefore higher level of education, and level of social economic, hence there were tendency to have fewer caries above average (> 2). Chi-Square test was a significant relationship. Result: Moreover, types of respondents who lived in the city at risk of caries are greater than living in the village. Communities often consume sweet foods tend to occur more caries compared with a eat pattern of fibrous foods. In addition, respondents who have a tendency to brush your teeth caries occurrence are lighter than that does not brush their teeth. For that suggested the need for information about the eat patterns can reduce the occurrence of caries, as well as increased efforts to maintain dental health within the community who had been very low. Research and information about medicinal plants that can be used by the public as an antiseptic teeth and mouth can reduce the occurrence of dental caries. School Efforts for Oral Health (UKGS) and Dental Health Programs in the community need to be increased so that the prevalence of caries can be reduced.
