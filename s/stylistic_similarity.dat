5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E
25|$|The Mississippian culture {{developed}} the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, the name which archeologists have {{given to the}} regional <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> of artifacts, iconography, ceremonies and mythology. The rise of the complex culture {{was based on the}} people's adoption of maize agriculture, development of greater population densities, and chiefdom-level complex social organization from 1200 CE to 1650 CE.|$|E

25|$|The telenovela, a shorter-form {{format of}} serial melodrama, shares some {{thematic}} and especially <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> to the soap opera, {{enough that the}} colloquialism Spanish soap opera has arisen to describe the format. The chief {{difference between the two}} is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.|$|E
25|$|Under the Pomeroys {{the castle}} {{consisted}} of a dry moat (now mostly infilled), gatehouse and ramparts surmounted by the curtain wall with buildings disposed around the wall on the inside. Due to the extensive remodelling that took place later, very few archaeological remains survive to show the exact placement of these original buildings. In 1978, a wall painting was discovered in the upper storey of the gatehouse, hidden behind {{a thick layer of}} vegetation. It is a representation of the Adoration of the Magi and has been dated to c.1490–1500 based on its <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> to European works of the period.|$|E

25|$|Christianity {{introduced}} simple monastic houses, such as Clonmacnoise, Skellig Michael and Scattery Island. A <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> {{has been}} remarked between these double monasteries {{and those of}} the Copts of Egypt. Gaelic kings and aristocrats occupied ringforts or crannógs. Church reforms during the 12th century via the Cistercians stimulated continental influence, with the Romanesque styled Mellifont, Boyle and Tintern abbeys. Gaelic settlement had been limited to the Monastic proto-towns, such as Kells, where the current street pattern preserves the original circular settlement outline to some extent. Significant urban settlements only developed following the period of Viking invasions. The major Hiberno-Norse Longphorts were located on the coast, but with minor inland fluvial settlements, such as the eponymous Longford.|$|E
500|$|Monument 161 {{lies within}} the North Group, on the San Elías plantation. It is a basalt outcrop {{measuring}} [...] high by [...] wide {{on the side}} of the Ixchayá ravine. It bears a petroglyph of a face carved onto the upper part of the rock, looking upwards. The face has cheekbones, a prominent chin and a slightly open mouth. It has some <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> to Early Classic jade masks, although it lacks certain features associated with these.|$|E
500|$|Stylistic {{comparisons}} {{place the}} relief {{at the earliest}} into the Isin–Larsa period, or slightly later, {{to the beginning of}} the Old Babylonian period. Frankfort especially notes the <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> with the sculpted head of a male deity found at Ur, which Collon finds to be [...] "so close to the Queen of the Night in quality, workmanship and iconographical details, that it could well have come from the same workshop." [...] Therefore, Ur is one possible city of origin for the relief, but not the only one: Edith Porada points out the virtual identity in style that the lion's tufts of hair have with the same detail seen on two fragments of clay plaques excavated at Nippur. And Agnès Spycket reported on a similar necklace on a fragment found in Isin.|$|E

500|$|Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times was {{critical}} of the film's visuals and soundtrack, comparing it unfavourably with Miami Vice and describing it as a [...] "chic, well-cast wasteland" [...] that [...] "delivers very little". The film's <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> to Miami Vice was also pointed out by Film Threats Dave Beuscher, who felt it was the chief reason for the film's poor box office results. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Steve Winn derided the film, claiming its lack of a strong lead role caused it to [...] "fall apart like the shattered mirrors that figure in the crimes". Time was more favorable in its review, praising the [...] "intelligent camerabatics" [...] and [...] "bold, controlled color scheme". Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it [...] "gripping {{all the way through}} and surprisingly nonexploitive", although adding that [...] "the holes start to show through" [...] if looked for [...] "too carefully". Manhunter was, however, nominated for the 1987 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture.|$|E
500|$|The oldest (and {{also the}} only) {{manuscript}} {{was written in}} 1762, after Bach's death. The provenance of the cantata is disputed: some suggest {{that it may not}} be a Bach work because of its [...] "unpretentious" [...] nature and the lack of authoritative original music, or perhaps it was a transposition of an earlier work. Alternatively, part of the cantata may have been written by Bach, while other parts (likely the choruses and the bass aria) were added or amended by other composers. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, remarks on the <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> of the text structure to Bach's early cantatas written in Mühlhausen. He also sees similar musical expression to the cantata for the inauguration of a new town council there, Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, written in 1708. While some musicologists assume that it may have been composed for the same occasion one year later, Gardiner proposes that it could either be a still earlier work, or that it [...] "was, at least in part, an apprentice piece written in Weimar under Bach's direct tutelage.|$|E
2500|$|Martini wrote masses, motets, psalms, hymns, {{and some}} secular songs, {{including}} chansons.

[...] Some <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> to Obrecht suggests that the two may have known each other, {{or at the very least}} Martini may have seen Obrecht's music. [...] Obrecht was a guest in Ferrara in 1487, and his music is known to have circulated in Italy in the early 1480s.|$|E

2500|$|The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (formerly the Southern Cult), aka S.E.C.C., is {{the name}} given to the {{regional}} <b>stylistic</b> <b>similarity</b> of artifacts, iconography, ceremonies, and mythology of the Mississippian culture that coincided with their adoption of maize agriculture and chiefdom-level complex social organization from 1200 to 1650 CE. This development appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerica, but developed independently.
