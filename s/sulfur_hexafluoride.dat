5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms, so <b>sulfur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides. Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms, and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as <b>sulfur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> or xenon.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas <b>sulfur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and <b>sulfur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> can be breathed safely when {{mixed with}} at least 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E

5|$|The Montreal Protocol, {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; <b>sulfur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E

The chart at right attributes anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to eight main economic sectors, of which the largest contributors are power stations (many of which burn coal or other fossil fuels), industrial processes, transportation fuels (generally fossil fuels), and agricultural by-products (mainly methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide from fertilizer use).|$|E
