40|$|AbstractAfter Descartes’ {{death in}} 1650, Princess Elizabeth generously shared with others several letters she had {{received}} from the philosopher, which contained philosophically as well as mathematically exciting material. In this article I place the transmission of these copies in context, revealing that Elizabeth steadily became an intellectually inspiring figure, attracting international attention. In the 1650 <b>s</b> <b>she</b> <b>stayed</b> at Heidelberg where she discussed Cartesian philosophy with professors and students alike, including the professor of philosophy and mathematics Johann von Leuneschlos. In the mid- 1660 s, an initiative {{was taken from the}} English side of the Channel (Pell, More) to obtain Descartes’ mathematical letters to Elizabeth that had not yet been published. One letter of Elizabeth herself on this very subject has been preserved. The letter, addressed to Theodore Haak, will be published here for the first time. It is of special interest, because the princess supplies a general outline of her solution to the mathematical problem Descartes gave her to solve in 1643. It substantiates the hypothesis regarding Elizabeth’s solution earlier proposed by Henk Bos...|$|R

There {{is very little}} quantitative research on concurrent planning 2 ̆ 7 s effects. This study examines the influence of concurrent planning practice elements (reunification prognosis, concurrent plan, full disclosure, and discussion of voluntary relinquishment) on reunification and adoption. Method: Using a sample of 885 children, an observational design, and statistical controls, children who received concurrent planning elements were {{compared to those who}} did not. Results: Findings show discussion of voluntary relinquishment to be positively associated with adoption and full disclosure to be negatively associated with reunification. Conclusions: Concurrent planning 2 ̆ 7 s benefits may require more intensive services to be fully realized. Care should be taken to ensure activities achieve their intended effects...|$|R

40|$|We provide here a {{framework}} for studying Prolog programs with various built-in's that include arithmetic operations, and such metalogical relations like var and ground. To this end we propose a new, declarative semantics and prove completeness of the Prolog computation mechanism w. r. t. this semantics. We also show that this semantics is fully abstract in an appropriate sense. Finally, we provide a method for proving termination of Prolog programs with built-in's which uses this semantics.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recovery of an unknown multivariate signal f observed in a d-dimensional Gaussian white noise model of intensity ε. We assume that f belongs to a class of smooth functions F^d⊂ L_ 2 ([0, 1]^d) and has an additive sparse structure determined by the parameter s, the number of non-zero univariate components contributing to f. We {{are interested in the}} case when d=d_ε→∞ as ε→ 0 and the parameter <b>s</b> <b>stays</b> "small" relative to d. With these assumptions, the recovery problem in hand becomes that of determining which sparse additive components are non-zero. Attempting to reconstruct most non-zero components of f, but not all of them, we arrive at the problem of almost full variable selection in high-dimensional regression. For two different choices of F^d, we establish conditions under which almost full variable selection is possible, and provide a procedure that gives almost full variable selection. The procedure does the best (in the asymptotically minimax sense) in selecting most non-zero components of f. Moreover, it is adaptive in the parameter s...|$|R
