5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> God, and {{proposed}} that this view {{is no different from}} the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about.

Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Puranas are {{the first}} scriptures to <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> her birth. They declare that sage Kashyapa is her father, not Shiva as {{described}} in the Mangalkavyas. Once, when serpents and reptiles had created chaos on the Earth, sage Kashyapa created goddess Manasa from his mind (mana). The creator god Brahma made her the presiding deity of snakes and reptiles. Manasa gained control over the earth, by the power of mantras she chanted. Manasa then propitiated the god, Shiva, who told her to please Krishna. Upon being pleased, Krishna granted her divine Siddhi powers and ritually worshiped her, making her an established goddess.|$|E
5|$|Symeon endured severe {{opposition}} from church authorities, {{particularly from the}} chief theologian of the emperor's court, Archbishop Stephen, who at one time was the Metropolitan of Nicomedia. Stephen was a former politician and diplomat {{with a reputation for}} a thorough theoretical understanding of theology, but one which was removed from actual experience of the spiritual life. Symeon, in contrast, held the view that one must have actual experience of the Holy Spirit in order to <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> God, at the same time recognizing the authority of scripture and of the earlier church fathers. Their differing views on the source of authority to speak on spiritual matters was the cause of several years of intense conflict, ending with Symeon's eventual exile.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1951-1952 season, the TSO {{refused to}} renew the {{contracts}} of these musicians, stating that they had not fulfilled their contractual agreements. The six musicians appealed this decision to its union, the Toronto Musicians' Association; the Mayor of Toronto; the Canadian Civil Liberties Association; and many other bodies, without success. They received support from the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts, but not from the Canadian Congress of Labour. The incident garnered extensive media coverage in both Canada and the United States, and sparked a protest against the TSO's decision. The orchestra's director, Ernest MacMillan, did not <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> the matter in public, which also prompted criticism, and two members of the TSO board resigned. The six musicians were viewed with suspicion by their colleagues and people avoided them to protect themselves from guilt by association. Budd and Staryk later returned to the TSO, while the four other musicians continued their careers elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They <b>speak</b> <b>about</b> the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers.
