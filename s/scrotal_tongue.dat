40|$|Melkersson-Rosenthal {{syndrome}} is an uncommon condition of unknown cause. The classical triad includes recurrent orofacial oedema involving predominantly the lips (macrocheilitis), intermittent peripheral facial palsy and <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue.</b> Some authors consider Miescher's cheilitis as a monosymptomatic {{form of the}} syndrome. Nineteen cases (11 females and 8 males) of macrocheilitis seen at the Dermatologic Clinic, University of Coimbra, between 1966 and 1992, are reviewed. The complete triad of signs was present only in 4 patients (21 %) and two features of the classic triad in 3 (16 %) (macrocheilitis and lingua plicata in two; macrocheilitis and facial palsy in one). Twelve patients had only recorrent or persistent orofacial swelling. All 19 patients had macrocheilitis. Less commonly, the check, nose, forehead, eyelid, chin and buccal mucosa were also involved. Peripheral facial paralysis was present in 5 cases (26 %), and <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue</b> occurred in 6 (32 %). Lip biopsies, performed in 17 patients, revealed the typical pathologic picture of granulomatous cheilitis only in 8 cases. Systemic corticosteroids and clofazimine were the most efficacious treatment. Melkersson-Rosenthal {{syndrome is}} an uncommon condition of unknown cause.

40|$|Cowden syndrome, or the {{multiple}} hamartoma syndrome, is a familial cancer syndrome with involvement of various organ systems. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable expression. Progressive macrocephaly, <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue,</b> and {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation are important signs indicating the syndrome in young children. Other mucocutaneous symptoms, for example, trichilemmomas in the nasolabial folds and palmar and plantar hyperkeratotic pits, usually become evident later in childhood. They are often accompanied {{by the appearance of}} subcutaneous lipomas and cutaneous haemangiomas. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|All {{sides of}} the tongue are assessed. To inspect the dorsal side (top) of the tongue, a patient sticks out their tongue. A healthy dorsal tongue is symmetrical, pink, moist, {{slightly}} rough from the papillae, possibly with a thin, whitish coating. The {{sides of the}} tongue are inspected with a gloved hand holding a piece of gauze. The tongue is moved side to side and inspected; it should be pink, moist, smooth and glistening. Assessment of the ventral (bottom) surface of the tongue is done by having the patient touch the tip of their tongue against the roof of their mouth. If healthy, it should have prominent veins and be pink, smooth, moist, glistening and free of lesions. The frenulum should be centered under the tongue. Abnormal findings includes marked redness, cyanosis or extreme pallor. Diseases include <b>scrotal</b> or fissured <b>tongue,</b> migratory glossitis (geographic tongue), atrophic glossitis, black hairy tongue, caviar lesions, carcinoma, macroglossia, candidiasis, aphthous ulcer and leukoplakia.|$|R
40|$|The Melkersson-Rosenthal {{syndrome}} {{consists of}} recurrent facial swelling, recurrent facial paralysis, and fissured or <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue.</b> Any two {{symptoms of the}} triad may represent incomplete forms of the syndrome, and therefore may be acceptable for the diagnosis. A case study is presented and discussed in detail, whereby {{it is to be}} noted that the early manifestations of this anomaly usually develop in adolescents. Any patient with facial palsy, facial swelling or fissured tongue should be questioned and examined for the other features of the triad. No treatment is available. Some success has been recorded with intralesional steriods. Surgical excision of the chronically enlarged tissue has also been recommended. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Pachyonychia congenita {{syndrome}} (PCS) is {{a genetic}} disease with an {{autosomal dominant mode}} of transmission in which the main sign, pachyonychia, usually arises at birth or in childhood together with other disorders of keratinization. A 28 -year-old woman developed subungual hyperkeratosis of all toe-nails and thumb-nails associated with pain on pressure and walking. She had a <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue</b> with leucokeratotic areas, blister formation, plantar hyperkeratosis, palmoplantar hyperhidrosis and dental cavities since childhood. The present case, interpreted as PCS of late onset, could be a clinical variant of the Jadassohn-Lewandowsky syndrome with the late onset of pachyonychia or else an additional form of PCS due to {{the expression of a}} new and different allele...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a vast}} {{spectrum}} of clinical disorders which pre-sent with an abnormal appearance of the tongue. Many of the benign tongue variants are more common in, but not unique to, atopic individuals. These variants enjoy bizarre and descriptive names, such as black hairy tongue, geographic tongue or fissured (<b>scrotal)</b> <b>tongue.</b> 1 This article deals with the latter two condi-tions, both of which represent abnormalities of the papillae. Geographic tongue (Fig. 1) Background: Geographic tongue, also called benign migratory glossitis, was first described in 1955 and occurs in approximately 3 % of the population. It occurs in all age groups but {{is more common in}} adults; the inci-dence in females is approximately twice that o...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Lingual hamartoma {{is a rare}} tongue mass, {{primarily}} {{diagnosed in}} childhood. In most cases in the literature, the masses were surgically removed without preoperative imaging. There are only 3 cases reported in the clinical literature that describe preoperative imaging findings. We report the clinical and imaging findings in an infant with lingual hamartoma and review the literature. Lingual hamartoma is a rare benign tumorlike malforma-tion of the tongue composed of tissue indigenous to {{the area in which}} it is found, but abnormally arranged. These malformations may occur as isolated lesions or in associa-tion with syndromes such as oral-facial-digital syndrome. Although one might expect that they would occur in Cow-den syndrome (multiple hamartoma syndrome), the classic lesion of the tongue in these patients is a <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue</b> rather than a focal lingual hamartoma. 1 In the clinical lit-erature, the imaging characteristics (in 2 children and 1 adult) have been reported as hypointense on T 1 -weighted images, hyperintense on T 2 -weighted images, and interme...|$|E
40|$|During {{one year}} survey, 77 psoriatic {{patients}} were hospitalized in the dermatology department of Razi Hospital. This comprised 19 % of admitted patients in this period. 29 % (n= 22) of psoriatic patients had previous history of hospitalization. On admission, {{the mean age}} of patients was 32. 8 years, the mean and peak age of disease onset were 26. 46 and between 11 - 20 years, respectively. 14 % (n= 10) of the patients had a family history of psoriasis and 70 % (n= 7) of those with a positive family history had their age of onset under 20 years. Involvement of different regions was as follows: Scalp: 88 % (n= 68), nails: 53 % (n= 41) and joints (arthritis) : 10 % (n= 8). Psoriasis was associated with <b>scrotal</b> <b>tongue</b> in 19 % (n= 13) and with geographic tongue in 10 % (n= 8) of patients. Regarding the medical treatment, the drugs which were used most frequently were tigason in 34 % (n= 41) and ditranol in 22 % (n= 26) of the cases. The mean duration of hospitalization was 39. 29 days and most patients were discharged from the hospital in a good condition without any serious complication. During this period 9 % of patients had a relapse of their disease...|$|E
