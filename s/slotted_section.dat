40|$|The use of {{downhole}} {{heat exchangers}} (DHE) in {{the exploitation of}} geothermal resources is characterized by an absence of mass withdrawal from the aquifer. Although this peculiarity reduces installation costs it also imposes limits on the heat ¯ow withdrawable (generally less than 100 kW), and, therefore, {{on the use of}} DHEs in small applications such as greenhouses, small buildings or thermal baths. For this reason DHEs are mainly used in super®cial geothermal aquifers (up to 30 mdepth), usually with liquid-phase water at temperatures greater than 60 °C. A study has been made of the influence of the position of the casing <b>slotted</b> <b>section</b> within an aquifer on the heat withdrawal rates using DHEs. This study numerically simulates an aquifer using the finite-element method to determine the heat flow that can be withdrawn by the DHE when the <b>slotted</b> <b>section</b> position is varied within a geothermal aquifer. The simulations carried out also enable us to determine the influence of the main characteristics of the aquifer and the extraction plant on the design of the tube casing <b>slotted</b> <b>section.</b> On the basis of the numerical results obtained, a particular configuration of <b>slotted</b> <b>section</b> is proposed where this is subdivided into different sections, one placed in {{the lower part of the}} aquifer and the other in the upper part. The results obtained have shown that this configuration optimizes the heat flow drawn by the DHE from the geothermal aquifer. All rights reserved...|$|E

The test procedure involves measuring the reflection and transmission properties of the soil using a <b>slotted</b> <b>section</b> of coaxial transmission line, With the soil acting as the dielectric of the coaxial transmission line, four sets of measurements were collected using a network analyzer. These measurements include transmission through the soil and three sets of reflection measurements with the attached loads: short, open, and 50 Ohms. Next, these measurements are compared to analytic values; these are calculated ‘by representing the coaxial transmission line by a signal flow graph and assuming initial values of the permittivity and permeability.

40|$|Well ER- 16 - 1 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office, {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. The well was drilled in June and July 2005 as part of a hydrogeologic {{investigation}} program for the Rainier Mesa-Shoshone Mountain Corrective Action Unit, Number 99. The overall purpose of the well was to gather subsurface data to better characterize the hydrogeology of the Shoshone Mountain area, especially in the older Tertiary and pre-Tertiary strata. The main 46. 99 -centimeter hole was drilled to a depth of 702. 9 meters and cased with 33. 97 -centimeter casing to 663. 7 meters. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 centimeters, and the well was drilled to total depth of 1, 220. 7 meters. A completion string set at the depth of 1, 162. 4 meters consisted of 13. 97 -centimeter stainless-steel casing, with one continuous slotted interval open to the lower carbonate aquifer. The fluid level in the borehole soon dropped, so the borehole was deepened in July 2006. To deepen the borehole, the <b>slotted</b> <b>section</b> was cemented and a 12. 1 -centimeter hole was drilled through the bottom of the completion string to the new total depth of 1, 391. 7 meters, which is 171. 0 meters deeper than the original borehole. A string of 6. 03 -centimeter carbon-steel tubing with one continuous slotted interval at 1, 361. 8 to 1, 381. 4 meters, and open to the lower carbonate aquifer, was installed in the well with no gravel packing or cement, to serve as a monitoring string. Data gathered during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3 meters (extra cuttings samples were collected from the Paleozoic rocks for paleontological analyses), sidewall core samples from 37 depths, various geophysical logs, and water level measurements. These data indicate that the well penetrated 646. 8 meters of Tertiary volcanic rocks and 744. 9 meters of Paleozoic dolomite, quartzite, shale, and limestone.

40|$|Approximately 300  kg/day of {{food-grade}} CO 2 was injected {{through a}} perforated pipe placed horizontally 2 – 2. 3  m deep during July 9 –August 7, 2008 at the MSU-ZERT field test to evaluate atmospheric and near-surface monitoring and detection techniques {{applicable to the}} subsurface storage and potential leakage of CO 2. As part of this multidisciplinary research project, 80 samples of water were collected from 10 shallow monitoring wells (1. 5 or 3. 0  m deep) installed 1 – 6  m from the injection pipe, at the southwestern end of the <b>slotted</b> <b>section</b> (zone VI), and from two distant monitoring wells. The samples were collected before, during, and following CO 2 injection. The main objective of {{study was to investigate}} changes in the concentrations of major, minor, and trace inorganic and organic compounds during and following CO 2 injection. The ultimate goals were (1) to better understand the potential of groundwater quality impacts related to CO 2 leakage from deep storage operations, (2) to develop geochemical tools that could provide early detection of CO 2 intrusion into underground sources of drinking water (USDW), and (3) to test the predictive capabilities of geochemical codes against field data. Field determinations showed rapid and systematic changes in pH (7. 0 – 5. 6), alkalinity (400 – 1, 330  mg/l as HCO 3), and electrical conductance (600 – 1, 800  μS/cm) following CO 2 injection in samples collected from the 1. 5  m-deep wells. Laboratory results show major increases in the concentrations of Ca (90 – 240  mg/l), Mg (25 – 70  mg/l), Fe (5 – 1, 200  ppb), and Mn (5 – 1, 400  ppb) following CO 2 injection. These chemical changes could provide early detection of CO 2 leakage into shallow groundwater from deep storage operations. Dissolution of observed carbonate minerals and desorption-ion exchange resulting from lowered pH values following CO 2 injection are the likely geochemical processes responsible for the observed increases in the concentrations of solutes; concentrations generally decreased temporarily following four significant precipitation events. The DOC values obtained are 5  ±  2  mg/l, and the variations do not correlate with CO 2 injection. CO 2 injection, however, is responsible for detection of BTEX (e. g. benzene, 0 – 0. 8  ppb), mobilization of metals, the lowered pH values, and increases in the concentrations of other solutes in groundwater. The trace metal and BTEX concentrations are all significantly below the maximum contaminant levels (MCLs).

40|$|A dual slant {{polarized}} {{slot antenna}} is proposed. The antenna is {{printed on the}} two sides of a single substrate and has two microstrip feed lines to excite a V-shaped slot formed by the merging of two tilted rectangular step shaped slots. Stepping of the <b>slot</b> <b>sections</b> as well as the feed line improves the impedance matching. A narrow rectangular metallic stub is introduced at the junction of the slot arms to improve the decoupling between the ports. The antenna polarization is + 450 /− 450 with respect to horizontal under alternate excitation and this dual slant polarized nature is demonstrated through aperture electric field plots and far field radiation patterns. The measured return loss bandwidth (S 11  < − 10  dB) of the antenna is from 2. 3  GHz and extends beyond 12  GHz while the measured isolation bandwidth (S 21  < − 20  dB) is from 5  GHz onwards. The time domain characterization of the antenna is also done by calculating the fidelity factor. For evaluating the diversity performance, the envelope correlation coefficients are calculated from the simulated and measured S-parameters. The correlation coefficients are well below the acceptable values. With a peak gain varying between 3 and 5 dBi, the antenna is expected to be useful for wideband dual slant polarized applications...|$|R

Both Liao's and Lindman's absorbing boundary conditions are implemented for the exterior boundaries to efficiently truncate the computation domain for elongated 3 -D well logging problems. Symmetric and anti-symmetric boundaries in azimuthal and axial directions are also implemented in the code to further {{reduce the size of}} the problem.

40|$|Measuring the {{velocities}} of premixed laminar flames {{with precision}} remains a controversial {{issue in the}} combustion community. This paper studies the accuracy of such measurements in two-dimensional slot burners and shows that while methane/air flame speeds can be measured with reasonable accuracy, the method may lack precision for other mixtures such as hydrogen/air. Curvature at the flame tip, strain on the flame sides and local quenching at the flame base can modify local flame speeds and require correc- tions which are studied using two-dimensional DNS. Numerical simulations also provide stretch, dis- placement and consumption flame speeds along the flame front. For methane/air flames, DNS show that the local stretch remains small so that the local consumption speed {{is very close to}} the unstretched premixed flame speed. The only correction needed to correctly predict flame speeds in this case is due to the finite aspect ratio of the slot used to inject the premixed gases which induces a flow acceleration in the measurement region (this correction can be evaluated from velocity measurement in the <b>slot</b> <b>section</b> or from an analytical solution). The method is applied to methane/air flames with and without water addition and results are compared to experimental data found in the literature. The paper then discusses the limitations of the slot-burner method to measure flame speeds for other mixtures and shows that it is not well adapted to mixtures with a Lewis number far from unity, such as hydrogen/air flames...|$|R

An extensive groundwater temperature baseline monitoring network has been established for a shallow superficial aquifer in the city of Cardiff, U.

In Spring 2014, temperature profiling was carried out at 1 m depth intervals at 168 groundwater monitoring boreholes across Cardiff, establishing baseline groundwater temperatures within the shallow ( 100 m boreholes showed the urban warming effect may extend to 80 mbgl, before temperatures follow the predicted geothermal gradient. We term this the Zone of Anthropogenic Influence. After initial baseline temperatures were established, a site was selected for the installation of a shallow GSHP. Before installation work began, a monitoring network was set up to establish a temperature baseline for future GSHPs and identify any impacts on the thermal resource caused by removing 2 °C from the abstracted groundwater prior to reinjection into the aquifer. This comprised of 97 temperature loggers in 60 boreholes, including the abstraction and recharge boreholes and boreholes up and down gradient of the site.
