500|$|In {{evaluating}} {{the impact of}} the public's reaction to Parker's alleged 1999 rape of a fellow Penn State student, a film producer told The Hollywood Reporter, about Parker's directing career, [...] "His inability to act like he cared that people invested a whole lot of money in him — <b>sorry.</b> <b>You</b> go into the 'life is too short' category." [...] Noting that {{the first half of the}} New York Times review of The Birth of a Nation is taken up with the controversy, this person adds, [...] "No matter what Nate Parker makes, ... this will always be the first paragraph."
