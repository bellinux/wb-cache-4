He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been undone by government complacency though forces could still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national <b>security</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national <b>security</b> <b>interests,</b> and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E
50|$|A <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> {{is a type}} of {{property}} interest created by agreement or by operation of law over assets to secure the performance of an obligation, usually the payment of a debt. It gives the beneficiary of the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> certain preferential rights in the disposition of secured assets. Such rights vary according to the type of <b>security</b> <b>interest,</b> but in most cases, a holder of the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> is entitled to seize, and usually sell, the property to discharge the debt that the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> secures.|$|R
50|$|Debt {{can become}} secured by a {{contractual}} agreement, statutory lien, or judgment lien.

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Australian {{government}} had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards. The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role, with the new government's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia's global <b>security</b> <b>interests.</b> In line with this new focus, the ADF's force structure changed {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The {{partition}} {{treaty was}} ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. It {{was a major}} success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share {{might have been the}} smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Prussia took most of Polish Royal Prussia, including Ermland, allowing Frederick to link East Prussia and Brandenburg. Prussia also annexed northern areas of Greater Poland along the Noteć River (the Netze District), and northern Kuyavia, but not the cities of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Thorn (Toruń). The territories annexed by Prussia became a new province in 1773 called West Prussia. Overall, Prussia gained 36,000km2 and about 600,000 people. According to Jerzy Surdykowski Frederick the Great soon introduced German colonists in territories he conquered and engaged in Germanization of Polish territories. Frederick II settled 26,000 Germans in Polish Pomerania which influenced the ethnic situation in the region that at the time had around 300,000 inhabitants, and enforced Germanization. According to Christopher Clark in certain areas annexed by Prussia like Notec and Royal Prussia 54 percent of the population (75 percent of the urban populace) were German-speaking Protestants. In the next century this was used by nationalistic German historians to justify the partition, but it was irrelevant to contemporary calculations: Frederick, dismissive of German culture, was instead pursuing an imperialist policy, acting on the <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> of his state. The new-gained territories connected Prussia with Germany proper, and were of major economic importance. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly cut off Poland from the sea, and gained control of over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous custom duties, Prussia accelerated the inevitable collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state.|$|E
