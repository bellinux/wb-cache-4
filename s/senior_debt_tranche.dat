50|$|In May 2010 the two economists Jakob von Weizsäcker and Jacques Delpla {{published}} an article proposing a mix of traditional national bonds (red bonds) and jointly issued eurobonds (blue bonds) to prevent debt crises in weaker countries, {{while at the same}} time enforcing fiscal sustainability. According to the proposal EU member states should pool up to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of their national debt under joint and several liability as <b>senior</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> (blue <b>tranche),</b> thereby reducing the borrowing cost for that part of the debt. Any national debt beyond a country's blue bond allocation (red tranche) should be issued as national and junior debt with sound procedures for an orderly default, thus increasing the marginal cost of public borrowing and helping to enhance fiscal discipline. Participating countries must also establish an Independent Stability Council voted on by member states parliaments to propose annually an allocation for the blue bond and to safeguard fiscal responsibility.|$|R

50|$|The {{underwriter}} of a CDO {{is typically}} an investment bank, and {{acts as the}} structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO's portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, {{and working with the}} credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each <b>debt</b> <b>tranche.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In finance, <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> {{frequently}} {{issued in}} the form of senior notes or referred to as <b>senior</b> loans, is <b>debt</b> that takes priority over other unsecured or otherwise more [...] "junior" [...] debt owed by the issuer. <b>Senior</b> <b>debt</b> has greater seniority in the issuer's capital structure than subordinated debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt, <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> theoretically must be repaid before other creditors receive any payment.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2010, large PFI projects were funded through the sale of bonds and/or <b>senior</b> <b>debt.</b> Since the crisis, funding by <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> has become more common. Smaller PFI projects — the majority by number — have typically always been funded directly by banks {{in the form of}} <b>senior</b> <b>debt.</b> <b>Senior</b> <b>debt</b> is generally slightly more expensive than bonds, which the banks would argue is due to their more accurate understanding of the credit-worthiness of PFI deals — they may consider that monoline providers underestimate the risk, especially during the construction stage, and hence can offer a better price than the banks are willing to.|$|R
50|$|The {{final step}} is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each <b>debt</b> <b>tranche)</b> and place the tranches with investors. The {{priority}} in placement is finding investors for the risky equity <b>tranche</b> and junior <b>debt</b> tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain {{a piece of the}} equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.|$|R

50|$|Junior {{borrowing}} {{base and}} senior borrowing base are {{calculated for the}} financial institutions and large corporations which have structured debt. In these cases, senior borrowing base is associated with <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> and calculated of all assets. On the other hand, junior borrowing base is associated with junior debt and calculated of assets that are not already pledged for <b>senior</b> <b>debts.</b> Thus junior borrowing base is always smaller than senior borrowing base.|$|R

5000|$|In {{relation}} to credit standing, the ranking {{of a security}} refers to where that particular security would stand in a wind up of the issuing company, i.e., its seniority in the company's capital structure. For instance, capital notes are subordinated securities; they would rank behind <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> in a wind up. In other words, the holders of <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> would be paid out before subordinated debt holders received any funds.|$|R
40|$|A liquidity-constrained {{entrepreneur}} {{needs to}} raise capital {{to finance a}} business activity that may cause injuries to third parties - the tort victims. Taking the level of borrowing as fixed, the entrepreneur finances the activity with <b>senior</b> (secured) <b>debt</b> in order to shield assets from the tort victims in bankruptcy. Interestingly, <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> serves the interests of society more broadly: it creates better incentives for the entrepreneur to take precautions than either junior debt or outside equity. Unfortunately, the entrepreneur will raise a socially excessive amount of <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> reducing his incentives for care and generating wasteful spending. Giving tort victims priority over senior debtholders in bankruptcy prevents over-leveraging but leads to suboptimal incentives. Lender liability exacerbates the incentive problem even further. A Limited Seniority Rule, where the firm may issue <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> up to an exogenous limit after which any further borrowing is treated as junior to the tort claim, dominates these alternatives. Shareholder liability, mandatory liability insurance and punitive damages are also discussed...|$|R

Founded in 1986 and {{publicly traded}} between 1997 and 2017, American Capital had six offices in the U.S. and Europe. Through its private equity and leveraged finance business, American Capital participated in management and employee buyouts either by providing mezzanine and <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> financing for buyouts led by private equity firms or by providing capital directly to companies through a 'One Stop Buyout' in which it funded <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> mezzanine and equity and was the controlling shareholder.

50|$|The {{short-term}} securities that a SIV issues often contain two tiers of liabilities, junior and senior, with a leverage ratio ranging from 10 to 15. The <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> is invariably rated AAA/Aaa/AAA and A-1+/P-1/F1 (usually by two rating agencies). The junior debt {{may or may}} not be rated, but when rated it is usually in the BBB area. There may be a mezzanine tranche rated A. The <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> is a pari passu combination of medium-term notes (MTN) and commercial paper (CP). The junior debt traditionally comprises puttable, rolling 10-year bonds, but shorter maturities and bullet notes became more common.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, where {{mezzanine}} capital funding {{is a market}} standard, issuers may choose to pursue a dual track approach to syndication whereby the MLAs handle the <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> and a specialist mezzanine fund oversees placement of the subordinated mezzanine position.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in various}} jurisdictions and circumstances, {{nominally}} [...] "senior" [...] debt may not {{rank pari passu}} with all other senior obligations. For example, in the 2008 Washington Mutual Bank seizure, all assets and most (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank's liabilities were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. However other debt claims, including unsecured <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> were not. By doing this, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) effectively subordinated the unsecured <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> to depositors, thereby fully protecting depositors while also eliminating any potential deposit insurance liability to the FDIC itself. In this and similar cases, specific regulatory and oversight powers can lead to senior lenders being subordinated in potentially unexpected ways.|$|R
