40|$|This review covers some {{epidemiological}} {{aspects that}} allow Brucella to survive, spread, and maintain {{itself in the}} environment. Because the success of maintaining Brucella-free herds {{is determined by the}} efficiency of the <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> to detect a single infected animal the limitations of the traditional <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are emphasized. <b>Serological</b> <b>tests</b> cannot differentiate between cattle infected with Brucella and cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with B. abortus antigen. These cattle and cattle with 'natural' antibodies jeopardize the Brucella-free status of a herd. Likewise, infected cattle with serologically inconclusive test results or which elude detection are also a hazard to Brucella-free herds. Since cattle that elude detection with <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> and the presence of non-specific serum antibodies in healthy cattle have long been recignized as problems, it is opportune to reconsider the procedures currently used to diagnose brucellosis in individual animals. Use of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity test in addition to <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> will significantly improve the diagnosis of brucellosis. This will limit the financial loss incurred by outbreaks of brucellosis...|$|R

40|$|Background. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are {{now widely}} available, but indi-cations {{for their use}} have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a {{committee}} of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations {{for the use of}} type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV- 2) <b>serological</b> <b>tests.</b> Methods. By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population. Results. The committee concluded that, in addition to <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV- 2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial. Conclusions. The targeted use of HSV- 2 <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> for specific diagnostic situations and selected pop-ulations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recom-mendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV- 2 <b>serological</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2 commercial, rapid in-clinic <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in sera of dogs, the Snap Canine Leishmania Antibody Test kit (IDEXX Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, Maine) and the ImmunoRun Antibody Detection kit (Biogal Galed Labs, Kibbutz Galed, Israel), using indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) as the reference method. A total of 109 sera collected from 65 seropositive and 44 seronegative dogs were used. The sensitivities of the Snap and ImmunoRun kits were 89. 23 % (95 % confidence interval: 79. 05 - 95. 54 %) and 86. 15 % (95 % confidence interval: 75. 33 - 93. 45 %), respectively, and the specificity of both tests was 100 %.
