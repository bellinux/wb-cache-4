5000|$|Born to a farmer's {{family in}} the small village of Zagorica east of Ljubljana in Slovenia, Vega was 6 years old when his father Jernej Veha died. Vega was educated first in Moravče and later {{attended}} high school for six years (1767-1773) in Ljubljana (the Jesuit College of Ljubljana, [...] ), studying Latin, Greek, religion, German, history, geography, science, and mathematics. At that time there were about 500 students there. He was a schoolfellow of Anton Tomaž Linhart, a Slovenian writer and historian. Vega finished high school when he was 19, in 1773. After completing his studies at the Lyceum of Ljubljana (Licej v Ljubljani) he became a navigational engineer in 1775. Tentamen philosophicum, {{a list of questions}} for his comprehensive examination, was preserved and is available in the Mathematical Library in Ljubljana. The problems cover logic, algebra, metaphysics, geometry, trigonometry, geodesy, <b>stereometry,</b> geometry of curves, ballistics, and general and special physics.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the course}} of her life Wilhelmina Barns-Graham's work {{generally}} lay on the divide between abstract and representational, typically drawing on inspirations from landscape. From 1940, when she arrived in Cornwall, her pictures are exploratory and even tentative as she began to develop her own method and visual language. The influence of St Ives then starts to arise, to take hold as local shapes and colours appear in the images - the Cornish rocks, landscape and buildings. Perhaps the most significant innovation at this time derived from the ideas of Naum Gabo, who was interested in the principle of <b>stereometry</b> - defining forms in terms of space rather than mass. Barns-Graham's series of glacier pictures that started in 1949, inspired by her walks on the Grindelwald Glacier in Switzerland, reflect the idea of looking at things in a total view, not only from the outside but from all points, including inside. In 1952 her studies of local forms became more planar and two dimensional, but from the mid-1950s she had developed a more expressionist and free form attitude following journeys to Spain.|$|E

However when, within months, the French began closing convents and seizing church treasures the Maltese people rebelled, and the French garrison of General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois retreated into Valletta. After several failed attempts by the locals to retake Valletta, they asked the British for assistance. Rear Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson decided on a total blockade, and in 1800 the French garrison surrendered.|$|E

40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis Anaglyphs {{and their}} application in teaching <b>stereometry</b> deals with anaglyphs and their creation. It gives information about linear perspective, which {{is necessary for}} the creation of anaglyphs. The terms of linear perspective are explained as well as the methods we can use in constructions of this projection. The thesis is mainly devoted to anaglyphs and their creation by the tools of descriptive geometry - central projection and especially linear perspective. Types of anaglyphs, drawing of anaglyphs and the possibility of constructing anaglyphs by software are mentioned. The third chapter deals with <b>stereometry</b> and it uses anaglyphs to support the spatial imagination. There are two versions of the third chapter - each one uses different types of anaglyphs to show the same problems of <b>stereometry.</b> 3 D red cyan glasses are enclosed to the thesis as well as a CD containing both versions of the thesis and two files showing the creation of anaglyphs.

40|$|<b>Stereometry</b> or {{geometry}} {{in space}} {{is an important}} area of geometry, which deals with the study of spatial(stereometric) relations. Basic definitions and theorems concerning properties of axial affinity in an Euklidean space and in a plane are presented in this thesis, as well as basic stereometric theorems and their consequences. Everything is supplemented by illustrations. The thesis attends in more detail to axial affinity between two planes, in a plane and between a circle and an ellipse. A great deal of this thesis is formed by exercises concerning sections of bodies by plane, which are solved by axial affinity, which is unknown to today's students of high schools. Every important chapter contains samples and a pack of exercises for practicing with possibility to display the solution and the procedure step by step. These exercises are also supplemented with applets, which {{make it possible to}} look at the solution from different visual angles and they can help students better imagine a stereometric situation of the given exercise. This study material can be used not only by students to extend their knowledge of <b>stereometry,</b> but also to inspire their teachers as well. For them there are prepared exercises, which are not in today's schoolbooks about <b>stereometry,</b> and work sheets, which can be used for teaching...|$|E
