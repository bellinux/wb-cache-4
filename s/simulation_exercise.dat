In response to the earthquake's occurrence, the Federal District announced the installation of 50,000 seismic alarms in local schools, hospitals, and offices.

Following a short tour aboard , Murray was assigned to [...] as Navigation Officer, until Aurora was paid off in 1921 due to naval budget cuts. Leonard married Jean Chaplin Scott in Westmount, Quebec on 10 October 1921, and with the Royal Canadian Navy depleted of ships on which he could serve, at this point he considered a civilian career, in 1924 qualifying as master of a foreign-going vessel. Deciding to remain with the armed forces, Murray joined many of his colleagues and spent the inter-war years alternating between shore assignments as a training officer with the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, and serving aboard Royal Navy vessels, which in Murray's case included [...] (during a tour in 1923 in Turkey where he befriended Lord Louis Mountbatten), and [...] Understandably, this provided Murray and his peers, including Percy W. Nelles, with a distinct anglophile and, in matters military, Royal Navy bias. In January 1925, Murray was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and spent two years at the Royal Canadian Navy's main training base at HMCS Stadacona. In 1927, Murray returned to the UK where he did a tour aboard [...] and then spent 1928 studying at the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich. During a <b>simulation</b> <b>exercise</b> at the College, Murray broke new ground by planning large convoys – convoys that were regarded at the time as [...] "almost suicidal", but which had become normal by the time of the Battle of the Atlantic. Upon return to Canada in January 1929, Murray was promoted to Commander and became the senior naval officer at CFB Esquimalt. In notes for a lecture to RMC Kingston in 1932, his continuing interest in the offensive merit of convoys over patrols is evident: ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis aims {{to examine}} <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> {{comparatively}} in Korea and the UK, and provide practical suggestions {{for the future of}} Korean <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises,</b> based on lessons from the UK experiences and practices, regarding effective planning and execution of <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises.</b> To achieve this aim, two research questions were formulated. Firstly, ‘How are <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in Korea and the UK organised and conducted, and how can this knowledge be used to respond to crises or disasters more effectively?’. Secondly, ‘Why are new methodological changes to organise and conduct <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> needed in Korea?’. In order to practically assess whether or not <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in Korea are sufficient in dealing with the nature and characteristics of a large-scale disaster, this thesis carries out an in-depth investigation of two real-life underground fires: the King’s Cross Underground Fire in the UK and the Daegu Subway Fire in Korea. <b>Simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> are influenced by the social, political, and cultural contexts of emergency management arrangements, and hence, the study also conducts a comparative study of emergency management frameworks in Korea and the UK. The current practices of <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in Korea can be categorised into the four main themes: ‘Top-level Commitment and Support’, ‘Repeating Training through Rehearsals’, ‘The Politics of Box Seats, Ill-structured Scenario-Scripts and a Lack of Adaptation’, and ‘The Politics of Podium and Speech-based Debriefs’. However, critical analysis of the empirical data in the study reveals that a complex and highly-coupled ‘socio-technical’ crisis does not respect such a conventional training and exercising methodology of Korean <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises,</b> and that a degree of ‘adaptation’ is indispensable to effective crisis response. Thus, it is proposed in the study that Korean <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> need to allow adaptation and diversion to take place, encouraging communication and discussion between exercise players. Furthermore, ensuing afteraction reviews in Korea should be transformed into a discussion-based debriefing style to maximise learning effectiveness. Finally, it is suggested that emergency management arrangements in Korea should also evolve into a more flexible, decentralised, bottom-up model in terms of effective response to ‘socio-technical’ crises or disasters along with changes in <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> and subsequent after-action reviews.

National preparedness plans for responding to poliovirus introduction are insufficient in many countries of the European Region. We describe a series of polio outbreak <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> that were implemented to formally test polio outbreak preparedness plans in the European Region. Methods. We designed and implemented the exercises, reviewed the results, made recommendations, and as-sessed the role of outbreak <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> in maintaining regional polio-free status. In addition, we performed {{a comprehensive review of}} the national plans of all WHO Member States in the European Region. Results. Three exercises, delivered during 2011 – 2013 (for the Balkans, United Kingdom, and the Caucasus and Ukraine), revealed that participating countries were generally prepared for poliovirus introduction, but the level of preparedness needed improvement. The areas in particular need of strengthening were national preparedness plans, initial response, plans for securing vaccine supply, and communications. Conclusions. Polio outbreak <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> can be valuable tools to help maintain polio-free status and should be extended to other high-risk countries and subnational areas in the European Region and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} groups of respondents completed a set of simula-tion exercises intended to reflect lawyering skills involved in client interviews. The written <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> began with {{a brief description of}} a practical situation and required a series,of interde-pendent steps be taken toward resolution of a specific problem in client interviewing. The four response groups were: (a) undergrad-uate prelaw students; (b) law students without any direct client experience; (c) law students completing programs of clinical legal education; and (d) law professors and attorneys. Scores on the <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> showed successive, significant increases across response groups and seemed independent of academic preparation and ability. These results suggest both the appropriate-ness of <b>simulation</b> <b>exercises</b> as measures of clinical skills in legal education and the effectiveness of clinical programs in promoting the development of such skills within law schools.
