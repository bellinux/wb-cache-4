40|$|Citation: Carnell, Fannie. The free coinage of silver. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1897. Introduction: It is {{important}} to understand clearly and exactly what the free coinage of silver under present conditions means. It is the right of anyone to deposit silver at the limited State’s mint and have every 3711 / 4 grains of pure <b>silver</b> <b>stamped</b> free of charge, One Dollar, which dollar shall be full legal tender at its face value in payment of debts and obligations of all kinds, public and private in the United States. Why do we need this free and unlimited coinage of silver? Is it going to benefit the American people? If so, how? Let us first consider how it will benefit the West. There are a great many reasons peculiar to its resources and environment which justify the desire of the west for free silver. The term “The West” comprises by far the vaster portion of the union, tuning with unbounded natural resources, and occupied by millions of enterprising and industrious peoples. Conceded to be the granary of the world, it is at once the metallic treasure house of the nation and the principal source of food supply. Its annual yield of grain, livestock, wool, and metals, is far in excess of two billion dollars. It furnishes the great lines of transportation with the bulk of their business and equips our manufactories with much of the raw material essential to their continued exploration...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{steam power}} was {{introduced}} to run a grinding hull and drop hammers in a <b>silver</b> die <b>stamping</b> shop. The key to the success of buildings such as Leah’s Yard was that they could be adapted to provide accommodation for a number of different metal industry trades on the same site. They provided adaptable, cheap work space by crowding buildings into a confined area. By 1905, the workshops around the courtyard of Leah’s Yard were occupied by eighteen little mesters whose trades included dram flask manufacturer, hollow ware and silver buffers, palette knife makers, steel fork manufacturer, silver ferrule maker, brass and nickel silver turners, electroplate producer and a cutler.|$|R

While {{traveling}} on a ferry, he meets Xiao-qing and her mistress, Bai-niang, {{of the house of}} Bai. As they introduce themselves, Bai-niang's red scarf flies into Xu Xian's face. Xian gives the scarf back and lends his parasol to the two ladies to protect them from the sudden rainstorm. The next day, he goes to the Bai manor to retrieve his parasol. Upon seeing Xian, Bai-niang tells Xu Xian, [...] "My love is like a pearl, hidden deep down in the ocean", and presents a pearl to him, and throws the pearl deep into a fountain in her rose garden. Xu Xian reveals he has no status, and is the apprentice of his brother's medicine shop. To help him, Bai-niang gives him 500 pieces of <b>silver,</b> <b>stamped</b> with the character of fire, and her red scarf as proof of her love. Xiao-qing questions their actions, regarding such a display of love as foolish. Bai-niang gets angry and admonishes Xiao-qing for laughing at her. Xian goes home and gives the silver to his family. Unbeknownst to him, Xiao-qing stole the silver from the local treasury on behalf of her mistress for him. His brother, realizing the truth, turns in the silver. At the behest of the government, and his family, Xu Xian takes everyone to the Bai manor, which is abandoned, and does not appear lived in. The officials and soldiers go in the manor, and in her room, see Bai-niang, who disappears in a cloud of smoke.|$|R

50|$|Kārshāpaṇa (कार्षापण), {{according}} to the Ashtadhyayi of Panini, refers to ancient Indian coins current during the 7th and the 6th century BCE onwards, which were unstamped and stamped (āhata) metallic pieces whose validity depended on {{the integrity of the}} person authenticating them. Parmeshwari lal Gupta states that there is no proof that such coins were first issued by merchants and traders but adds that they did contribute to the development and spread of coin usage. Kārshāpaṇas were basically <b>silver</b> pieces <b>stamped</b> with one to five or six rūpas ('symbols') originally only on the obverse side of the coins initially issued by the Janapadas and Mahajanapadas, and generally carried minute mark or marks to testify their legitimacy. Silver punch-marked coins ceased to be minted sometime in the second century BCE but exerted a wide influence for next five centuries.|$|R
