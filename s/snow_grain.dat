40|$|ABSTRACT: Of special {{interest}} {{within the field}} of avalanche research and avalanche warning are properties related to <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> type and <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size at the surface. In continental and intermountain avalanche climates weak layers or interfaces are the main cause of avalanches. Knowledge about such weak layers helps to increase the precision of avalanche forecasting. Some of these potential weak layers form on the snow surface and are preserved until burial. Optical satellite sensors measure reflected sunlight at different wavelengths. The near-infrared region is sensitive to the optical grain size of the snow. Due to the distinct size and shape characteristics of potential weak layers such as, for example, surface hoar, their reflectance is quite different from new snow in general. If the weather permits optical observations it should, therefore, be possible to detect such layers by remote sensing. We present the results of a pilot study where in situ measured surface <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> characteristics are compared to <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> characteristics as derived from multispectral data from the MODIS satellite sensor. The pilot study showed that parallel in situ snow measurements and snow analyses exploiting data from MODIS are possible for the selected test sites in Norway. The study aims at establishing a relationship between the satellite-observed <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size index (SGS) variable and the <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size and shape as measured in the field. Based on satellite and in situ data measured over several years, we intend to establish a <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> evolution model.

In conjunction with a discrete ordinate method radiative transfer model that couples the polar atmosphere with a scattering and absorbing snowpack, the thermal infrared channels of the AVHRR instrument can, therefore, be used to estimate effective grain size at the snow surface over Antarctica.

40|$|In July 2012, extreme surface melt events {{occurred}} on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Generally, surface melt is physically controlled by the surface energy balance, where net shortwave radiant flux is {{the main energy source}} for melt during summer. Although (optically equivalent) <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile affects near-infrared albedo and in turn net shortwave radiant flux, its qualitative impacts on the surface melt events is unclear. In the present study we investigated effects of <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile on the surface melt event observed at the site SIGMA-A (78 ° 03 ’N, 67 ° 38 ’W, 1, 490 m a. s. l.), which locates on northwest part of GrIS, during 30 June to 10 July 2012 through numerical studies with a physically based 1 -D snowpack model SMAP. Observed snow physical state at SIGMA-A during 30 June to 13 July is indicated in Figure 1 in terms of <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> shape profile. As shown in this figure, top melt form layers (depicted with red color) were expanded day by day as a result of surface melt during the period. First of all, we simulated temporal evolution of physical states of near-surface snowpack at SIGMA-A during 30 June to 10 July 2012 by forcing in-situ meteorological data obtained at SIGMA-A. The depth of simulated snow layer, which was characterized by a thick bottom ice formation, was 88 cm on 30 June. The initial states of snowpack were given from the snow pit observation counducted on 30 June 2012, 16 : 45 UTC. It was found that the simulated shortwave albedo (ctrl in Figure 2) agreed well with measurements (R 2 = 0. 820, root mean square error = 0. 019, and mean error = 0. 008). Next, we performed two sensitivity tests with SMAP, where initial <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile was modulated in order to assess its impacts on the surface energy balance. In these tests we replaced the original <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile for the top 21 cm melt form layers depicted in Figure 1 (average <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size was 0. 6 mm) with smaller (test 1) and larger profiles (test 2). In test 1 top 21 cm <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size was equally set to be 0. 02 mm, which is almost the minimum value for new snow. On the other hand, in test 2, 1. 0 mm, which is the typical maximum value for melt form observed in seasonal snowpack in Japan, was arranged in the top 21 cm layers. Figure 2 illustrates simulated shortwave albedos for test 1 and test 2 cases comparing against ctrl case. Obviously, simulated shortwave albedo for test 1 is higher than that for ctrl continuously, while that for test 2 was kept smaller than that for ctrl. Comparing simulated results for test 1 and test 2 we could know how surface energy balance could be varied with <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile. Obtained average differences in simulated shortwave albedo and net shortwave radiant flux between test 1 and test 2 were 0. 06 and 21. 8 W/m 2, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Dry-snow slab {{avalanches}} initiate from {{a failure}} {{in a weak}} snow layer below a cohesive slab. Snow is considered as a porous ice structure, and the strength distribution of the single elements of this structure, i. e. grains and bonds between grains, shows {{a high degree of}} disorder. On the bond or microstructural level, the failure process is believed to start if the fracturing of bonds between <b>snow</b> <b>grains</b> is not balanced by the formation of new bonds.

The model consists of fibres of various strengths representing single <b>snow</b> <b>grains</b> between two rigid plates which represent the slab above and the substratum below the weak layer. The fibres deform in a linear elastic manner and break instantly at their rupture strength. Broken fibres may sinter (re-bond) and regain strength after a finite sintering time.

In this study, we evaluate the effect of <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> shape on climate simulated by NorESM in a slab ocean configuration of the model. An experiment with spherical snow grains (SPH) is compared with another (NONSPH) in which the snow shortwave single-scattering properties are based on a combination of three non-spherical <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> shapes optimized using measurements of angular scattering by blowing snow. The key difference between these treatments is that the asymmetry parameter is smaller in the non-spherical case (0. 77 – 0. 78 in the visible region) than in the spherical case ([*]≈[*]  0. 89). Therefore, for the same effective <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size (or equivalently, the same specific projected area), the snow broadband albedo is higher when assuming non-spherical rather than spherical snow grains, typically by 0. 02 – 0. 03. Considering the spherical case as the baseline, this results in an instantaneous negative change in net shortwave radiation with a global-mean top-of-the-model value of ca. − 0. 22  W m − 2. Although this global-mean radiative effect is rather modest, the impacts on the climate simulated by NorESM are substantial. The global annual-mean 2  m air temperature in NONSPH is 1. 17  K lower than in SPH, with substantially larger differences at high latitudes.

Both microwave emission and radar backscatter from the snow are dominated by the <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size stratigraphy. As a result, retrieval algorithms for measuring snow water equivalents from orbiting satellites is largely hindered by inadequate knowledge of grain size...|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} meteorological occurrence was {{the first}} snowfall, which occurred on 8 July 1994 in Pelotas from 11:00 am to 1:30 pm. Before this date, {{there had never been}} any record of snow in the city. The phenomenon was weaker in the urban parts of the city, and did not cover the ground. However, the snowfall was more intense further inland, in districts such as Cascata and Quilombo, and was able to cover the vegetation in a white blanket. <b>Snow</b> <b>grains</b> were recorded in Pelotas on 4 September 2006, on 5 September 2008, and on 3 August 2010, and graupel was registered on 12 July 2012, and on 25 September 2012.|$|R
5000|$|This is a flat or {{sometimes}} ragged non-convective stratiform type that sometimes resembles elevated fog. [...] Only very weak precipitation can fall from this cloud (usually drizzle or <b>snow</b> <b>grains),</b> although heavier rain or snow may fall through a stratus layer from a higher precipitating cloud deck. When a low stratiform cloud contacts the ground, {{it is called}} fog if the prevailing surface visibility is less than 1 kilometer, although radiation and advection types of fog tend to form in clear air rather than from stratus layers. If the visibility increases to 1 kilometer or higher {{in any kind of}} fog, the visible condensation is termed mist.|$|R
40|$|The {{fast that}} river water {{turns out to}} be more acidie in the snowmelting season is known. The {{phenomenon}} is called acidic shock. According to the observation, the pH value of the river water increased in the snowmelting season. And the ion concentrations of the snowmelt water decrease in a day. This fact indicates that acidie materials concentrate in the outer part of the <b>snow</b> <b>grains.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} make the model which concludes two processes. One is to compute the snow accumulations, melting and runoff process. Another is to compute acidic materials in the soil and river water. The model is applied to the Takatoki River located at the northern part of Lake Biwa...|$|R
