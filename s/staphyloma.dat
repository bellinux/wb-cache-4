2500|$|A myopic {{individual}} can see clearly {{out to a}} certain distance, but everything further becomes blurry. [...] If {{the extent of the}} myopia is great enough, even standard reading distances can be affected. [...] Upon routine examination of the eyes, the vast majority of myopic eyes appear structurally identical to non-myopic eyes. [...] In cases of high myopia, a <b>staphyloma</b> can sometimes be seen on fundoscopic examination. [...] Because the most significant cause of myopia is the increase in axial length of the eye, the retina must stretch out to cover the increased surface area. As a result, the retina in myopic patients can become thin and might develop retinal holes and lattice degeneration in the periphery [...] High myopia increases the risk of retinal tears and detachment.|$|E
2500|$|The German oculist Burchard Mauchart {{provided}} an early description in a 1748 doctoral dissertation {{of a case}} of keratoconus, which he called <b>staphyloma</b> diaphanum. However, {{it was not until}} 1854 that British physician John Nottingham (18011856) clearly described keratoconus and distinguished it from other ectasias of the cornea. Nottingham reported the cases of [...] "conical cornea" [...] that had come to his attention, and described several classic features of the disease, including polyopia, weakness of the cornea, and difficulty matching corrective lenses to the patient's vision. In 1859, British surgeon William Bowman used an ophthalmoscope (recently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz) to diagnose keratoconus, and described how to angle the instrument's mirror so as to best see the conical shape of the cornea. Bowman also attempted to restore vision by pulling on the iris with a fine hook inserted through the cornea and stretching the pupil into a vertical slit, like that of a cat. He reported that he had had a measure of success with the technique, restoring vision to an 18-year-old woman who had previously been unable to count fingers at a distance of 8inches (20cm).|$|E

We conducted this study to evaluate efficacy of single injection percaruncular peribulbar anaesthesia for phacoemulsification in patients with axial myopia. MethodsEighty patients with axial myopia received percaruncular peribulbar anaesthesia and were evaluated for incidence of major or minor complications. Also surgeon and patients’ satisfaction and their comment on operative conditions were noted. ResultsOf the 80 patients 51 patients had posterior <b>staphylomas.</b> About three quarters of the patients developed adequate akinesia in 10 min. Remaining 25 % received second injection with the same technique but with less volume after which the percent of patients with adequate akinesia rose to 91 %. Adequate analgesia developed in almost all patients and only in one patient, intravenous analgesia was necessary to complete the operation. All operations were completed uneventfully. No perforations or penetrations were recorded and no other major complications were encountered. About 97 % of the surgeons and 96 % of the patients found the operative conditions satisfactory.

40|$|Background: Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and {{nephrocalcinosis}} (FHHNC) is a rare, {{autosomal recessive}} condition caused by mutations in CLDN 16 or CLDN 19, which encode for tight junction proteins, claudin- 16 and claudin- 19, respectively. This condition often has a delayed diagnosis {{in patients with}} no prior family history {{due to a lack}} of specific clinical symptoms. Description of case, diagnosis, and treatment: A 4 -year, 10 -month-old Caucasian boy presented with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and ocular findings consisting of horizontal nystagmus, bilateral macular <b>staphylomas,</b> and high myopia. Laboratory studies revealed hypercalciuria, hypomagnesemia, and renal insufficiency. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral small kidneys with medullary nephrocalcinosis. Candidate gene sequencing performed at age 7 years identified a novel, homozygous, frameshift mutation c. 140 _ 141 delAT (p. Tyr 47 Stop) within CLDN 19, confirming the molecular diagnosis of FHHNC. Due to rapid renal progression, the proband underwent renal transplant at age 10 years, 10 months. FHHNC was prenatally diagnosed in the proband's sister, who was found at birth to have ocular findings and hypomagnesemia. In addition, she had feeding intolerance and persistent hypoglycemia with hyperinsulinism that has required chronic diazoxide therapy. Conclusions: Although rare, FHHNC should be suspected in patients who present with nephrocalcinosis in the setting of congenital eye anomalies...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{safety of}} chronic {{implantation}} of a retinal prosthesis in the suprachoroidal space {{has not been}} established. This study aimed to determine {{the safety of a}} wide-field suprachoroidal electrode array following chronic implantation using histopathologic techniques and electroretinography. METHODS: A platinum electrode array in a wide silicone substrate was implanted unilaterally in the suprachoroidal space in adult cats (n = 7). The lead and connector were tunneled out of the orbit and positioned subcutaneously. Postsurgical recovery was assessed using fundus photography and electroretinography (ERG). Following 3 months of passive implantation, the animals were terminated and the eyes assessed for the pathologic response to implantation. RESULTS: The implant was mechanically stable in the suprachoroidal space {{during the course of the}} study. The implanted eye showed a transient increase in ERG response amplitude at 2 weeks, which returned to normal by 3 months. Pigmentary changes were observed at the distal end of the implant, near the optic disc. Histopathologic assessment revealed a largely intact retina and a thin fibrous capsule around the suprachoroidal implant cavity. The foreign body response was minimal, with sporadic presence of macrophages and no active inflammation. All implanted eyes were negative for bacterial or fungal infections. A midgrade granuloma and thick fibrous buildup surrounded the extraocular cable. Scleral closure was maintained in six of seven eyes. There were no <b>staphylomas</b> or choroidal incarceration. CONCLUSIONS: A wide-field retinal prosthesis was stable and well tolerated during long-term suprachoroidal implantation in a cat model. The surgical approach was reproducible and overall safe.

5000|$|Degenerative myopia, {{also known}} as malignant, pathological, or {{progressive}} myopia, is characterized by posterior sclera elongation and thinning (at least 25.5 mm to 26.5 mm) and high refractive errors of at least -5 to -7.5 diopters with an increase per year. [...] There may also be changes in the fundus, including posterior <b>staphyloma,</b> caused by the eye growing posteriorly and losing its spherical shape. [...] Since enlargement of the eye does not progress at a uniform rate, abnormal protrusions of uveal tissue may occur through weak points in the eye. <b>Staphyloma</b> {{is marked by a}} thinning of sclera collagen bundles and decreased number of collagen striations. It correlates with a large posterior temporal bulge. Curtin described five varieties, based on size, shape, and change in appearance of the optic nerve and retinal vessels, but the posterior pole type is the most common. [...] As the posterior <b>staphyloma</b> enlarges, choroidal tissue becomes thin and Bruch's membrane begins to break, creating lesions called lacquer cracks. Neovascularization may occur, causing blood vessels to protrude through the cracks and leak in the space underneath the photoreceptor cell layer. This hemorrhaging can lead to scarring and macular degeneration, causing vision to gradually deteriorate. [...] If left untreated, high myopia can cause retinal detachment, glaucoma, and a higher risk of cataracts.|$|E

It is an ectasia of pseudocornea ( [...] the scar formed from organised exudates and fibrous tissue covered with epithelium) which results after sloughing of cornea with iris plastered behind, it is known as anterior <b>staphyloma.</b>|$|E
50|$|The surgery aims {{to cover}} the {{thinning}} posterior pole with a supportive material to withstand intraocular pressure and prevent further progression of the posterior <b>staphyloma.</b> The strain is reduced, although damage from the pathological process cannot be reversed.

50|$|Degenerative myopia, {{also known}} as malignant, pathological, or {{progressive}} myopia, is characterized by marked fundus changes, such as posterior <b>staphyloma,</b> and associated with a high refractive error and subnormal visual acuity after correction.

50|$|A <b>staphyloma</b> is an {{abnormal}} protrusion of the uveal tissue through a weak {{point in the}} eyeball. The protrusion is generally black in colour, due to the inner layers of the eye. It occurs due to weakening of outer layer of eye (cornea or sclera) by an inflammatory or degenerative condition. It may be of 5 types, depending on the location on the eyeball (bulbus oculi).|$|E
5000|$|The {{condition}} of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> in high myopia was first described by Scarpa in the 1800s. Speculation about reinforcement {{of the eye}} began in the 19th century, when Rubin noted that sclera reinforcement “is probably {{the only one of}} all the surgical techniques myopia which attempts to correct a cause, rather than an effect”. [...] Procedures in early literature aimed at shortening the length of the eyeball by resecting a ring of sclera from the equator of the eye. [...] Later procedures focused on modifying the axial length of the eye, by preventing elongation and <b>staphyloma</b> progression by placing grafts over the posterior part of the eye. In 1930, Shevelev proposed the idea of transplantation of fascia lata for sclera reinforcement. [...] Curtin promoted the use of donor-sclera grafting for reinforcement. [...] In 1976, Momose first introduced Lyodura, a material derived from processed cadaver dura mater. [...] At this point, many different surgeons made alterations to existing techniques. Snyder and Thompson modified reinforcement techniques and had positive outcomes, while others, like Curtin and Whitmore, expressed dissatisfaction with their negative conclusions.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} was first practiced by Herman Knapp in 1884. Here, 2% xylocaine is {{introduced into the}} muscle cone behind the eyeball. The injection is usually given through the inferior fornix of {{the skin of the}} outer part of the lower lid when the eye is in primary gaze. The ciliary nerves, ciliary ganglion, oculomotor nerve and abducens nerve are anesthetized in retrobulbar block. As a result, global akinesia, anaesthesia and analgesia are produced. The superior oblique muscle, which is outside the muscle cone, is not usually paralyzed. The complications of retrobulbar block are globe perforation, optic nerve injury, retrobulbar haemorrhage and extraocular muscle palsy. Retrobulbar anaesthesia is contraindicated in posterior <b>staphyloma,</b> high axial myopia and enopthalmos.|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} varies, but {{the most}} severe form results in an enlarged disc where vessels exit from the periphery instead of the center. Redundant fibroglial tissue also is seen in severe cases. Milder forms of dysplasia exhibit missing portions of the optic disc located in the optic nerve pit. The least severe form of papillorenal disease shown in the eye is the exiting of blood vessels from the periphery that do not disturb {{the shape of the}} eye. Other eye malformations include scleral <b>staphyloma,</b> which is the bulging of the eye wall. There can also be retinal thinning and myopia. Additionally, there can be an optic nerve cyst, which is dilation of the optic nerve posterior to the globe; which most likely results from incomplete regression of the primordial optic stalk and the filling of this area with fluid. Retinal coloboma is also common, which is characterized by the absence of retinal tissue in the nasal ventral portion of the retina. However, this is an extremely rare finding.|$|E

The air pump which was a simple idea of using an aquarium fish pump to increase the fluid into the eye in bimanual phaco and co-axial phaco has helped prevent surge. This built the basis of various techniques of forced infusion for small incision cataract surgery. He was also the first to use trypan blue for staining epiretinal membranes and publishing the details in his 4 volume textbook of ophthalmology. He has also discovered a new refractive error called Aberropia. He has also been the first to do a combined surgery of microphakonit (700 micron cataract surgery) with a 25 gauge vitrectomy in the same patient thus having the smallest incisions possible for cataract and vitrectomy. He is also the first surgeon to implant a new mirror telescopic IOL (LMI) for patients suffering from age related macular degeneration. He has also been the first in the world to implant a Glued IOL. In this a PC IOL is fixed in an eye without any capsules using fibrin glue. The Malyugin ring for small pupil cataract surgery was also modified by him as the Agarwal modification of the Malyugin ring for miotic pupil cataract surgeries with posterior capsular defects.

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} study the {{morphological}} characteristics of myopic posterior <b>staphyloma</b> in Caucasians and to evaluate the correlation between posterior <b>staphyloma,</b> myopic macular lesions and visual acuity. Methods: Ninety eyes of 67 consecutive patients affected by high myopia associated with posterior <b>staphyloma</b> were recruited between January 2012 and December 2013. Posterior <b>staphyloma</b> was classified according to Curtin’s criteria. Every patient underwent fundoscopic examination and best corrected visual acuity measurement (BCVA). A and B-scan ultrasound (US), high-resolution, three-dimensional magnetic resonance image (MRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), red free (RF) and color fundus photography studies were performed. Results: The mean age was 64. 4 ± 9. 48 years (range: 41 – 82). The mean BCVA was 0. 7 ± 0. 5 logMAR (range: 0 – 2). The mean axial length was 29. 92 ± 2. 39 millimeters (range: 24. 25 - 36. 53). The authors found four types of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> according to Curtin’s classification: I, II, IV and IX. Significant prevalence of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> in female sex was observed (p = 0. 0235). Significant correlation between the depth and the diameters of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> was demonstrated (p < 0. 0001). Significant association between posterior <b>staphyloma</b> type and tomographic foveal patterns (p = 0. 0230) was highlighted. Posterior <b>staphyloma</b> type I was more frequently associated with peripapillary atrophy and less with macular atrophy compared to type II and IX (p = 0. 0169). The prevalence of macular atrophy was more than double in posterior <b>staphyloma</b> type II (33. 3 %) in comparison to posterior <b>staphyloma</b> type I (12. 5 %). Conclusions: This study confirms that the type I and II {{are the most common}} types of posterior <b>staphyloma,</b> as already highlighted in the literature. A significant association between the type of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> and the MRI ocular shape pattern, the OCT patterns of macular profile and the location of chorioretinal atrophy was highlighted. The correlation between the depth and the width of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> has demonstrated that the deeper the <b>staphyloma,</b> the wider it was. The deepest area of the posterior <b>staphyloma</b> was characterized by a greater thinning of the sclera and by a higher prevalence of chorioretinal atrophy compared to the other parts of the eye. More studies are necessary to support our findings and to add more information on the natural evolution of posterior <b>staphyloma</b> and on its associated complications...|$|E
40|$|We report seven {{cases of}} subretinal neovascularisation with {{inferior}} posterior <b>staphyloma.</b> The upper {{border of the}} shallow <b>staphyloma,</b> detected by B-mode echography, invaded the macular area, {{and there was a}} neovascular net {{at the edge of the}} <b>staphyloma.</b> Three of the cases showed chorioretinal atrophy at the upper edge of the <b>staphyloma</b> in the same location as the neovascular net. Our cases were identical to those of subretinal neovascularisation in high myopic eyes in which the rupture of Bruch's membrane was related to the deformity of the scleral shell. As our cases included not-high-myopic eyes, the results suggest that the identical mechanism might be involved in the occurrence of neovascular maculopathy in the pathological high myopic eye and in the not-high-myopic eye with posterior <b>staphyloma.</b> Localised inferior posterior <b>staphyloma</b> may be an important cause of 'idiopathic' subretinal neovascularisation...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 250 myopic {{patients}} with posterior <b>staphyloma</b> affecting {{one or both}} eyes received a complete ocular examination including binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy, refraction, and axial length measurement. Ten types of <b>staphyloma</b> were noted; five primary and five compound. The primary <b>staphyloma</b> involved the posterior pole (Type I), macular area (Type II), peripapillary area (Type III), the fundus nasal to the disc (Type IV) and the area below the disc (Type V). Compound staphylomas consisted of combined primary staphylomas or distinctive and complex variations of a primary <b>staphyloma,</b> usually Type I.
