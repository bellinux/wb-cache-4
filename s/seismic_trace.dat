By phase shifting the recorded trace by 90 degrees, we can obtain the imaginary part of the complex trace. The complex <b>seismic</b> <b>trace</b> is a complex function whose real and imaginary part are the previously mentioned. From the complex trace, one can now define seismic attributes such as the complex amplitude, phase, instantaneous phase and instantaneous frequency.|$|E
30|$|After obtaining {{vectorized}} scanned <b>seismic</b> <b>traces,</b> it {{is necessary}} to carry out some corrections, such as the geometry of the recording system, deconvolution with the instrument response, etc. One of the major problems with the historical seismograms is the curvatures on vectorized <b>seismic</b> <b>traces,</b> which {{is the result of the}} mechanism of needle mounted on a finite-length pivoting arm of mechanical seismometer. In such a case, the abscissa of the seismogram cannot be obtained as linear function of time (Grabrovec and Allegretti 1994). In this study, the geometrical distortions such as the pen curvature, uneven paper speed and skew on <b>seismic</b> <b>traces</b> have been corrected by applying the formula of Grabrovec and Allegretti (1994) and Samardjieva et al.

40|$|Time-shift {{estimation}} between arrivals in two <b>seismic</b> <b>traces</b> {{before and}} after a velocity perturbation is a crucial step in many seismic methods. The accuracy of the estimated velocity perturbation location and amplitude depend on this time shift. Windowed cross-correlation and trace stretching are two techniques commonly used to estimate local time shifts in seismic signals. In the work presented here we implement Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to estimate the warping function – a vector of local time shifts that globally minimizes the misfit between two <b>seismic</b> <b>traces.</b> We compare all three methods using acoustic numerical experiments. We show that DTW is comparable to or {{better than the other}} two methods when the velocity perturbation is homogeneous and the signal-to-noise ratio is high. When the signal-to-noise ratio is low, we find that DTW and windowed cross-correlation are more accurate than the stretching method. Finally, we show that the DTW algorithm has good time resolution when identifying small differences in the <b>seismic</b> <b>traces</b> for a model with an isolated velocity perturbation. These results impact current methods that utilize not only time shifts between (multiply) scattered waves, but also amplitude and decoherence measurements...|$|R

50|$|The {{deterministic}} {{nature of}} linear inversion requires a functional relationship which models, {{in terms of}} the earth model parameters, the seismic variable to be inverted. This functional relationship is some mathematical model derived from the fundamental laws of physics and is more often called a forward model. The aim of the technique is to minimize a function which is dependent on the difference between the convolution of the forward model with a source wavelet and the field collected <b>seismic</b> <b>trace.</b> As in the field of optimization, this function to be minimized is called the objective function and in convectional inverse modeling, is simply the difference between the convolved forward model and the <b>seismic</b> <b>trace.</b> As earlier mentioned, different types of variables can be inverted for but for clarity, these variables will be referred to as the impedance series of the earth model.

50|$|Hale (1981) {{found that}} the inverse Q filter overcompensated the amplitudes for the later events in a <b>seismic</b> <b>trace.</b> Therefore, {{in order to obtain}} {{reasonable}} amplitude, the amplitude spectrum of the computed filter has to be clipped at some maximum gain to prevent undue amplitude at later times.

The solution is based on the theory of wavefield downward continuation. In this outline here I will compute on a clipped version by introducing low-pass filtering.

40|$|Seismic methods play a {{key role}} in {{exploration}} and reservoir characterization of the offshore Newfoundland Hibernia oil field. Seismic data is traditionally processed to image continuous reflections rather than to image discontinuities such as faults. Thus, when interpreting such 3 D seismic data it is often difficult to obtain a clear and unbiased view of faults. Due to the complex structure of offshore Newfoundland fields, fault imaging is extremely important since field production may be affected by sealing faults, and may effect hydrocarbon production and development strategies. [...] In recent years, companies have produced algorithms for enhanced fault detection. The edge detection differencing method, as presented by Lou et al., (1996), measures changes in the subsurface such as faults using differencing of <b>seismic</b> <b>traces.</b> The C 1 coherency algorithm, as described by Marfurt et al., (1998), uses cross-correlation between <b>seismic</b> <b>traces.</b> Another method used for fault detection is second derivative maps which take the second derivative of the <b>seismic</b> <b>traces.</b> [...] The main objective of the this study is to compare different fault detection algorithms using both synthetic (Kelly, 1998) and real seismic data from the Hibernia fields (1991 and 1997 surveys).
