5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E

2500|$|The casual {{format of}} Gacaca {{has led to}} many legal criticisms of the format which include the following: no right to a lawyer, no right to be presumed {{innocent}} until proven otherwise, no right to be informed of charges being brought against you, no right to case/defense preparation time, no {{right to be present}} at one's own trial, no right to confront witnesses, no right against self incrimination, no right against double jeopardy, no right against arbitrary arrest and detention, and furthermore, there is vast evidence of corruption among officials. [...] "You have to give money. Gacaca judges are not paid so they make arrangements to get money from those who are accused," [...] <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> accused of genocide who said he had paid a bribe to Gacaca judges. The lack of legal representation is, in the majority, a result of the genocide itself wherein {{the vast majority of people}} of such professions were casualties. This brings, perhaps, the biggest issue of Gacaca: the lack of legal representation. Gacaca functions using [...] "people of integrity" [...] as judges, lawyers, and the jury. Not only are some of these people perpetrators themselves, but the lack of financial compensation for the position and the lack of training make them susceptible to bribery and to leading unfair trials.|$|E
