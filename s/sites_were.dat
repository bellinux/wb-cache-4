5|$|As Apollo 14 was {{an early}} Apollo mission, landing <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> {{restricted}} to equatorial regions for technical reasons. After Apollo 12 demonstrated the ability to land at a pre-specified landing zone, mission planners considered landings in rough, but geologically interesting areas of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Madagascar's three established sites, a further seven sites {{are listed as}} tentative and are under consideration by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for elevation to official status. Five initial <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> inscribed on the tentative list in 1997: the Betafo Riziculture and Hydraulic Landscape, the Royal Compound of Tsinjoarivo), the Mahafaly Country of Southwestern Madagascar, the Cliff and Caves of Isandra, and Antongona. In 2008, two additional <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> added to the list: Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve (an extension of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana) and the Dry Forests of the Andrefana.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tourists}} <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> disrupted and {{the access}} to the Pyramids was suspended. The resort town of Sharm-el Shaikh, however, remained calm. Chaos was reported at Cairo International Airport, where thousands of stranded and frightened foreigners attempted to evacuate.|$|E

5|$|The {{work was}} {{undertaken}} rapidly, and 24 <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> completed and garrisoned {{by the end}} of 1540, with almost all of the rest finished {{by the end of}} 1543. By the time they were completed, however, the alliance between Charles and Francis had collapsed and the threat of imminent invasion was over.|$|E
5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|All the {{proposals}} were {{reviewed by the}} Welsh Office, who rejected sites due to poor location, accommodation or cost. A shortlist of ten <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> further reviewed, they were; Capital Waterside (now known as Cardiff Waterside), Cardiff City Hall, a site next to County Hall, Bute Square (now known as Callaghan Square), Prospect Place, Cardiff Gate Business Park, Kingsway and the Coal Exchange all in Cardiff, with the HTV site at Culverhouse Cross, and the Guildhall in Swansea.|$|E

5|$|Also, several {{historic}} <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> {{damaged or}} destroyed by Dennis; Angelo's on Ochlockonee Bay, a landmark restaurant, was completely washed away. Beach front cottages on St. Teresa were either {{damaged or destroyed}} and several beach dunes on St. George Island were washed away by the pounding surf. On Holiday Island, several houses and apartment buildings were severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Alternative <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} as temporary holding locations during renovations. In 2005, officials investigated establishing a new temporary site be created {{at the old}} Lake Success location. Brooklyn was also suggested as a temporary site. Another alternative for a temporary headquarters or a new permanent facility was the World Trade Center site. Once again, these plans met resistance both within the UN and from the United States and New York governments and were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 15 was {{the first}} mission in which landing <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> not {{restricted}} to equatorial areas. The Hadley-Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon than had been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating Hadley Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity.|$|E

5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> taken.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, {{it would have been}} possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> rejected. With the Pas de Calais being the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region. But it offered few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome through the development of artificial Mulberry harbours. A series of specialised tanks, nicknamed Hobart's Funnies, were created to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy Campaign, such as scaling sea walls and providing close support on the beach.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State {{joined with}} a pro-gun rights organization, the Second Amendment Foundation, and prevailed {{in a lawsuit}} against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable {{restrictions}} upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.|$|E

Four <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. Niantic had previously been {{a stop on the}} Clamdigger. As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy, $750,000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic. A study will be undertaken to analyze the corridor capacity impacts that the station would bring.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, black mine {{workers at}} various sites in Katanga Province, {{including}} Jadotville and Élisabethville, went on strike, demanding that their pay be increased from 1.50 francs to 2 francs {{to compensate for}} rising living costs. The strike started on 3 December, and {{by the next day}} 1,400 workers had downed tools. All UMHK <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> affected by 9 December. The strike was also fuelled by other grievances against the colonial order and segregation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, most of {{the former}} Overhill <b>sites</b> <b>were</b> {{submerged}} by the impoundment of the Little Tennessee River in a Tennessee Valley Authority project. But, archaeologists conducted extensive excavations prior to this, during which they identified {{most of the}} Overhill towns and extracted thousands of artifacts, helping them develop volumes of invaluable information regarding the region's Cherokee and pre-Cherokee inhabitants. Different cultures of indigenous peoples had lived along the river for 12,000 years.|$|E
