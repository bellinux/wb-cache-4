40|$|The project {{deals with}} the {{development}} of recommendation for collection of municipal solid waste in Cyprus. Project Aim The aim of the project is to propose a new method of collection in order to improve the existing Municipal Solid Waste Management System in Cyprus. Project Research Approach The whole project approach is based on the Epistemological positivisticpragmatism method under the umbrella of Action Research. A complete Action Plan is followed step by step in order to reach the findings. Project Findings • The Stability test, of the refuse collection vehicle (RCV), was found to bemissing as a must for the proper selection of a new purchased RCV; • The improper selection of chassis, creates serious problems such as over weighted trucks; • The RCV should comply with safety regulations of 2001 by the Ministry ofLabour and Social Insurance; • The RCVs manufactured in Cyprus don't comply with the European Standard ofEN 1501 - 1 : 2008; • The plastic 1100 lt bins were found to be the reason of overfilling waste; • Metallic compactors of 10 cubic metres capacity must be used in order toeliminate overfilling; • The use of <b>skip</b> <b>loaders</b> must be implemented, not only because was proved tobe more economical than the use of RCVs, but in order to transfer thecompactors for discharge; Project Recommendations • New method of collection called “Mixed Design” should be used for themunicipal solid waste in Cyprus; • Stop using the 1100 lt bins; • All RCVs shall comply fully with the standard EN 1501 - 1 : 2008; • Upgrading the specifications for the purchase of new RCV and Compactors; • Compactors must be installed in each new building; • A National System for monitoring and control of waste collection, must bedeveloped at the Ministry of Interior and Municipal/Local authorities...|$|E

50|$|A loader {{is a heavy}} {{equipment}} machine used in construction to move aside or load materials such as asphalt, demolition debris, dirt, snow, feed, gravel, logs, raw minerals, recycled material, rock, sand, woodchips, etc. into or onto another type of machinery (such as a dump truck, conveyor belt, feed-hopper, or railroad car). There are many types of loader, which, depending on design and application, are called by various names, including bucket loader, front loader, front-end loader, payloader, scoop, shovel, <b>skip</b> <b>loader,</b> wheel loader, or skid-steer.|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} a {{strength}} analysis of the main frame and loading arms of a <b>skip</b> <b>loader.</b> For a calculation of load states is used a dynamic simulation and its results are used as a boundary conditions for the strength analysis using finite element method (FEM). The results of the analysis is evaluated and on theirs basis are designed a construction improvements. The part of the thesis is drawings documentation of the construction improvements...|$|R
