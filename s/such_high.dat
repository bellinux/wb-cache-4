5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). <b>Such</b> <b>high</b> interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E

5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. Because of <b>such</b> <b>high</b> demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has <b>such</b> <b>high</b> thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.

5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was.

This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at <b>such</b> <b>high</b> speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake <b>such</b> <b>high</b> risks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at <b>such</b> <b>high</b> levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E
5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for <b>such</b> <b>high</b> Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E

5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in <b>such</b> <b>high</b> regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained <b>such</b> <b>high</b> marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa.

The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with <b>such</b> <b>high</b> levels dropped to 2.2%. The main product made of lead {{by the end of the}} 20th century was the lead–acid battery, which posed no direct threat to humans. From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western Bloc grew by a third. The share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E

5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at <b>such</b> <b>high</b> speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
