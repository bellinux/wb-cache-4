50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is akin to}} the use of a lock on a door. A {{radio with}} carrier squelch is {{unlocked}} and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct 'key', in this case a specific digital code. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> systems can overlap; a radio may have (group call) and DTMF individual calling.|$|E
50|$|Tone squelch, {{or other}} forms of <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> is {{sometimes}} used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (co-channel users), <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receive audio for any signal, the audio turns on only {{in the presence of the}} correct <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).|$|E
5000|$|A general option {{setting for}} all MDC systems is to enable or disable an {{acknowledgement}} (ack) data packet. For example, following a <b>selective</b> <b>call,</b> the called radio replies with an ack. This data [...] "handshake" [...] confirms the called radio is powered on, has received and decoded the call. The encoder beeps {{to confirm the}} call got through to the target. In computer-aided dispatch, the encoder/decoder may pass the ack to the dispatch computer system, flagging the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> as having been received by the mobile radio or automatically marking the time of call. The disadvantage of using an ack on busy channels is that more air time is used: roughly double the air time used by the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> data alone. The ack packet takes roughly {{the same amount of}} air time as the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> itself.|$|R
5000|$|Control {{examples}} - For example, function A may be <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode, while function B is the vibrate function. Function C monitors channel 2. D is {{the mode}} {{that is similar}} to a scanner. When the pager is turned on, eight short beeps are heard along with flashing of both LEDs. Holding down the reset button in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode will monitor the channel for any transmission on that channel at that time, or pure static as the squelch is bypassed.|$|R
50|$|The Motorola Minitor is a portable, analog, receive only, voice pager {{typically}} {{carried by}} fire, rescue, and EMS personnel (both volunteer and career) to alert of emergencies. The Minitor, slightly {{smaller than a}} pack of cigarettes, is carried on a person and usually left in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode. When the unit is activated, the pager sounds a tone alert, followed by an announcement from a dispatcher alerting the user of a situation. After activation, the pager remains in monitor mode much like a scanner, and monitors transmissions on that channel until the unit is reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode either manually, or automatically after a set period of time, depending on programming.|$|R
50|$|In {{conventional}} systems, {{units are}} separated into groups by <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> Radios are usually segmented into customers with each customer {{on a separate}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. Systems may use continuous tone-coded squelch system for this purpose. A disadvantage is that conventional systems require the user to disable <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> (to monitor,) {{in order to see}} if another company is talking before using the channel. Conventional systems are usually analog FM.|$|E

50|$|In a conventional, analog {{two-way radio}} system, a {{standard}} radio has noise squelch or carrier squelch which allows a radio to receive all transmissions. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is used to}} address a subset of all two-way radios on a single radio frequency channel. Where more than one user is on the same channel, (co-channel users,) <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> can address a subset of all receivers or can direct a call to a single radio. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> features fit into two major categories: individual calling and group calling. Individual calls generally have longer time-constants: it takes more air-time to call an individual radio unit than to call {{a large group of}} radios.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} associated with distributing an Ada program over a loosely coupled communication network. Some of these problems involve the {{various aspects of the}} distributed rendezvous. The problems addressed involve supporting the delay statement in a <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> and supporting the else clause in a <b>selective</b> <b>call.</b> Most of these difficulties are compounded by the need for an efficient communication system. The difficulties are compounded even more by considering the possibility of hardware faults occurring while the program is running. With a hardware fault tolerant computer system, it is possible to design a distribution scheme and communication software which is efficient and allows Ada semantics to be preserved. An Ada design for the communications software of one such system will be presented, including a description of the services provided in the seven layers of an International Standards Organization (ISO) Open System Interconnect (OSI) model communications system. The system capabilities (hardware and software) that allow this communication system will also be described...|$|R

50|$|In non-critical uses, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} be used to hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments.

5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base {{stations}} often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|E

40|$|Ads on the Internet are {{increasingly}} sold via ad exchanges such as RightMedia, AdECN and Doubleclick Ad Exchange. These exchanges allow real-time bidding, that is, {{each time the}} publisher contacts the exchange, the exchange ``calls out'' to solicit bids from ad networks. This aspect of soliciting bids introduces a novel aspect, in contrast to existing literature. This suggests developing a joint optimization framework which optimizes over the allocation and well as solicitation. We model this <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> out as an online recurrent Bayesian decision framework with bandwidth type constraints. We obtain natural algorithms with bounded performance guarantees for several natural optimization criteria. We show that these results hold under different call out constraint models, and different arrival processes. Interestingly, the paper shows that under MHR assumptions, the expected revenue of generalized second price auction with reserve is constant factor of the expected welfare.

We investigate the influence of the spreading bandwidth on the system performance using the two considered types of Rake receivers.

This optimal bandwidth increases with the number of Rake fingers, and is higher for an SRake than for a PRake. We also investigate the effects of the fading statistics (Rayleigh or Nakagami) on the optimal spreading bandwidth. We find that the optimal spreading bandwidth is approximately the same for both types of fading, but that the actual performance of an SRake can be better or worse in Rayleigh fading (compared to Nakagami), depending on the spreading bandwidth and the number of fingers...|$|R
