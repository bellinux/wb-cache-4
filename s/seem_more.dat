5|$|The {{assumption}} that John of Lydus' figure of 390,000 for the Diocletian's army {{refers to the}} beginning of that emperor's reign is dubious as it would <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> natural for the chronicler to report the army's peak strength under that emperor.|$|E

The paper constructs several hypotheses based on the transaction-cost and resource- dependence approaches, and tests these hypotheses by {{using data from the}} automobile suppliers. Our study shows: (1) the resource-dependence approach <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> effective in explaining EDI adoption, while the transaction-cost approach <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> effective in explaining EDI integration; (2) the transaction-cost approach <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> suited to the US context, while the resource-dependence approach <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> suited to the Japanese context; (3) EDI adoption and EDI integration had positive impacts on EDI performance in the US, suggesting the higher validity of our framework in the US.

Either {{at the outset}} or as an outcome of the story line there is a biologically female character who <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> culturally masculine and a biologically male character who <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> culturally feminine. There is variation in degree and manifestation, {{but it is important}} time and time again.|$|R
5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> fitting for a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E

5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2011, {{the site}} of a former BJ's Wholesale Club in Norcross, Georgia was {{converted}} in appearance to a Costco for shooting. On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> alive).|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make the show <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E

5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fianc√©e, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made him <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards women in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding of the character in his original story.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} the first in the series to feature the {{character}} of Worf, who had previously been a character on , in a central storyline. Due to time restraints in filming, there were edits made to the scripts and the production team were forced to make best use of the cave sets which had been seen on the show previously. The sword itself was created specifically for the episode, and was made to <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> elaborate than the bat'leths previously seen in Star Trek, including hand etchings to make it appear similar to Damascus steel. Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score, including the use of Wagner tubas. Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction, critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{were the}} reigning UEFA Cup champions, they had beaten Belgian team Club Brugge 4‚Äì3 on {{aggregate}} {{to win the}} 1975‚Äì76 UEFA Cup. Liverpool entered the competition as English champions having won the 1975‚Äì76 Football League First Division. They were drawn against the Northern Irish champions Crusaders in the first round. The first leg was a home tie at Anfield, which Liverpool won 2‚Äì0 courtesy of a Phil Neal penalty and a John Toshack goal. The second leg away at Seaview, was won 5‚Äì0 by Liverpool. Four of the goals were scored within nine minutes {{of the end of}} the match, to make the scoreline <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> one-sided than the match actually was. Liverpool won the tie 7‚Äì0 and were drawn against Turkish champions Trabzonspor in the second round. The first leg was played in Turkey at H√ºseyin Avni Aker Stadium. Liverpool's plan was to try to avoid defeat, however that plan failed when Trabzonsor were awarded a penalty midway through the second half. Trabzonspor converted the subsequent penalty and won the match 1‚Äì0. Liverpool recovered in the second leg at Anfield. Three goals early in the first half meant they won the match 3‚Äì0 to win the tie 3‚Äì1 on aggregate and progress to the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Nojima {{was charged}} with writing the {{scenario}} and with unifying the team members' ideas into a cohesive narrative, as Kitase was impressed with his earlier work on the mystery-like Heracles no Eik≈ç III: Kamigami no Chinmoku, an entry in the Glory of Heracles series. To make the characters <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> realistic, Nojima wrote them so they would not unanimously agree, with some raising objections instead: while this inevitably slowed down {{the pace of the}} story, it added depth to the characters. The graphical improvements enabled even relatively bland lines of dialogue to be enhanced. As the inclusion of voice acting would have lead to significant load times, it was decided to be omitted. Another writer who contributed was Masato Kato, who wrote several late-game scenes including the Lifestream sequence and Cloud and Tifa's conversation before the final battle. Initially not involved with the project, he was called upon to help flesh out less important story scenes. He wrote his scenes to his own tastes without outside consultation, something he later regretted.|$|E
5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> realistic.|$|E

5|$|When Philip {{began his}} attack in 349 BC, the Olynthians appealed to Athens for aid. In response, Demosthenes gave {{a series of}} speeches, {{now known as the}} Olynthiacs, {{encouraging}} the Athenians to resist Philip. The period from 351 BC to 346 BC marks the gradual ascendancy of Demosthenes in Athenian politics, as he became leader of the Athenian resistance to Philip. However, exactly when Demosthenes became important is disputed; Cawkwell points out that the chance preservation of a good proportion of Demosthenes's speeches may make him <b>seem</b> <b>more</b> important than he was. In the end, the Athenians decided to send a force of 2000 lightly armed mercenaries (referred to in the sources as peltasts, even if strictly speaking, they were not), and 38 triremes to aid the Olynthians. Of these triremes, 30 were already in service under Chares, possibly operating in the north Aegean; the other 8 were to be crewed by Athenians citizens. However, {{it is not clear whether}} this force achieved anything.|$|E
