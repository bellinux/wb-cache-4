25|$|Upon {{discovery}} {{of gold in}} the South Fork of the American River in 1848, thousands of gold seekers going west passed near the basin {{on their way to}} the gold fields. European civilization first made its mark in the Lake Tahoe basin with the 1858 {{discovery of}} the Comstock Lode, a <b>silver</b> <b>deposit</b> just 15 miles (24km) to the east in Virginia City, Nevada. From 1858 until about 1890, logging in the basin supplied large timbers to shore up the underground workings of the Comstock mines. The logging was so extensive that loggers cut down almost all of the native forest.|$|E

40|$|The {{localization}} of histones was studied ultrastructurally {{with the}} use of the ammoniacal silver stain in erythroid precursors from 6 patients with chronic erythremic myelosis (Di Guglielmo syndrome), 3 patients with severe untreated pernicious anemia, 2 patients with untreated autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and 4 presumedly normal individuals. <b>Silver</b> <b>deposits,</b> indicative of sites of arginine-rich histone within nuclei, were not observed in proerythroblasts from any of the individuals. Small <b>deposits</b> of <b>silver</b> were seen in the heterochromatin in very early intermediate normoblasts. Differences in the amount and distribution of the <b>silver</b> <b>deposits</b> in the various types of erythroid precursors first became recognizable in the intermediate normoblast stage. In all of the individuals, the <b>silver</b> <b>deposits</b> were localized predominantly in the heterochromatic regions of the nucleus. In 6 patients with chronic erythremic myelosis, unusually, dense <b>deposits</b> of <b>silver</b> were observed in erythroid precursors having amounts of heterochromatin comparable to that found in intermediate normoblasts of intermediate megaloblasts in other conditions. In these chronic erythremic myelosis erythroid precursors, the <b>silver</b> <b>deposits</b> were larger and, in many instances, appeared to be more aggregated than in erythroid precursors obtained from 3 patients with untreated pernicious anemia, 2 patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and 4 presumedly normal persons. It is possible that the findings described in this study are involved in the pathogenesis of megaloblastoid erythropoiesis as found in chronic erythremic myelosis...|$|R
