40|$|Glufosinate {{efficacy}} {{was examined}} in two major grass weed species, rigid ryegrass and <b>sterile</b> <b>oat.</b> Dose–response pot experiments under controlled environmental conditions showed that <b>sterile</b> <b>oat</b> was more successfully controlled by glufosinate than was rigid ryegrass. Glutamine synthetase was extracted from both species and assayed in vitro. Glufosinate readily inhibited glutamine synthetase activity in both species, indicating no differential {{sensitivity to the}} target enzyme. Thin-layer chromatography analysis of glufosinate showed no significant metabolism of glufosinate in either species. Absorption and translocation studies with 14 C-glufosinate showed that the radiolabel was rapidly absorbed into the leaves of both species. However, translocation of radiolabeled glufosinate from the treated leaf to the meristematic regions was significantly greater in <b>sterile</b> <b>oat,</b> whereas translocation {{to the tip of}} the leaf was significantly greater in rigid ryegrass. This indicates that there is a difference in glufosinate distribution between the two species. It is likely that this difference in the distribution of glufosinate results in <b>sterile</b> <b>oat</b> being more easily controlled by glufosinate than is rigid ryegrass. Anuja R.

40|$|Avena sterilis (<b>sterile</b> <b>oat)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extended}} and harmful weeds in Mediterranean cereal crops. A process-based niche model for this species was developed using CLIMEX. The model was validated and used to assess the potential distribution of A. sterilis in Europe under the current climate and under two climate change scenarios. Both scenarios represent contrasting temporal patterns of economic development and CO 2 emissions. The projections under current climate conditions indicated that A. sterilis does not occupy the full extent of the climatically suitable habitat available to it in Europe. Under future climate scenarios, the model projection showed a gradual advance of <b>sterile</b> <b>oat</b> towards Northeastern Europe and a contraction in Southern Europe. The infested potential area increases from the current 45. 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} manage weed infestations in a {{spatially}} precise manner will rely {{on the availability of}} efficient methods of mapping weed distributions. We have conducted a study designed to compare four different ground based methods for collecting georeferenced information on <b>sterile</b> wild <b>oat</b> infestation in a winter barley crop. Sampling was done at harvest time (when wild oat panicles are most visible) by scoring panicle density, either from the ground or from a combine, by counting panicle contacts by an observer walking through field transects or by sampling wild oat seed rain on the ground. Although the four methods tested provided similar descriptions of the spatial distribution of this weed, they differed in their costs (considering both, the cost of sampling and the cost of wrong decissions). Defining the location of weed patches from the combine appears to be a relatively cheap and reliable method for the creation of weed management maps {{to be used in the}} following season...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sterile</b> wild <b>oat</b> (Avena sterilis L.) is an autogamous grass {{established}} in warm climate regions. This species {{has been used}} as a cover crop in Mediterranean perennial crops during the spring period prior to initiating competition with the main crop for water and nutrients. However, such cover crops need to be controlled (by glyphosate or tillage) before the beginning of summer period (due to the possibility of intense drought stress). In 2011, the olive grove farmers of southern Spain expressed dissatisfaction because of the ineffective control with glyphosate on A. sterilis. Experiments were conducted to determine whether the continued use of glyphosate over a 5 year period had selected a new resistant or tolerant species. The GR 50 values obtained for A. sterilis were 297. 12 and 245. 23 g ae ha- 1 for exposed (E) and un-exposed (UE) glyphosate accessions, respectively. The spray retention and shikimic acid accumulation exhibited a non-significant difference between the two accessions. The results of 14 C- glyphosate absorption was the same in the two accessions (E and UE), while the translocation from the treated leaf to the rest of the shoots and roots was similar in A. sterilis accessions. Glyphosate metabolism to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and glyoxylate was similar in both accessions, but increased after treatment with glyphosate, indicating that metabolism plays an important role in tolerance. Both A. sterilis accessions, present similarity in the 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) activity enzyme with different glyphosate concentrations and without glyphosate, confirming that both accessions present the same genomic characteristics. The above-mentioned results indicate that innate tolerance to glyphosate in A. sterilis is probably and partly due to reduced herbicide absorption and translocation and metabolism compared to the susceptibility of other grasses weeds like Chloris inflata, Eleusine indica and Lolium rigidum...|$|R
40|$|Trabajo presentado en el 6 th International Weed Science Congress, celebrado en Hangzhou (China) del 17 al 22 de junio de 2012. Global Climate Change is a {{major concern}} for the future {{sustainability}} of our development. There will be large alterations over the global ecosystems, where predictions indicate a reduction around 10 - 20 % of world agrosystems production. Climate change might have a deep effect on crop protection. Especially affected would be the weed flora, altering the competitive interaction crop-weed, impacting on weed biodiversity and on weed geographic distribution. Avena sterilis L. (<b>sterile</b> <b>oat)</b> {{is one of the most}} extended and harmful specie in Mediterranean climate. The emergence of <b>sterile</b> <b>oat</b> is very dependent of temperature and rainfall. Therefore, it is very likely that geographic distribution of A. sterilis might be affected by climate change. The objective of this study was to simulate the effect of various climate change scenarios. A specie niche model for A. sterilis was developed using CLIMEX. The model calibration was done with eco-physiological data from the literature and was validated with independent data worldwide. Two contrasting climate scenarios were used to project the potential distribution of A. sterilis in Europe under future climate: A 2 representing a low-emission scenario and B 2 a high-emission scenario. Under both future climate change scenarios, the range of suitable climate for <b>sterile</b> <b>oat</b> in Europe is projected to extend further from Mediterranean regions northward in Scandinavia, Ireland and England and eastward into east Europe (balcanians countries). In contrary, countries in the Mediterranean area, from Portugal to Greece will become unsuitable under the low-emission scenario (B 2 scenario) and mostly unsuitable for persistence under the highemission scenario (A 2 scenario).

40|$|The {{effect of}} five {{adjuvants}} (non-ionic surfactant, paraffinic oil, vegetable oil, mixture of fatty acids methyl esters plus surfactant blend, and organosilicone) on diquat efficacy was assessed on poverty brome, <b>sterile</b> <b>oat,</b> and Italian ryegrass in field and pot experiments. All tank mixtures with diquat increased diquat efficacy from 50 - 54 % to 77 - 98 % as for fresh weight reduction, indicating significant enhancement of diquat efficacy on grasses. The increased efficacy {{was most likely}} attributed to better droplet retention and diffusion on the leaf surfaces. When combined with non-ionic surfactant, diquat showed slightly more rapid control of grass weeds (i. e. symptoms were visible {{within a few hours}} after application) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oat</b> <b>sterile</b> dwarf virus (OSDV) subviral {{particles}} (SVPs) were purified from {{roots and}} stem bases of Lolium multifiorum. Electron microscopy of the prepara-tions showed B-spiked SVPs typical of Fijiviruses (Fiji disease and maize rough dwarf-like viruses). Two sera with titres in gel-diffusion tests of 1 / 512 and I/ 2 O 48 were prepared against he SVPs. The sera did not react with the SVPs of maize rough dwarf and pangola stunt viruses when tested by gel-diffusion and immuno-electron microscopy. The first serum did not react with virus dsRNA or poly (1). poly(C) {{and the second}} serum had a titre of I/ 8 with each of these. Poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the nucleic acid from purified OSDV SVPs re-vealed ten dsRNA segments though only nine of these were resolved as separate bands in dsRNA extracted irectly from infected plants. The genome pattern was broadlysimilar to but distinct {{from those of the}} known Fijiviruses. The RNA of the serologicatly related Arrhenatherum blue dwarf virus (ABDV), extracted i-rectly from plants, appeared i entical to that extracted irectly from OSDV-infected plants. Both OSDV and ABDV were transmitted by the planthopper vector Javesella pellucida despite, in the case of OSDV, having been maintained in vegetatively propagated plants for 5 years...|$|R
40|$|Sequence {{determination}} of full-length cDNA clones of genomic segments 7 – 10 (S 7 –S 10) of <b>oat</b> <b>sterile</b> dwarf fijivirus (OSDV) {{revealed that the}} 5 � and 3 � ends of the plus strands of these segments had the same conserved terminal sequences, 5 � AACGAAAAA and UUUUUUUAGUC 3 �. These sequences are similar, but not identical, to the conserved terminal nucleotide sequences of the genomic segments of rice black streaked dwarf fijivirus (RBSDV) and maize rough dwarf fijivirus (MRDV). The coding strands of S 7 and S 10 each contained two large nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs), as do RBSDV S 7 and S 9, MRDV S 6 and S 8 and Nilaparvata lugens reovirus (NLRV; a putative member of Fiji-virus) S 9. These results strongly suggest that the dicistronic nature of certain genomic segments is characteristic of fijiviruses. Computer analyses revealed sequence homology between RBSDV S 7 ORF 2, MRDV S 6 ORF 2 and OSDV S 7 ORF 2, suggesting that this protein is conserved among plant fijiviruses. No counterparts {{were found in the}} genome of NLRV, which is a nonphytopathogenic insect reovirus. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees derived from multiple sequence alignments of each of the homologous proteins from OSDV, RBSDV, MRDV and NLRV suggest that NLRV did not evolve fro...|$|R
40|$|A {{widespread}} {{disease of}} pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) and summer grass (D. ciliaris) in south-eastern Queensland {{was characterized by}} a bunched and stunted growth habit, yellow or red discolouration of the foliage, seed heads with crimped, distorted racemes, and sometimes premature plant death. Virus-like particles present in extracts of diseased plants were unstable, 50 - 70 nm in diameter, had a core and outer coat and were morphologically similar to particles of viruses in the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae. The particles were shown by immune electron microscopy to be serologically closely related to pangola stunt and maize rough dwarf viruses, but unrelated to <b>oat</b> <b>sterile</b> dwarf virus. Similar virus-like particles were observed in crystalline arrays in ultrathin sections of cells in vein enations of D. ciliaris. Extracts of diseased pangola grass and summer grass contained 10 double-stranded RNA species, which were somewhat similar in size to those reported for pangola stunt virus. A planthopper, Sogatella kolophon, which {{is related to the}} South American vector of pangola stunt virus, S. furcifera, was associated with diseased pangola grass and summer grass in the field, and was shown to be a vector. However, efforts to infect maize, a major host of maize rough dwarf virus, were unsuccessful. On the basis of these properties the Australian virus is considered to be pangola stunt virus...|$|R
40|$|Wheat dwarf virus (WDV; family Geminiviridae, genus Mastrevirus) is a {{single-stranded}} DNA virus {{transmitted by}} the leafhopper Psammotettix alienus and it periodically causes severe damage to winter wheat in Sweden. WDV is {{also present in}} large parts of Europe. Two strains of WDV are known, the wheat strain and the barley strain. To get {{better understanding of the}} genetic diversity of WDV in Sweden and compare to the situation {{in the rest of the}} world, several isolates from wheat, triticale, wild grasses and the insect vector were collected and partially sequenced. All isolates collected in Sweden were shown to belong to the wheat strain of WDV. From Turkey and Hungary, two barley strain isolates were collected and complete genome sequences were determined. WDV infection in wild grasses was shown to occur only sporadically in Swedish grasslands, even in samples collected adjacent to heavily infected winter wheat fields. This indicates that wild grasses are not important as a primary source of WDV for the insect vector. Infected grasses might instead act as virus reservoirs, enabling WDV to prevail without winter wheat. The diversity of the Swedish wheat strain isolates and available international isolates was shown to be low. In phylogenetic analyses, no clear grouping could be seen according to geographical origin or host. The partial sequences of barley strain isolates grouped into three distinct clades: one Central-European clade with isolates from Germany, Hungary and Czech Republic, one clade with isolates from Spain and one clade with the Turkish isolates. For future studies on the host specificity determinants of the two WDV strains, infectious clones, transmissible by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, were constructed. The infectious clone of the barley strain was constructed from the Hungarian isolate WDV-Bar[HU]. The clone WDV-Bar[HU] was shown to infect barley, oat and rye. The biological activity of the barley infectious clone was further confirmed by insect transmission and typical WDV particles were visualised by electron microscopy. An infectious clone was also constructed for a Swedish wheat strain isolate and was confirmed to be able to infect wheat. PCR-based techniques were developed for rapid detection of WDV and <b>Oat</b> <b>sterile</b> dwarf virus in their respective insect vectors. The methods will be useful when trying to predict the risk of virus infection in cereal fields...|$|R
