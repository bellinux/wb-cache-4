5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a single <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had <b>shot</b> <b>this</b> idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In June 2010, McDowell won the Celtic Manor Wales Open {{by three}} <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> was his fifth European win.|$|R
5000|$|In Round 16, Geelong beat Collingwood {{despite having}} fifteen fewer scoring <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> equalled Richmond's record against Fitzroy from 1957.|$|R
5|$|Nineteen runners {{completed}} the course, including {{three of the}} six 100/1 <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> was {{the highest number of}} finishers since 2005 when twenty-one horses passed the finishing post.|$|R
5|$|York {{picked up}} their first {{points of the}} season after they beat Yeovil Town 1–0 at home, in which Berrett scored in the 63rd minute with a {{deflected}} 20-yard <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> {{was followed by a}} 0–0 away draw with Exeter City, in which Zubar was carried off injured. Following the match, Lindon Meikle was released by mutual consent, having failed to make a matchday squad in the first five matches of the season. York were beaten 3–0 away by Swansea City of the Premier League in the League Cup third round, with Nathan Dyer, Matt Grimes and Marvin Emnes scoring their goals. Zubar returned to Bournemouth after he suffered cruciate ligament damage during the Exeter match. Platt was loaned to National League North team Harrogate Town for three months. Thompson gave York a sixth-minute lead with a close-range finish in a home match against Mansfield Town. The away team scored twice later in the first half through Matt Green, and York lost the match 2–1.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Gisele meets Pierre {{the next}} day when she is picking up a {{painting}} where he spots odd behavior in her such as writing with the wrong hand, which leads him to return to her castle to investigate further. Gisele begins growing ill from her previous experiment and calls upon Professor Julian to aid her. As he leaves, Joseph awakens in Julian's lab. Pierre triggers an alarm which has him race out the castle where he meets the disoriented Joseph. Pierre takes Joseph to the police station where he reveals he was the kidnapper of the young women but the people in the castle are the real murderers. The police arrive looking for Marguerite but only find Gisele who denies any knowledge of Joseph. Pierre and the police explore the castle without finding clues. On leaving, Gisele begins transforming back into Marguerite before their eyes prompting for an emergency search of the castle. A gun battle ensues between Professor Du Grands assistant and the police leaving the assistant and Professor Du Grand <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> leads the police to open his grave where they find Lorette. Lorette is sent home and Inspector Chantal reveals that Giselle confessed to the crimes and died shortly after.|$|E
5000|$|Fewer total extracts: Relative {{proportions}} aside, fewer total coffee compounds—caffeine {{being just}} one—are extracted into ristrettos versus full length <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> {{is an important}} factor when diluting shots into water or milk.|$|R
5000|$|In Round 4, Richmond {{defeated}} Fitzroy by 15 points {{despite having}} fifteen fewer scoring <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> remains the greatest deficit in scoring shots by a winning side, though equalled by Geelong against Collingwood in 1977.|$|R
50|$|Although certain players {{may wish}} to bank their <b>shots,</b> <b>this</b> is deemed un-sportsman-like and is {{generally}} frowned upon, {{with the exception of}} ladies golf. Golf tournaments held for charity may sell mulligans to collect more money for the charity.|$|R
5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and shot it down — its landing gear dropped {{down and it}} rolled over and into a mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen had gone off to scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have <b>shot</b> <b>this</b> down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E
25|$|Ablett's footballing ability {{soon came}} on notice again, {{this time to}} the Geelong Football Club and their long-time {{recruiting}} officer Bill McMaster. McMaster convinced Ablett to give the game another <b>shot,</b> <b>this</b> time {{in the confines of}} the rural city of Geelong. After protracted negotiations with Hawthorn, Geelong finally paid a $60,000 transfer for Ablett in 1984.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Toho {{issued a}} {{restored}} laserdisc incorporating the rediscovery of a reel of 35mm trims of the deleted footage. The resultant quality was {{far superior to}} previous reconstructions, but not perfect; an abrupt cut caused by missing frames at the beginning or end of a trim is evident whenever the master switches between the Champion cut and a 35mm trim within the same <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> laserdisc master was utilized for Toho's 2001 DVD release with few changes.|$|E
50|$|Two {{videos were}} <b>shot</b> for <b>this</b> song.|$|R
50|$|Some Bollywood {{movies like}} Love Ke Liye Kuchh Bhi Karega, Shootout at Wadala, and Manmohan Desai's 1985 movie Mard, Zamana Deewana, Khalnayak, Shatranj, and Tarazu were <b>shot</b> at <b>this</b> {{location}}. Many episodes {{of the popular}} serial Chandrakanta and CID have been <b>shot</b> in <b>this</b> location also.|$|R
5000|$|On video: [...] "Lately, I’ve been {{interested}} in movement. I sense the need for movement within my <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> video is composed of images identical to photos; there is no story to follow. It is {{a moment in time}} like a photo in which the subjects move." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{winning the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Ricky Steamboat at WrestleWar, Ric Flair became a fan {{favorite}} as he showed respect to Steamboat after the match. Flair began a rivalry with Terry Funk because Funk attacked Flair for turning down Funk's challenge for a title <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> {{resulted in a}} severe potentially career-ending injury for Flair. On July 1 edition of World Championship Wrestling, Flair {{announced that he would}} not retire and agreed to defend the title against Funk at The Great American Bash. Flair defeated Funk to retain the title.|$|E
25|$|Greensome (also {{known as}} Scotch Foursomes): also called {{modified}} alternate <b>shot,</b> <b>this</b> is played in pairs; both players tee off, and then pick {{the best shot}} as in a scramble. The player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome. A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.|$|E
25|$|The airlift mission {{arrived on}} station on 31 March 1958. In four days, they {{finished}} their assignment. Then, {{before they could}} depart, they found themselves charged with another phase of Booster <b>Shot.</b> <b>This</b> had its difficulties. Although prepared for their initial task, the 483rd was unready for operations beyond that. Some of their aircraft were coming due for maintenance; two were scheduled for immediate care in Japan after returning from the planned week's exercise. Additionally, the second phase cargo lists were still being gathered from disparate U.S. agencies in Laos. Obsolete maps caused problems locating drop zones.|$|E
50|$|Big Shots Bonus EP is a {{follow-up}} album to Charizma & Peanut Butter Wolf's Big Shots album. Similar to Big <b>Shots,</b> <b>this</b> album is produced entirely by PB Wolf, however it includes tracks {{that were not}} on the former album. This album was released only in vinyl format.|$|R
50|$|Josie and the Pussycats {{contains}} placements {{in most of}} the <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> {{appears to}} be done ironically, as the plot of the film revolves around subliminal messages in advertising. The film's general message can also be construed as an anti-consumerist one. The film neither sought nor received compensation for the placements.|$|R

25|$|The cannonade and {{bombardment}} commenced at 14:30, {{and continued}} without intermission till sunset. The attack was renewed on the following, and on every succeeding day until the 9th, {{when it was}} resolved at a council of war, for sufficient reasons, to return immediately to Spain. In the course of these attacks 3732 mortar shells and 3833 rounds of shot were discharged by the Spaniards, and the Algerines returned 399 mortar shells and 11,284 rounds of <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> vast expenditure of ammunition produced no corresponding effect on either side: the town was repeatedly set on fire, but the flames were soon subdued.|$|E
25|$|In {{highlighting}} {{the severity of}} the Free State's execution policy, however, {{it is important not to}} exaggerate its extent. The Free State took a total of over 12,000 Republicans prisoner during the war, of whom roughly 80, less than 1% were executed. How those who were executed were chosen from the others captured in arms is unclear; however, many more men were sentenced to the death penalty than were actually <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> was intended to act as a deterrent to anti-Treaty fighters in the field, who knew that their imprisoned comrades were likely to be executed if they kept up their armed campaign.|$|E
25|$|Two {{helicopter}}s, {{one from}} the police, and another {{one from the}} army, flew over the plaza. Around 5:55 P.M. red flares were shot from the nearby S.R.E. (Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations) tower. Around 6:15 P.M. another two flares were <b>shot,</b> <b>this</b> time from a helicopter (one was green and another one was red) as 5,000 soldiers, 200 tankettes and trucks surrounded the plaza. Much of what proceeded after the first shots were fired in the plaza remained ill-defined for decades after 1968. Records and information released by American and Mexican government sources since 2000 have enabled researchers to study the events and draw new conclusions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, the visual effects {{supervisors}} were Dan Glass and Ryan Urban, {{the latter of}} whom held the title of digital effects supervisor during the first season. Technicolor were again responsible for managing dailies and color grading the show, while their VFX department delivered over 600 <b>shots</b> <b>this</b> time around.|$|R
50|$|An unusual study (Project MORAINE) {{suggests}} mounting an RMK 30 gun in a retractable mast on a Type 212 submarine. Such masts {{would extend}} {{the capabilities of}} submarines, which currently lack appropriate means to fight small surface targets or just give warning <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> study has directly led to the Muraena concept.|$|R
5000|$|Kurland {{was known}} to leap above the rim to grab opponents' <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> led to the NCAA banning {{defensive}} goaltending in 1945. Kurland {{was also the first}} person to regularly dunk during games. The rivalry between him and De Paul's George Mikan would foreshadow similar matchups, especially those of basketball's [...] "big men." ...|$|R
25|$|Basket interference, or goaltending is a {{violation}} charged when a player illegally interferes with a <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless {{it is obvious that}} the ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot. When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, the basket is awarded. If an offensive player commits the infraction, the basket is cancelled. In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.|$|E
25|$|Finnish coastal {{artillery}} made {{modifications to}} the gun mountings during the interwar period. The most significant of these was inverting the gun so that the recuperating spring {{was on top of}} the gun which allowed increasing the maximum elevation and thus the range. Inverting the gun however required also strengthening the recuperator, adding an equilibrator to correct the changed balance and other changes to the mounting and elevation mechanism. Increased maximum elevation also allowed using the gun as an anti-aircraft weapon. To increase maximum range even more the ammunition for the guns was modified by adding a ballistic cap to existing ammunition which increased the range by a factor of 1.5. Additionally Finns changed the gun loading practice to allow reloading without the need to return the gun to zero elevation after each <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> practice increased the rate of fire.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, in some upland areas, foxes were flushed by {{packs of}} dogs to be <b>shot.</b> <b>This</b> {{activity}} is still permitted in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. However MPs, in making law for England and Wales, {{decided that this}} activity did result in unnecessary suffering, not least {{because it is more}} difficult to control a large number of hounds in dense woodland where this activity used to take place. On Wednesday, 15 July 2015, the current Conservative Government are proposing Amendments to the Act, after realising they had only a slender chance of Repealing it. The amendments will be voted upon by a free vote, after just one hour's debate in the House of Commons. One of the key amendments is the flushing out of foxes, for them to be shot to death. Whilst this might sometimes prevent the foxes from being attacked by hounds, it is conceivable such attacks will happen, especially with dogs having previously been trained to do so.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} shots used {{can be quite}} large; in certain game types, players {{routinely}} fire 3000+ <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> will give an accuracy rate of perhaps 5%. This seemingly low amount {{is a result of}} constant firing and dodging, as players are not directly penalized for missed shots. The average is 6% ratio of accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while {{simultaneously}} changing direction, {{on each of}} its next six holes, among hillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including gorse and whins, to severely punish offline <b>shots.</b> <b>This</b> sector, with two blind tee shots on the tenth and 11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes.|$|R
