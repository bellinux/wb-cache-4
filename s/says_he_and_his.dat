If they refuse, then we will raise our hands." [...] Lok Prabha editor Pravin Tokekar said: [...] "The MNS chief has technically not made any inflammatory statement. Even when he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse, he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se". On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E

2500|$|Less subtle was {{the racism}} at school, where Clark <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister got into fights with schoolmates {{in the first}} grade who called them “niggers” and “cottonheads”. [...] Adding to his sense of {{identity}} confusion was the fact that African Americans did not accept him either, and called him and his sister “wiggers”, on which Clark comments, “It’s real unsettling when you’re young and don’t know which group you belong to.” [...] Today, Clark reflects on his multiethnic heritage with pride, and says he wishes more people were open-minded about interracial dating, saying, “Our family could claim to be the ultimate melting pot,” and that being of so many different ethnicities gave him the ability to [...] "adapt to any situation".|$|E

6000|$|... 23. Morning. It is {{a terrible}} rainy day, and rained prodigiously on Saturday night. Patrick lay out last night, and is not yet returned: faith, poor Presto is a desolate creature; neither servant, nor linen, nor anything.--Night. Lord Forbes's man has brought back my portmantua, and Patrick is come; so I am in Christian circumstances: I shall hardly commit such a frolic again. I just crept out to Mrs. Van's, and dined, and stayed there the afternoon: it has rained all this day. Windsor is a delicious place: I never saw it before, except for an hour about {{seventeen}} years ago. Walls has been here in my absence, I suppose, to take his leave; for he designed not to stay above five days in London. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife will come here for some months next year; and, in short, he dares not stay now for fear of her.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] Cissie asked. [...] "He {{knew that}} we must be {{thinking}} about it, and why shouldn't I say it? and I am glad I did, for if I had not spoken perhaps {{he would not have}} alluded to the matter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> told me that whatever other people might <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mother were quite sure that Mr. Partridge did not take the money." ...|$|R
