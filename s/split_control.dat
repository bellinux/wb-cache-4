40|$|Abstract. Optimal <b>controlled</b> <b>splitting</b> is an {{emergency}} strategy to split the power system into several sub-regions based on global electrical information before {{the collapse of the}} system which is subject to severe disturbances. How to seek the optimal splitting sections rapidly and accurately is a key problem in <b>controlled</b> <b>splitting</b> field. A <b>controlled</b> <b>splitting</b> scheme based on layer expanding graph algorithm is presented in this paper. Firstly, source nodes of island regions extend out for the formation of the island regions. Secondly, island regions can be combined to make up synchronous sub-regions {{on the basis of the}} clustering of generators. At last, the optimal sections can be determined according to the initial and improved adjustment of splitting sections. Moreover, the scheme proposed can be adapt to the change of operation mode of the power system. The accuracy and effectiveness of the scheme is shown by the simulation results of CEPRI 36 -bus system...|$|R

40|$|Optical mode-splitting is an {{efficient}} tool to shape and fine-tune the spectral response of resonant nanophotonic devices. The active control of mode-splitting, however, is either small or accompanied by undesired resonance shifts, often {{much larger than}} the resonance-splitting. We report a control mechanism that enables reconfigurable and widely tunable mode-splitting while efficiently mitigating undesired resonance shifts. This is achieved by actively controlling the excitation of counter-traveling modes in coupled resonators. The transition from a large splitting (80 GHz) to a single-notch resonance is demonstrated using low power microheaters (35 mW). We show that the spurious resonance-shift in our device is only limited by thermal crosstalk and resonance-shift-free <b>splitting</b> <b>control</b> may be achieved.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{interaction}} model for augmented environments based on the concept of mixed initiative interaction, and describe the design of the Pendle, a gesture-based wearable device.

The Pendle is a personalizable wearable device with the capability to recognize hand gestures. It acts as mediator between user and environment, and provides a simple, natural interface that lends itself to casual interaction. Experiences with two concrete examples, the MusicPendle and NewsPendle, demonstrate the advantages of the personalized user experience and the flexibility of the device architecture. 1...|$|R

Therefore, we propose a novel architecture of a distributed SDN controller in this paper, providing maximum flexibility with respect to distribution. Our architecture <b>splits</b> <b>control</b> logic into light-weight control modules, called controllets, based on a micro-kernel approach, reducing common controllet functionality to a bare minimum and factoring out all higher-level functionality. Light-weight controllets also allow for pushing control logic onto switches to minimize latency and communication overhead. Controllets are interconnected through a message bus supporting the publish/subscribe communication paradigm with specific extensions for content-based OpenFlow message filtering. Publish/subscribe allows for complete decoupling of controllets to further facilitate control plane distribution...|$|R

Austria now dropped to the second rank among the Great Powers. Emperor Napoleon III of France could not tolerate the rapid rise of Prussia, and started the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 over trivialities. The spirit of German nationalism caused the smaller German states (such as Bavaria and Saxony) to join the war alongside Prussia. The German coalition won an easy victory, dropping France to second class status among the Great Powers. Prussia, under Otto von Bismarck, then brought together almost all the German states (excluding Austria, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein) into a new German Empire.
