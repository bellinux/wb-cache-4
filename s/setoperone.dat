50|$|<b>Setoperone</b> is a {{compound}} {{that is a}} ligand to the 5-HT2A receptor.It can be radiolabeled with the radioisotope fluorine-18 and used as a radioligand with positron emission tomography (PET).Several research studies have used the radiolabeled <b>setoperone</b> in neuroimaging for the studying neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depressionor schizophrenia.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} D- 2 {{dopamine}} (DA) receptor blockade were mod ulated by ICI 169, 369, a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HTh receptor antagonist, and by other 5 -HT 2 antagonists. Specifically, {{it appears that}} blockade of 5 -HT 2 receptors can attenuate the effects of D- 2 receptor blockade on rat stnatal dopaminergic transmission. Thus, the blockade of D- 2 receptors by halopendol results in a compensatory increase in rat stnatal DA metabolism, which is enhanced by lCl 169, 369. By itself, ICI 169, 369 did not significantly alter DA metabolism. Conversely, several corn pounds which possess appreciable activity at 5 -HT 2 sites in ex vivo binding assays, but possess little activity at D- 2 sites (i. e., pirenperone, <b>setoperone,</b> fluperlapine and clozapine), all pro duced large increases in striatal DA metabolism. Therefore, {{these data suggest that}} the 5 -HT 2 component of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Within-session {{decrements}} in instrumental responding are {{a characteristic}} effect of certain neuroleptic drugs including hal-operidol and pimozide. There is little consensus, however, {{as to whether}} these effects can best be explained as motivational or motor deficits. A number of recently developed drugs {{have been described as}} atypical antipsychotics and are claimed to produce fewer motor side effects than more traditional neuro-leptics. Little work has been done to investigate whether such atypical agents also give rise to within-session response dec-rements. The present experiment used the operant responding of rats to study the effects of a range of antipsychotic drugs. Rats were trained to lever press for food dunng daily sessions (FRi 0 schedule) and responding was recorded during each 3 -mm period of the 1 5 -mm sessions. Dose-related decreases in overall response rates were produced by all the drugs studied; ED 5 O values were: haloperidol 0. 1 7 mg/kg, nspendone 0. 18 mg/kg, <b>setoperone</b> 0. 23 mg/kg, remoxipnde 1. 2 mg/kg, sertin-dole 4. 8 mg/kg, thioridazine 7. 6 mg/kg, clozapine 8. 9 mg/kg...|$|E
40|$|Using [F- 18]setoperone and {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET), alterations in serotonergic 5 -HT 2 receptor binding were studied in cerebral cortex of nine unmedicated patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and 37 healthy controls. The kinetics of unchanged radioligand in plasma and F- 18 -radioactivity in blood and brain were obtained for 90 min following tracer injection. The specific binding of [F- 18]setoperone to 5 -HT 2 receptors in the cerebral cortex was quantitated by subtraction using cerebellum as reference. In controls, {{a significant reduction in}} specific binding was associated with age and similar linear regression slopes were obtained in all the cortical regions studied. No significant difference was observed between patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls in the injected mass of <b>setoperone,</b> percentage of unmetabolized [F- 18]setoperone in plasma, F- 18 -radioactivity in blood fractions and cerebellar F- 18 -radioactivity concentration, indicating similar non-specific brain kinetics and metabolism of the radioligand. In contrast, there was a significant reduction in specific [F- 18]setoperone binding in the cerebral cortex in patients with Alzheimer's disease relative to control values (temporal, 69 %; frontal, 69 %; parietal, 55 %; temporo-parietal, 54 %; occipital cortex, 35 %). The results demonstrate that the loss in 5 -HT 2 receptor binding in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, long documented by post-mortem studies, can now be assessed in vivo using PET...|$|E
