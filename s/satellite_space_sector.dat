40|$|Space… Does space really matter? As {{more and}} more turn towards a <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> economy to aid them in {{developing}} their countries, to improve economic growth {{and the quality of}} life from telecommunications and broadcasting to satellites for climate change, agriculture, conserving natural resources to urban planning and anticipating natural disasters, we in Africa should be asking: How can we benefit? Of what potential impact and value would developing a <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> economy be? How has it assisted us so far? This paper therefore advocates, that the future of emerging African nations is not constrained to the stereotypical, outdated economic model of the past but through the myriad economic opportunities through trade, employment, expenditure, economic activity, investment and other chances offered by <b>satellites,</b> <b>space</b> research, technology, projects such as MeerKAT, SALT, the VBLI and the SKA, that if we are to ensure the economic sovereignty of our nations and continent, if we are ever to benefit from space research and technology, that the future lies in developing a <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> economy in Africa. It provides an overview history of existing African space accomplishments, the purpose and value of the African space economy, space agencies and facilities, their research and technology. It seeks to further pinpoint a methodology capable of assessing the economic impact of space through existing space agency efforts primarily for South Africa as the main African space economy participant but also for countries such as Algeria, Nigeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Ghana, Kenya and others, to inspire Africans to invest and believe that we too can benefit from space, as a historically neglected area of research. It aspires to a partial cost-benefit analysis to ultimately determine the future prospects and impact of developing this <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> economy in Africa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyses}} some specific conditions for {{innovation in the}} European <b>space</b> <b>sector.</b> Innovation has been a key parameter since the first steps into space. On the other hand, the <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> lacks key parameters encouraging innovation. While governments have put in place instruments to overcome these deficiencies, the current mechanisms seem to address mainly incremental/sustaining innovation. It is argued that this situation might be leaving the <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> potentially prone to changes coming through radical and disruptive innovation. Applying mechanisms developed for understanding disruptive innovation processes in the private sector, two specific current developments in the <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> are analysed...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of satellite-enabled applications to society, geographical discussions of the <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> have been dominated by accounts of the geopolitics ‘up there’, without due consideration of the industry driving the use of space ‘down here’. As a result, the geography of the <b>space</b> <b>sector,</b> and the interactions between the agents and institutions involved, have been overlooked in the academic literature. To address this ‘silence’, this thesis explores the competitiveness, organisation and governance of the UK <b>space</b> <b>sector.</b> The primary {{method of data collection}} for this thesis was eighty semi-structured interviews with representatives from the UK <b>space</b> <b>sector.</b> The conceptual framework integrated economic and geopolitical concepts on competitiveness, organisation and governance. Key findings of this thesis include: (i) orbital slots and frequency spectrum are competitive assets, which highlight the verticality of our economy; (ii) heritage is a source of competitiveness, which can cause technological lock-in; (iii) different segments within the UK <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> manage their own production projects, which are linked by buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs); (iv) BSRs are influenced by buyers, contracts, technology, time and geography; and (v) the governance of the UK <b>space</b> <b>sector</b> is multi-centric, with a dominance of regulatory forms...|$|R

We undertake an econometric evaluation {{of the degree of}} scale economies in satellite operations and calibrate a Cournot model of competition in which the effect of liberalization is modelled as the segmentation of national markets that currently prevails. We conclude that existing players in the satellite operations industry would make negative profits under liberalization. We find that four players would break even and operate close to the minimum efficient scale (of about ten satellites). We also conclude that some consolidation is required in the production of satellites. In both cases it seems that intervention by a supra-national authority like the EC Commission would be useful.
