5|$|The largest {{study to}} date {{followed}} {{over a thousand}} people for eight years; it showed an 87% increased risk of death compared to the normal population. Predictors of higher risk were: female sex, absence of treatment for <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency, younger age {{at the time of}} diagnosis, and a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Apart from cardiovascular disease, this study also showed an increased risk of death from lung disease.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{motivation is}} influenced by hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin. In most mammalian species, <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> control the ability to engage in sexual behaviours. However, <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> do not directly regulate the ability to copulate in primates (including humans). Rather, <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> in primates are only one influence on the motivation to engage in sexual behaviours.|$|R
50|$|BPA can disrupt normal, {{physiological}} {{levels of}} <b>sex</b> <b>hormones.</b> It does this by binding to globulins that normally bind to <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> such as androgens and estrogens, {{leading to the}} disruption of the balance between the two. BPA can also affect the metabolism or the catabolism of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones.</b> It often acts as an antiandrogen or as an estrogen, which can cause disruptions in gonadal development and sperm production.|$|R

40|$|Context:: Steroid <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> and SHBG may modify {{metabolism}} and diabetes risk, with implications for sex-specific diabetes risk {{and effects of}} prevention interventions. Objective:: This study aimed to evaluate the relationships of steroid <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> SHBG and SHBG single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with diabetes risk factors and with progression to diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Design and Setting:: This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial involving 27 U. S. academic institutions. Participants:: The study included 2898 DPP participants: 969 men, 948 premenopausal women not taking exogenous <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> 550 postmenopausal women not taking exogenous <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> and 431 postmenopausal women taking exogenous <b>sex</b> <b>hormones.</b> Interventions:: Participants were randomized to receive intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin, or placebo. Main Outcomes:: Associations of steroid <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> SHBG, and SHBG SNPs with glycemia and diabetes risk factors, and with incident diabetes over median 3. 0 years (maximum, 5. 0 y). Results:: T and DHT were inversely associated with fasting glucose in men, and estrone sulfate was directly associated with 2 -hour post-challenge glucose in men and premenopausal women. SHBG was associated with fasting glucose in premenopausal women not taking exogenous <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> and in postmenopausal women taking exogenous <b>sex</b> <b>hormones,</b> {{but not in the}} other groups. Diabetes incidence was directly associated with estrone and estradiol and inversely with T in men; the association with T was lost after adjustment for waist circumference. Sex steroids were not associated with diabetes outcomes in women. SHBG and SHBG SNPs did not predict incident diabetes in the DPP population. Conclusions:: Estrogens and T predicted diabetes risk in men but not in women. SHBG and its polymorphisms did not predict risk in men or women. Diabetes risk is more potently determined by obesity and glycemia than by <b>sex</b> <b>hormones...</b>|$|R

5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones.</b> This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> (androgens) into female <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> (estrogens).|$|R
40|$|We use {{fluctuations}} {{of female}} <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> occurring naturally over the menstrual cycle or induced by hormonal contraceptives {{to determine the}} importance of <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> in explaining gender differences in competitiveness. Participants in a laboratory experiment solve a simple arithmetics task first under a piece rate and then under a competitive tournament scheme. Subjects can then choose which compensation scheme to apply in a third round. We find that <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have a strong effect on whether women select into the competitive environment. The observed patterns are consistent with a negative impact especially of progesterone on competitiveness and our results therefore provide a partial biological explanation for gender differences in competitiveness. We consider three possible indirect pathways through which <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> could affect competitiveness: via an impact on risk aversion, via an impact on performance, and via an impact on overconfidence. None of these hold up to the data and we conclude that <b>sex</b> <b>hormones</b> have a more direct impact on competitiveness. competitiveness, gender differences, hormones, lab experiment...|$|R

25|$|Testosterone is {{observed}} in most vertebrates. Testosterone and the classical nuclear androgen receptor {{first appeared in}} gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Agnathans (jawless vertebrates) such as lampreys don't produce testosterone but instead use androstenedione as a male <b>sex</b> <b>hormone.</b> Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone. The presence of these ubiquitous steroids {{in a wide range}} of animals suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|Further {{variability}} {{is introduced}} by the degree of enzyme inefficiency produced by the specific alleles each patient has.

25|$|DHT {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Adolf Butenandt {{and his colleagues}} in 1935. It was prepared via hydrogenation of testosterone, which had been discovered earlier that year. DHT was introduced for medical use as an AAS in 1953, and was noted to be more potent than testosterone but with reduced androgenicity. It was not elucidated to be an endogenous substance until 1956, when it was shown to be formed from testosterone in rat liver homogenates. The biological importance of DHT was not realized until the early 1960s, when it {{was found to be}} produced by 5α-reductase from circulating testosterone in target tissues like the prostate gland and seminal vesicles and was found to be more potent than testosterone in bioassays. The biological functions of DHT in humans became much more clearly defined upon the discovery and characterization of 5α-reductase type II deficiency in 1974. DHT was the last major <b>sex</b> <b>hormone,</b> the others being testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, to be discovered, and is unique in that it is the only major <b>sex</b> <b>hormone</b> that functions principally as an intracrine and paracrine hormone rather than as an endocrine hormone.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other forms}} of neutering, vasectomy and tubal {{ligation}} eliminate the ability to produce offspring.

25|$|Estradiol is {{produced}} especially within the follicles {{of the female}} ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and nonendocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from cholesterol {{through a series of}} chemical intermediates. One principal pathway involves the generation of androstenedione, which is converted into estrone by aromatase and then by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into estradiol. Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into testosterone, an androgen and the primary male <b>sex</b> <b>hormone,</b> which in turn can be aromatized into estradiol.|$|E
