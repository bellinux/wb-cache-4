She later extended these studies to examine in detail the vegetational history of the Lake District. This work is remarkable for its palynological detail and field <b>sampling</b> <b>programme,</b> and for the clear correlations which emerged between vegetational history, climatic history and man's occupation of the area.From this work Dr. Tutin developed pioneering palaeolimnological studies of Lake District lakes, and demonstrated how chemical studies of lake sediments revealed much about the vegetation and soil history of catchments. She later extended this field of study to lakes in northern Scotland. This work has proved very stimulating and productive and is now of fundamental importance. More recently Dr. Tutin has been concerned with applying absolute pollen frequency methods, palaeomagnetic dating methods and tracer element studies to palaeolimnological problems.

40|$|Integrated geophysical, geochemical and hydrogeological {{modelling}} {{techniques have}} been used in this PhD research study to characterise the ground contamination at four study sites. The primary aim of the research is to study the efficiency of using an integrated approach to study hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination in the subsurface soil, geology and groundwater systems. Each of the four sites have different industrial legacies (hence types of contamination) and periods of operation. The sites in increasing age are: Bromsgrove landfill, Cathays Railway Depot, Barry Docks and Weston-Super-Mare gasworks. The geophysical methods used in this study are Electrical Resistivity imaging (IRIS) and multifrequency ground conductivity (Gem- 2). These techniques can map the electrical properties of the sub-surface in both 2 D and 3 D. The electrical properties are then compared with independent professional geochemical <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> for both soil and groundwater. The results of this project show that the geophysical methods provide a clear indication of the zones of ground contamination (hydrocarbons and heavy metals) in both 2 D and 3 D. Electrical resistivity/conductivity mapping using both independent techniques show consistent results. The geophysical results also show a good correlation with the geochemical <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> for soil, water and gas. The results are encouraging in that geophysics could be used more widely in professional contaminated land site investigations to supplement conventional invasive techniques and <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes.</b> The research has also investigated whether geophysical parameters such as electrical conductivity {{could be used as a}} groundwater modelling parameter in the Visual Modflow software. The advantage being that geophysics can provide a high intensity of data in 3 D and even temporal 4 D at a site. The geophysical results can define an accurate spatial distribution of the contaminated area. This can be used to assign a ‘concentration recharge’ in the modelling compared to the normal practice of using chemical data from a small number of discrete sampling points. However this approach will still require chemical data for validation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|Diamonds {{were first}} {{discovered}} on the Koffiefontein farm in 1870. Mining {{started in the}} form of small claims that were later amalgamated into Koffiefontein Mine Limited. De Beers acquired control of Koffiefontein Mine Limited in 1911. Mining operations were then continuous until the advent of the Great Depression in 1932 when work was suspended. Between 1950 and 1953, a prospecting shaft was sunk which was followed by limited production. The mine was reopened in 1970 and preparations for increased production were completed in August 1971. Immediately after completing the preparations, production from the open pit commenced and proceeded to a depth of 270 metres. Underground development started in 1974 through a <b>sampling</b> <b>programme.</b> Underground production briefly took place in 1982 but ceased soon thereafter due to the 1981 slump in the diamond market. These operations were resumed in March 1987. During the period 1972 to the end of 2004, approximately 69.5 million tonnes of kimberlite ore were mined and 6.1 million carats of diamonds were recovered. In February 2006, De Beers ceased mining when the old order mining right for Koffiefontein expired and in July of that year Petra Diamonds commenced operating the mine under care and maintenance conditions. The acquisition of the mine was completed in July 2007 and Petra Diamonds was subsequently able to commence diamond recoveries by starting to process the stockpile through the plant.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of {{effluent}} discharges {{from industrial}} establishments discharging directly into municipality sewers {{is one of}} the major water pollution control activities conducted by municipalities. For largely industrialised municipalities the task can be quite expensive and not effective if <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes</b> are not properly designed. In most cases samples are randomly collected without proper knowledge of the discharge patterns of various industries. As a result the information obtained does not give a good reflection of the quality of effluent being discharged. These problems can be resolved by adapting a statistical approach to the design of <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes.</b> This approach is useful in determining the frequency of sampling, the number of samples needed to estimate the average concentration of target pollution indicator parameters and the magnitude of the uncertainty involved. The benefits and applications of this approach are demonstrated by a case study presented in this paper. It was found that the number of samples and cost of sample analysis can be greatly reduced by the use of systematic instead of random sampling. The statistical approach greatly improves the estimate of monthly means of pollution indicator parameters and is an effective approach for pollution control when coupled with the “polluter pays principle”...|$|R
40|$|Kimberlite and lamproite {{exploration}} programmes {{have traditionally}} been underpinned by systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes,</b> aimed at identifying anomalous concentrations of kimberlite indicator minerals (KIMs) proximal to the host rocks. These 'pathfinders', which typically include {{one or more of}} the phases ilmenite, eclogitic and peridotitic garnets, chromite, Cr-rich diopside, occasionally olivine, and sometimes diamond, tend to concentrate as a lag halo around the source rocks because of their relatively high densities compared to more abundant crustal minerals such as quartz and feldspar [...] Dispersion of the KIMs away from the parent rocks by processes such as fluvial and glacial transport, and longshore currents in lacustrine or marine environments, typically results in decreasing concentrations away from the source. However, distal re-concentration of pathfinder minerals may occur in geomorphic settings which act as traps or sinks for relatively dense phases. It is important to distinguish between proximal and distal pathfinder concentrations at an early stage, not only because of the time and cost associated with <b>sampling</b> <b>programmes,</b> but also with the view to planning ongoing exploration to locate the ultimate source rocks. This study highlights some of the typical characteristics of distal KIM anomalies within the Kalahari environment with reference to a major kimberlitic garnet anomaly located in the southwestern Makgadikgadi basin in northern Botswana...|$|R
