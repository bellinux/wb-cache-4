25|$|On Biryukova's 29th birthday, {{in early}} 2010, she was briefly {{committed}} to a mental hospital {{for the first of}} three times, after telling Solomon she had dreamed of killing the children. There, she was diagnosed with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); however psychiatrists did not believe that rendered her unfit to parent a child and she would later deny that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> diagnosed. Shortly after she got out, her husband filed for divorce.|$|E
500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous {{you can hold your}} hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
6000|$|Diana couldn't {{remember}} when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> completely nonplused before. After an involuntary gasp she answered quietly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> cruel, {{knowing his}} condition? She might, with woman's tact, have {{rejected}} him less abruptly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew Polly <b>was</b> {{plotting}} mischief, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> quiet lately," [...] muttered Ned, eying {{his little}} brother with lofty scorn.|$|R
6000|$|... "It has seemed, further," [...] went on Leo, reddening, [...] "that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> good as {{to look on}} me with--some undeserved regard." ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{too quick}} in this petulant sally against 'Pa's lodger'; {{and she felt}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> when she met his quiet look.|$|E
60|$|Elspeth {{being his}} sister--But {{he had promised}} Grizel, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> ill brought up that she said nasty things when you broke your word.|$|E
6000|$|Barbara {{raised to}} her cheek the fingers which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> convulsively embracing. [...] "Don't let her go on, uncle," [...] she whispered, [...] "not just now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You needn't alarm {{yourself}} a bit, Mr Snevellicci,' said Mrs Lillyvick. 'She {{is only a}} little weak and nervous; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> ever since the morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No!' he exclaimed, 'all I say <b>is,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> thrust {{down and}} forced back, that she cannot venture to avow her {{feelings}} even to herself!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor child!" [...] said Miss Wellwood, kindly, {{but looking}} to Mrs. Curtis in her turn. [...] "Perhaps, as <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> ill, the evening might be enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor fellow! She {{had come}} to {{understand}} that feeling. After all, it wasn't altogether his fault that they had met. And <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> cross to him! ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a brief}} {{pause in}} which Lady O'Moy shuddered. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> near to betraying herself. How very quick and shrewd Sylvia was! She made, however, a good recovery.|$|E
60|$|Jill {{turned her}} head away. She {{did not want to}} hurt him, but nothing could have kept her from smiling. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> sure that he would say that sooner or later.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> dangerous, though <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> kind,' sighed Mrs. Malory. 'I have {{observed}} nothing {{to justify the}} talk which I have heard, but I am in doubt.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} you are willingly unjust, or could <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> to any living creature, least of all to her. But I--we--owe her <b>so</b> much; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> patient." ...|$|R
50|$|Lovatts Crosswords are a {{range of}} {{magazines}} sold throughout the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Christine Lovatt is the main cryptic compiler, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> for 30 years.|$|R
60|$|To this Ugolina assented fully, adding, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{shocked by}} the suddenness and horror of the news, as to have become {{perfectly}} incapacitated ever since for any high order of thought.|$|E
60|$|It succeeded beautifully. She had {{not been}} walking a minute before she found herself {{face to face with}} the Red Queen, and full in sight of the hill <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long aiming at.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{kissed her}} when he raised her from the ground on the day when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{consistently}} and expressively forgotten. Quite as he might have kissed her, {{if she had been}} conscious? No difference? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would never}} consent {{to sell the}} things,--not even to you, Bill; and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long {{the head of the}} house that I don't think she would like to--to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|What, already, sir!' said Miggs, {{opening the}} door with a look of surprise. 'We were just getting on our nightcaps to sit up,--me and mistress. Oh, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>SO</b> bad!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After this I don't {{know how}} I'm to trust her. I don't indeed. It {{seems to me}} that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> artful throughout. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a regular case of catching." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel answered, [...] "I guess I {{know where}} it is." [...] He did not mean it for {{anything}} of a joke, but both the girls laughed, and though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> silent before, Statira laughed the most.|$|E
60|$|In fact, Dolly {{had thrown}} herself upon the sofa, quite {{regardless}} {{of all the}} little finery of which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> proud in the morning, and with her face buried in her hands was crying very much.|$|E
60|$|The kiss {{filled him}} with a strange comfort; he led her back to where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> upset. And the dog Balthasar, following, laid the bone {{of one of the}} cutlets they had eaten at their feet.|$|E
5000|$|Patricia Clarkson as Joy Burns, April's mom, who is {{very sick}} with breast cancer, {{who is very}} {{hesitant}} to go to April's home because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> angry at her for so long.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "that Paris, where <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much admired, <b>is</b> {{not a good}} place for her. That is why I <b>am</b> glad that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> gone to London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Katharine," [...] {{said her}} aunt, [...] "come {{up with me}} to your Aunt Jane's room. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much distressed about you, that she will not <b>be</b> easy till <b>she</b> <b>has</b> seen you." ...|$|R
60|$|So she writhed and groaned, {{her hopes}} all pathetically trampled and dust-covered now. Everybody would hear of her idiocy. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{determined}} to do something worth while, and she had read her worst lines, and whistled--whistled like a cow-boy.|$|E
60|$|Agnes {{was taken}} by surprise, and {{remained}} silent. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> carefully trained to tell her father and mother everything, and to trust them, {{that it was a}} new and disagreeable idea to her the thought of doing anything secretly.|$|E
60|$|As for Lucy, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> well {{cared for}} and {{protected}} from the bitter fury of the wind, that, although much exhausted, terrified, and shaken, she was neither so be-numbed nor so helpless as some of her less fortunate companions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's {{been asleep}} all night, and was, all yesterday, {{except for a}} minute or two now and then,' replied John Browdie's choice, 'and I was very sorry when she woke, for <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>SO</b> cross!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Cecilia! How can <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> foolish! He <b>is</b> {{of such a}} {{singular}} temperament that I {{do not know what}} the effect may be. I wish you would think better of it, Sir Francis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Sir Hugo, {{glancing at}} Deronda, [...] "the fact is, it is useless to flatter a bride. We {{give it up}} in despair. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> fed on sweet speeches that every thing we say seems tasteless." ...|$|R
