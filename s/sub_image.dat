The proposed scheme divides a grayscale (or color) image into overlapped 6 × 6 blocks {{each of which}} is partitioned into four small 3 x 3 non-overlapped sub-images. A new spatial approach for efficiently computing 2 -dimensional linear convolution or cross-correlation between suitable flipped and fixed filter coefficients (<b>sub</b> <b>image</b> for cross-correlation) and corresponding input <b>sub</b> <b>image</b> is presented. Computation of convolution is iterated vertically and horizontally {{for each of the four}} input sub-images.

The present algorithm proposes a simplified processing technique based on a particular arrangement of the input samples, spatial filtering and small sub-images. This results in reducing the computational complexity as compared with other well-known FFT-based techniques. This algorithm lends itself for partitioned small sub-images, local image spatial filtering and noise reduction. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through some simulation examples...|$|E

To address this problem very important area of research, the present paper proposes a novel scheme of age classification system using features derived from co-occurrence parameters using Rank based Edge Texture Unit (RETU). The Co-occurrence Matrix (CM) on RETU characterizes {{the relationship between the}} neighbouring edge values, while preserving local information. The novelty of the proposed RETU is it classifies the age of human into seven categories i. e. in the age groups of 1 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, 51 - 60, and greater than 60. The TU of the proposed RETU ranges from 0 to 17 and thus reduces overall complexity in evaluating features from CM. The co occurrence features extracted from the RETU provide complete facial image information for age classification purpose.
