During the 2006-2007 fiscal year, 810,589 customers visited the Library. Circulation was more than 1.4 million, 105,870 reference and information questions were answered, 36,693 children listened to stories and participated in children's programs and 27,342 new books and media items were added to the collection which includes holdings of 300,000, including 210,000 books and 423 periodical subscriptions. The library also provides valuable outreach services through the bookmobile and S.O.S. volunteer program to those in Mountain View, who are unable to come to the main branch. The building was built in 1997. The second floor of the library has a special collection in a room devoted to the history of Mountain View, which features a portrait of Crisanto Castro, for whom the downtown main street is named. [...] The library hosts the Mountain View Reads Together program. Outside the library one can find a piece of the torn down Berlin Wall on display.|$|E

A <b>self-checking</b> circuit consists of a functional circuit, which produces encoded output vectors, and a checker, which checks the output vectors.

A <b>self-checking</b> system consists of an interconnection of <b>self-checking</b> circuits. The advantage of such a system is that errors can be caught as soon as they occur; thus, data contamination is prevented.
