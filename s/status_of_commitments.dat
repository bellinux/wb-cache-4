The mitigation actions are implemented in order to comply with regulatory requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by fulfilling DOE`s commitments under the LEDA MAP. This report contains the following three main sections: Introduction; LEDA MAP scope, schedule and status; and Summary and Recommendations. The Introduction section provides a background regarding the origin and purpose of the LEDA MAP. The LEDA MAP scope, schedule, and status section provides a more detailed description of each mitigation action commitment and the current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> each associated action plan.

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{advancement}} of e-service technology, {{there is a}} need to manage business relationships among business entities such as service providers, service consumers, and internal departments. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to business relationship management using business commitments and associated business commitment hubs. Business commitments are commitments related to business issues such as service levels in service agreements, and terms and conditions in procurement contracts. The concept <b>of</b> business <b>commitments</b> has captured the essence of business relationships in e-services. Based on case studies, we have envisioned the need of establishing a business commitment hub to centrally manage the external relationships with trading partners and the internal relationships with internal departments. A language called Business Commitment Language (BCL) has been proposed to specify business commitments. These business commitments are used to monitor and control the execution <b>status</b> <b>of</b> e-services. Conceptually, the business commitment hub has two related subsystems: the active subsystem and the dashboard subsystem. The active subsystem responds to business events received from business entities. The dashboard subsystem visually displays the key data and the execution <b>status</b> <b>of</b> business <b>commitments.</b> ...|$|R

A survey of the deceptive techniques used by men and women was completed by 62 women and 30 men. Results showed that both men and women believe that men attempt to deceive women about their financial <b>status</b> and level <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> and that women attempt to deceive men about their physical attractiveness.

40|$|Abstract Though {{the use of}} {{pesticides}} has offered significant economic benefits by enhancing the production and yield of food and fibers and the prevention of vector-borne diseases, evidence suggests that their use has adversely affected the health of human populations and the environment. Pesticides have been widely distributed and their traces can be detected {{in all areas of}} the environment (air, water and soil). Despite the ban of DDT and HCH in India, they are still in use, both in domestic and agricultural settings. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the production and consumption of persistent organic pesticides, their maximum residual limit (MRL) and the presence of persistent organic pesticides in multicomponent environmental samples (air, water and soil) from India. In order to highlight the global distribution of persistent organic pesticides and their impact on neighboring countries and regions, the role of persistent organic pesticides in Indian region is reviewed. Based on a review of research papers and modeling simulations, it can be concluded that India {{is one of the major}} contributors of global persistent organic pesticide distribution. This review also considers the health impacts of persistent organic pesticides, the regulatory measures for persistent organic pesticides, and the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> India's <b>commitment</b> towards the elimination of persistent organic pesticides...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of normative pressure within Venture Capital syndicates that lead organizational decision makers to avoid terminating unsuccessful investments, so called ‘escalation of commitment’ or ‘throwing good money after bad’. Venture Capital organizations tend to invest in syndicate form, because of the risk involved in investing in start-up companies. Investing in syndicate form has many advantages, like improving the performance of Venture Capital organizations and increasing the survival chances of the portfolio companies they have invested in. To be invited to join a syndicate, a Venture Capital organization must have a good network, a good reputation and must be reliable. The reputation and reliability of a Venture Capital organization determine the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> a Venture Capital organization. This status plays a role in choosing future syndicate partners. Status can be determined by measuring the position of the organization within a broader network. The more central within the network, the higher the status. Within syndicates the different syndicate parties have to comply with formal and informal rules of engagement. Formal rules are sanctioned by formal contracts. Informal rules are sanctioned by the logic of social obligations. If the accepted informal rule is consistency and decisiveness, like ‘sticking to their guns’, decision makers may feel the pressure to continue investing even after they have received negative feedback. This is called normative pressure. Not all organizations experience the same amount of normative pressure. Some organizations are more sensitive to normative pressure than others, this depends on the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the organization. The literature did not give a clear picture of the influence of normative pressure on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Some scientists claimed that normative pressure has a positive effect on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> where others claimed there was no relationship at all. In the investigation on normative pressure and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> also the role <b>of</b> <b>status</b> was frequently involved. Which role status plays was not clear either. Some studies stated that high status organizations are more sensitive to normative pressure, while other studies stated that high status organizations are less sensitive to normative pressure. This conclusive and contradicting statements suggested further research. A qualitative research was conducted in which 3 Venture Capital syndicates consisting of 8 Venture Capital organizations were investigated. Each Venture Capital syndicate invested in a portfolio company and the presence <b>of</b> escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was determined. Professionals of these Venture Capital organizations were interviewed on the subject of normative pressure. Finally the network of these 8 Venture Capital organizations was mapped out to determine the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> each Venture Capital organization. A positive relationship between normative pressure and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was found. The majority of the Venture Capital organizations stated that there are informal norms like ‘sticking to their guns’ which lead to escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The role <b>of</b> <b>status</b> with regard to this relationship remained unclear, because the organizations which were sensitive to normative pressure showed different levels in status...|$|R
