The influence of bond <b>strength</b> on masonry compressive <b>strength</b> is not fully accounted for in these failure theories. In this investigation, the influence of bond <b>strength</b> on masonry compressive <b>strength</b> has been examined through an experimental program using local bricks and mortars. Masonry prism compressive <b>strength</b> has been determined when the brick-mortar bond <b>strength</b> is varied over a wide range without altering the <b>strength</b> and deformation characteristics of the brick and mortar. Brick-mortar bond <b>strength</b> has been determined through flexure bond <b>strength</b> and shear bond <b>strength</b> tests. A relationship between the masonry prism compressive <b>strength</b> and bond <b>strength</b> has been obtained.

Methods: Thirty-four patients more than 2 years after ulnar and/or median nerve injury. Muscle <b>strength</b> was evaluated using manual muscle <b>strength</b> testing (MMST), grip, pinch and intrinsic muscle <b>strength</b> measurements. Results: Manual muscle <b>strength</b> testing showed that most muscles recover to grade 3 or 4. Average grip <b>strength</b> recovery, as percentage of the uninjured hand, was 83 %. Pinch <b>strength</b> recovery was 75 %, 58 % and 39 % in patients with ulnar, median and combined nerve injuries, respectively. The RIHM measurements revealed a poor recovery of the ulnar nerve innervated muscles in particular (26 - 37 %). No significant correlation (Pearson) {{was found between the}} measurements of the RIHM and grip <b>strength.</b> Pinch <b>strength</b> was significantly correlated with <b>strength</b> of the abduction of thumb and opposition of the thumb <b>strength</b> (r 0. 55 and 0. 72, p = 0. 026, 0. 002) as measured with the RIHM. Conclusion: While manual muscle <b>strength</b> testing and grip <b>strength</b> measurements show a reasonable to good recovery, measurements of the intrinsic muscles by means of the RIHM showed poor recovery of intrinsic muscle <b>strength</b> after peripheral nerve injury. No correlation was found between the recovery of intrinsic muscle <b>strength</b> and grip <b>strength</b> measurements...|$|R

5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act.

A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying <b>strengths</b> and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the relationship of muscular <b>strength</b> with swimming performance. For this purpose, fifteen muscular <b>strength</b> tests and thirteen swimming performance tests were administrated to 153 skilled college male swimmers. The findings are surmmarized as follows; 1) The dynamic <b>strength</b> which was measured by arm-pulls, sit-ups, and squat-jump showed significant correlation with most of swimming performance tests. However, the static <b>strength</b> which was measured by push arm <b>strength,</b> pull arm <b>strength,</b> abdominal <b>strength,</b> and leg <b>strength</b> (up-ward) did not show such correlation. 2) For the crawl stroke, the static <b>strength</b> which Was measured by back <b>strength,</b> grip <b>strength,</b> arm <b>strength,</b> and leg <b>strength</b> (down-Ward) showed no significant correlation with 200 m and/or 400 m swimming performance tests. Significant correlation between the static <b>strength</b> and performances, however, was found for such shorter distances as 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, and/or 200 m. Dynamic <b>strength</b> which was measured by arm-pulls, sit-ups, and squat-jump showed significant correlation with all swimming performance tests from 25 m to 400 m. 3) For the distance of 25 m, the following correlations were statistically significant: the performances in breast stroke with the records in back <b>strength</b> and push arm strength; those of back stroke with leg <b>strength</b> (down-ward) and squat jump; and those of butterfly stroke with squat jump. For the distance of 200 m, however, these correlations were not significant. 4) The performances in butterfly stroke showed significant correlation with sit-ups, arm-pulls, and squat-jump. The same performances, however, did not show any correlation with the static <b>strength</b> which wan measured by back <b>strength,</b> grip <b>strength,</b> arm <b>strength,</b> push arm <b>strength,</b> and leg <b>strength.</b> 5) In 25 m swimming performance tests, the sit-ups did not show significant correlation only with breast stroke, while the push arm <b>strength</b> and vertical jump showed significant correlation only with breast stroke. In 200 m swimming performance tests, the sit-ups did not show significant correlation only with breast stroke, while the vertical jump showed significant correlation only with breast stroke. 6) In 25 m swimming performance test, the arm <b>strength</b> and push-ups showed significant correlation only with crawl stroke. In 200 m swimming performance test, the arm <b>strength,</b> push-ups, and leg <b>strength</b> (down-ward) showed significant correlation only with crawl stroke. 7) The total amount of contribution of all the muscular <b>strength</b> tests to the swimming performance was found highest in the 25 m crawl arm pull (42. 1 %), and lowest in the 200 m breast stroke (17. 1 %). 8) In most of swimming performance tests, more than 70 % of total amount of contribution of all the muscular <b>strength</b> tests can be explained by less than half of all the test items experimented. 9) In case of 25 m breast stroke, 91. 4 % of total amount of contribution of all the muscular <b>strength</b> tests can be explained by five tests; grip <b>strength</b> (left hand), squat-jump, grip <b>strength</b> (right hand), vertical jump, and arm-pulls.
