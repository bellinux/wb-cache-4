The rise of Haidar came at a time of important political developments in the sub-continent. While the European powers were busy transforming themselves from trading companies to political powers, the Nizam as the subedar of the Mughals pursued his ambitions in the Deccan, and the Marathas, following their defeat at Panipat, sought <b>safe</b> <b>havens</b> in the south. The period also saw the French vie with the British for control of the Carnatic – a contest in which the British would eventually prevail as British commander Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French under the Comte de Lally at the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760, a watershed in Indian history as it cemented British supremacy in South Asia. Though the Wodeyars remained the nominal heads of Mysore during this period, real power lay in the hands of Haider Ali and his son Tipu.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two questions. First, {{we investigate}} whether gold is a hedge against stocks and/or bonds and second, we investigate whether gold is a <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> for investors if either stocks or bonds fall. A <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> {{is defined as}} a security that loses none of its value in case of a market crash. This is counterpoised against a hedge, defined as a security that does not co-move with stocks or bonds on average. We study constant and time-varying relationships between stocks, bonds and gold in order to investigate the existence of a hedge and a <b>safe</b> <b>haven.</b> The empirical analysis examines US, UK and German stock and bond prices and returns and their relationship with the Gold price. We find that (i) Gold is a hedge against stocks, (ii) Gold is a <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> in extreme stock market conditions and (iii) Gold is a <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> for stocks only for 15 trading days after an extreme shock occurred. <b>Safe</b> <b>haven,</b> gold, stock-bond correlation, flight-to-quality...|$|R

40|$|During {{times of}} extreme market turmoil, it is {{acknowledged}} {{that there is}} a tendency towards "flight to safety". A strong (weak) <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> is defined as an asset that has a significant positive (negative) return in periods where another asset is in distress, while hedge has to be negatively correlated (uncorrelated) on average.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the role of gold in the global {{financial}} system. We test the hypothesis that gold represents a <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> against stocks of major emerging and developing countries. A descriptive and econometric analysis for a sample spanning a 30 Â year period from 1979 to 2009 shows that gold is both a hedge and a <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> for major European stock markets and the US but not for Australia, Canada, Japan and large emerging markets such as the BRIC countries. We also distinguish between a weak and strong form of the <b>safe</b> <b>haven</b> and argue that gold may act as a stabilizing force for the financial system by reducing losses in the face of extreme negative market shocks.

These numerous security measures appear to have borne fruit, as many pirates were apprehended in 2010, including a prominent leader. Puntland's security forces also reportedly managed to force out the pirate gangs from their traditional <b>safe</b> <b>havens</b> such as Eyl and Gar'ad, with the pirates now primarily operating from Hobyo, El Danaan and Harardhere in the neighboring Galmudug region.

25|$|The {{period in}} Argentina between 1990 and 1993 {{was a time}} of {{transition}} away from social policies, government support devices, and welfare systems to an IMF-backed structural adjustment in economic and market policies.

Crime rates rose 286% between 1992 and 1995 and in 1995 the former President, Carlos Menem was re-elected with international praise for achieving low inflation, privatizing state-run companies and the currency peg to the dollar. Crime has continued to grow as a considerable social concern in the aftermath of the 2001 recession and a reversal of the currency peg where hyperinflation ensued. Consequently, the arms and drug trade has flourished and slums in Buneos Aires grew by 114% during the 1990s to around 113,000 people.

Il-Khans and Timurids deliberately patronized Persianate high culture. Under their rule developed new styles of architecture, Persian literature was encouraged, and flourished miniature painting and book production, and under Timurids prospered Turkic poetry, based on the vernacular known as Chaghatai (today called Uzbek; of Turkic Qarluq origin).|$|E
25|$|Another {{precondition}} {{for the rise}} {{of democracy in the}} Anglo-American world was the fact that Calvin favored a mixture of democracy and aristocracy as the best form of government (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. The aim of his political thought was to safeguard the rights and freedoms of ordinary men and women. In order to minimize the misuse of political power he suggested dividing it among several institutions in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if worldly rulers rise up against God they should be put down. In this way, he and his followers stood in the vanguard of resistance to political absolutism and furthered the cause of democracy. The Congregationalists who founded Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. Enjoying self-rule they practiced separation of powers. Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, founded by Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively, combined democratic government with freedom of religion.
