5|$|The {{legislative}} {{intent of}} the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 {{was to develop a}} national program to guard America's sound recording heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts. The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> and collections of <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.|$|E
5|$|The Warren D.

5|$|The RNC hired Albert Lasker, an {{advertising}} executive from Chicago, to publicize Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques {{for the first}} time in a presidential campaign. Lasker's approach included newsreels and <b>sound</b> <b>recordings.</b> Visitors to Marion had their photographs taken with Senator and Mrs. Harding, and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E
5|$|During the decade, Richardson made {{numerous}} <b>sound</b> <b>recordings.</b> For the Caedmon Audio label he re-created {{his role}} as Cyrano de Bergerac opposite Anna Massey as Roxane, and played the title role in a complete recording of Julius Caesar, with a cast that included Anthony Quayle as Brutus, John Mills as Cassius and Alan Bates as Antony. Other Caedmon recordings were Measure for Measure, The School for Scandal and No Man's Land. Richardson also recorded some English Romantic poetry, including The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and poems by Keats and Shelley for the label. For Decca Records Richardson recorded the narration for Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, and for RCA the superscriptions for Vaughan Williams's Sinfonia antartica – both with the London Symphony Orchestra, the Prokofiev conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and the Vaughan Williams by André Previn.|$|E
5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has {{found no evidence}} that this is effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E

5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> also made in the attic, have {{appeared}} on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E
5|$|The library {{contains}} over 390,000 volumes, {{more than}} 317,000 titles, and over 1,400 journal subscriptions. These collections include periodicals, books, newspapers, microforms, <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> videos, government documents, CD-ROMS, and musical scores. As of 2006, this includes 365,609 volumes of books, past issues of periodicals, and other printed sources; 11,508 {{items in the}} audio visual collection; 5,147 subscriptions to periodicals; and 337,918 microforms. The library also offers access to electronic sources through FirstSearch, RLIN, OCLC, EPIC, and DIALOG among others. Additionally, university publications such as the yearbook (The Wallulah), the student newspaper (Willamette Collegian), school catalogs, the Willamette Journal of the Liberal Arts, and the Willamette Scene among others, are collected by the library.|$|E
5|$|The museum's Sound Archive holds 33,000 <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> {{including}} a large collection of oral history recordings of witnesses to conflicts since 1914. The museum's sound collection originated in 1972 {{with the creation}} of the Department of Sound Records and the instigation of an oral history recording programme. The sound collection opened to the public in July 1977. The collection also includes recordings made by the BBC during the Second World War, actuality sound effects, broadcasts, speeches and poetry. As part of the museum's First World War centenary programme, the museum is producing Voices of the First World War, a podcast series drawing upon the museum's oral history recordings. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its sound collection as 37,000 hours.|$|E

The university library system had 4.5 million patrons in person or online during the 2015–2016 academic year. The university library employs a total of 130 professional, and support staff. The library's resource expenditure for the 2015–2016 academic year was approximately $10.4 million, with 81 percent of the budget allocated to serial and e-resource subscriptions, 10 percent on hard copy acquisitions, and 9 percent to membership and collections support. The library system include four libraries housing 1,255,490 paper books and 3,656,647 total resources, including videos, maps, <b>sound</b> <b>recordings,</b> and microfilm. Mills Library houses the humanities and social sciences collections, {{with a wide range of}} print and digital resources. Innis Library houses content which supports the academic and research interests of the DeGroote School of Business.

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{preparation}} method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones {{for a complete}} skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case}} with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate-controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E

25|$|While the Hasbro case {{considered}} {{a special case}} of the applicability of rule of the shorter term {{in the context of}} the UCC, the case of Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc. (4 N.Y.3d 540, 2nd Cir. 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under Berne Convention. In this case, Capitol Records claimed copyright on old British <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the United Kingdom had expired in the late 1980s. Naxos Records, which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. <b>Sound</b> <b>recordings</b> are a special case because pre-1972 <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> in the United States are not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and because nothing in the Berne Convention (which is inapplicable to <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> anyway) or the Rome Convention usurped the State of New York's law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York common lawwhile the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.|$|E
