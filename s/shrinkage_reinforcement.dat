40|$|Predicting the {{time-dependent}} behaviour of {{prestressed concrete}} (PC) beams is crucial as time effects under serviceability loading {{can result in}} a critical loss of prestress. The conventional technique using moment–curvature (M/χ) to simulate the behaviour of PC beams is based on the Euler-Bernoulli corollary of a linear strain profile in which all deformations are accommodated through changes in the material strain, i. e. it is strain based. Consequently, the M/χ approach cannot directly accommodate discrete deformations associated with tension stiffening, such as the formation of individual cracks and reinforcement slip. Hence, the M/χ approach can simulate the behaviour prior to cracking purely through mechanics. However, for post-cracking behaviour it requires empirically derived correction factors, such as empirically derived flexural rigidities, to allow for the deformations associated with tension stiffening. This paper presents a displacement- based moment–rotation (M/Θ) approach for determining the behaviour of PC beams by applying the Euler-Bernoulli theorem of plane sections, as opposed to the conventional M/χ approach of a linear strain profile. Being based on plane sections, the M/Θ approach deals directly with displacements and, consequently, can simulate the mechanics of tension stiffening directly. The approach is shown to accommodate the time effects of concrete creep, <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> relaxation and can develop equivalent flexural rigidities directly from mechanics.

40|$|The {{premature}} {{deterioration of}} concrete bridge decks is a multi-billion dollar {{problem in the}} United States. In December 2003, the Federal Highway Administration estimated that approximately 27 percent of the 592, 000 nation's bridges are considered structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. It would cost about 80 billion dollars to bring all of the nation's bridges to an acceptable and safe standard by either rehabilitation or replacement. Moreover, {{according to the data}} of the “national bridge inventory” obtained from the U. S. Department of Transportation, it is estimated that deficiencies occur mostly in the decks in {{more than half of the}} bridges in United States. Not only bridge deck deterioration is an economic problem; it is also a risk to those who traverse the structure. Forms of deterioration can range from slightly damaged deck surfaces, causing unpleasant sights and decreasing bridge deck serviceability, up to spalling of large pieces of concrete that reduces the structural integrity and it can be a danger for the public. Therefore, there is a compelling need to understand the behavior of bridge decks under service load and develop a reliable procedure to assess the serviceability of the deck, which will then serve as a decision-making tool for the rehabilitation or the replacement of the decks. In the United States, most of the bridge decks are constructed as reinforced concrete slabs supported by steel or precast prestressed girders. Such decks have traditionally been designed using the “strip method”, based on a conventional beam theory, which assumes that the slab is continuous over fixed supports. As a result, the top part of the slab is reinforced with steel bars to resist the negative moments, and the bottom part of the slab is reinforced with steel bars to resist the positive moments. Temperature and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is added orthogonally at the top and at the bottom. When cracks occur in concrete, the top reinforcement can be subjected to environmental agents and aggressive chemicals; such as deicing salt, and it can start to corrode. The corrosion can result in a lateral expansion of the steel bars, leading to spalling of concrete cover and subsequent formation of potholes. Previous research in the United States and mainly in Canada showed that the flexural capacity of bridge decks can be increased by the presence of in-plane compressive forces, created when the deck is restrained by supports that cannot move laterally. This phenomenon is referred as “arching action” and is the basis of the empirical design provisions of the Ontario (Canada) Bridge Design Code (1993). This empirical method has been adopted in the current AASHTO LRFD code (2005), and it is referred to as isotropic reinforcement. According to the empirical method, arching action requires less steel reinforcement than that required by the strip method of AASHTO LRFD code (2005). Therefore, it is believed that the decks designed by empirical method are more resistant to deterioration due to fewer sources of corrosion (fewer steel rebars). At the present, there is no assessment method available to evaluate the serviceability and durability of bridge decks. Therefore, in this dissertation, a procedure for bridge decks evaluation is developed, which is focused on evaluation and comparison of bridge decks performance for the two aforementioned design procedures. A reliability based method associated with a state of the art nonlinear finite element analysis, calibrated using field tests, is developed in order to understand the structural behavior of the deck and to assess its performance.

40|$|When {{designing}} one way slabs in post-tensioned {{beam and}} slab construction, is it acceptable {{to provide all}} of the required continuous shrinkage and temperature reinforce-ment in the beams only? No. It is PTI’s opinion that one-way slab <b>shrinkage</b> and temperature <b>reinforcement</b> cannot be provided by beam tendons alone. Elimination of shrink-age and temperature reinforcement in the slabs of one-way beam-and-slab structures violates {{the requirements of the}} ACI Building Code. Following is a detailed discussion that explains the PTI position. COMMENTARY: ACI CODE REQUIREMENTS Requirements for shrinkage and temperature reinforce-ment in one-way slabs are specified in the ACI Building Code (current edition ACI 318 - 05) 1 in Section 7. 12. Section 7. 12. 1 (see below) states in mandatory language that reinforcement shall be provided for shrinkage and temperature stresses. 7. 12. 1 – <b>Reinforcement</b> for <b>shrinkage</b> and temperature stresses normal to flexural reinforcement shall be provid-ed in structural slabs where the flexural reinforcement extends in one direction only. Either non-prestressed reinforcement (Section 7. 12. 2) or prestressed reinforcement (Section 7. 12. 3) is permitted to be used to satisfy this requirement. The code specifies three criteria when prestressed reinforcement is used. They are repeated below: 7. 12. 3. 1 – Tendons shall be proportioned to provide a minimum average compressive stress of 100 psi on gross concrete area using effective prestress, after losses, in accordance with 18. 6. 7. 12. 3. 2 – Spacing of tendons shall not exceed 6 feet. 7. 12. 3. 3 – When spacing of tendons exceeds 54 in., addi-tional bonded <b>shrinkage</b> and temperature <b>reinforcement</b> conforming to 7. 12. 2 shall be provided between the ten-dons at slab edges extending from the slab edge for a dis-tance equal to the tendon spacing.

Generally, expansive cements shrink more than portland cements, and especially more so if they have not been adequately cured, i. e. curing period of at least 7 days is necessary to ensure good performance against shrinkage. Internal damage caused by large amounts of expansion leads to a large magnitude of shrinkage. In that event curing {{does not seem to have}} any beneficial impact on <b>shrinkage</b> performance.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain {{shrinkage}} and creep of HPC used in Sutong continuous rigid-frame bridge, shrinkage and creep of plain concrete and RC are investigated under natural environment over two years. Reinforcement ratio 0. 76 % is close {{to that of the}} middle span. Loading stress of creep test is about 15 MPa, which is near the maximum stress of the bridge. Four loading ages, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d and 28 d, were used to simulate different loading ages in construction. The curves of creep and shrinkage were fitted from test values. The results show the test values of creep and shrinkage were less than the current Chinese bridge code JTG D 62 - 2004, and the creep and shrinkage of RC is less than plain concrete. If the reinforcement ratio is low, reinforcement exerts less influence on creep and shrinkage, and the influence of reinforcement can be neglected in engineering application. Reinforcement can effectively reduce creep and <b>shrinkage</b> if the <b>reinforcement</b> ratio is high. 1...|$|R

However, there are constraints on the properties of the expansion and shrinkage of bamboo, which in its use as reinforcement, bamboo will expand due to the absorption of water in fresh concrete and then will shrink along with the evaporation of water in the process of drying concrete. Shrinkage in a bamboo cause a loss of bonding in bamboo and concrete that may cause a collapse.

40|$|Today, Japan {{has more}} than 10, 000 road or railway tunnels with a total length of more than 4, 500 km, {{as a result of}} {{vigorous}} infrastructure developments. With some of old ones constructed before World War II being still in service, tunnel maintenance has become a crucial issue. This paper deals with deformations as lining cracks, ground heaving and cross-section <b>shrinkage,</b> discussing the <b>reinforcement</b> strategy to deal with any deformation caused by the plasticization of rock mass around tunnel. There have been studies on rock deformation behavior over time, through various approaches using the creep model, but there is only a few that consider the time behavior of rock mass in the actual reinforcement strategy. The applicability of various analytical methods is also yet to be fully examined. The {{reason for this is that}} the initial design of tunnels is not based on detailed geological survey or highly accurate analysis, but depends on flexible design modifications during the actual construction work to achieve rationalization. Therefore, only limited geological information is available at the maintenance stage, and furthermore, it is sometimes the case that an old tunnel hardly has any geological information obtained at the construction stage. Another factor that makes the design of a deformation remedial measure difficult is the fact that it requires more information including the initial settings and input physical property values to be used for the modeling of rock mass. Aiming to evaluate the actual deformation behavior of tunnels suffering from long-term rock mass deformation with limited information, this paper examines the analytical method that considers the strength degradation of rock mass around tunnel (hereinafter called “the rock mass degradation model”). Also, in order to design the deformation remedial measure in consideration of the time degradation of the rock mass strength, the measurements and analytical results were combined to introduce the notion of time to the prediction of deformation progress.
