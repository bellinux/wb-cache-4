The latter storage lake was built in 1984 {{and was the first}} place in Belgium where <b>separated</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> were applied. Because of subsequent pollutions it became necessary, however, to completely empty and clean the lake.

50|$|Phillips {{proposed}} the <b>separate</b> <b>system</b> of <b>sewerage</b> for London in 1849. But {{a few years}} later, Bazalgette’s combined system was selected (Metcalf and Eddy 1928). Although supporters for <b>separate</b> <b>sewerage</b> existed, early <b>systems</b> were mostly combined because: (1) there was no European precedent for successful separate systems; (2) there was a belief that combined systems were cheaper to build than a complete separate system; and (3) engineers were not convinced that agricultural use of separate-sanitary wastewater was viable (Tarr 1979).|$|R
40|$|In the Research Centre Karlsruhe a {{waste water}} {{treatment}} plant with 1000 population equivalents is operated employing the activated sludge process, whereby the waste water is supplied by a <b>separate</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> Caused by this, the waste water quantities are considerably varying, and, furthermore, the inflow contains high ammonia concentrations, making an optimal cleaning performance difficult. Additionally the crude waste water has a low BOD/nitrogen relation, which is disadvantageous for a biological nitrogenelimination. At the end of 1997 the outflow concentration standards were modified {{in the course of a}} new permission by water right, based now on the minimum requirements of the German Waste Water Ordinance for treatment plants of the size class 4, because the effluent of the STP feeds a sensible river. This meant that for the first time a limit value for phosphorus of 3 mg/L P was set and that concerning nitrogen a reduction of the limit from 40 mg/L N on 18 mg/L N was decided. It was the aim of the investigations to lower the nitrate concentrations in the purified waste water from about 25 mg/L N to 10 mg/L N without, although mostly unavoidable, extra investment costs and without increasing the running costs. As first step the conditions in the STP of the Research Centre Karlsruhe were thoroughly investigated. From this analysis a catalogue of possible measures were obtained, of which up to now two points were put into operation: 1. introduction of a denitrification step by anoxic opecation of one of the two aeration basins 2. increase of the BSB/N relation in the inflow water by the dosage of the kitchen wastes of the mess of the Research Centre Karlsruhe thus serving as an external source of carbon. These measures could be put into operation mainly just by variating the operational modes and with nearly no additional costs. By this, a considerable improvement of the quality of the purified waste water and, furthermore, a noticeably saving of the running cost of the STP was achieved. (orig.)

40|$|A {{community}} <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> is {{a public}} good which society derives {{a wide range of}} benefits from. Because a community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> {{is a public}} good, it is normally provided under the direction and control of a local authority. A local authority contemplating providing a community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> in a small coastal community, must consider whether the welfare of the community will increase as a result. To do this it needs to consider the total economic costs and benefits that the community might incur or gain from building a small community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> In the coastal environment the value of many of the benefits a community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> would provide can not be observed in commercial markets. This research aimed to provide local authority decision-makers with a way to value the benefits of a small community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> in the coastal environment. To achieve this the contingent valuation method was used {{in the form of a}} mail questionnaire with specific reference to the circumstances of small coastal communities. Application of the questionnaire was illustrated using three small New Zealand coastal communities, Russell, Tapeka and Horeke. The questionnaire was mailed to households and businesses in these communities to solicit their willingness to pay for the benefits of a proposed community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> An average return rate of 50 % was obtained. The information and results obtained from the questionnaires showed that they can provide valuable information. In particular, information for a decision-maker wishing to determine if community sewerage is economically efficient in a small coastal community. The average value per fortnight that respondents from Russell, Tapeka, and Horeke placed on the benefits of a community <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> was $ 16. 60, $ 15. 97 and $ 9. 75 respectively.
