40|$|Avian vegetation-use and {{foraging}} {{behavior were}} studied along a spruce-fir sere in the Bear River Mountains of northern Utah and southern Idaho from 1976 to 1978 on four 10 ha plots [...] one each in meadow, aspen, fir and spruce. A total of 71 species were encoun­tered, of which 43 bred {{in at least}} one of three breeding seasons. Avian vegetation-use was quantified on the 3 forested plots by sampling a total of 197 (0. 05 ha) plots around singing male birds of 15 species. Also, 75 random plots (25 in each <b>seral</b> <b>stage)</b> were sampled to characterize the available vegetation. Principal component analysis (PCA) on all avian samples showed that, based on vegetation­use, avian communities in the seral stages were distinct, although some bird species showed affinities for vegetation within one <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> that was characteristic of another <b>seral</b> <b>stage.</b> White-crowned Sparrow and Yellow-bellied Sapsucker showed an affinity for fir in aspen stands; Oregon Junco and Ruby-crowned Kinglet used aspen and spruce, respectively, in fir stands; Chipping Sparrow and Western criminant function analysis (DFA) of the avian vegetation-use data con­firmed the PCA relationships. PCA of avian vegetation-use data within each <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> showed that in aspen, differences between broad-leaf and coniferous vegetation explained the distribution of several species. Relatively little variation existed in the vegetation physiognomy of the aspen <b>seral</b> <b>stage.</b> In fir and spruce, subtle differences in coniferous vegetation explained the distribution of most species. PCA and DFA of the random vegetation samples were similar to the analyses of the avian vegetation-use data when comparing aspen to fir and spruce, suggesting that gross morphological differences in vege­tation are sufficient to separate avian communities when vegetational characteristics of a particular <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> are distinct. However, the vegetation-use pattern of the bird communities in fir and spruce stands overlapped to a greater degree than did the random vegetation samples in fir and spruce, suggesting that bird communities in these two seral stages are partitioning the use of vegetation on a coarser scale than that defined merely by changes in vegetation due to succes­sion. Foraging behavior data were collected on 3 species that occurred in aspen, fir, and spruce; 3 species that occurred in fir and spruce; and 5 species that occur in fir and spruce, but for which a large sample of foraging behavior was obtained only in fir. PCA of the foraging behavior data determined that; 1) each species studied tended to forage in a similar manner in different seral stages, 2) different foraging types, e. g., flycatchers, foliage gleaners, exhibited distinct foraging patterns, and 3) most species did not change vegetation types in different seral stages. Colwell and Futuyma niche breadth and overlap measures were cal­culated for the foraging behavior data, and generally confirmed that foraging technique was the most conservative of the foraging classes studied. Foraging niche breadths and overlaps were relatively high, suggesting a reduction of competition between species. Ricklefs and Cox 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) index of morphological similarity confirmed that most of the foliage-gleaning species were quite similar morphologically. This occurrence of many similar species {{may be due to the}} structure of western conifers, or possibly species are keying on temporally super­abundant food resources. It is concluded that it is the distinctiveness of the vegetation within a <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> that will determine the population response of avian species along a sere. Possible ways in which vegetation physiognomy of each <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> may affect avian community structure are discussed.

A variety of bioassessment methods have been successfully applied to aquatic ecosystems using fish and macroinvertebrate communities. Terrestrial biotic index methods are less developed than those for aquatic systems and we are seeking to address this problem here. This study had as its objective to examine the baseline differences in ant communities at different <b>seral</b> <b>stages</b> from clear cut back to mature pine plantation as a precursor to developing a bioassessment protocol.

Analysis of the ant data indicates that ants respond strongly to the habitat changes that accompany ecological succession in managed pine forests and that individual genera as well as ant community structure can be used as an indicator of successional change.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 The canyon grasslands of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (HCNRA) are {{a unique}} {{ecosystem}} within the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Region (PNWBR) {{with a long}} history of natural and anthropogenic disturbances including fire, invasive species introduction, historical livestock grazing, and cultivation. Even with this history, these canyon grasslands contain some of the last remnants of the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Region. For thousands of years, these grasslands were occupied by the Nez Perce Tribe and have been grazed since the 1700 s. In addition to grazing, settlers cultivated many parts of the HCNRA and some of these homesteads can still be seen today. Both historical and current land uses are strongly influenced by the natural topography of these canyon grasslands, with the highest concentration of land use centered on benchlands while steep canyon slopes avoided cultivation and were used less by livestock. The different plant associations of these grasslands are also influenced by the unique topography of the HCNRA due to the relationships between soil moisture and depth and abrupt alterations in aspect, slope, and elevation. Very few studies have examined the plant associations of the canyon grasslands of the HCNRA, even fewer have asked how they have changed over time, and there are no studies looking into their future trajectory by assessing the seed bank. The first study in my thesis (Chapter 2) focused on how canyon grasslands have changed over time using a repeated survey of vegetation from four different plant associations within the Lower Imnaha Subbasin. From the original study conducted in 1981, a total of 19 different plots in four plant associations were chosen to be resampled in 2014. Since the original study was used to classify seral stages within the plant associations, these successional stages were used to determine if the plant communities had transitioned between the seral classes over the 33 year-time-period. In addition, given the importance of topography to these grasslands, elevation, slope, and aspect were evaluated for their relationship to successional changes. Both Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) and Indicator Species Analysis were used to verify the <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> classifications for each plot in 1981 and 2014.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the ecological status of representative herbaceous species with respect to environmental factors and subhabitats of which the spatial and temporal pattern could be elucidated. The basal cover of the herbaceous vegetation was determined by means of the wheel-point method. Frequency data in each of 200 1 m 2 contiguous quadrats were ordinated by means of detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA). The distribution of the species along the first axis is a function of conditions representing an open habitat with full sunlight and somewhat drier conditions to the left and a denser and/or shrub habitat with more shade and wetter, more favourable conditions to the right. The gradient along the second axis is that of undisturbed conditions with more perennials at the lower end to disturbed conditions with more annuals at the upper end.

In the absence of natural disturbances, old growth habitat and large patches of forest of similar age and tree species composition decreased unless special management practices were applied.

Although ΨL did not differ between evergreen and drought-deciduous trees, results from stable isotope analyses indicated different strategies to overcome seasonal water limitations.

The objective of this descriptive 15 -year study, conducted at the Nature Conservancy Niobrara Valley Preserve near Johnstown, Nebraska, was to quantify and interpret patterns of seral change occurring in a Sandhills blowout [Valentine Association (mixed mesic Typic Ustipamments) ] by defining consistent patterns of plant community change. Grazing was excluded from two active blowouts (12 ha and 5 ha) in 1981 and 1990, respectively. Each study area was overlain with a permanent grid system to facilitate mapping of the vegetation and sand erosion/deposition annually through 1995. Sand erosion/deposition patterns and plant community data were digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to produce community maps. Spatial data for patches, class and landscape-level plant communities were rasterized, and analyzed for multiple spatial statistics by FRAGSTATS. The shape index was superior to a two-dimensional fractal analysis in characterizing patch and class dynamics. Four successional trajectories within a Nebraska Sandhills blowout were evident: (1) seral advancement of minimally disturbed perennial grass patches, (2) edge closure, (3) bare sand to blowoutgrass to blowoutgrass/sand muhly to perennial grass/sand muhly to perennial grass, and (4) bare sand to annuals to annual/perennial mixture to perennial grass.

In order to integrate the palynoassemblages with the environment of deposition, additional granulometric data and nutrient data from XRF analysis were used in combination with the palynology. A new method using correspondence analysis was used for understanding the palaeoecology and floral dynamics. An updated, dynamic model for the Middle Jurassic floral palaeoecology of the Neuquén Basin has been presented and the drivers of floral succession are interpreted as disturbance tolerance and substrate water content. Taphonomic expressions of seral groupings show that later <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> community palynomorphs are preferentially deposited within or close to distributary systems, whereas earlier <b>seral</b> <b>stage</b> palynomorphs are preferentially deposited in environments of greater accommodation space, such as bayfills.

The weathering and nutrient status of the substrates throughout the Lajas Formation is presented using XRF proxy data. The proxies are also used with CCA to create nutrient related floral groupings. When plotted stratigraphically, these show cycles of eutrophication and subsequent weathering of the substrates. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of community restoration {{is to understand}} and exploit the principles of ecological succession at all <b>seral</b> <b>stages,</b> by complementing and accelerating the processes of colonisation and regeneration. The main aim is to construct self-sustaining, appropriate communities, connected in the landscape, that meet conservation, landscape and crop production goals. Research, to date, has been biased towards the plant and soil components with little consideration for the animal element. We discuss {{the importance of this}} missing component, put forward our belief that it is essential for enhancing landscape biodiversity, given that invertebrates provide the bulk of the biodiversity in New Zealand, and ensure that many ecological functions are performed. We suggest that restoration is an ideal model system for testing succession theory...|$|R
40|$|Oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) {{species are}} {{important}} mast producers that can regulate wildlife populations. Specifically, mast {{is a critical}} energy source during winter months and positively influences small mammal abundance. Wildlife also can affect oak reproductive success through seed and seedling predation and dispersal. Current oak-focused forest management strategies attempt to reverse declines in oak regeneration. An important corollary of this work {{is to develop a}} greater understanding of wildlife responses to these management strategies. In an attempt to understand these responses, I characterized small mammal populations and communities at different oak-managed successional sites, both pre- and post-harvest. I used methodologies that explicitly acknowledged the limitations inherent in the sampling of cryptic species by incorporating detection probability into the estimates of occupancy, abundance, species richness, colonization rates, and extinction rates for small mammals. I also incorporated detection probability into the indicator value method to more accurately select indicator species. This method, which I demonstrate with song birds in oak-managed stands, can be used when selecting wildlife species to monitor for responses to forest management. I found dramatic differences in occupancy and abundance estimates for small mammals relative to naïve estimates, especially for rarer species. Small mammal assemblages at my study sites responded to stand structure and microsite characteristics, with an Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) dominated community at early <b>seral</b> <b>stages</b> developing into a more diverse, white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) dominated community at later <b>seral</b> <b>stages.</b> I also found that imperfect detection influenced the selection of indicator species, with the greatest influence occurring when species counts and probability of detection are low or when probability of detection strongly varies with site-association. Failure to account for imperfect detection could result in erroneous estimates of occupancy, abundance, and incorrect species-site associations. Monitoring plans or management decisions made based on methods that do not account for imperfect detection could have negative repercussions for conservation. ...|$|R
40|$|Management {{strategies}} for promoting late-seral attributes in second-growth forest need evaluation for their efficacy in maintaining biodiversity, including complete forest-floor, small-mammal communities. Two common {{strategies in the}} Pacific Northwest are (1) management with thinnings to promote large trees with developed understories and (2) retention of legacies, defined as live trees, logs, and snags from the preceding forest, at harvest, followed by protection but not thinnings of the new stand. We compared small-mammal communities resulting from > 65 yr of application of these strategies in the Puget Trough, Washington. We also compared these communities with the small-mammal communities found in old-growth, naturally young, and extensively managed forests elsewhere in western Washington. Forests managed with thinnings had 1. 5 times the individual mammals and 1. 7 times the mammal biomass of forests managed with legacies of coarse woody debris and snags-differences similar to those between old-growth and naturally young forest (1. 2 times more individuals in old-growth) and old-growth and extensively managed forest (1. 6 times more individuals in old-growth). Management strategy {{had a profound impact}} on community structure, with the Columbian mouse (Peromyscus oreas), the small mammal mostassociated with old growth, much reduced in Puget Trough forests (absent from most stands) and the creeping vole (Microtus oregoni) (a species commonly associated with early <b>seral</b> <b>stages,</b> but found in all <b>seral</b> <b>stages</b> in Washington) third-ranked in thinned stands but seventh ranked in legacy stands. The montane shrew (Sorex monticolus) was second-ranked, after Trowbridge's shrew (S. trowbridgii), in marked contrast to codominance by the southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), S. monticolus, and P. oreas in old growth. Thus, neither strategy produced communities typical of late-seral forestsWilson and Carey "Legacy retention versus thinning: Influences on small mammals.
