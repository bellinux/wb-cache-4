5000|$|It {{is often}} said falsely that Welsh has no words at all for yes and no.

So the answers to [...] "" [...] ("Is Ffred coming?") are either [...] "" [...] ("He is (coming).") or [...] "" [...] ("He is not (coming)"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with [...] As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned yes means in response to a negative question.

40|$|AbstractQuestions {{tend to be}} {{the most}} {{productive}} tool for obtaining information, knowledge, test taking, health-care, justice, criminal investigations, fun, etc. Whenever two people meet, the simplest form of contact might be ‘Hi!’ which is an inbuilt question directed by the addresser to the addressee to tell the latter that s/he means something to him/her. The two basic types of questions in English are information questions ‘also called wh-questions’ and yes/no questions ‘also called polarity questions’. This paper deals with the second type, viz. yes/no questions in English from a pragmatic standpoint. The ultimate goal is {{to find out if the}} syntactically oriented term ‘yes/no questions’ is also pragmatically valuable, or needs to be approached differently. Concerning the term ‘yes/no question’, no such questions start with either <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no.</b> They normally start with an operator ‘main or auxiliary verb’, but are supposed to be answered with either <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no.</b> Hence, starting from the semantic perspective, one might claim that such questions are not specifically yes/no questions, but rather ‘questions that are responded to with <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> no’. This implies a lack of precision in the term. This study covers yes/no questions addressed to Barak Obama, President of United States of America, in six randomly selected press conferences, and how he decides to answer in any other way or using any term, but rarely <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no.</b> The study ends with a suggestion of an alternative term to ‘yes/no questions’ in English from a pragmatic perspective...|$|R

40|$|In the Ultimatum Game {{players are}} to {{distribute}} 100 units among themselves {{according to the}} following rules. Player I is the allocator and player II the responder. Player I proposes a division of that sum between the two players. Player II responds by <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no.</b> If the response is yes, the proposed division is implemented. If the response is no, both players get nothing. In game theory, we shall {{find out what the}} two players are to do in this situation by applying solution concepts. The Ultimatum Game being a game in extensive form and of perfect information, the appropriate solution concept is subgame-perfect Nash-equilibrium. Accordingly, player I is to propose a 99 : 1 division; and since one is more than zero, player II is better off accepting this radically unequal distribution of the sum than receiving nothing. This result is so counterintuitive, that the game has been on the agenda of experimental studies for almost twenty years. In their first report on Ultimatum Game experiments Güth, Schmittberger and Schwarze (1982) found that player I would not infrequently propose a fifty:fifty share, and that she in fact would be unwise to demand more than about two thirds of the sum, since then she would stand about half a chance of being refused. The difference from the subgame-perfect prediction is so robust that it led to a large number of papers, which argu...|$|R
40|$|The author {{contrasts}} command-and-control regulation (tight {{control of}} water purification, for example) with more flexible forms, including incentive regulation (such as price cap regulation), potential regulation (providing for closer scrutiny if enough customers complain), and reactive rather than proactive policies (the firm proposing actions, the regulatory <b>saying</b> <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no).</b> He contrasts informing regulation (for example, requiring that consumers be informed about {{ingredients in a}} product) and enforcing regulation (for example, prohibiting the use of certain chemicals in foods). A country's institutional structure can limit the regulators'potential for commitment, he says [...] especially if regulators are limited {{in their ability to}} deliver rewards or penalties. The scope and function of regulation may also be fairly limited when technological conditions allow competition to discipline producers. Sophisticated buyers with economic power may reduce the need for regulatory control, and rapid technological change can render comprehensive command-and-control regulation ineffective or debilitating. Many forces operate simultaneously, making regulatory design a complex undertaking. Inertia is one such influence. Regulatory policies that once served an important purpose sometimes persist even though they no longer serve that purpose [...] sometimes because they favor a constituency that convinces the regulator to keep the control in place. Subsidies and tariff protection often continue long past the time needed to promote the development of an infant industry, for example. When there is limited public outcry against continuing the special treatment, and the affected firms strongly urge its continuance, the regulator may be convinced to continue special treatment that no longer serves the public interest. Regulation may also be affected by the regulators'personal ambition. When regulators are"captured"by regulated firms [...] diverted from the goal of protecting consumers through the promise of personal rewards for favorable treatment of the firms [...] regulation may not serve society's best interest. Even if regulators are not motivated by self-interest, their ideas of what is best for society may differ from those of other government officials or of society at large. When that happens, which goals are pursued depends largely on the autonomy regulators that are granted and on the balance of power among government bodies. Regulation should be viewed in this large context to be understood fully.

The celebrity bestowed upon Michaelis on his release two years ago by some emotional journalists in want of special copy had rankled ever since in his breast.

His two former chiefs would have seen the point at once; whereas this one, without <b>saying</b> either <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no,</b> sat there, as if lost in a dream. Moreover, besides being legal and expedient, the arrest of Michaelis solved a little personal difficulty which worried Chief Inspector Heat somewhat. This difficulty had its bearing upon his reputation, upon his comfort, and even upon the efficient performance of his duties. For, if Michaelis no doubt knew something about this outrage, the Chief Inspector was fairly certain {{that he did not know}} too much. This was just as well. He knew much less—the Chief Inspector was positive—than certain other individuals he had in his mind, but whose arrest seemed to him inexpedient, besides being a more complicated matter, on account of the rules of the game. The rules of the game did not protect so much Michaelis, who was an ex-convict. It would be stupid not to take advantage of legal facilities, and the journalists who had written him up with emotional gush would be ready to write him down with emotional indignation.|$|R

40|$|We analyze what {{functions}} as a YES response and a NO response for different yes/no questions. This problem is surprisingly complex: respondents do not always produce overt <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> lexical items {{in response to a}} yes/no question. In addition, when respondents don't include a clear <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> word, they may mean to communicate a clear <b>YES</b> <b>or</b> <b>NO</b> meaning, <b>or</b> something else. We find that the classification of yes/no questions described in (Carletta et al., 1995) for the Edinburgh map task corpus correlates well with whether a response will be a bare <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no,</b> a <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> plus additional speech, or just speech without an overt <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no.</b> Correlation with responses described simply as as "direct" or "indirect" is less good.
