30|$|Our {{results show}} that <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> was not {{successful}} in increasing return-to-work among DI beneficiaries, and a natural question is why the interest in <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> was so low. We discuss three possible explanations for this finding. First, we discuss whether our simulations overestimated the impact of <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> due to misclassifications of beneficiary types. Second, we ask whether {{the complexity of the}} DI system and information frictions precluded beneficiaries from understanding the incentives. Third, we discuss whether beneficiaries did not respond to the incentives because of risk aversion and the way the <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> programme was designed.|$|R
30|$|Two {{different}} treatments were implemented: DI beneficiaries in the “high” <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> treatment receive CHF 18, 000 {{for each}} pension reduction by one quarter, while beneficiaries in the “low” <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> treatment receive CHF 9, 000 for each pension reduction by one quarter. Thus, a DI beneficiary {{with a full}} pension who completely exits the DI programme receives CHF 72, 000 in the high <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> treatment and CHF 36, 000 in the low <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> treatment. The former amount {{is comparable to the}} average income of a Swiss household, while the latter amount corresponds to the minimum yearly income guaranteed by means-tested benefits. The lump-sum payment is split into four equal tranches, paid bi-annually over two years. Once an individual falls back to a higher pension, the DI system stops the payment of outstanding <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> tranches. Already paid tranches {{do not have to be}} reimbursed.|$|R

30|$|This section {{presents}} micro-simulation {{results on}} the predicted effect of <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> based on the simple labour supply model described in the previous section. Here, we model the necessary return-to-work condition based on the budget constraint for different types rather than fully specify the utility functions: Type 1 and 3 beneficiaries will only react to <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> if they are overcompensated for the benefit loss. Type 2 beneficiaries {{do not need to}} be overcompensated, but their additional earnings and <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> together need to at least compensate for the loss in benefits. We use available survey and administrative data to determine the type, as well as their expected gains and losses from taking up <b>seed</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|R

30|$|Yet, we {{find that}} the {{interest}} in participating in the programme is very low. The overall take-up rate of <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> was just 0.5 %. Only 4 % of DI beneficiaries contacted their case worker within five months after the programme announcement to request more information. Doubling the amount of the lump-sum payment made no difference. We find slightly higher reactions to <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> for beneficiaries with disability degrees at “cash-cliffs”, who, according to our model, should be particularly attracted to take up <b>seed</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{our results}} {{document}} a low {{interest in the}} programme. Only 20 treated individuals (0.5 %) took up <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> within three years after sending out the offer. The take-up rate corresponds approximately to the overall rate of pension reductions due to increased earnings in previous years. 8 It is thus very likely that <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> generated wind-fall profits for a few recipients who would have increased employment and reduced their DI benefits anyway. Yet, <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> {{does not seem to}} incentivise take-up or expansion of employment among marginal recipients.|$|R

30|$|One {{possibility}} for our findings {{could relate to}} misclassification of beneficiaries into types. The correct classification of beneficiaries into types is crucial when estimating the overall response to <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> because our simulations suggest that type 2 beneficiaries should be much more responsive to <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> than type 1 and type 3 beneficiaries. We classify all beneficiaries who were employed prior to <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> and who had disability degrees close to a cash-cliff as type 2. Observed bunching at cash-cliffs prior to <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> announcement is consistent with labour supply responses to a non-linear budget set, but Fig.  3 also displays bunching at disability degrees that are not associated with higher DI benefits (for example, 80 % and 100 %). Clustering of disability degrees at decimal numbers may therefore also reflect rules of thumb that case workers use {{in the assessment of}} disability degrees. Consequently, the true proportion of type 2 beneficiaries may be much smaller than predicted.|$|R

30|$|The simple model also {{demonstrates}} {{the limits of}} financial incentives: <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> increases employment and reduces DI benefits for type 1 and type 3 beneficiaries {{only if they are}} overcompensated for the benefit loss. This implies that the savings in DI benefits due to the intervention are less than the <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> payments, which cannot be a cost-effective intervention {{from the perspective of the}} insurance system.|$|R

30|$|As {{interest}} in take-up of <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> {{during the first}} five months of the experiment fell far behind the FSIO’s expectations, the FSIO refrained from further data collection and delivery. By contacting the local DI offices we learned that 20 individuals or 0.5 % of the treatment group took up <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> during the field phase (September 2010 —August 2013). However, with a take-up rate of only 0.5 %, studying long-term outcomes other than DI take-up is unlikely to be meaningful.|$|R

While individuals choosing the former may have either very high disutility of work or low wages (both may reflect {{the consequences of a}} disability), individuals choosing the latter would work more if they did not lose disability benefits. The remaining individuals choose employment at the interior solution with the optimal level of hours of work {{to the left of the}} cash-cliff (type 3).|$|R
40|$|It’s the {{objective}} of this research to empirically identify the effect of some of the firm resources on <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> acquisition within early stage research based startups. This research uses 10 propositions to identify some of the fundamental resource combination to financial resource accumulation. Based on the resource theory, this research empirically tests for the effect of team atmosphere, team education, entrepreneurial leadership experience, cooperation with competitors, patents, commitment of entrepreneurial team and functional diversity on team likelihood of obtaining <b>seed</b> <b>capital.</b> Contrary to existing literature, this research finds that functional diversity of the entrepreneurial team is least likely to guarantee financial resource accumulation. This research further finds that firms able to nurture a combination of social, human and technological capital are more likely to acquire <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> thereby affirming that process of bootstrapping firm resources is socially complex, tacit and path dependent...|$|R
30|$|A third {{possible}} explanation for the low take-up rate is the way that the <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> programme was designed. More specifically, the programme tried to achieve two objectives: (1) increase employment and (2) reduce (guaranteed) DI benefits. It is very likely that many risk averse beneficiaries did not perceive the programme as advantageous as they would have faced a trade-off of certain DI benefits against a potentially higher, but more uncertain, work income. Risk aversion could thus significantly harm the expansion of employment and the take-up of <b>seed</b> <b>capital,</b> particularly for longer return-to-work periods. Consistent with this explanation, we find that beneficiaries who would have lost DI benefits (and the possibility to receive means-tested benefits) by taking up <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> are significantly less likely to call back and to schedule a meeting with their case worker.|$|R
