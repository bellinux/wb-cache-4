50|$|Stained glass {{has been}} a {{favourite}} art form since ancient times and continues to fascinate both the artist and the user even today. It has various applications and adds that special bit of glamour to your décor. With a thousand-year history, the term {{has been a}}pplied almost exclusively to the windows of Churches, Parsi Fire temples and other significant heritage buildings. Originally it was made in flat panels and used as windows, however, modern stained glass artists also work in three-dimensional formats. The design may be figurative or nonfigurative, may depict Biblical themes, history, literature; or present symbolic motifs including flora, fauna, landscape or abstracts designs. The usage of stained glass has moved far beyond its limitations of ecclesiastical use as in the early days. Stained glass {{can be used to}} add glamour to residences, offices, bungalows flats, offices, clubs and restaurants. It can be used in almost any part of the house or office; even in the kitchen. These glasses are available in various shapes, sizes and colours to fit in the frame of your imagination. Stained glass art has grown to become a popular form of art used in interior decoration and is not restricted to making only windows, doors and portico arches but several other decorative works of art too. Stained glass is also used to make trays, glasses, vases, lamp-shades, <b>screens,</b> <b>divider</b> panels, centre pieces, table tops and various excellent gifting items. The beauty of stained glass is that it allows the light to play truant and offers several perspectives as it does so. Stained glass catches the sun rays or the light present in interiors and work astounding magic with a beautiful interplay of colours, thus creating magical patterns in the room. They are now popular even with the trendier and funky generation.|$|R

Among {{them are}} {{a girl who}} is twenty-three with red hair, a dark-haired lawyer or aspiring politician for a hero, a secondary character predisposed toward speaking in quotations, a fan back chair, a Mandarin coat, a Chinese lacquer <b>screen</b> (room <b>divider),</b> New England as a setting or character trait (“New England granite”), and a black-and-white spotted dog. She also favored the surname [...] "Shaw", which was the maiden name of Herman Melville's wife, who {{was the daughter of}} noted Massachusetts jurist Lemuel Shaw. The middle name of both her sons is Melville. Given what is known of her life, such as her connections to New England, the name [...] "Shaw", and a predilection toward lawyers, it is possible that these recurring details are somewhat autobiographical.|$|R
