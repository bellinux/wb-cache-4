Those who urge the advantages of anonymity are either people who do not realise the <b>special</b> <b>peril</b> of our time or they are people who are profiting by it. It is true, but futile, for instance, {{to say that there is}} something noble in being nameless when a whole corporate body is bent on a consistent aim: as in an army or men building a cathedral. The point of modern newspapers is that there is no such corporate body and common aim; but each man can use the authority of the paper to further his own private fads and his own private finances.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, many women, {{and some}} men also, think the social {{status of women}} is just now in <b>special</b> <b>peril.</b> The late {{extension}} of the franchise has admitted to a share in framing our laws many thousands of men of that class which--whatever be their other virtues, and they are many--is most given to spending their wives' earnings in drink, and personally maltreating them; and least likely--to judge from the actions of certain trades--to admit women to free competition for employment. Further extension of the suffrage will, perhaps, in a very few years, admit many thousands more. And {{it is no wonder}} if refined and educated women, in an age which is disposed to see in the possession of a vote the best means of self-defence, should ask for votes, for the defence, not merely of themselves, but of their lowlier sisters, from the tyranny of men who are as yet--to the shame of the State--most of them altogether uneducated.|$|E
60|$|When Melmotte {{arrived at}} his own door {{with his wife and}} {{daughter}} he had heard nothing of the matter. That a man so vexed with affairs of money, so laden with cares, encompassed by such dangers, should be free from suspicion and fear it is impossible to imagine. That such burdens should be borne at all is a wonder to those whose shoulders have never been broadened for such work;--as is the strength of the blacksmith's arm to men who have never wielded a hammer. Surely his whole life must have been a life of terrors! But of any <b>special</b> <b>peril</b> to which he was at that moment subject, or of any embarrassment which might affect the work of the evening, he knew nothing. He placed his wife in the drawing-room and himself in the hall, and arranged his immediate satellites around him,--among whom were included the two Grendalls, young Nidderdale, and Mr Cohenlupe,--with a feeling of gratified glory. Nidderdale down at the House had heard the rumour, but had determined that he would not as yet fly from his colours. Cohenlupe had also come up from the House, where no one had spoken to him. Though grievously frightened during the last fortnight, he had not dared to be on the wing as yet. And, indeed, to what clime could such a bird as he fly in safety? He had not only heard,--but also knew very much, and was not prepared to enjoy the feast. Since they had been in the hall Miles had spoken dreadful words to his father. 'You've heard about it; haven't you?' whispered Miles. Lord Alfred, remembering his sister's question, became almost pale, but declared that he had heard nothing. 'They're saying all manner of things in the City;--forgery and heaven knows what. The Lord Mayor is not coming.' Lord Alfred made no reply. It was the philosophy of his life that misfortunes when they came should be allowed to settle themselves. But he was unhappy.|$|E

40|$|Two fearsome {{possibilities}} preoccupy thoughtful men {{everywhere in}} the world. These worries are unique to our own age and time. Lord Russell puts it succinctly, 2 ̆ 2 The world is faced, at the present day, with two antithetical dangers: (a) the human race may {{put an end to}} itself by a too lavish use of H bombs; and (b) the human population of our planet may increase to the point where only a starved and miserable existence is possible, except for a minority of powedul people. 2 ̆ 2 Each of these dangers has its own characteristics, its own <b>special</b> <b>perils,</b> and its own possibilities for prevention. Nuclear war would bring swift and complete destruction of life as we know it. Whether or not such a war occurs, seemingly depends upon the wisdom of a few trusted leaders. On the other hand, so it is said, starvation is a gradual and agonizing phenomenon, already stealthily engulfing the world. The extent to which we endure the slow and dehumanizing destruction that is synonymous with starvation, depends on the individual decisions of literally billions of human beings. The two threats are inter-related. A world in which one-third of the people live in extravagant opulence while two-thirds live in oppressive squalor is not conducive to political sta,bility. Such a world is particularly susceptible to violence, including mass nuclear destruction. There is little question that, as a rule, man 2 ̆ 7 s inclination towards aggressiveness declines in proportion to the spaciousness and comforts of his life...|$|R
40|$|Dispersed {{human populations}} inhabiting remote atolls across the {{tropical}} Pacific Ocean are reliant on {{the viability of}} thin freshwater lenses (FWLs) contained within the island coralline sediments for their survival. Yet FWLs are uniquely fragile and easily damaged by saline intrusion. Eustatic sea-level rise (SLR) and sea flooding generated by intense tropical cyclones therefore pose <b>special</b> <b>perils</b> for continued existence on atolls. In this work, mathematical modelling is {{used to examine the}} effects on an atoll freshwater lens of various projected long-term SLR scenarios (10, 20, and 40. cm). A cyclone-driven wave washover event is then simulated in order to observe the responses and recovery of the FWL, subsequent to the SLR scenarios imposed. A key attribute of our model design is the inclusion of a topographic depression containing a low-lying fresh swamp in the atoll islet interior (which is often ignored), where seawater accumulates during inundation. Results indicate that a 40. cm SLR produces a major impact: the FWL decreases in thickness by approximately 50 %, develops a brackish centre and contracts to a shrunken 'doughnut' morphology. Following cyclone inundation, observed salinity profiles are illuminating. Steep salinity gradients show how a strong saline plume forms at shallow depths, but also reveal the existence of an undisturbed fresh horizon beneath the salt plume under both present conditions and the modest 10. cm SLR scenario. Within the preserved fresh horizon, salt concentrations are maintained below 1. 5. g/L (i. e. within usable limits) for at least a year. In contrast, the diminished freshwater lenses that exist after 20 and 40. cm SLR then exhibit far less resilience to saline damage over comparable post-cyclone timeframes. The findings point towards Pacific atolls becoming increasingly uninhabitable long before their complete submergence by sea-level rise, owing to irrecoverable groundwater salinisation seriously reducing the availability of freshwater. © 2012 Elsevier B.
