Approval was given on 22 December 2007 for TIE to sign contracts with CAF to supply vehicles and BBS (a consortium of Bilfinger Berger and Siemens) {{to design and}} construct the network. Contract negotiations finished in April 2008, and construction started in June 2008. By this stage {{the cost of the}} project was estimated at £521 million. Funding problems and political disputes led to the <b>scaling</b> <b>back</b> of the original plans. In April 2009, the council cancelled phase 1b, citing revenue shortfall created by the economic slowdown to save an estimated £75 million. The Granton extension was also cancelled.|$|E
5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television. At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight <b>scaling</b> <b>back</b> of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat of}} attack from other European colonial powers {{prompted}} {{the directors of}} the Dutch West India Company to formulate a plan to protect the entrance to the Hudson River. In 1624, 30 families were sponsord by Dutch West India Company moving from Nut Island to Manhattan Island, where a citadel to contain Fort Amsterdam was being laid out by Cryn Frederickz van Lobbrecht at the direction of Willem Verhulst. By the end of 1625, the site had been staked out directly south of Bowling Green {{on the site of the}} present U.S. Custom House. The Mohawk-Mahican War in the Hudson Valley led the company to relocate even more settlers to the vicinity of the new Fort Amsterdam. In the end, colonizing was a prohibitively expensive undertaking, only partly subsidized by the fur trade. This led to a <b>scaling</b> <b>back</b> of the original plans. By 1628, a smaller fort was constructed with walls containing a mixture of clay and sand.|$|E
25|$|Australia's special {{investor}} visa program {{introduced in}} 2012 encouraged Chinese investment. The visa program fast tracks visas and eases the residency requirement {{for a permanent}} visa for those ready to invest over 5 million Australian dollars into state government bonds, specific infrastructure and property investments. Wealthy Chinese interested in retirement houses, top schools and cleaner air, began looking to Australia after Canada started <b>scaling</b> <b>back</b> it’s investment visa program in 2012 and eliminated it's main investor visa program in 2014.

By 2017, almost 90% of the more than 1,300 foreigners who used Australia's special investor visa program were from China. Australia also has an investor visa program with a required investment of 1 million Australian dollars but with more restrictions and a lengthier period of time to get a permanent visa.|$|E
