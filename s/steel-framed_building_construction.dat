40|$|In {{a recent}} study at the National Research Council of Canada, the direct {{airborne}} and impact sound insulation of steel-framed floors were investigated. This study forms {{one part of a}} project focusing on the direct and flanking sound transmission in lightweight <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings</b> for mid-rise <b>constructions.</b> Mid-rise constructions (4 to 6 stories) using lightweight steel framing {{are becoming more and more}} common in North America. The floors investigated in this study consisted of 38 mm lightweight gypsum concrete on a corrugated steel deck, fastened to steel joists with a gypsum board ceiling. The parameters investigated included the joist depth and the configuration of the ceiling. In addition, the influence of various floor coverings was examined. The airborne sound transmission loss was measured according to ASTM E 90, and the light impact sound insulation was measured according to ASTM E 492. The results are presented and discussed.

40|$|A {{life-cycle}} inventory {{model for}} the office buildings is developed in this paper. The environmental effects of two different building structures, steel and concrete, are intercompared. The {{results show that the}} <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> is superior to the concrete-framed building on the following two indexes, the life-cycle energy consumption and environmental emissions of building materials. It is found that the life-cycle energy consumption of building materials per area in the <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> is 24. 9 % as that in the concrete-framed building, whereas, on use phase, the energy consumption and emissions of <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> are both larger than those of concrete-framed building. As a result, lower energy consumption and environmental emissions are achieved by the concrete-framed building compared with the <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> on the whole life-cycle of building. The present study also provides a good method of assessing the performance of energy saving and environmental protection of different building structures based on a whole life-cycle...|$|R

40|$|Tensile {{membrane}} {{action is}} a load carrying mechanism in reinforced concrete f-loors at very large deflection. Under ths action, the load carried by the reinforced concrete floor can be many {{times higher than the}} design load carrying capacity determined at small deflections. Recent full scale fire tests and fire accidents in <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings</b> with reinforced concrete floors have identified tensile membrane action as the main load carrying mechanism. This mechanism is able to transfer the applied loads on the floor to the supporting columns when the supporting steel beams to the floor are damaged and have lost their load carrying capacities The understanding of tensi!e membrane action in reinforced concrete floors has a significant implic tion for the fire protection of <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings</b> reinforced concrete floors. This is because the supporting steel beams may be allowed to fzil without endangering the safety of the !e bui!ding. Consequently, fire protection to these stee! beams can be reduced or eliminated. This paper describes in some detail an analytical procedure developed by the author for predicting tensile membrane action in reinforced concrete floors. An example is given which shows how to use this method to determine the fire resistance of a <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building.</b> KEY WORDS: tensile membrane action, reinforced concrete slabs, fire resistance, fire protection, <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{floors are}} widely used in <b>building</b> <b>construction,</b> {{but there is little}} detailed design guidance on their application in <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings.</b> Traditionally the steel beams have been designed to support the precast slabs on their top flange. However, there are an increasing number of composite frames and slim floor constructions where the precast slabs are designed to interact structurally with the steel frame. Composite action can be developed by welded shear connectors attached to the steel beams and by transverse reinforcement; however, this form of construction is currently outside the provisions of the current codes of practice. This paper discusses some of the particular issues that affect this form of construction, and presents design guidance using the Eurocode methodology...|$|R
