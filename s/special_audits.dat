30|$|Internal {{assessment}} within units or departments, {{which should}} employ standard audit methodology, is recommended as a systematic and continuing activity {{with a significant}} annual output of departmental audit data. Emphasis is however placed on external clinical audits whereby an external auditing body or auditors carry out the audit. A cycle of external audits carried out every 5  years is recommended. To carry this out, the guidelines recommend the development of <b>special</b> <b>auditing</b> organisations. These should preferably be non-profit organisations, if possible, supported by professional and/or scientific societies. These auditing organisations should be accredited by a national accreditation body. International audit services may be exploited where no national systems exist.
