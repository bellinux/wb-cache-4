25|$|A mercury {{arc valve}} {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current. Rectifiers of this type were used in electric motor power supplies for industry, in electric railways, streetcars, and diesel-electric locomotives.

40|$|Hybrid {{renewable}} energy is an emerging notable choice in microgrids' formation {{to overcome the}} problem of intermittency that is usually raised while using a single {{renewable energy}} source. Generally, the hybrid renewable energy source produce DC power, {{which is to be}} converted to AC power to supply to loads and integrating with utility grid. Hence, the efficacy of a microgrid relies on its DC/AC power conversion. For DC/AC conversion, the contemporary research work focuses on the design of power electronics based <b>static</b> multilevel <b>inverter</b> configurations and the traditional electrical machines based retrofitted configurations. However, all these <b>static</b> and rotary <b>inverter</b> configurations possess their inherent limitations, which affect the fruitful operation of the microgrid. Keeping this conviction in mind, this paper analyzes the effect of <b>static</b> and rotary <b>inverters</b> on the microgrid operation.

Various performance indices are obtained for the considered static/rotary inverters and presented a comprehensive analysis as a result...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of wind-driven generators {{in the last few}} years has resulted in special generator designs which ope) :ate at varying speed and frequency, utilising <b>static</b> <b>inverters</b> for conversion of direct to alternating current. The potential application of this emerging technology to hydropower production schemes has recently received considerable attention, as witnessed, for example,by the recent DOE-EPRI (1983) workshop on applications of variable-speed generators in hydropower. Typically, a variable speed hydroelectric scheme would consist essentially of the turbine, a synchronous generator (variable speed and frequency), a rectifier for the generator output, an inverter at the powerhouse and alternating current transmission, or direct current transmission, and an inverter at the substation [...] Regardless of the speed variations, the inverters have the ability to maintain virtually constant frequency and voltage for any given load.

40|$|The {{frequency}} droop {{response of}} conventional turbine driven synchronous generators {{with respect to}} load increases is normally used {{in order to have}} stable operating characteristics for multiple generators operating in parallel over large geographical regions. This presents a challenge for renewable energy sources that interface to the transmission grid through <b>static</b> <b>inverters</b> that do not exhibit an intrinsic frequency droop characteristic. This paper provides a technique for designing optimal load frequency controllers as transmission line inverters fed from renewable energy sources that allows for fast dynamic response due to variable solar and wind conditions while maintain stability to interconnected synchronous generators. A control technique based on LQG optimization theory is presented. Detailed analysis of a three-area system in a region of mixed wind and solar photovoltaic sources is modeled in a manner that confirms the effectiveness of the disclosed load-frequency control method.
