MethodsThirty-six LAs were performed in 32 patients (including four patients with <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> bilateral adrenalectomies) {{over a period of}} 3 years, from May 2002 to 2005. Patients were divided into two groups based on the tumour size, i. e. masses less than 6 cm (group I) and masses 6 cm or more (group II). The results with respect to mean (95 % confidence interval) operative time, blood loss, postoperative course and complications were compared. ResultsGroup II included 11 LAs performed in 10 patients including one bilateral LA for bilateral phaeochromocytomas in multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 A. The mean size (± standard deviation) of masses was 8 cm (± 1. 47). In comparison, 22 patients in group I underwent 25 adrenalectomies (including three bilateral <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>procedures</b> for Cushing's syndrome). The mean size of masses was 4. 1 cm (± 1. 27). There were eight and six phaeochromocytomas in groups I and II, respectively.

In 152 cases, we also found bile duct stones. 150 of these were treated in a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>procedure.</b> We divided our patients into 2 groups: Group A was younger than 65 (104 patients); Group B was 65 or older (46 patients). We retrospectively compared sex, ASA score, conversion rate, success rate, post-operative complications, hospital stay, and treatment method. We had no intra-operative mortality. 1 patient in Group B, heart condition (ASA 4), died with multiple organ failure (MOF) 10 days after his operation. ASA score: 3. 5  ±  0. 5 in A vs 2  ±  0. 9 in B (P 0. 001), post-operative complications 6 % in A vs 18. 1 % in B (P 0. 0325) and hospital stay 4. 1  ±  2. 3 in A vs 9. 5  ±  5. 5 in B (P 0. 0001) were significantly higher in Group B. No differences were found in term of success rate: 94 % in A vs 90 % in B (P 0. 4944). The procedure used to obtain the clearance of the bile duct showed a different success rate across the two groups: for the patients under 65 years old, trans-cystic clearance (TC-CBDE) was successful in 90 % of cases, and only 51 % for those older than 65, where we had to recall 49 % for laparo-endoscopic rendez-vous (RV-IOERC) (P 0. 0014).

40|$|Background : Articular {{cartilage}} lesions {{with the}} inherent limited healing potential {{are difficult to}} treat and thus remain a challenging problem for orthopaedic surgeons. Regenerative treatment techniques, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), are promising as a treatment option to restore hyaline-like cartilage tissue in damaged articular surfaces, {{as opposed to the}} traditional reparative procedures (e. g. bone marrow stimulation – microfracture), which promote a fibrocartilage formation with lower tissue biomechanical properties and poorer clinical results. ACI technique has undergone several advances and is constantly improving. The new concept of cartilage tissue preservation uses tissue-engineering technologies, combining new biomaterials as a scaffold, application of growth factors, use of stem cells, and mechanical stimulation. The recent development of new generations of ACI uses a cartilage-like tissue in a 3 -dimensional culture system that is based on the use of biodegradable material which serves as a temporary scaffold for the in vitro growth and subsequent implantation into the cartilage defect. For clinical practice, <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>procedures</b> appear attractive to reduce cost and patient morbidity. Finally, modern concept of tissue engineering facilitates hyaline-like cartilage formation and a permanent treatment of cartilage lesions.

40|$|Basilar {{invagination}} (BI) and atlanto-axial dislocation (AAD) {{are mostly}} irreducible {{in nature and}} are quite complex pathologies to manage. Traditionally they required a trans-oral excision of odontoid process followed by a posterior instrumented fusion. This has been challenged recently, where a <b>single</b> <b>staged</b> posterior only <b>procedure</b> addresses both reduction and decompression in the same sitting. This evidence was based on earlier publication and also on the author′s own experience, where he described a new technique (distraction, compression, extension and reduction), which performed for the 1 st time a 2 -axis movement in the cranio-vertebral junction (CVJ) allowing effective reduction of both AAD and BI.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{granular}} {{materials are}} applied in geotechnical works, like embankments and road pavement layers, {{one of the}} most relevant engineering properties in stability analysis is ultimate shear strength. In geotechnical engineering, the triaxial test is {{one of the most}} reliable methods available for determining ultimate shear strength. In this test, a soil specimen, compacted in laboratory or collected from exploratory soil borings, is generally used. In order to determine the strength parameters, at least 3 identical specimens are required in this test. Having 3 identical specimens, a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> triaxial test <b>procedure</b> is used. If not, multistage triaxial test procedure is used to eliminate the effects of soil variability in the results. In this case, several confining pressures are applied to the same specimen. Although multistage triaxial tests have been used for soils for a long time, there is still a lack of test results for unbound granular non-traditional materials. This paper presents triaxial test results obtained from a Portuguese unbound granular non-traditional material (named as Inert Steel Aggregate for Construction - ISAC). The triaxial tests were carried out using multistage and <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> techniques. As the results are quite well comparable, it is concluded that it is possible to determine shear strength parameters with just one specimen. Consequently, the research conducted has validated the use of multistage triaxial tests as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to the conventional <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> triaxial test in the mechanical characterization of unbound granular materials...|$|R
40|$|Traditional <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> design {{optimality}} <b>procedures</b> {{can be used}} to efficiently generate {{data for}} an assumed model y = f(x (m),β) + ε. The model assumptions include the form of f, the set of regressors, x (m), and the distribution of ε. The nature of the response, y, often provides information about the model form (f) and the error distribution. It is more difficult to know, apriori, the specific set of regressors which will best explain the relationship between the response and a set of design (control) variables x. Misspecification of x (m) will result in a design which is efficient, but for the wrong model. A Bayesian two stage design approach makes it possible to efficiently design experiments when initial knowledge of x (m) is poor. This is accomplished by using a Bayesian optimality criterion in the first stage which is robust to model uncertainty. Bayesian analysis of first stage data reduces uncertainty associated with x (m), enabling the remaining design points (second stage design) to be chosen with greater efficiency. The second stage design is then generated from an optimality procedure which incorporates the improved model knowledge. Using this approach, numerous two <b>stage</b> design <b>procedures</b> have been developed for the normal linear model. Extending this concept, a Bayesian design augmentation procedure has been developed for th...|$|R

Results: A total of 40 patients - 34 males and six females, in {{the age group of}} two months to six years were studied. Staged procedure was done in 39 patients; one child with recto vestibular fistula underwent <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>procedure.</b> All the patients withstood surgery well. One patient required conversion due to problems in gaining enough length for the distal rectum in a patient with rectovesical fistula so colostomy was closed and re-located at a proximal splenic flexure.

One-stage procedure includes enterolithotomy, cholecystectomy and repair of fistula at the same setting, whereas staged procedure includes enterolithotomy alone, with fistula repair at a later stage. This study aims to determine factors influencing choice of surgical procedure in Patients with gallstone ileus. Methods : Data was collected for Patients diagnosed with gallstone ileus between 1990 and 2005.

The mean operative time was 126 +/- 23 minutes in Group 1 and 245 +/- 54. 4 minutes in Group 2. There was no mortality, three Patients in Group 1 had superficial wound infection, and one Patient in Group 2 had injury to the common bile duct necessitating hepaticojejunostomy. The mean follow-up period was 3. 5 +/- 1. 5 years. None of the Patients in both groups had recurrent symptoms requiring further intervention. Conclusions: Choice of surgical procedure was largely determined by the clinical status of the Patient. Single-stage procedure was performed in haemodynamically-stable Patients, while enterolithotomy alone was considered sufficient for unstable Patients...|$|E
40|$|When {{granular}} {{materials are}} applied in geotechnical works, like embankments and road pavement layers, {{one of the}} most relevant engineering properties in stability analysis is ultimate shear strength. In geotechnical engineering, the triaxial test is {{one of the most}} reliable methods available for determining ultimate shear strength. In this test, a soil specimen, compacted in laboratory or collected from exploratory soil borings, is generally used. In order to determine the strength parameters, at least 3 identical specimens are required in this test. Having 3 identical specimens, a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> triaxial test <b>procedure</b> is used. If not, multistage triaxial test procedure is used to eliminate the effects of soil variability in the results. In this case, several confining pressures are applied to the same specimen. Although multistage triaxial tests have been used for soils for a long time, there is still a lack of test results for unbound granular non-traditional materials. This paper presents triaxial test results obtained from a Portuguese unbound granular non-traditional material (named as Inert Steel Aggregate for Construction - ISAC). The triaxial tests were carried out using multistage and <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> techniques. As the results are quite well comparable, it is concluded that it is possible to determine shear strength parameters with just one specimen. Consequently, the research conducted has validated the use of multistage triaxial tests as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to the conventional <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> triaxial test in the mechanical characterization of unbound granular materials.

40|$|Introduction: Radial {{bone loss}} {{associated}} with gross manus valgus deformity {{can be managed}} by open reduction internal fixation using intervening strut bone graft, callus distraction using ring or monoaxial fixator, and achieving union by distraction histogenesis. These methods are particularly suitable when bone loss is small. <b>Single</b> or <b>staged</b> <b>procedure</b> is described for congenital {{as well as in}} acquired extensive bone loss of radius. Distraction through radial proximal to distal segments, to achieve reduction of distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ), is also described in acquired cases. In the present series, functional results of distraction through ulna to 2 nd metacarpal is studied alongwith, functional status of hand, stability of wrist, level of patient′s satisfaction are also studied. Materials and Methods: 7 unilateral cases of radial loss (M = 5, F = 2) affecting 4 right hands of mean age 17 years (range 9 to 24 years) were included in this study. They were treated by distracting through ulna to 2 nd metacarpal to achieve DRUJ alignment in first stage. Subsequently ulna was osteotomised and translated to distal stump of radius. It was then fixed to the distal radial remnant in 30 ° pronation in dominant and 30 ° supination non dominant hands. Results: Union was achieved in all cases associated with beneficial cross union of distal ulna. Hand functions improved near to normal, with fully corrected stable wrist joint, hypertrophied ulna and without recurrence. All of them had practically complete loss of forearm rotations, however patients were fully satisfied. Conclusion: This method is particularly suitable when associated with 6 cm or more radial bone loss. But when loss is small, sacrifice of one bone may not be justifiable...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to report the {{functional}} and cosmetic outcome of <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> surgical <b>procedure</b> for correction of the classic components of Blepharophimosis syndrome. Materials and Methods: We report a retrospective case file review of 11 patients with Blepharophimosis syndrome operated between July 2004 and April 2008. Each patient had undergone the correction of epicanthus inversus, telecanthus, palpebral phimosis, and bilateral ptosis as a single-stage surgical procedure. Patients were examined and photographed before and after surgery. The mean follow-up was 3 years (range 2 - 6 years). Results: A total of 11 patients (8 males, 3 females) with a mean age of 9 years (range 6 [...] 22 years) were reviewed. The surgical outcome was assessed both functionally and cosmetically. The mean preoperative visual acuity was 0. 729 ± 0. 316 SD and the mean postoperative visual acuity was 0. 856 ± 0. 277 SD (P < 0. 0428). There was a statistically significant decrease of astigmatism following ptosis correction (P< 0. 05), improvement of telecanthus (P< 0. 0001) in terms of IICD (inner intercanthal distance), and HPFL (horizontal palpebral fissure length) (P= 0. 019) along with improvement of the superior visual field. The mean preoperative and postoperative IICD was 3 ± 0. 33 SD and 2. 418 ± 0. 189 SD, respectively. There was also a significant postoperative improvement of ptosis (P< 0. 01), as measured by IPFH (vertical interpalpebral fissure height). All the patients had a stable functional and cosmetic result after a mean follow-up period of 3 years. Conclusion: Single-stage surgical correction of the classic anomalies of Blepharophimosis syndrome provides stable and successful long-term results...|$|R
