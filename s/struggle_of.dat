5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> the eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and {{its refusal to}} psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} of Nicopolis, the Ottomans {{occupied}} Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 {{by taking advantage of}} the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in {{the battle of}} Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was forced to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the <b>struggle</b> <b>of</b> good versus evil.|$|E

25|$|Trotskyists {{differ on}} the extent to which this is true today, but even the most {{orthodox}} tend to recognise in the late twentieth century a new development in the revolts of the rural poor, the self-organising <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> the landless, and many other struggles which in some ways reflect the militant united organised <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> the working class, and which to various degrees do not bear the marks of class divisions typical of the heroic peasant <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town and city based working class struggle is central to the task of a successful socialist revolution, linked to these <b>struggles</b> <b>of</b> the rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces, and that the collective consciousness it achieves as a result is an essential ingredient of the socialist reconstruction of society.|$|R
