40|$|This paper {{describes}} a motion adaptive indexing scheme for efficient evaluation of moving queries (MQs) over moving objects. It uses {{the concept of}} motion-sensitive bounding boxes to model the dynamic behavior of both moving objects and moving queries. Instead of indexing frequently changing object positions, we index less frequently changing motion <b>sensitive</b> bounding <b>boxes</b> together with the motion functions of the objects. This significantly decreases the number of update operations performed on the indexes. We use predictive query results to optimistically precalculate query results, thus decreasing the number of search operations performed on the indexes. More importantly, we propose a motion adaptive indexing method. Instead of using fixed parameters for motion <b>sensitive</b> bounding <b>boxes,</b> we automatically adapt the sizes of the motion <b>sensitive</b> bounding <b>boxes</b> to the dynamic motion behaviors of the corresponding individual objects. As a result, the moving queries can be evaluated faster by performing fewer IOs. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of guaranteed safe radius and optimistic safe radius to extend our motion adaptive indexing scheme to evaluating moving continual k-nearest neighbor (kNN) queries. Our experiments show that the proposed motion adaptive indexing scheme is efficient for evaluation of both moving continual range queries and moving continual kNN queries. ...|$|R

Each disc features a full live set from either April or November 2001, {{making it the}} most comprehensive live document of any era of The Fall's long career thus far. The discs are not arranged chronologically. Due to the brief timespan, there is considerable repetition - {{the bulk of the}} material is drawn from 2000's The Unutterable and 2001's Are You Are Missing Winner. As {{the use of the word}} bootleg implies, the sound quality varies but it is generally superior. A handful of tracks from the first 2 discs also feature on the 2G+2 album.|$|R

40|$|We model mock {{observations}} of collisionless N-body disc-disc mergers {{with the same}} axisymmetric orbit superposition program {{that has been used}} to model elliptical galaxies in Coma. The remnants sample representatively the shape distribution of disc-disc mergers, including the most extreme cases, like highly prolate, maximally triaxial and dominantly oblate objects. The aim of our study is to better understand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed masses and stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric, whether the axisymmetry assumption then leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised in models of real galaxies. The mass recovery at the half-light radius depends on viewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct total masses with an accuracy between 20 percent (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3 percent (oblate remnant). Masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by up to 50 percent. Deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants are strongly triaxial or prolate. Luminous mass-to-light ratios are <b>sensitive</b> to <b>box</b> orbits in the remnants. Box orbit...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermal control}} system of a {{spacecraft}} {{is used to}} maintain all subsystems within their temperature limits. It {{must be able to}} deal with different operational states and orbital environments. Theory provides knowledge about the quality of effects of certain designs options, but for a complex system like a spacecraft, simulations are needed for quantification. This thesis has two main purposes. Critical parts concerning thermal control in the current design are identified and the thermal design for NPSAT 1 is improved. Furthermore this developed design is analyzed for being appropriate and temperature-time predictions are developed. Both design objectives are accomplished with the help of EDS I-DEAS with Maya's TMG. After defining all constraints and requirements, a thermal FE model is developed, documented, and verified. Simulations with this model are used to track insufficiencies concerning the thermal design. With their help, different design approaches are analyzed to obtain sensitivity information. Proposals for design changes are made. Four worst-case scenarios are defined and the developed design is evaluated with their help. Temperature-time histories are obtained with an emphasis on the temperature <b>sensitive</b> electronic <b>boxes.</b> A special analysis is provided for the connection of the solar cells to the structure...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{sequence}} of an insertion element originally found in Rhizobium sullae, the nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbiont of the legume Hedysarum coronarium, we devised three primer pairs (inbound, outbound and internal primers) for the following applications: (a) tracing genetic relatedness within rhizobia using a method independent of ribosomal inheritance, based on the presence and conservation of IS elements; (b) achieve sensitive and reproducible bacterial fingerprinting; (c) enable a fast and unambiguous detection of rhizobia at the species level. In terms of taxonomy, while in line with part of the 16 S rRNA gene- and glutamine synthetase I-based clustering, the tools appeared nonetheless more coherent with the actual geographical ranges of origin of rhizobial species, strengthening the European-Mediterranean connections and discerning them from the asian and american taxa. The fingerprinting performance of the outward-pointing primers, designed upon the inverted repeats, was shown {{to be at least}} as <b>sensitive</b> as <b>BOX</b> PCR, and to be functional on a universal basis with all 13 bacterial species tested. The primers designed on the internal part of the transposase gene instead proved highly species-specific for R. sullae, enabling selective distinction from its most related species, and testing positive on every R. sullae strain examined, fulfilling the need of PCR-mediated species identification. A general use of other IS elements for a combined approach to rhizobial taxonomy and ecology is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{pathways}} {{that could}} account for observed rapid rates of transcription reinitiation were explored. A nuclear extract system was established in which reinitiation rates were observed to be kinetically facilitated and in which the rate was <b>sensitive</b> to TATA <b>box</b> mutation. Kinetic facilitation of functional complex formation could be mimicked by pre-assembling activator and certain general transcription factors on the promoter and then adding nuclear extract. The minimal activated complex with this characteristic contained general factors TFIID and TFIIA. The ability of the TFIID:TFIIA complex to complete assembly rapidly was reduced by the same TATA box mutation that reduced reinitiation rate. Band shift experiments also showed that this same mutation lowered {{the stability of the}} TBP:TFIIA complex on the DNA. The results suggest that TATA-dependent variations in retention of the TFIID:TFIIA complex after release of the polymerase could be a primary determinant of reinitiation rate, allowing diversity in promoter strength to be related to diversity in TATA element sequences...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric {{levels of}} O 3 have {{historically}} exceeded the official annual Mexican standards within the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) in NE Mexico. High-frequency and high-precision measurements of tropospheric O 3, NOy, NO 2, NO, CO, SO 2, PM 10 and PM 2. 5 {{were made at}} the Obispado monitoring site near the downtown MMA from September 2012 to August 2013. The seasonal cycles of O 3 and NOy are driven by changes in meteorology {{and to a lesser}} extent by variations in primary emissions. The NOy levels were positively correlated with O 3 precursors and inversely correlated with O 3 and wind speed. Recorded data were used to assess the O 3 -Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) -NOx system’s sensitivity through an observational-based approach. The photochemical indicator O 3 /NOy was derived from measured data during the enhanced O 3 production period (12 : 00 – 18 : 00 Central Daylight Time (CDT), GMT- 0500). The O 3 /NOy ratios calculated for this time period showed that the O 3 production within the MMA is VOC <b>sensitive.</b> A <b>box</b> model simulation of production rates of HNO 3 (PHNO 3) and total peroxides (Pperox) carried out for O 3 episodes in fall and spring confirmed the VOC sensitivity within the MMA environment. No significant differences were observed in O 3 /NOy from weekdays to weekends or for PHNO 3 /Pperox ratios, confirming the limiting role of VOCs in O 3 production within the MMA. The ratified photochemical regime observed may allow the environmental authorities to revise and verify the current policies for air quality control within the MMA...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} has shown that robust procedures for testing variances have become available. The two best procedures are one proposed by O'Brien (1981) and another by Brown and Forsy the (1974). An exami-nation of these procedures {{for a wide variety of}} populations confirms their robustness and indicates that optimal power can usually be obtained by applying a test for kurtosis to aid in the decision between these two proce-dures. Recently robust tests of variance (scale) have been reported (Brown & Forsythe, 1974; O'Brien, 1981) and have been found to give good power for a variety of population distributions (Algina, Olejnik, & Ocanto, 1989; Conover, Johnson, & Johnson, 1981; Olejnik & Algina, 1987; Ramsey & Brailsford, 1990). Traditional tests of variance such as the homogeneity of variance F (HVF) test can be very simple, requiring the calculation of an F ratio as the ratio of two sample variances. The HVF test has long been known to be extremely <b>sensitive</b> to kurtosis (<b>Box,</b> 1953; Scheffe, 1959). Eve...|$|R

The aim is to better understand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed masses and stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric, whether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised in models of real galaxies.

Masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by up to 50 %. Deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants are strongly triaxial or prolate. Luminous M/L are <b>sensitive</b> to <b>box</b> orbits in the remnants. Box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle. Reconstructed luminous M/L and central masses follow this variation. Luminous M/L are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2. 5). Respective dark halos in the models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again on viewing angle. Reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle and on the orbital composition of the remnant. We construct N-body realisations of the Schwarzschild models to discuss chaotic orbits and the virial equilibrium in our models. Apparently flattened, rotating ellipticals of intermediate mass are likely close to both, axial symmetry and edge-on orientation. Our results imply that Schwarzschild models allow a reconstruction of their masses and stellar anisotropies with high accuracy.

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae U 6 RNA gene (SNR 6), {{which is}} {{transcribed}} by RNA polymerase III, has an unusual combination of promoter elements: an upstream TATA box, an intragenic A block, and a downstream B block. In tRNA genes, the A and B blocks are binding {{sites for the}} transcription initiation factor TFIIIC, which positions TFIIIB a fixed distance upstream of the A block. However, in vitro transcription of SNR 6 with purified components requires neither TFIIIC nor the A and B blocks, presumably because TFIIIB recognizes the upstream sequences directly. Here we demonstrate that TFIIIB placement on SNR 6 in vivo is directed primarily by the TFIIIC-binding elements rather than by upstream sequences. We show that the A block is a stronger start site determinant than the upstream sequences when the two are uncoupled by an insertion mutation. Furthermore, while TFIIIC-independent in vitro transcription of SNR 6 is highly <b>sensitive</b> to TATA <b>box</b> point mutations, in vivo initiation on SNR 6 is only marginally sensitive to such mutations unless the A block is mutated. Intriguingly, a deletion downstream of the U 6 RNA coding region that reduces A-to-B block spacing also increases in vivo dependence on the TATA box. Moreover, this deletion results in the appearance of micrococcal nuclease-hypersensitive sites in the TFIIIB chromatin footprint, indicating that TFIIIB binding is disrupted by a mutation 150 bp distant. This and additional chromatin footprinting data suggest that SNR 6 is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that facilitates the TFIIIC-dependent binding of TFIIIB...|$|R
40|$|This note {{summarizes}} the main {{lessons learned from}} govern-ment efforts, supported by national and international ex-perts, including the World Bank, to restore credibility to the official methodology for poverty measurement in Colombia. These lessons are valuable for both low- and middle-income countries that might need to face {{the difficult task of}} revising their official poverty methodology, or any other politically <b>sensitive</b> indicator (see <b>box</b> I for a summary of the lessons learned). The World Bank’s engagement in this process had four primary objectives: (i) ensure that poverty figures are backed by international practices; (ii) help build interagency consen-sus and foster transparency; (iii) lend credibility as an active member of a poverty committee; and (iv) share knowledge gained through participation in similar regional experiences. Providing clarity and transparency on the technical challenges of poverty measurement enables both country governments In the mid- 2000 s, poverty measurement in Colombia was at a standstill. A dated poverty measurement methodology was clashing with improvements in the national household survey system. As a result, official poverty rates showed volatile trends, and a weak communication strategy produced an unconvincing storyline, which further resulted in the rapid deterioration of indicator credibility. This happened during a period of high and sustained growth that also included a number of poverty reduction interventions, such as the flagship program Familias en Accion and the Unidos strategy. The public debate on poverty lost focus and moved from substantial policy discussions to technical measurement methods. and the Bank to focus their attention on a more fruitful dis-cussion of poverty trends and policy implications...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{number and}} quality of {{published}} scientific articles {{are among the most}} important measures of a scientist’s productivity. The increasing pressure to publish was found to be associated with unethical research practices and misuse of authorship. In an attempt to ensure honest practices, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) defined contributions making a person eligible for authorship on a scientific article. However assessment of authorship contribution is often based on unreliable questionnaires and many researchers in biomedicine do not agree with ICMJE criteria or do not know what they are. We performed a cross-sectional study to analyze medical students’, graduate students’ and doctors’ and medical teachers’ perceptions of research contributions as criteria for authorship in relation to the ICMJE authorship criteria. Another cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the association between authors' perceived importance of different contributions for authorship and the level of their participation in that contribution category for manuscripts submitted to a general medical journal. The aim of last study was to assess if the use of different formats for the disclosure of authorship contributions influenced authors’ compliance with the ICMJE criteria for authorship. [...] - Methods In the first cross-sectional study, we asked medical students with (n = 152) or without (n = 85) prior instruction on ICMJE criteria, graduate students/doctors (n = 125) and medical teachers (n = 112) to rate the importance of 11 contributions for authorship. They also reported single contributions eligible for authorship and acceptable combinations of two or three qualifying contributions. The second study included authors (n= 1181) of 265 manuscripts submitted to the Croatian Medical Journal who were asked to rate their contribution in 11 categories in the preparation of the submitted manuscript (0 – none to 4 – full) and to rate the importance of the same contributions as authorship qualifications (0 – none to 4 – full). They were randomly allocated into 3 groups as follows: the first group (n= 90 manuscripts, n= 404 authors) first received the contribution disclosure form and then the importance rating questionnaire; the second one (n= 88 manuscripts, n= 382 authors) first received the questionnaire and then the contribution disclosure form, whereas the third group (n= 87 manuscripts, n= 395 authors) received both questionnaires at the same time. We compared the perceived importance of contribution categories of authors who did and did not declare a specific contribution, authors who were identified as deserving and non-deserving authors according to the ICMJE criteria, and authors who reported ≤ 3 contribution categories with those who reported > 3 contribution categories. The third study included 865 authors of 181 manuscripts submitted to the Croatian Medical Journal from January to July 2005. These authors were randomly allocated into 2 groups as follows: 456 authors (94 manuscripts) received an ordinal rating form to rate their contributions to the submitted manuscript in 12 categories on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (full), whereas 409 authors (87 manuscripts) received a binary rating form to mark the categories in which they made a contribution. [...] - Results Our study showed that Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation, and Drafting of article formed the most important cluster in all four groups. Students without prior instruction rated Critical revision and Final approval lower than the other three groups. Final approval {{was a part of the}} least important cluster in all groups except among students with instruction. In the study with authors from Croatian Medical Journal, we received responses from 1014 (85. 9 %) authors of 235 manuscripts. The authors who declared the contribution to a specific category rated it as more important for authorship than those authors who did not contribute to the same category. Authors identified as deserving authors according to ICMJE criteria rated all contribution categories higher than the authors identified as non-deserving authors. The same was true for authors who declared > 3 contribution categories in comparison with those with ≤ 3 reported contributions, except for Administrative or technical or logistic support, Obtaining of funding, and Provision of study materials or patients. The ordinal rating form identified twice as many authors (87. 9 %) as meeting the ICMJE criteria in comparison with the binary rating form (39. 2 %, P< 0. 001). The group answering the ordinal rating form also had 5 times more manuscripts (71. 6 %) with all authors meeting the ICMJE criteria than the binary rating form group (15. 5 %, P< 0. 001). The proportion of authors who reported contributions on each item on the binary rating form was similar to the proportion of authors who reported at least moderate participation to the same items on the ordinal rating form except Final approval of the article. [...] - Conclusions Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation, and Drafting of article were recognized as the most important ICMJE criteria by all participants. They can be considered independent of previous instruction or experience. Final approval and Critical revision should be actively taught as important authorship criteria to future scientists. Authors who did not make a substantial contribution to submitted manuscript evaluated all contributions in manuscript preparation lower than their coworkers who contributed more. Ordinal scales for reporting authors’ contributions to manuscripts were more <b>sensitive</b> than tick <b>boxes</b> for assessing the appropriateness of authorship. The exception was the Final approval of the article, which should be considered a dichotomous variable and thus considered separately...|$|R
