5|$|The first turuma, Norden, was c. 35m (116ft) {{long and}} 8m (26.5ft) wide with {{a draft of}} 3.3m (11ft). By the third ship, the Lodbrok (1771), the hull had been {{expanded}} to 38.5m (126ft) by 9.5m (31ft) and remained roughly the same. The armament was considerably heavier {{than that of the}} galleys, or the smaller udemas and pojomas. It had one full gundeck of 22 (24 in the ships built before 1790) 12-pounders in a regular broadside arrangement, firing through gunports. On the forecastle deck facing <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> were two 18-pounders. For close-range action it carried another up to 24 3-pound swivel guns along the railings. In addition, there was also two 12-pound stern chasers.|$|E
5|$|After two failed {{attempts}} {{to capture the}} fort by <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> attacks, the British resorted to attrition tactics. On 28 November, instead of launching another infantry assault, the fort was encircled from all sides and placed under siege. This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering the fort. Mawbey then instructed his gunners, by now strongly reinforced, to fire into the fort. He also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort's external water source. The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water, stored in a portico, were destroyed in the bombardment. The eastern and northern walls of the fort were razed to the ground. The continuous bombardment also caused {{three of the four}} cannons installed on the fort's battlements to fall outside the fort, while the other fell inside. The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable, having either been disabled by misfiring during previous attacks, or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment. Left without any cannons to reply, the garrison suffered heavy casualties. They continued to resist using gunfire and stones, but eventually the few people that remained in the fort became desperate and could not hold on any longer. That night, despite threats to their person and property, desertion became rampant.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, {{the turret}} {{layout of the}} Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by {{no means}} a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of setting {{treatment}} standards and reuse legislation, {{it is important to}} be able to determine the amount of helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection helminthiasis) is not <b>straight</b> <b>forward.</b> In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, especially in the case of wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
25|$|Color performance: There are {{multiple}} terms to describe {{different aspects of}} color performance of a display. Color gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed, and color depth, which is the fineness with which the color range is divided. Color gamut is a relatively <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> feature, but it is rarely discussed in marketing materials except at the professional level. Having a color range that exceeds the content being shown on the screen has no benefits, so displays are only made to perform within or below the range of a certain specification. There are additional aspects to LCD color and color management, such as white point and gamma correction, which describe what color white is and how the other colors are displayed relative to white.|$|E
40|$|Problem Statement: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the ball {{velocity}} in different kicking conditions with dominant and non-dominant leg in junior soccer players. Approach: Sixteen junior soccer players (age 17. 6 ± 0. 6 yr, height 1. 76 ± 0. 06 m, and weight 67. 9 ± 5. 2 kg) participated in this study. All participants kicked a soccer ball three times in seven conditions with the dominant and non-dominant leg. 1) Kicking the ball from 11 m <b>straight</b> <b>forwards,</b> 2 and 3) kicking the ball from 11 m to the left and right side of the goal, 4 and 5) kicking the ball <b>straight</b> <b>forwards</b> from 11 m after a pass from the left and right side, 6 and 7) kicking the ball <b>straight</b> <b>forwards</b> from 11 m after a pass that came from a diagonal position (45 º) from the left and right side. The highest ball velocity was used for analysis. Results: Significant differences were found in ball velocity between the dominant and non-dominant leg in all conditions (p< 0. 001). For the dominant leg also significant differences were found in the kicking of eleven meters (ideal conditions) compared with: the perpendicular passing kick after the ball on the right (p= 0. 0024) and left (p= 0. 0080) and also with a diagonal kick after pass (45 °) of the ball on the right (p= 0. 0017) and left (p = 0. 0381). Significant differences in the kicking with the non-dominant leg were found when kicking from eleven meters to the right side of the goal in comparison to: the kick under the same conditions, to the left side of the goal (p= 0. 0243) after pass and shot from the left side perpendicular (p= 0. 0222). Conclusions/Recommendations: kicking velocity is influenced very much under different conditions when kicking with the dominant leg while for the non-dominant leg this influence was small, because the non-dominant leg is less trained, so the values of velocity in different conditions, in addition to being the lowest, are closer than those obtained with the dominant le...|$|R

25|$|A.P. Hill and Robert E. Lee both {{learned of}} the {{breakthrough}} soon after it occurred. At about 5:30a.m. Hill rode to meet with Lee, then set out to organize the defense along the Boydton Plank Road Line. After the initial breakthrough, stragglers from Wright's corps continued <b>straight</b> <b>forward</b> {{while most of the}} VI Corps troops turned to the left. West of the Boydton Plank Road, two stragglers from the 138th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, Corporal John W. Mauk and Private Daniel Wolford, stumbled upon Confederate Lieutenant General A. P. Hill and an aide, Sergeant George W. Tucker, as they rode through woods parallel to the Boydton Plank Road trying to reach Major General Henry Heth's headquarters near the front line. Hill demanded their surrender, but the Union soldiers took aim, fired and killed him. Tucker escaped and rode back to Lee to report Hill's death.|$|E
25|$|As {{the eighth}} seed at the Taiwan Open, Janković {{was stunned by}} the always-dangerous Kurumi Nara in the first round, despite having taken the first set.
