5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a <b>seat</b> <b>cushion,</b> spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E

25|$|After Joseph's birth, Jacob {{decided to}} return to the land of Canaan with his family. Fearing that Laban would deter him, he fled with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and twelve {{children}} without informing his father-in-law. Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his idols. Indeed, Rachel had taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's <b>seat</b> <b>cushion,</b> and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance (Gen 31:14–16). Rachel becomes a trickster like her father, her aunt (Rebekah), and her husband.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The design, {{application}} {{and evaluation of}} a specialized, personal computer-based manufacturing sys-tem for contouring foam cushions is presented. The topics discussed include both the hardware configuration and the software design. The target applications of this device are local or centralized fabrication of custom-contoured <b>seat</b> <b>cushions.</b> Although the technologies used for {{the development and implementation}} of this system are not new, using a personal-computer-based (PC) controller in place of a stand-alone numerically controlled (NC) motion controller significantly reduced the cost associated with this component. Further reductions in cost resulted from an optimization of the mechanical configuration for the dedicated task of carving foam cushions.

500|$|Although {{the weather}} was poor, with heavy rain and fog, and despite warnings, the plane took off. Four miles (6.4km) from their {{destination}} at Truax Field in Madison, the pilot radioed for permission to land. Shortly thereafter, the plane crashed into Lake Monona. Bar-Kays member Ben Cauley, the accident's only survivor, was sleeping shortly before the accident. He woke just before impact to see bandmate Phalon Jones look out a window and exclaim, [...] "Oh, no!" [...] Cauley said {{the last thing he}} remembered before the crash was unbuckling his seat belt. He then found himself in frigid water, grasping a <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> to keep afloat. A non-swimmer, he was unable to rescue the others. The cause of the crash was never determined. James Brown claimed in his autobiography The Godfather of Soul that he had warned Redding not to fly in the plane.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda {{introduced}} the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a {{limited production run}} based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. There were two [...] "series" [...] of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series {{can be found on}} the exterior- the earlier [...] "Series I" [...] cars had a black [...] "Mazda" [...] logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all [...] "Series II" [...] cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floormats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or [...] "bra"), and an aluminum under pan.|$|E
