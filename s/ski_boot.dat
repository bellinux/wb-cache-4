25|$|Para-alpine skiers in this {{classification}} {{have their}} choice regarding how many skis and ski poles {{they wish to}} use, along {{with the type of}} ski poles they wish to utilize, which may include outriggers. The rules FIS rules governing ski boots and bindings are not enforced for this class, with different requirements than rules that apply to that equipment for able-bodied competitors. For below the knee amputees in this class, their <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> may have their prosthetic leg built into it. In para-Nordic skiing, skiers use two skis and have an option to use one or two ski poles.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one or two skis and two ski poles, except in para-Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{a couple}} of Winterstick team riders went to France at the {{invitation}} of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs. After seeing an early film of this event, French skiers/surfers Augustin Coppey, Olivier Lehaneur, Olivier Roland and Antoine Yarmola made their first successful attempts during the winter of 1983 in France (Val Thorens), using primitive, home-made clones of the Winterstick. Starting with pure powder, skateboard-shaped wooden-boards equipped with aluminium fins, foot-straps and leashes, their technology evolved within a few years to pressed wood/fiber composite boards fitted with polyethylene soles, steel edges and modified <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> shells. These were more suitable for the mixed conditions encountered while snowboarding mainly off-piste, but having to get back to ski lifts on packed snow.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for {{the specific needs of}} the skier. The <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E

A snowboarder shopping for boots is usually {{looking for a good}} fit, flex, and looks. Boots can have different features such as lacing styles, heat molding liners, and gel padding that the snowboarder also might be looking for. Tradeoffs include rigidity versus comfort, and built in forward lean, versus comfort.|$|E
