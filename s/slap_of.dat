25|$|As {{announced}} on January 31, 2008 Chris Barnes officially parted ways with Torture Killer, {{to be replaced}} by Juri Sallinen. Drummer Greg Gall is currently writing and recording material with a new band called Exitsect, along with guitarist Sam Williams (Denial Fiend, Down by Law), bassist Frank Watkins (Obituary, Gorgoroth), guitarist Joe Kiser (Murder-Suicide Pact, <b>Slap</b> <b>Of</b> Reality) and vocalist Paul Pavlovich (Assück).|$|E
500|$|Bradley Stern of MuuMuse {{said the}} song is [...] "all sorts of throwback '80's-R ferociousness, {{blending}} dirty-minded temptation with a seriously fierce strut a la Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul— {{and a bit of}} Divinyls' 'I Touch Myself'." [...] In his album review, he described the song as [...] "a purely Prince/Vanity 6-inspired production, seductively sauntering into the speakers across a nasty, smutty <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> a beat". Stern considered the track one of the album's best moments and wrote, [...] "there's no part of 'Sexxx Dreams' that isn't purely aural sex". Two lyrics from the song were included in USA Today list of the eleven most suggestive lyrics from Artpop.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] is a eurodance and dance-pop {{song that}} {{incorporates}} dubstep elements with {{a length of}} three minutes and 51 seconds. According to Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media, [...] "even though the track opens builds like a arena anthem, but instead of exploding into oblivion after the breakdown it splits into a fizzy and wonky <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> a beat." [...] PopCrush's Trent Fitzgerald compared [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] to Usher's 2010 single [...] "OMG". Ryan Hadfield of Time wrote that, [...] "'Can’t Stop Won’t Stop' and 'Scream' are aggressively seductive club songs" [...] and drew comparisons to Usher's single [...] "Yeah!" [...] (Confessions, 2004) [...] and his collaboration with French disk jockey David Guetta entitled [...] "Without You" [...] (Nothing but the Beat, 2011). Billboards Erika Ramirez concluded that [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] is built around [...] "synth-heavy hook" [...] and was critical towards its [...] "mediocre lyricism". The song starts with the opening lines: [...] "Hey what’s up / This is a jam, turn it up / Play it loud in the club / This is fire, burning it up", while the chorus consists of the lyrics [...] "I can’t can’t stop it / Can’t stop won’t stop". Unterberger noted that the lines [...] "I don’t want {{to do all the}} normal things / That all these other normal dudes do" [...] could be the inspiration for the title of the album and its [...] "thesis statement".|$|E
5000|$|R v McCormick (1978) NI: Justice McGonigal {{ruled that}} <b>slaps</b> <b>of</b> the hand were {{permissible}} {{and not a}} form of torture or [...] "degrading and inhumane treatment".|$|R
5000|$|The camp of the Kekayas {{used to have}} loud sound <b>of</b> {{song and}} <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> palms which their soldiers, engaged in dance and revelry, used to make. (7,84) ...|$|R
50|$|They are {{notable for}} being, at 27 years, the Edinburgh Fringe's longest running {{improvisation}} show. Their trademark fast-paced short-form games and <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> the stage {{have since been}} adopted by similar student groups around the UK.|$|R
500|$|... "So Seductive" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many naming it a standout track from Thoughts of a Predicate Felon. Stylus Magazine writer Ross McGowan called the song [...] "a two-headed attack {{that resulted in}} one of the summer’s best singles", and complimented how the song fits Tony Yayo's persona, writing that [...] "So Seductive" [...] is practically a blueprint for how Tony Yayo should be packaged. He isn’t a very good rapper, but he is an entertaining personality and crew-member." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic described [...] "So Seductive" [...] as a [...] "hooky party number" [...] that Yayo [...] "handles extremely well", citing it {{as an example of how}} he [...] " [...] craftier and smarter than expected considering the thug myth built around him". Writing for The Michigan Daily, Evan McGarvey observed that the song works as a [...] "servicable first single", calling it an [...] "open-palm <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> a tune". He also complimented 50 Cent's performance, writing that he [...] "wisely takes a verse of his own and laces the track with an easy, Richard Scary hook". However, Fiona McKinlay of musicOMH denounced Tony Yayo's rapping on the song, calling his vocals [...] "really pretty disappointing". She also criticized the song's production as unoriginal, noting that [...] "there's nothing catchy, nothing memorable and it's not even any good for shaking your booty to", and concluded that [...] "as anything other than musical wallpaper, [...] is about as much use as soggy toast", although she conceded that it was [...] "probably going to be a Top Ten smash". At the 2005 Vibe Awards, [...] "So Seductive" [...] was nominated for best [...] "Club Banger", but lost to [...] "1 Thing" [...] by singer Ameriie.|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Merival is not {{receiving}} any one this evening," [...] the clerk answered, with a tone which was like the <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> a wet glove in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't {{let him get}} tight, you was a-goin' to say, Tommy," [...] howled {{three or}} four at once, and there ensued a great noise <b>of</b> the <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> thighs, {{followed}} by chuckles which exploded, at intervals, like crackers.|$|R
60|$|Clara, the {{coloured}} maid, {{found the}} door locked at 10 the next day, and they forced it open. Vinegar, and the <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one ran to 'phone for an ambulance.|$|R
50|$|Neuschwanstein Castle {{was used}} to portray the Baron's castle in the film. The {{traditional}} Vulgarian folk dance {{is a mix of}} the waltz with the <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> hands. All the noblewomen in Vulgaria wear purple and they have purple hair.|$|R
6000|$|Up started Teddy Malone, with a <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> his thigh. [...] "And it's mesilf as'll {{second that}} motion--only {{we should make}} him {{governor}} of the whole island, if not king!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{water on}} the right, close to the stern, bulged and burst with a roar. Upward even with us, above us, shot a tremendously large, shiny fish, shaking and wagging, with heavy <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> gills.|$|E
60|$|During the day, {{the number}} of animals of all sorts that were seen was so great as to induce Disco to protest, with a <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> his thigh, that the whole land, from stem to stern, seemed to him to be one prodigious zoological garden--it did, an' no mistake about it.|$|E
60|$|He {{got into}} his cot, and the regular splash of ripples against the boat's side, and the soft <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> the halyards on the mast, soon made him drowsy, but {{the last thing he}} saw was Andrew sitting on the {{opposite}} locker with a stern, thoughtful face.|$|R
60|$|The men tumbled out, ropes {{were cast}} inboard, and all hands, with the {{exception}} of Joe, tailed on. The shouting of men, the sound of oars, and the rattling and <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> blocks and sails, told that the men on shore were getting under way for the pursuit.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as a frying pan chop or an open-hand chop. The act <b>of</b> <b>slapping</b> the chest <b>of</b> the opponent using the forehand.|$|R
60|$|The {{newcomer}} in the Green Forest was {{a source}} of great interest to the Merry Little Breezes. Ever since they had seen him turn himself into a huge prickly ball, like a giant chestnut burr, and with a <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> his tail send Bowser the Hound yelping home with his lips stuck full of little barbed spears, they had visited the Green Forest every day to watch Prickly Porky.|$|E
60|$|Grabantak {{appeared}} {{to agree to}} {{this view of the}} case. That he saw and relished the jest was obvious, for he burst into an uproarious fit of laughter, in which his amiable warriors joined him, and, advancing to Leo, gave him a hearty <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> approval on the shoulder. At the same time he cast a look of amused scorn on his fallen son, who was being attended to by Merkut.|$|E
6000|$|Faith did {{not know}} what a vampire meant any more than she knew what the Scotch fiddle was. She had heard Susan use the {{expressions}} and gathered from her tone that both were dire things. But Norman Douglas knew what the latter meant at least. He had listened in absolute silence to Faith's tirade. When she paused for breath, with a stamp of her foot, he suddenly burst into loud laughter. With a mighty <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> hand on knee he exclaimed, ...|$|E
6000|$|The vessel had {{suddenly}} heeled over. The decks were aslant. A tin pannikin {{rolled down the}} inclined plane, rattling and banging. From above came the <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> canvas and the quivering rat-tat-tat of the after leech of the loosely stretched foresail. Then the mate's voice sang down the hatch, [...] "All hands on deck and make sail!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miles <b>slapped</b> one <b>of</b> {{his legs}} {{by way of}} {{indicating}} the mode of conveyance.|$|R
50|$|The Fa'ataupati is {{traditionally}} {{performed by a}} group of men and requires strength and stability. The men would clap and slap in sync with each other. This dance is the only dance in Samoa that does not require any instrument, as the <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> the bodies, the clapping of the hands and stomping of the feet create the music for this dance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whom shall I bring?" [...] mused I, highly {{flattered by}} this mark of confidence; and I thought of Bob Trippett; and little Fred Spring, of the Navy Pay Office; Hulker, who is rich, and I knew took lessons in Paris; and a half-score of other {{bachelor}} friends, {{who might be}} considered as VERY ELIGIBLE--when I was roused from my meditation by the <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> {{a hand on my}} shoulder; and looking up, there was the Mulligan, who began, as usual, reading the papers on my desk.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} not the home of any one--it was not inhabited, it was not livable. Yet it {{contained}} {{the same kind of}} furniture Durade had bought for her and it was clean and comfortable. Still, Allie shrank from touching anything. Through the walls came the low, strange, discordant din to which she had become accustomed--an intense, compelling blend of music, song, voice, and step actuated by one spirit. Then at times she imagined she heard distant hammering and the <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> a falling board.|$|E
60|$|They gazed helplessly at each other, though, in the long-living {{faith of}} youth, without {{distinct}} fear. The undulations increased in magnitude, and swung them higher and lower. The boat rocked, received a smart <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> the waves now and then, and wheeled round, {{so that the}} lightship which stolidly winked at them from the quicksand, the single object which told them of their bearings, was sometimes on their right hand and sometimes on their left. Nevertheless they could always discern from it that their course, whether stemwards or sternwards, was steadily south.|$|E
50|$|Slapping {{is viewed}} {{differently}} by different cultures. In Iceland, <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> children {{is viewed as}} an extreme form of physical abuse, whereas in the United Kingdom it is seen by only some parents as abusive, and even then only moderately so. A 1998 Indian study found {{a high rate of}} approval for husbands slapping their wives, particularly among husbands and middle-class Indians.|$|R
60|$|When all was ready, {{the word}} “hard-a-lee” was passed forward {{to me from}} man to man; and the Ghost heeled about on the port tack with {{practically}} no noise at all. And what little there was,—the <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> a few reef-points and the creaking of a sheave in a block or two,—was ghostly under the hollow echoing pall in which we were swathed.|$|R
60|$|There were swift {{commands}} on deck, a stamping of {{feet and}} a <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> reef-points as the Ghost {{shot into the}} wind and about on the other tack. As she filled away and heeled, the arm-chair began to slide across the cabin floor, and I sprang for it {{just in time to}} prevent the rescued woman from being spilled out.|$|R
60|$|But {{the hours}} slipped away, and {{little by little}} he grew less uneasy. He began to hope that that day would prove as {{peaceful}} as the previous day had been. Then {{suddenly there was a}} sharp report from the farther end of Paddy's pond. It was almost like a pistol shot. However, it wasn't a pistol shot. It wasn't a shot at all. It was the <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> Paddy's broad tail {{on the surface of the}} water. Instantly Lightfoot was on his feet. He knew just what that meant. He knew that Paddy had seen or heard or smelled a hunter.|$|E
6000|$|The solitary watcher {{might have}} heard a pistol shot ring through the air. I wish it had killed the old lady, {{but it was only}} the beaver giving warning of danger with the <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> his tail on the water. It was exactly like the [...] "phink" [...] of a pistol fired with damp powder. Then there were no more beavers--not a whisker-end. The lodge, however, was there, and a beast lower than any beaver began to throw stones at it because the old lady from Chicago said: [...] "P'raps, if you rattle them up they'll come out. I do so want to see a beaver." ...|$|E
60|$|A lively young grilse plunged headlong at {{the second}} fly and, thanks to my strong leader, I played {{him out in the}} current and led him listlessly, all the jump and fight gone out of him, {{to the foot of the}} cliff. There was no {{apparent}} way to get down; so, taking my line in hand, I began to lift him bodily up. He came easily enough till his tail cleared the water; then the wiggling, jerky strain was too much. The fly pulled out, and he vanished with a final swirl and <b>slap</b> <b>of</b> his broad tail to tell me how big he was.|$|E
50|$|The song {{refers to}} the <b>slap</b> style <b>of</b> double bass playing that was popular at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Nellys video [...] "Tip Drill" [...] became {{controversial}} by featuring {{women of}} various shades in thong bikinis or just thongs and topless. In addition to <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> each others butts or having them slapped by men as they gyrate close to mens faces, {{the women are}} simulating oral, vaginal and anal sex both with men and one another. The Rammstein video for Pussy contains unsimulated acts of sex.|$|R
6000|$|My {{friend had}} listened with amused {{surprise}} to this long speech, which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point being driven {{home by the}} <b>slapping</b> <b>of</b> a brawny hand upon the speaker's knee. When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched {{out his hand and}} took down letter [...] "S" [...] of his commonplace book. For once he dug in vain into that mine of varied information.|$|R
