50|$|Most of {{the first}} sewer systems in the United States were built as {{combined}} sewers (carrying both storm water and sewerage). They discharged into rivers, lakes and the sea without any treatment. The main reason for choosing combined sewers over separate systems (separating sanitary sewers from storm water drains) was a belief that combined sewer systems were cheaper to build than separate systems. Also, there was no European precedent for successful <b>separate</b> <b>sewer</b> systems at the time. The first large-scale sewer systems in the United States were constructed in Chicago and Brooklyn in the late 1850s, followed by other major U.S. cities.|$|E

At the time, their report was hailed as “The most important sewerage and sewage disposal report made in the United States.” [...] With today’s emphasis on controlling combined sewer overflows and the huge costs to effect control of these important non-point sources of pollution, the report would not receive the same plaudits today that it did in 1910.|$|E

In areas with combined sewer systems or old <b>separate</b> <b>sewer</b> systems with high inflow and infiltration, stormwater is also treated at the wastewater treatment facilities. By capturing stormwater runoff onsite in rain barrels and cisterns, the consumption of potable water for irrigation and its corresponding energy impact can be reduced.

Of these 27 cities, 26 had separate sanitary and storm water sewer systems, thus facilitating wastewater treatment, {{because there was no}} need for large capacitites to accommodate wet weather flows. Furthermore, there was a belief that the diluted combined wastewater was not harmful to receiving waters, due to the natural dilution and self-purifying capacity of rivers, lakes and the sea.

40|$|International audiencePhysico-chemical {{characterization}} of lead, zinc and cadmium {{has been carried}} out on eight samples from both <b>separate</b> and combined <b>sewers.</b> Dissolved and particulate total metal levels have been determined. A speciation scheme has been used ta further divide these phases in two dissolved fractions, bioavailable and stable, and five particulate fractions, ion-exchangeable, acid-soluble, reducible, oxidizable and residual. TotaJ dissolved lead concentrations were found ta be largely below European Community (EC) directives for drinking water production. Lead was represented by stable forms while zinc and cadmium were mainly bioavailable. Particulate concentrations were higher than naturallevels found in the Seine-Nolmandie basin. Zinc was characteristic for municipal effluents, and lead and cadmium were more concentrated in <b>separate</b> <b>sewers.</b> Correlations have been observed between particulate heavy metals and volatile matter on the ring highway, or with iron at the Savigny site. The particulate meral speciation scheme has demonstrated the important dependence of heavy metal distribution on the sampling site, as weil as the potentially more mobile nature of zinc and cadmium, compared to that of lead.
