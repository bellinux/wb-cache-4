The mold structure was designed, and 2 D assembly drawings was drew. The curved surface of the mold parting, core-pulling and key technology of <b>submarine</b> <b>gate</b> was analyzed. The mold was compacted in structure, meeting the requirement of product technology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{works is}} focused on design and fabrication of an automatic injection moulding tool for production of CAM BUSH which is used in electrical engines as a connector. An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, Ejector plate and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core pins and six ejector pins are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core pins, ejector pins, locator ring and the sprue bush and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled. <b>Submarine</b> <b>gate</b> and Baffle circular hole cooling system has been provided in the moulding tool to increase the productivity and good surface finish. The required Nylon- 66 Cam bush component is produced with this moulding tool by properly controlling the various parameters of injection moulding machine...|$|E
5000|$|Gates {{announced}} in February 2010 {{that the department}} would lift its ban on women serving on <b>submarines.</b> <b>Gates</b> also prepared the armed forces for {{the repeal of the}} don't ask, don't tell policy. Since the repeal in 2010, homosexuals are able to serve in the military openly. In service of that goal, he {{announced in}} late March 2010 the approval of new regulations that would {{make it more difficult to}} kick gays out of the military. Gates called the guideline changes, which went into effect immediately, a matter of [...] "common sense and common decency" [...] that would be [...] "an important improvement" [...] allowing the Pentagon to apply current law in [...] "a fairer and more appropriate" [...] manner. The Pentagon's legal counsel, Jeh Johnson, said the new regulations are by no means a moratorium on the current law and stressed that cases would move forward under the new standards.|$|R
5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as <b>submarine</b> or mould <b>gates,</b> are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|R
