25|$|The {{turn of the}} {{millennium}} has seen much stronger performances from Schalke. During the 1990s and early 2000, the club underwent a <b>successful</b> <b>transformation</b> into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself {{as one of the}} dominant teams of the Bundesliga. Schalke captured consecutive DFB-Pokals in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and earned second-place finishes in the Bundesliga in 2000–01, 2004–05 and 2006–07. The 2000–01 season finish was heartbreaking for Schalke's supporters as it took a goal in the fourth minute of injury time by Bayern Munich away to Hamburger SV to snatch the title from Die Königsblauen.|$|E

The {{historian}} Andrzej Leon Sowa {{characterized the}} outcome of the Polish transition as follows: [...] "Part of the nomenklatura, combined with the elites originating from the opposition, became the beneficiaries of the system that developed over the ruins of People's Poland. As a whole, however, both the PZPR and the worker in its bulk Solidarity lost. The only organization (...) strengthened in every respect is the institutional Roman Catholic Church." [...] According to the journalist Kaja Puto, the Polish parliamentary election of 2015 marked Poland's rejection of the myth of <b>successful</b> <b>transformation</b> {{and the end of the}} Polish post-communist period. Karol Modzelewski sees the 2015 elections and their outcome as a path to collapse of Polish democracy and the direct consequence of the faulty systemic transformation, beginning with the destruction of socialist industry. The transformation's victims and their descendants have experienced lasting social degradation and became disheartened adversaries of the post-1989 liberal democracy, which failed them and which in 2015 may have ended.|$|E

The transformations consisted of two phases, a preparation phase and a transition phase, linked by a window of opportunity. Key leaders and shadow networks can prepare a system for change by exploring alternative system configurations and developing strategies for choosing from among possible futures. Key leaders can recognize and use or create windows of opportunity and navigate transitions toward adaptive governance. Leadership functions include the ability to span scales of governance, orchestrate networks, integrate and communicate understanding, and reconcile different problem domains. <b>Successful</b> <b>transformations</b> rely on epistemic and shadow networks to provide novel ideas and ways of governing SESs. We conclude by listing some &# 82220;rules of thumb&# 8221; that can help build leadership and networks for <b>successful</b> <b>transformations</b> toward adaptive governance of social-ecological systems...|$|R

Certain of these transformations-well separated from the majority spin rule-produce sharply more accurate critical properties than the rest.

50|$|Plasmids {{are almost}} always {{purified}} from liquid bacteria cultures, usually E. coli, which have been transformed and isolated. Virtually all plasmid vectors in common use encode one or more antibiotic resistance genes as a selectable marker, for example a gene encoding ampicillin or kanamycin resistance, which allows bacteria that have been successfully transformed to multiply uninhibited. Bacteria that have not taken up the plasmid vector are assumed to lack the resistance gene, and thus only colonies representing <b>successful</b> <b>transformations</b> are expected to grow.Bacteria are grown under favourable conditions.|$|R

40|$|Our {{interest}} {{in the development of}} transition-metal catalysis for the realisation of vicinal diamination reactions of alkenes started about a decade ago. A number of <b>successful</b> <b>transformations</b> in this area have been developed using palladium catalysis. As a challenging aspect of major importance, the palladium-catalysed coupling of alkyl–nitrogen bonds constitutes the second step in diaminations of alkenes. We here discuss the details that led us to consider high-oxidation-state palladium catalysis as a key feature in such C–N bond-forming reactions. This work discusses both our own contributions and the ones from colleagues and combines the discussion of catalytic reactions and stoichiometric control experiments. It demonstrates that reductive alkyl–nitrogen bond formation from palladium(IV) proceeds with a low activation barrier and through a linear transition state of nucleophilic displacement...|$|R

The dairy industry is constantly developing new products that are free from lactose, to satisfy these individuals. Even though producers have come a long way in developing techniques that are efficient and cheap there is still improvements to be made. β-D-galactosidase have been proven to effectively remove lactase from dairy products, still further enhancement is presumed possible. In this study the aim was to further explore and develop the properties of known β-D-galactosidase enzyme found in Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus. With the use of polymerase chain reaction and transformation techniques, the β-D-galactosidase coding bglA gene from Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus B 7 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21 competent cells. Furthermore over expression of the rBglAp and spectrophotometric analysis was conducted to detect any <b>successful</b> <b>transformations.</b> The transformation showed no indication of catalysis of lactose into its monomeric forms. Further verification of the techniques would have increased the success rate of the experiment.
