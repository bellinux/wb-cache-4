Upon graduation, Smith applied to Columbia University and Geneva Medical College in New York State, but was denied admission due to racial discrimination. Williams encouraged Smith to attend the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and abolitionist benefactors of the AFS provided Smith with money for his trip overseas and his education.

Motoki then drilled himself by practising on his talent manager until {{he felt he had}} mastered the procedure, one whose intricate, delicate movements he compared to those of the Japanese tea ceremony.

40|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, policy thinkers and activists have despaired over the {{prospect}} that global institutions can bring progressive change to the international order. They advocate that those who would change things should place their hopes in global social movements rather than global institutions. This essay humbly suggests {{that we ought to}} do both. Global institutions require an active global civil society that includes social movements if they would not lose their <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>mission</b> and purpose. Global social movements for their part require global institutions to serve as focal points for their efforts, which are otherwise threatened with diffusion and dissipation.

[...] Reviewing the box set in The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote, [...] "Decades later, what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylan’s unmistakable fervor, his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>mission.</b> The studio albums are subdued, even tentative, compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylan’s voice is clear, cutting and ever improvisational; working the crowds, he was emphatic, committed, sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music." [...] Trouble No More includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylan's gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor Michael Shannon.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{appeared}} as a correspondent on The Daily Show between 1997 and 2005. During this time, the comedian developed the character that would later {{form the basis for}} his Colbert Report persona, one that its creator calls a [...] "fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool". Colbert frequently cites Stone Phillips — whom he describes as having [...] "the greatest neck in journalism" [...] — as a source of inspiration for the character, as well as Geraldo Rivera, [...] "because he's got this great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>mission...</b> He just thinks he's gonna change the world with this report". As a correspondent, Colbert was regularly pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, fellow correspondent Steve Carell, or host Jon Stewart in scripted exchanges which typically revealed the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he was discussing. Other Daily Show correspondents have since adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{attempted}} {{to justify their}} respective military goals in both active and reactive ways. The Roman quest for world domination {{was accompanied by a}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>mission</b> and pride in Western civilization and by ambitions to become a guarantor of peace and order. Roman sources reveal long-standing prejudices with regard to the Eastern powers' customs, religious structures, languages, and forms of government. John F. Haldon underscores that [...] "although the conflicts between Persia and East Rome revolved around issues of strategic control around the eastern frontier, yet there was always a religious-ideological element present". From the time of Constantine on, Roman emperors appointed themselves as the protectors of Christians of Persia. This attitude created intense suspicions of the loyalties of Christians living in Sasanian Iran and often led to RomanPersian tensions or even military confrontations.* McDonough (2006), 73 A characteristic of the final phase of the conflict, when what had begun in 611612 as a raid was soon transformed into a war of conquest, was the pre-eminence of the Cross as a symbol of imperial victory and of the strongly religious element in the Roman imperial propaganda; Heraclius himself cast Khosrau as the enemy of God, and authors of the 6th and 7th centuries were fiercely hostile to Persia.|$|E

The American Puritans' religious zeal contributes to America's ideological self-certainty and lack of regard for the values of others.
