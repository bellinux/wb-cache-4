5000|$|For metal coils, the slitter {{consists}} of three main parts: an uncoiler, <b>slitter,</b> <b>and</b> recoiler. [...] The material is fed from the uncoiler, through the nip between the two circular cutting wheels (one on top and another underneath), and then re-wound in slit pieces on the recoiler.|$|R
50|$|Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site is a National Historic Site {{located about}} 10 miles (16 kilometers) {{northeast}} of Downtown Boston in Saugus, Massachusetts. It {{is the site}} of the first integrated ironworks in North America, founded by John Winthrop the Younger and in operation between 1646 and approximately 1670. It includes the reconstructed blast furnace, forge, rolling mill, shear, <b>slitter</b> <b>and</b> a quarter-ton drop hammer.|$|R
50|$|Xerox's {{first foray}} into duplicating, as {{distinct}} from copying, was with the Xerox 2400, introduced in 1966. The model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour. Although not as fast as offset printing, this machine introduced the industry's first automatic document feeder, paper <b>slitter</b> <b>and</b> perforator, and collator (sorter). This product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the Xerox 3600 Duplicator.|$|R
40|$|The project {{continued}} in this reporting period with focus on three issues: (1) failure {{analysis of the}} FM inserts tested in the field, (2) continued study of confinement burn-out, <b>and</b> (3) disc <b>cutter</b> manufacturing. The failure analysis concludes that the main reason causing early failure of FM inserts is its low hardness, or in the other words, the FM inserts contained too much cobalt. The recipe to make the FM material needs to be changed. The continued binder burn-out experiments showed that FM confinement burn-out in a metal container filled with sand is {{an effective way to}} remove the organic binder in the inserts without causing bloating and delamination. Three 6. 5 inch disc <b>cutter</b> <b>sections</b> were successfully produced. They were made of H 13 powder with a green FM insert, a hot pressed FM insert, and a pre-sintered traditional WC insert respectively. One 17 inch disc <b>cutter</b> <b>section</b> was also produced from H 13 powder with a pre-sintered traditional WC insert. It is planned to test the heat treatment effect on the H 13 and WC bonding and manufacture full 6. 5 inch disc cutters in the next quarter...|$|R

40|$|A {{slotting}} {{method for}} cosine gears was proposed {{by using the}} involute cutter based on the conjugate theories of digital surface and gear meshing. The slotting model between the cosine tooth surface represented by discrete points <b>and</b> the <b>cutter</b> figuration determined by analytic function was built for their geometrical relationship and conjugate motion during the machining process. Conjugate points in the <b>cutter</b> <b>section</b> corresponding to the discrete points on the cosine gear tooth surface and the conjugate movements were solved. By using the flexible control of the CNC procedure, the active control of the cutting trace of the slotting <b>cutter</b> was accomplished <b>and</b> the envelop forming of the cosine gear was obtained. Based on the software C++ and Matlab, the computer aided manufacturing (CAM) system of the cosine gear was developed, and the simulation of the slotting process was accomplished. Several examples were provided to illustrate the approach. The result of the simulation demonstrates that the proposed slotting method is feasible. ? 2014 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

Based on the equal base circle bevel gear theory, By solving coordinate values of the disk <b>cutter</b> <b>section,</b> made tool model in VERICUT environment. By planning disc cutter machining path, the disc cutter trajectory is obtained, simulated the NC machining to a equal base circle bevel gear using VERICUT software. The results show that machining this gear in NC machine can be realized using disk cutter...|$|R
