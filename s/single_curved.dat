25|$|The 1974 {{terminal}} {{was built}} in the International style of architecture popular for American commercial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It consists of a <b>single</b> <b>curved</b> terminal with concourses radiating outward. Large floor to ceiling plate glass windows form curtain walls on the departure level of the terminal with horizontal bands of repetitive white architectural panels above and below. A slight departure from typical International style, the upper band of panels was decorated with raised circles of four sizes, two circles per size per panel. The roof is flat over the terminal and concourses; a series of steel columns painted white with stay cables for the terminal awning project from the roof. An enclosed white-clad Observation Deck jutted out from the airside terminal face at a sharp angle between the old concourses B and C. On the airside of the terminal, a large horizontal white sign with teal lettering identified the city as Birmingham.|$|E

The escal bulb terminates in a pair of forked tendrils and bears varying numbers of lateral lobes and a <b>single</b> <b>curved</b> denticle. The size of the transparent window in the bulb can be adjusted to change the amount of light emanating from the lure.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{six years}} of opening, {{the rapid growth of}} the {{railways}} required expansion of the original station. A plan was formed to erect an iron roof similar to that found at Euston station in London, a ridge roof supported by iron columns. However, Richard Turner and William Fairburn submitted a design for a <b>single</b> <b>curved</b> roof, which won the approval of the station committee. The work cost £15,000 (...) and was completed in 1849 with the involvement of William Tite. Meanwhile, in 1845, the L had been absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway. A group of four columns, adjoining platform 1 and attributed to Edward Woods, date to the 1846–1850 rebuild of the station.|$|E

2500|$|There are 25 shaftheads {{visible at}} Eylesbarrow, {{most of which}} are on a <b>single</b> <b>curved</b> {{alignment}} along the line of the main lode, which is roughly followed by part of the main track that runs through the mine. The shaftheads exist as conical pits, the smallest being 9m in diameter and the largest, marking Pryce Deacon's Shaft near the eastern end of the alignment, 16m in diameter. Some of them (for instance New Engine Shaft, shown here) have the original masonry collar still visible. Each pit has a spoil heap nearby, usually {{in the shape of a}} crescent on the downhill side of the pit. These heaps vary in size; the largest, at Pryce Deacon's Shaft, is over [...] high and covers about [...] Much interpretative work has taken place to match the visible shafts with the names mentioned in the contemporary documentation, with the result that about half of them can be named and dated with some confidence.|$|E
2500|$|Pulvinar means pillow in Latin. It {{constitutes}} the posterior pole of the thalamus and its posterior border is indeed smooth. Anteriorly {{there is only}} an incomplete boundary with the medial nucleus. The two have in fact common connections both thalamocortical and corticothalamic. This {{is the case for}} instance for the frontal cortex. The usual subdivisions do not fit with the distribution of cortical afferent. It is common to find the description of a [...] "nucleus lateralis posterior ( [...] LP). This is simply a part of the pulvinar passing over the lateral region and giving in transverse sections the image of a ventral and a dorsal (or lateral) subdivision. Sagittal sections show that the pulvinar(LP) ensemble is a <b>single</b> <b>curved</b> entity. The whole receives in the same almost identical afferences. A main medial part receives flat islands of axonal terminations from the frontal, parietal, temporal and preoccipital cortex. Only one part of the pulvinar is particular, the intergeniculate or inferior pulvinar, which receives tectal afferents and which has a visuotopic map.|$|E
60|$|Prehensile Antennæ.--I {{examined}} {{these in}} the larvæ presently to be mentioned, and therefore they were in better condition than in the mature animal when cemented. Their total length, measured along the outside, from the basal articulation {{to the end of}} the disc, is 32/6000ths or 33/6000ths of an inch--that is, one third longer than in I. Cumingii; whilst the hoof-like disc itself is 8/6000ths, or only 1/6000th of an inch longer than this same part in I. Cumingii: the apex of the disc is downy, or bears some excessively minute spines. The ultimate segment has its end irregularly rounded, with the spines obscurely divided into two groups, the outer group consisting of two or three longer and thinner spines, and the inner group of, as I believe, five rather shorter spines: the longer spines equal in length the whole ultimate segment. I could not perceive that they were plumose, as in many other genera. A single, rather thicker and long spine, pointing backwards, is attached to the under side of the disc, nearly opposite to the point where the ultimate segment is articulated on the upper convex surface. Another <b>single,</b> <b>curved</b> spine is attached on the outer side of the basal segment, near its distal end.|$|E

60|$|Antennæ.--The {{peduncle}} terminates (Pl. V, fig. 1 e) {{in the two}} usual, larval, prehensile antennæ, {{which it}} is very difficult to see distinctly; they are tolerably well represented in fig. 5, greatly magnified. Their extreme length, measured from the basal articulation to the tip of the hoof-like disc, is 22/6000ths of an inch, the disc itself being 7/6000ths of an inch. The disc is slightly narrower than the long basal segment, from which it is divided by a broad conspicuous articulation; its lower surface is flat and its upper convex, altogether resembling in shape a mule's hoof; its apex is fuzzy with the finest down; it bears a narrow ultimate segment, thrown, as usual, on one side; this segment supports on its rounded irregular summit, at least five, I believe, judging from the structure of the same part in the male larva of Ibla quadrivalvis, six or seven spines, longer than the segment itself: one long spine arises from the under side of the disc, near the base of the ultimate segment, and points backward: there is also a <b>single</b> <b>curved</b> spine on the outside, near the distal end of the basal segment. These organs were imbedded in a heart-shaped ball or cylinder of brown, transparent, finely laminated cement, and thus attached to the fibrous tissue of the female. The two cement-ducts (fig. 1 f) were very plain, each about 1/6000th of an inch in diameter, containing the usual inner chord of opaque cellular matter. I traced them at the one end into the prehensile antennæ as far as the disc; and at the other, up the peduncle for about one fourth of its length, where I lost them, and could not discover with certainty any cement glands. I may, however, here mention, that I found in the lower half of the peduncle, numerous, yellowish, transparent, excessively minute, pyramidal bodies, with step-formed sides; of these two or three often cohered by their bases like crystals; I have never seen anything like these in other Cirripedes, but it has occurred to me that they may possibly be connected with the formation of the cement: for in the last larval condition of Lepas, the cement-ducts run up to the gut-formed ovaria, filled at this period with yellowish, grape-like, cellular masses, without the intervention of cement glands, and I can imagine that similar masses, not being developed into functional ovaria, might give rise to the yellow pyramidal bodies.|$|E
