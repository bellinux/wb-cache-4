60|$|Jason thereupon began {{building}} a ship, {{which he called}} Argo, and proclaimed the intended expedition throughout Greece, thus gathering together all the most famous heroes then living, most of whom had, like him, been brought up by the great Centaur Chiron. Hercules was one of them, and another was Theseus, the great hero of the Ionian city of Athens, whose prowess was almost {{equal to that of}} Hercules. He had caught and killed the great white bull which Hercules had brought from Crete and let loose, and he had also destroyed the horrid robber Procrustes (the Stretcher), who had kept two iron bedsteads, one long and one short. He put tall men into the <b>short</b> <b>bed,</b> and cut them down to fit it, and short men into the long bed, pulling them out till they died, until Theseus finished his life on one of his own beds.|$|E

50|$|Differences in {{processing}} from other yarn manufacturers {{include the use}} of a single roller on the carding machine instead of the usual three, hand-feeding tufts of fiber into the carding machine, and the arrangement of specified color runs by hand. The single roller as well as the <b>shorter</b> <b>bed</b> on the spinning machine result in less twist to the single ply than other yarns, giving a variance in thickness along its length.|$|R
5000|$|Four-door [...] "Quad-Cab" [...] {{models were}} added for 2000 with a {{slightly}} <b>shorter</b> <b>bed,</b> 63.1 in (160.2 cm), but riding on the Club Cab's 130.9 in (332.5 cm) wheelbase. The aging 5.2 L Magnum V8 {{was replaced by a}} new high-tech 4.7 L SOHC PowerTech V8. The Quad-Cab featured a full-sized flip up rear seat to provide room for three passengers in the back or lots of dry, interior room for cargo.|$|R

50|$|A long-bed {{truck is}} {{best suited for}} most campers. It is very {{important}} that the center of gravity of a truck camper be located forward of the rear axle.

50|$|Also in 1983 the Hijet Jumbo appeared, a high-roofed {{extended}} cab pickup with a <b>shorter</b> <b>bed.</b> This {{meant that}} there was space for more comfortable seats, with considerable more travel and folding seatbacks. The resulting rear compartment offered small luggage spaces, a flat-folding passenger seat, and a small luggage rack above. The two-wheel Jumbo was available with a fifth gear, as were some versions of the Atrai passenger van. There was also a Hijet Climber series (two- or four-wheel drive), these were fitted with bigger off-road tires and a limited-slip differential.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects that}} the spring-neap cycle {{has on the}} {{formation}} of tidal sand waves are investigated by performing a linear stability analysis of the flat bottom configuration of a shallow sea subject to a modulated tidal current.

40|$|A {{non-destructive}} vapour test, {{involving an}} ethane pulse challenge, that measures {{the integrity of}} the activated carbon bed in military canisters is presently under development at the Defence Research Establishment Ottawa. The effectiveness of the test has been theoretically assessed in this report by modelling the effect of the presence of defects in the carbon bed on its performance. The model has been modified to successfully predict the adsorption behaviour of a dry ethane pulse- or a dry n-octane step-challenge on uneven, non-uniform or <b>short</b> <b>beds.</b> It has been found that the behaviour for the non-uniform beds is different from uneven beds and that care must be taken in selecting the breakthrough concentration for the ethane test. Whilst the sensitivity of the ethane pulse test to identify the defects is not as good as the n-octane step test, the time required for the ethane test is muc...|$|R
50|$|Truck tents are {{basically}} conventional 2-3 person tents that are rigged {{to hook up}} to a truck bed. Most truck tents are designed with {{a particular type of}} truck in mind, or a truck with certain features — those with dropgates, liftgates, camper tops, <b>short</b> <b>beds,</b> or long beds, etc. The tents either hook in or strap in to several locations around the truck. The initial set up may take some time, but is fairly simple after one or two attempts. Once the tent is fitted to a specific truck, setting up is as easy as setting up traditional tent. Many proponents choose to put a mattress in the bed of the truck for a more comfortable experience. These mattresses are available in various sizes to fit all trucks. A zip up window provides access to the cab for trucks that have a rear window.|$|R

50|$|The pickup {{received}} the BPB55, BTA55/65, or FA2T55/65/66 model codes respectively when fitted with the OHV 1.0 or 1.2, or the OHC 1.3. FA2T55 was a <b>short</b> <b>bed</b> with 500 kg max load, 65 {{was a long}} bed with the same capacity, while the 66 upped that to 600 kg. All three models were available as either Standard or Deluxe. The 1000 Van (Japanese terminology for the station wagon, which was intended for commercial use there) received either BPCV or BPBV chassis codes, signifying three- or five-door versions. The Familia Presto Van, with OHC engines, received chassis numbers MP3xV/SP3xV for the 1000 (3-door/5-door) and MT2xV/ST2xV for the 1200. The five-door Van range was gradually expanded downwards as the three-door models dropped in popularity.|$|E
50|$|The CCKW had {{a ladder}} frame chassis with three driven beam axles, the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. There were two wheelbases, the short Model 352 {{and the long}} Model 353. The short, 145 in (Measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear bogie) was used with a <b>short</b> cargo <b>bed</b> as an artillery prime mover for 75mm and 105mm howitzers. All other models used the long 164 in wheelbase. Tires were 7.50-20, brakes were hydraulic with vacuum assist.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Envoy XUV over a pickup truck or a more truck-like configuration such as the Chevrolet Avalanche (which originated the MidGate feature) is that with retractable roof and rear glass closed, the cargo area is sealed, full roof height and lockable, thus making it an enclosed SUV. The disadvantages include a much <b>shorter</b> cargo <b>bed</b> area and breakable side glass. The Envoy XUV's retractable roof was reminiscent of the Studebaker Wagonaire of the 1960s, while other features such as the 'MidGate' {{were similar to those}} of the GMC Terracross concept SUV.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} role of the {{accident}} and emergency (A&E) short stay ward by a survey of departments in the United Kingdom and review of published reports. METHODS: A postal questionnaire with telephone follow up to all major A&E departments with <b>short</b> stay <b>beds.</b> RESULTS: 95 departments were found to have <b>short</b> stay <b>beds.</b> These units received between 19000 and 121000 new patients per year (mean 51000, median 50500) and had access to between two and 20 beds (mean 7. 5, median 6). The level of provision varied from one bed per 2440 new attendances to one bed per 27250 new attendances (mean 8380, median 6625). Where data on admission rates were available the departments admitted between 0. 1 % and 13. 3 % of their new attendances (mean 2. 62 %, median 1. 9 %). Cover was typically provided by an A&E senior house officer with frequent senior ward rounds. While the casemix usually included minor head injuries and alcohol intoxicated patients, there was considerable variation in the cases admitted. CONCLUSIONS: Short stay provision is highly variable in the United Kingdom. While there are many reports of well run short stay units, consistent evidence of clinical value and cost-effectiveness compared to other methods of care is lacking. Further comparative studies are required to define {{the role of}} the A&E short stay ward...|$|R
