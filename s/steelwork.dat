5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, {{which was designed to}} take a third of the weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their <b>steelwork</b> were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} carriageway of {{the bridge}} was closed on 1 December 2015 after <b>steelwork</b> defects had been discovered during routine inspections and traffic was restricted 7.5 tonne or less (public service vehicles excepted). On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers, which required additional remedial work.|$|E
5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the {{continued use of}} tolls by suggesting they were necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new <b>steelwork.</b> Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E
40|$|The paper summarises {{experience}} with using synthetic slags on the CaO – Al 2 O 3 oxide {{basis in the}} technological flow of the oxygen converter steelworks in TŘINECKE ́ ŽELEZÁRNY, a. s. These slags are used {{as an alternative to}} slags containing fluorspar which unfavourably affects both the service life of ladle linings and the <b>steelwork’s</b> working environment. The content gives the first knowledge of using the Refraflux type synthetic slag to desulphurize steel, and it also provides a basic statistical evaluation of the heat produced...|$|R
5000|$|In {{common with}} other steel producers, from the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, much of the output went to war-related usage. The best-known contribution of the works was Pipe Line Under The Ocean (PLUTO), a pipeline built, following the D-Day landings to supply fuel for the invading forces. Almost 1,000 miles of steel tubes went into the main HAMEL project. In acknowledgement of the Corby <b>steelwork's</b> contribution to PLUTO, a public house in Corby was named [...] "The Pluto". The pub has since closed and the site is awaiting development.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 {{the board}} of Koninklijke Hoogovens voted in favour of merging their IJmuiden {{steelworks}} with the Dortmund plant of German steelmaker Hoesch; Hoesch would benefit from the IJmuiden <b>steelwork's</b> port, and Koninklijke Hoogovens' 43% shareholding in the Dortmund-Hörder Hüttenunion (DHHU) was converted into a 15% shareholding in Hoesch with Hoesch acquiring DHUU. The two firms made agreements on division of work between the plants - IJmuiden was to concentrate on pig iron, crude steel, and semi-manufactured products, whilst Hoesch's Dortmund plant was to produce finished steels and manufactured products. The two entities were merged in 1972, forming Estel NV, headquarter in Nijmegen.|$|R
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} phase, the A Station, began in March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out by}} John Mowlem & Co, and the structural <b>steelwork</b> erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E

25|$|Kennedy {{found time}} {{outside of his}} {{academic}} works to establish an extensive concultancy business. His designs include the steel arched pier at Trouville-sur-Mer, the concrete structure and <b>steelwork</b> of the rebuilt Alhambra Theatre and the <b>steelwork</b> of the first Hotel Cecil. He made great use of his laboratory to test his materials and his designs were always valued for the hours of research he had invested in them.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>steelwork's</b> for the tower-shaft, {{the upper}} storeys and the {{equipment}} {{were carried out}} in a dry dock of the Howaldts-factory in Kiel (Fig. 3). The tower-shaft was towed through the Kiel Canal towards its destination site in the Outer-Weser waterway (Fig. 6). For this purpose a floating offshore-lift platform which had been supplied with a central cut-out for the tower was used. At the site the shaft was lowered and subsequently jetted into the sand to the intended depth. After feeding in a layer of underwater concrete, the shaft was evacuated and the additional layers of ferroconcrete were installed (Fig. 5).|$|R
50|$|Lochside Farm {{was present}} on the north-west side of the loch in the 19th century, lying below and to the {{south-west}} of Lochrig, later Lochridge, as shown on the 19th century OS map; a 'Flax Pond' for rhetting flax, {{as part of the}} process of linen manufacture, is also shown nearby on the loch bank; it is now visible as a wet area dominated by rushes. The firm of William & James Knox, linen thread manufacterers, established as early as 1788, are still based in Kilbirnie. Scotland was amongst the first producers of flax. The road running down to the loch here from Baxter Head became known locally as the 'Shanks-McEwan Road' after the company that was contracted to remove the old <b>steelwork's</b> slag heaps.|$|R
50|$|In 1896, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited had {{acquired}} {{land on the}} river shore at Mayfield East for smelters, and in 1910 {{it was decided that}} they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton blast furnace and three 65-ton open hearth steel furnaces, a bloom mill and heavy rail mill, with by-product coke ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and South Maitland coalfields, (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to dredge and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, 500 ft wide and 25 ft deep at low water to the <b>steelwork's</b> basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired 1225 acre. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the steel}} columns were erected for the {{basement}} car park, the <b>steelwork</b> to the suspended ground floor was installed. Barrett then erected the 11 storey frame above this concrete base. Below the slab, Barrett Steel Buildings {{had already left}} studs on the columns which allowed Kier to erect the RC basement beams later on. For the steel frame, Barrett split the project into halves and erected three floors on one side before moving over to the other. This allowed the decking to be laid on the first side {{as well as the}} concrete floors. The programming meant Barrett was always erecting <b>steelwork</b> at least two levels ahead of the concreting team. The erection of <b>steelwork</b> was completed on Phase 2 by the end of 2007. The glass cladding is currently being installed. Kier Group's contract is due to expire when the building is completed in February 2009.|$|E

25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class 66 and later the Vossloh Euro, CargoNet's need for the uneconomical and underdimensioned Di 8 fell through. The Euro was put into service on the Nordland Line and the Rauma Line, and NSB started looking for a possibility to sell the locomotives. In October 2011, GB Railfreight was awarded the contract for {{the operation of the}} railway after Sahaviriya Steel Industries had bought and reopened Teesside Steelworks in Redcar, United Kingdom. They were thus in need for locomotives to haul the internal torpedo trains with liquid steel between the <b>steelwork's</b> blast furnaces and continuous casters. Ten Di 8s were thereby sold, of which the first five were shipped on 12 December 2011, and arrived on 20 December, and the last were delivered in January 2012. Eight of the ten locomotives will be used in revenue service; the other two will be used for parts. At that point, seven Di 8s remained in service with CargoNet, with one having been retired and one used for parts. No. 714 was, as the first Di 8, scrapped on 10 July 2013.|$|R
50|$|By 1929 {{the great}} {{depression}} was to bite and the famous name of Bolckow-Vaughan passes into history merging with neighbour Dorman-Long & Co. who became Britain's biggest iron and steel maker employing 33,000 men. By 1954 the post-war boom sees Britain's premier steel-making centre remaining on the Tees as Dorman-Long builds {{a state of the}} art steelworks at Lackenby and then new blast furnaces at Clay Lane. 1967 sees Dorman-Long become part of the nationalized British Steel Corporation as production booms in Britain and in 1979 The largest blast furnace in Europe is erected at BSC's new Redcar plant. This plant which was subsequently acquired and operated by Chorus, Tata Steel and then most recently Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) is still operating today. To illustrate the scale of this steel manufacturing unit, in 2011 GB Railfreight won a contract to operate the rail system at the SSI steelworks in Redcar (UK) and the company purchased 10 NSB Di 8 is a class of diesel-electric locomotives for use on internal torpedo trains between the <b>steelwork's</b> blast furnaces and continuous casters. The locomotives were delivered to the UK in December 2011.|$|R

25|$|Afterward, {{work on the}} building's {{interior}} and crowning mast commenced. The mooring mast topped out on November 21, {{two months after the}} <b>steelwork</b> had been completed. Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time <b>steelwork</b> had been built to the 95th floor. The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November. Because of the building's height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the Otis Elevator Company to make 66 cars that could speed at , which represented the largest-ever elevator order at the time.|$|E
25|$|Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge in Dallas, Texas, U.S.A., {{which opened}} in 2012 and spans the Trinity River.

The bridge also received a 2012 European Convention for Constructional <b>Steelwork</b> Award For Steel Bridges.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{links between}} the {{suspensions}} chains and the decking were added in 1969 to further strengthen the bridge. In 2011 Network Rail began a three-year £10 million refurbishment involving replacing 50,000 bolts and installation of 100 tonnes of new <b>steelwork.</b> The bridge is also being stripped back to the bare metal and repainted in the Goose Grey colour originally applied in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Thon's last {{important}} commissions {{were the}} Nikolaevsky railway stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg (1849–51). In his {{design for the}} stations the architect implemented some of the newest construction technologies. Despite large pieces of <b>steelwork</b> used in the construction, Venetian facades and medieval clock towers of the stations cleverly masked their modern function. Both structures, although extensively reconstructed, are still standing.|$|E
25|$|Bosa Contracts {{were invited}} by Hall Construction Limited and Wates to provide {{recommendations}} {{to overcome the}} specific problems in the structural concrete elements including beams and retaining walls within the original structure.

25|$|Cable {{spinning}} {{took place}} between September 1977 and July 1979. Each cable weighs 5,500 tonnes, with 37 strands of 404 lengths of cable. The cable on the northern span has four extra strands. Each cable can take a load of 19,400 tonnes. The box sections weighed around 140 tonnes each. The first box sections were assembled in June 1975, and put into the main span on 9 November 1979. The toll buildings and north approach road were built by A.F. Budge of Retford, Nottinghamshire, costing £2.9million. Work began on the administration building in November 1976. The toll system was manufactured by Plessey Controls of Poole, Dorset. Corrosion resistance on the <b>steelwork</b> was provided by Camrex Corrosion of Bellshill, North Lanarkshire.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants in {{all three}} waves were {{attracted}} by the high wages and ample job opportunities for unskilled manual labor in the United States, and were driven to jobs in American mining, meatpacking, construction, <b>steelwork,</b> and heavy industry—in many cases dominating these fields until the mid-20th century. Over 90% of Poles arrived and settled in communities with other Polish immigrants. These communities are called Polonia and the largest such community historically was in Chicago, Illinois. A key feature of Polish life in the Old World had been religion, and in the United States, Catholicism often became {{an integral part of}} Polish identity. In the United States, Polish immigrants created communities centered on Catholic religious services, and built hundreds of churches and parish schools in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, {{a mobile}} crane {{and a small}} piling rig arrived on site. In early March 2009, the crane began putting steel beams into the ground, as part of {{preparations}} for {{the core of the}} building. Full construction began on 16 March 2009. Demolition work on New London Bridge House started in May 2009, as part of the concurrent London Bridge Place project. The first <b>steelwork</b> went into the Shard's piles on 28 April. Five cranes were used to build the Shard, with four of them 'jumping' with the tower as it rose. Crane 1 was erected in September 2009 and Crane 2 was erected at the beginning of October.

25|$|Subsequent to the {{original}} design by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Ltd chosen to supervise {{the architecture of the}} project. Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering. Hyder Consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify SOM's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities. NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on site supervision during construction and design of a 6-storey addition to the Office Annex Building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD, an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and <b>steelwork.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially, it was {{proposed}} to use Insitu concrete flat slabs {{in the basement}} with a composite steel frame above podium level all on a 9m x 9m grid. However, as the top five floors had been prelet to KPMG, construction needed to be accelerated and water tightness on the upper levels needed to be achieved quicker. As a result, the plan was changed and the steel frame was started at basement level. However, the basement floors and column finishes were required to be concrete. A hybrid concrete flat slab and concrete encased steel column solution was used to achieve this as it allows the <b>steelwork</b> to continue for the upper floors with temporary bracing in the lower levels. As the concrete floors for the basement construction catch up, the temporary bracing is removed or built in.|$|E
25|$|At Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street, {{where the}} BMT Fulton Street Line {{elevated}} railway {{had given way}} to the IND Fulton Street Line subway, a large station is present with modern conveniences, elevators and escalators, providing an easier transfer between the shuttle and the IND line. From that station, most of the original <b>steelwork</b> from elevated days has been removed and replaced with heavier construction. The line runs on a single track from Franklin/Fulton to another new station at Park Place. Though this portion of the line uses much of the reinforced viaduct from 1903-1905, it is virtually new as of 1999. After Park Place, the line broadens from one to two tracks and the right-of-way transforms from 1999 reconstruction to near-original 1878 right-of-way, including the original railroad-style tunnel under Eastern Parkway, {{at the south end of}} which is the rehabilitated Botanic Garden station of 1928. From Botanic Garden, the line continues on original 1878 roadbed to its connection with the main part of the Brighton Beach Line at Prospect Park. Before entering Prospect Park, most trains switch to the northbound track to enter the station, where the shuttle terminates.|$|E
