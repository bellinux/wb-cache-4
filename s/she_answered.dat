She {{attracted the attention of}} the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house. <b>She</b> <b>answered</b> the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi retorted that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, Jenner debuted her {{new name}} and image, and began {{publicly}} using feminine pronoun self-descriptors. Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner. Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed {{with the family}} in which <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized {{that there is no}} one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three days, the group {{undertook}} a series of tasks by which they could earn the right to become housemates. The remaining non-housemates were instructed to change into a special uniform. Anyone not obeying would lose {{the opportunity to become}} a housemate. Lisa gained housemate status {{in the early hours of}} Day 2 when <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> a ringing phone in the living room. Given 15 minutes to select the fourth housemate, she chose Kris. Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to be real glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in a cup of tea for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and which one would be evicted. With 6.8% of a vote to save, Beinazir became the first evictee without ever becoming a housemate.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Sarita {{entered a}} feud with Velvet Sky, scoring back-to-back pinfall victories over {{her on the}} October 28 and the November 4 episodes of Impact!, first in a six-woman tag team match {{and then in a}} singles match. Sarita and Taylor Wilde had their third match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion, with Sarita once again coming out victorious. Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact! as a face, when <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> the challenge of TNA Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non-title match, Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact! when, despite losing to her and Love in the first round match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, Sarita claimed that Sky was a loser, and {{would never be able to}} beat her. On the December 23 episode of Impact!, Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but was forced to miss the match, after being attacked backstage by Sarita. The following week, Sarita defeated Sky in a Strap match. On the February 10 episode of Impact!, Sarita's on-screen cousin, Rosita, made her TNA debut in an eight-woman tag team match, where the duo teamed with Madison Rayne and Tara and defeated Angelina Love, Mickie James, Velvet Sky and Winter. The following week, Sarita and Rosita aligned themselves with Hernandez, who had returned from working in Mexico the previous week and had begun expressing anti-American views. Later in the evening, Sarita and Rosita defeated Angelina Love and Velvet Sky in a tag team match. Afterwards, Sky challenged Sarita to a one-on-one match, where she agreed to put her career on the line. On the March 3 episode of Impact!, Sky was able to defeat Sarita in a singles match, salvaging her career in the process.|$|E

25|$|The {{career of}} writer-producer Fred Barron began in 1975 {{when he used}} the history of Cambridge’s The Real Paper {{as the basis for}} a screenplay, Between the Lines. When Joan Micklin Silver brought Hester Street (1975) to the Welles Cinema, she was joined at the Welles Restaurant by Barron and others. When someone asked what she would direct next, <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> that she was looking at screenplays. Barron stood up, left the {{restaurant}} and returned with his screenplay. The success of Between the Lines (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled Between the Lines.|$|E
25|$|On October 22, 1824, Barbudo {{appeared}} {{at a hearing}} before a magistrate. The Government presented as evidence against her various letters which included five letters from Rojas, two issues of the newspaper El Observador Caraqueño; two copies of the newspaper El Cometa, and one copy each of the newspapers El Constitucional Caraqueño and El Colombiano, which were sympathetic to Bolívar’s ideals. When asked if she recognized the correspondence, <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> in the affirmative and refused to answer any more questions. The government also presented as evidence various anti-monarchy propaganda pamphlets to be distributed throughout the island. Barbudo was found guilty.|$|E

ICM Research, ComRes and YouGov all took polls immediately afterwards, all three of them putting her in last place. In the second debate on 16 April, Wood challenged Labour leader Ed Miliband to hold an emergency budget if the party won the election, to reverse spending cuts she believes have been particularly harmful in Wales. On 30 April, she took part in Ask Leanne Wood, a 30-minute debate on BBC One Wales in which <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> questions from a live audience, and suggested Plaid Cymru would support a Labour government.|$|E
25|$|She became {{interested}} in flying as an eight-year-old when she saw a barnstormer land in a field near her family's farm. She trained at a flight training school and had her first solo flight in 1941 as a 19-year-old. Ringenberg began her aviation career in 1943 during World War II when she became a ferry pilot with the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). Although WASP pilots {{were not allowed to}} fly combat missions, they served grueling, often dangerous duties, such as ferrying, test flying, and target towing. The WASP corps was disbanded at the end of 1944. Ringenberg {{went on to become a}} flight instructor in 1945 and flew as a commercial pilot and instructor for the rest of her life. After the war, <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> phones at an airport.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1982, Berg {{tried to}} {{interview}} Ellen Kaplan, {{a member of}} the LaRouche movement, about an incident that had happened on February 7, 1982, at the Newark International Airport. Kaplan had recognized Henry Kissinger, who {{was on his way to}} Boston to undergo a bypass operation, and shouted an abusive question at him, whereupon his wife Nancy attacked Kaplan. During his program, Berg called Kaplan on the phone. When <b>she</b> <b>answered,</b> he introduced her as “a vile human being” and praised Nancy Kissinger's attack on her. After Kaplan hung up, Berg continued to ridicule Kaplan and abuse her verbally for the remainder of the program. Afterwards, KOA received complaints by listeners and Kaplan's boyfriend, and on suggestion of the lawyers of the station owners General Electric, the station management suspended Berg from work for a few days. After returning to work, Berg toned down his methods somewhat.|$|E

25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E

500|$|Ferraro's strong {{performance}} at an [...] press conference covering the final disclosure—where <b>she</b> <b>answered</b> all questions for two hours—effectively ended {{the issue for}} the remainder of the campaign, but significant damage had been done. No campaign issue during the entire 1984 presidential campaign received more media attention than Ferraro's finances. The exposure diminished Ferraro's rising stardom, removed whatever momentum the Mondale–Ferraro ticket gained out of the convention, and delayed formation of a coherent message for the fall campaign.|$|E

500|$|Arthur Vaughan Williams died {{suddenly}} in February 1875, and his widow took {{the children to}} live in her family home, Leith Hill Place, Wotton, Surrey. The children were {{under the care of}} a nurse, Sara Wager, who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions. Such views were consistent with the progressive-minded tradition of both sides of the family. When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin's controversial book On the Origin of Species, <b>she</b> <b>answered,</b> [...] "The Bible says that God made the world in six days.
