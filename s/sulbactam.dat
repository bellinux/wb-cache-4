25|$|Due to {{widespread}} resistance to many common first-line antibiotics, carbapenems, polymyxins, {{and more recently}} tigecycline {{were considered to be}} the drugs of choice; however, resistance to these drugs has also been reported. Despite this, they are still being used in areas where resistance has not yet been reported. Use of β-lactamase inhibitors such as <b>sulbactam</b> has been advised in combination with antibiotics to enhance antimicrobial action even {{in the presence of a}} certain level of resistance. Combination therapy after rigorous antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been found to be the best course of action in the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Some next-generation antibiotics that are reported as being active against P. aeruginosa include doripenem, ceftobiprole, and ceftaroline. However, these require more clinical trials for standardization. Therefore, research for the discovery of new antibiotics and drugs against P. aeruginosa is very much needed.|$|E
25|$|Although the inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are not ESBLs, {{they are}} often {{discussed}} with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of E. coli, but also some strains of K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, P. mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii.

2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, <b>sulbactam,</b> or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E
2500|$|In general, an isolate is {{suspected}} {{to be an}} ESBL producer when it shows in vitro susceptibility to the second-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefotetan) but resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and to aztreonam. Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported in vitro susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as [...] "resistant" [...] to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, {{even if it is}} tested (in vitro) as susceptible. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as well as high frequency of co-existence of fluoroquinolone resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, <b>sulbactam,</b> and tazobactam in vitro inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. Cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. In vivo studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. (Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated in vitro stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, carbapenems are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent in vitro activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{properties of}} sultamicillin are improved {{compared to a}} combination of ampicillin and <b>sulbactam.</b> Sultamicillin increases the absorption and decreases the chances of diarrhea and dysentery. The inclusion of <b>sulbactam</b> extends ampicillin's spectrum of action to beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteria. Oral <b>sulbactam</b> with parenteral form provides a regimen of continuous <b>sulbactam</b> therapy throughout the treatment, resulting in better clinical results.|$|E
50|$|After absorption, {{sultamicillin}} releases ampicillin and <b>sulbactam</b> {{into the}} system, {{so all the}} antibacterial efficacy of sultamicillin is due to ampicillin and <b>sulbactam.</b> Ampicillin exerts antibacterial activity against sensitive organisms by inhibiting biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide where as <b>sulbactam</b> irreversibly inhibits most important beta-lactamases that occur in resistant strains.|$|E
50|$|Cefoperazone is {{also sold}} as a co-formulation with <b>sulbactam.</b> Cefoperazone exerts its {{bactericidal}} effect by inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis, and <b>sulbactam</b> acts as a beta-lactamase inhibitor, to increase the antibacterial activity of cefoperazone against beta-lactamase-producing organisms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sulbactam</b> is an {{irreversible}} inhibitor of β-lactamase; it binds to {{the enzyme}} {{and does not}} allow it to degrade the antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|The {{recommended}} adult dose of ampicillin/sulbactam is 1.5 grams (1g ampicillin sodium plus 0.5g <b>sulbactam</b> sodium) to 3.0 grams (2g ampicillin sodium plus 1g <b>sulbactam</b> sodium) {{every six}} hours. In pediatric patients, the dose {{is based on}} body weight and is recommended at 300 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. This total daily dose is to be divided into equal amounts to be given every six hours. In patients with decreased kidney function, the dosing frequency {{may need to be}} reduced.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of <b>sulbactam</b> to ampicillin enhances {{the effects of}} ampicillin. This increases the antimicrobial activity by 4- to 32-fold when compared to ampicillin alone. Ampicillin is a time-dependent antibiotic. Its bacterial killing is largely related to the time that drug concentrations in the body remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The duration of exposure will thus correspond to how much bacterial killing will occur. Various studies have shown that, for maximum bacterial killing, drug concentrations must be above the MIC for 50-60% of {{the time for the}} penicillin group of antibiotics. This means that longer durations of adequate concentrations are more likely to produce therapeutic success. However, when ampicillin is given in combination with <b>sulbactam,</b> regrowth of bacteria has been seen when <b>sulbactam</b> levels fall below certain concentrations. As with many other antibiotics, under-dosing of ampicillin/sulbactam may lead to resistance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulbactam</b> is a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug {{is given}} in {{combination}} with β-lactam antibiotics to inhibit β-lactamase, an enzyme produced by bacteria that destroys the antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|He {{has helped}} in {{outsourcing}} of several products like Metoprolol extended release + Amlodipine, Metoprolol XL + Ramipril, Cefoperazone + <b>sulbactam</b> (2:1 combination) and Quetiapine Sustained Released to various multi-national and Indian pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
50|$|Sultamicillin is an oral {{form of the}} {{antibiotic}} combination (codrug or mutual prodrug) ampicillin/sulbactam. It contains esterified ampicillin and <b>sulbactam</b> and is marketed under a number of trade names, e. g. Unasyn from Pfizer.|$|E
50|$|Sultamicillin is {{a mutual}} prodrug of {{ampicillin}} and <b>sulbactam.</b> Ampicillin, a semi-synthetic orally active broad spectrum antibiotic, is linked via a methylene {{group with a}} beta-lactamase inhibitor. Sultamicillin is chemically oxymethyl penicillinate sulfone ester of ampicillin.|$|E
50|$|Ampicillin/sulbactam is a {{combination}} of the common penicillin-derived antibiotic ampicillin and <b>sulbactam,</b> an inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamase. Two different forms of the drug exist. The first, developed in 1987 and marketed in the United States under the tradename Unasyn, generic only outside of the United States, is an intravenous antibiotic. The second, an oral form called sultamicillin, is marketed under the trade name Ampictam outside of the United States. And generic only in the United States, ampicillin/sulbactam is used to treat infections caused by bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. <b>Sulbactam</b> blocks the enzyme which breaks down ampicillin and thereby allows ampicillin to attack and kill the bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|Acinetobacter {{species are}} {{innately}} resistant to many classes of antibiotics, including penicillin, chloramphenicol, and often aminoglycosides. Resistance to fluoroquinolones {{has been reported}} during therapy, which has also resulted in increased resistance to other drug classes mediated through active drug efflux. A dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter strains has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the carbapenems are recognised as the gold-standard and treatment of last resort. [...] Acinetobacter species are unusual {{in that they are}} sensitive to <b>sulbactam,</b> which is commonly used to inhibit bacterial beta-lactamase, but {{this is an example of}} the antibacterial property of <b>sulbactam</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>sulbactam</b> is {{combined}} to form ampicillin/sulbactam. It does possess some antibacterial activity when administered alone, {{but it is}} too weak to have any clinical importance. Its use in the UK is restricted to hospitals.|$|E
5000|$|The 2br enzymes, {{with the}} letter [...] "r" [...] {{denoting}} reduced binding to clavulanic acid and <b>sulbactam,</b> are also called inhibitor-resistant TEM-derivative enzymes; nevertheless, they are commonly still susceptible to tazobactam, except where an amino acid replacement exists at position met69.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulbactam</b> is able {{to inhibit}} the most common forms of β-lactamase but {{is not able to}} {{interact}} with the AmpC cephalosporinase. Thus, it confers little protection against bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia, which often express this gene.|$|E
5000|$|Ampicillin/sulbactam is a {{combination}} of a β-lactam antibiotic and a β-lactamase inhibitor. Ampicillin works by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. This causes disruption of the bacterial cell wall and leads to bacterial cell death. However, resistant pathogens may produce β-lactamase enzymes that can inactivate ampicillin through hydrolysis. [...] This is prevented by the addition of <b>sulbactam,</b> which binds and inhibits the β-lactamase enzymes. It is also capable of binding to the PBP of Bacteroides fragilis and Acinetobacter spp., even when it is given alone. The activity of <b>sulbactam</b> against Acinetobacter spp. seen in in-vitro studies makes it distinctive compared to other β-lactamase inhibitors, such as tazobactam and clavulanic acid.|$|E
50|$|Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM {{variants}} {{are resistant}} to inhibition by clavulanic acid and <b>sulbactam,</b> thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—beta lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin/sulbactam, they remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} {{and use of}} ampicillin alone started in 1961. [...] The development and introduction of this drug allowed the use of targeted therapies against gram-negative bacteria. With the rise of beta-lactamase producing bacteria, ampicillin and the other penicillin-derivatives became ineffective to these resistant organisms. With the introduction of beta-lactamase inhibitors such as <b>sulbactam,</b> combined with ampicillin made beta-lactamase producing bacteria susceptible.|$|E
5000|$|Haemophilus influenzae {{produces}} beta-lactamases, {{and it is}} {{also able}} to modify its penicillin-binding proteins, so it has gained resistance to the penicillin family of antibiotics.In severe cases, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone delivered directly into the bloodstream are the elected antibiotics, and, for the less severe cases, an association of ampicillin and <b>sulbactam,</b> cephalosporins of the second and third generation, or fluoroquinolones are preferred. (Fluoroquinolone-resistant Haemophilus influenzae have been observed.) ...|$|E
50|$|Currently {{available}} {{beta-lactamase inhibitors}} are effective against Ambler Class A beta-lactamases (tazobactam, clavulanate, and <b>sulbactam)</b> or against Ambler Class A, C and some Class D beta-lactamases (avibactam). Like beta-lactam antibiotics, they are processed by beta-lactamases {{to form an}} initial covalent intermediate. Unlike the case of beta-lactam antibiotics, the formed covalent intermediate is very stable. The persistence of the covalent bond between the beta-lactamase inhibitor and the beta-lactamase binding site deactivates the enzyme and prevents processing of beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Ampicillin is used {{to treat}} infections by many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ampicillin was the first 'broad spectrum' {{penicillin}} with activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (but not penicillin-resistant or methicillin-resistant strains), and some Enterococcus. Activity against Gram-negative bacteria includes Neisseria meningitidis, some Haemophilus influenzae, {{and some of the}} Enterobacteriaceae. Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by co-administration of <b>sulbactam,</b> a drug that inhibits beta lactamase, an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics. It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action, like vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline.|$|E
5000|$|The {{available}} parenteral antimicrobials {{for most}} infections are metronidazole, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, a penicillin (i.e. ticarcillin, ampicillin, piperacillin) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e. clavulanic acid, <b>sulbactam,</b> tazobactam), and a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem). An antimicrobial effective against Gram-negative enteric bacilli (i.e. aminoglycoside) or an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin (i.e. cefepime [...] ) are generally added to metronidazole, and occasionally cefoxitin when treating intra-abdominal infections to provide coverage for these organisms. Clindamycin {{should not be}} used as a single agent as empiric therapy for abdominal infections. Penicillin can be added to metronidazole in treating of intracranial, pulmonary and dental infections to provide coverage against microaerophilic streptococci, and Actinomyces.|$|E
5000|$|Ampicillin/sulbactam has poor {{absorption}} {{when given}} orally. [...] The two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic profiles that appear unchanged when given together. Ampicillin and <b>sulbactam</b> are both hydrophilic antibiotics {{and have a}} volume of distribution (Vd) similar to the volume of extra-cellular body water. The volume that the drug distributes throughout in healthy patients is approximately 0.2 liters per kilogram of body weight. Patients on hemodialysis, elderly patients, and pediatric patients have shown a slightly increased volume of distribution. Using typical doses, ampicillin/sulbactam {{has been shown to}} reach desired levels to treat infections in the brain, lungs, and abdominal tissues. Both agents have moderate protein binding, reported at 38% for <b>sulbactam</b> and 28% for ampicillin.15,16 The half-life of ampicillin is approximately 1 hour, when used alone or in combination with sulbactam; therefore it will be completely eliminated from a healthy person in around 5 hours. It is eliminated primarily by the urinary system, with 75% excreted unchanged in the urine. Only small amounts of each drug were found to be excreted in the bile. Ampicillin/sulbactam should be given with caution in infants less than a week old and premature neonates. This is due to the underdeveloped urinary system in these patients, which can cause a significantly increased half-life for both drugs.16 Based on its elimination, ampicillin/sulbactam is typically given every 6 to 8 hours. Slowed clearance of both drugs has been seen in the elderly, renal disease patients, and critically ill patients on renal replacement therapy. Reduced clearance has been seen in both pediatric and post-operative patients. Adjustments in dosing frequency may be required in these patients due to these changes.|$|E
