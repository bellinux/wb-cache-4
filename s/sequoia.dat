5|$|SR 198 then intersects Interstate 5 (I-5) in Fresno County {{near the}} Harris Ranch Airport before {{becoming}} a freeway west of Lemoore. The landscape becomes a bit less rural as it goes through Hanford and passes near the Hanford Municipal Airport, where it continues as a four-lane expressway from the intersection with SR 43 until SR 198 encounters a freeway-to-freeway interchange with SR 99 as it enters Visalia, the largest city it passes through, and goes by the Visalia Municipal Airport. It remains a freeway until east of Visalia, intersecting SR 65 and passing by College of the Sequoias. The road starts to climb the forested Sierra Nevada and ends at <b>Sequoia</b> National Park, near Lake Kaweah.

Soon Elveera and Lazuli moved away from the Whiskers and Aztecs form their territory next to the Whiskers. In 2007 Whiskers main rivals were Young Ones, Aztecs and Commandos. Then Young Ones died out, and Kung Fu formed next to Whiskers, Commandos moved away and the <b>Sequoia</b> formed. Today Whiskers main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and <b>Sequoia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1856, settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the Mariposa Grove of giant <b>sequoia</b> at Wawona, an indigenous encampment {{in what is}} now the southwestern part of the park.

5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant <b>sequoia</b> trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease.

5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} <b>sequoia,</b> and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E

5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant <b>sequoia,</b> interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant <b>sequoia</b> groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove {{of giant}} <b>sequoia</b> trees were {{transferred}} from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable {{to people and}} access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging {{of giant}} <b>sequoia,</b> and other damage caused Muir {{to become an}} {{advocate}} for further protection.

Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant <b>sequoia</b> is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{has nine}} or more subspecies which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it {{is more likely to be}} found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant <b>sequoia</b> as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E
5|$|The Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site near St. Louis, {{and several}} other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant's life.

On June 3, 1891, a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor Johannes Gelert was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena, Illinois. From 1890 to 1940, part of what is now Kings Canyon National Park was called General Grant National Park, named for the General Grant <b>sequoia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant <b>Sequoia</b> trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby <b>Sequoia</b> trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
