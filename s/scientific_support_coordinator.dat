40|$|NOAA is {{responsible}} for protecting and restoring marine and coastal environments impacted by spills and hazardous substance releases. The Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) {{is the focal point}} for NOAA’s spill preparedness, emergency response, and restoration programs. OR&R’s Hazardous Materials Response Division and its contingent of on-scene <b>Scientific</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Coordinators</b> have earned a wide reputation for delivering scientifically valid solutions to the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (the U. S. Coast Guard in the coastal zone, or EPA in inland areas). OR&R’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Division and Damage Assessment Center are critic al components of NOAA's natural resource trusteeship responsibilities. The CPR Division works closely with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to redress the environmental effects of hazardous waste sites across the United States. Coastal Resource Coordinators provide site-specific technical expertise in ecological risk assessment and coastal remediation issues. This expertise ranges from physical science to ecology, marine biology, and oceanography. In their NOAA trusteeship role, CRCs assess the longer-term risks to coastal resources (including threatened and endangered species) from Superfund-site contamination, support decision-making for site remedies and habitat restoration, and negotiate protective remedies with the responsible parties to ensure that cleanup, restoration, and recovery are appropriat...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{variables}} associated with the sustainability of Person Centered Planning over time by <b>Support</b> <b>Coordinators</b> working in an agency that provided services to individuals with developmental disabilities. Identifying these factors that positively or negatively affect the implementation and longterm sustainability of Person Centered Planning was an important outcome of the current study. The study was designed to investigate the following areas: (a) the current level of use of Person Centered Planning by <b>Support</b> <b>Coordinators</b> in the agency; (b) the variables associated with the degree to which Person Centered Planning has been sustained; (c) strategies for ensuring sustainability of Person Centered Planning; and (d) the agency's demonstration that its values are consonant with the philosophy and goals of Person Centered Planning. The research in this study was qualitative in nature, utilizing questionnaires, interviews and document reviews. Fourteen <b>Support</b> <b>coordinators</b> and five administrators employed by the agency comprised the population in the present study. <b>Support</b> <b>coordinators</b> who participated in this study were asked to complete a questionnaire related to specific demographics, as well as a questionnaire that illustrated the individual's perception of his/her use of Person Centered Planning. Both the administrators and the <b>support</b> <b>coordinators</b> were interviewed. The interviews were semistructured, guided by a set of questions, which provided consistent parameters around the areas for discussion. The review of documents included a portion of the Individual Service Plans completed during the years 2000 [...] 2001, and a review of the agency's mission statement and other planning documents. From the review of the ISP, a paucity of documentation exists from which to corroborate the numbers of <b>support</b> <b>coordinators</b> that self-reported they are either using Person Centered Planning or completing ISPs, which are person-centered. The results of the study provided evidence that Person Centered Planning has not been sustained as an overall organizational change within the agency under study...|$|R

This paper asks how this new role is working in practice, what are the realities and {{tensions}} of the role, and what has been the impact to students? One of the challenges of implementing this new system was expected to be ensuring that all those involved understand their roles and help students to make use of them appropriately. Data were collected both from the student <b>support</b> <b>coordinators</b> themselves and staff they worked alongside via interview and attendance at meetings. Data were also collected from students via interviews and surveys. The feedback from students showed an increasing awareness of the service offered by SSCs over time and a high level of satisfaction.
