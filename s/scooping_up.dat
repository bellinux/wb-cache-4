5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E

25|$|In both cases, {{having a}} crew member lift {{the end of the}} mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the {{greatest}} challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to lift out of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.|$|E
25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E
500|$|The {{brown pelican}} usually plunge-dives head-first for its prey, from a height {{as great as}} , {{especially}} for anchovies and menhaden. The only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is the Peruvian pelican, but its dives are typically from a lower height than the brown pelican. The Australian and American white pelicans may feed by low plunge-dives landing feet-first and then <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> the prey with the beak, but they—as well as the remaining pelican species—primarily feed while swimming on the water. Aquatic prey is most commonly taken {{at or near the}} water surface. Although principally a fish eater, the Australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites as well as taking carrion and [...] "anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs". Food is not stored in a pelican's throat pouch, contrary to popular folklore.|$|E

500|$|The diet of {{pelicans}} usually {{consists of}} fish, but occasionally amphibians, turtles, crustaceans, insects, {{birds and mammals}} are also eaten. The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location. For example, in Africa the pink-backed pelican generally takes fish {{ranging in size from}} fry up to [...] and the great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish, up to , but in Europe the latter species has been recorded taking fish up to [...] In deep water, white pelicans often fish alone. Nearer the shore, several will encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows, beating their wings on the water surface and then <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> the prey. Although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone, the Dalmantian, pink-backed and spot-billed pelicans are the only to prefer solitary feeding. When fishing in groups, all pelican species have been known to work together to catch their prey, and Dalmantian pelicans may even cooperate with great cormorants. They catch multiple small fish by expanding the throat pouch, which must be drained above the water surface before swallowing. This operation takes up to a minute, during which time other seabirds may steal the fish.|$|E
500|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Tallon stumped Denis Compton, but {{the umpire}} gave him not out because [...] "the {{glare of the}} sun {{suddenly}} became so intense that {{he was unable to}} see clearly the white line of the popping crease" [...] and Compton made 147. The England openers Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook had put on 100 in the second innings when Tallon caught Washbrook, <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> a ball from Lindwall. Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" [...] - and this caused an umpiring controversy. But Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him. Washbrook told Wally Hammond that the ball had gone into the ground just before it went into Tallon's gloves and the England captain tried unsuccessfully to find a press photograph of the ball touching the ground. Later in the match Tallon missed a vital stumping off the England wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans, who stayed put for 95 minutes without making a run. Tallon stumped Compton again, but he was given not out and went on to make an unbeaten 103 in a match-saving stand of 85 with Evans.|$|E
2500|$|The whale feeds {{mainly on}} benthic crustaceans, which it eats by turning {{on its side}} (usually the right, {{resulting}} in loss of eyesight in the right eye for many older animals) and <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> sediments from the sea floor. This unique feeding selection makes gray whales {{one of the most}} strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a baleen whale and has baleen, or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including amphipods taken in along with sand, water and other material. Mostly, the animal feeds in the northern waters during the summer; and opportunistically feeds during its migration, depending primarily on its extensive fat reserves. Calf gray whales drink [...] of their mothers' 53% fat milk per day.|$|E

2500|$|Sure enough, the Indian bowlers {{got plenty}} of help from the pitch. However, the Australian batsmen also played a hand in their own dismissal, playing too many rash strokes. The Australians {{suffered}} their first setback, when Ajit Agarkar got Justin Langer plumb lbw in the second ball of the second over with a delivery that nipped back in. At 10/1, Ricky Ponting, Australia's first innings double centurion entered. However, he played 16 balls without opening his account before he drove straight to the hands of gully. Then the score was 18/2. Soon after, in the 15th over, (8.2 overs after the first wicket)the third wicket fell–this time, Matthew Hayden being the batsman, <b>scooping</b> <b>up</b> a drive straight to cover. Australia were soon struggling at 44/3. Then came {{one of the few}} partnerships of any substantial note in the Australian innings. Damien Martyn and Steve Waugh came together to add 65 runs for the fourth wicket. The partnership started off slowly, with only 11 runs being added in 5 overs, and then in the 21st over, Waugh broke out from the defensive shell by stroking two boundaries off Ashish Nehra's over. Thereafter, Martyn took displayed a stylish exhibition of batting with some glorious cover-drives, whereas Waugh dominated the partnership with his trademark square-drives. However, the track seemed to aid spin-even Anil Kumble's legbreaks turned a great deal-Sourav Ganguly brought on Sachin Tendulkar, and the move immediately paid off. In his third over, Tendulkar lured Damien Martyn [...] into edging to slips, where Rahul Dravid held a superb catch. Martyn departed after a commanding 38, and then in his fourth over, he made Waugh edge a delivery to Dravid at slips. From 109/3, the Australian were suddenly in trouble at 112/5.|$|E
