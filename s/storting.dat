5|$|Because of scepticism {{surrounding}} the will, {{it was not}} until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the <b>Storting</b> in Norway. The executors of Nobel's will, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the award of prizes.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Peace Prize banquet {{is held in}} Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel {{after the}} award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the President of the <b>Storting,</b> the Prime Minister, and, since 2006, the King and Queen of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.|$|E
5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the <b>Storting,</b> he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a {{member of the}} supervisory board of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals. Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition that they not move to Christiania.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Quisling {{left the}} Farmers' Party and founded the fascist party Nasjonal Samling. Although he {{achieved}} some popularity after his {{attacks on the}} political left, his party failed to win any seats in the <b>Storting</b> and by 1940 it was still little more than peripheral. On 9 April 1940, with the German invasion of Norway in progress, he attempted to seize power in the world's first radio-broadcast coup d'état, but failed after the Germans refused to support his government.|$|E
5|$|Quisling {{had earlier}} {{pushed for a}} {{corporate}} alternative to the Parliament of Norway, the <b>Storting,</b> which he called a Riksting. It would comprise two chambers, the Næringsting (Economic Chamber) and Kulturting (Cultural Chamber). Now, in advance of Nasjonal Samling's eighth and last national convention on 25 September and becoming increasingly distrustful of professional bodies, he changed his mind. The Riksting became an advisory body while the Førerting, or Fører Council, and parliamentary chambers were now to be independent bodies subordinate to their respective ministries.|$|E
5|$|Christiania, {{promoted}} {{to the status of}} a capital city in 1814, had practically no buildings suitable for the many new government institutions. An ambitious building program was initiated, but realised very slowly because of a strained economy. The first major undertaking was the Royal Palace, designed by Hans Linstow and built between 1824 and 1848. Linstow also planned Karl Johans gate, the avenue connecting the Palace and the city, with a monumental square halfway to be surrounded by buildings for the University, the Parliament (<b>Storting)</b> and other institutions. But only the University buildings were realised according to this plan. Christian Heinrich Grosch, one of the first fully educated architects in Norway, designed the original building for the Oslo Stock Exchange (1826–1828), the local branch of the Bank of Norway (1828), Christiania Theatre (1836–1837), and the first campus for the University of Oslo (1841–1856). For the University buildings, he sought the assistance of the renowned German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel.|$|E
50|$|The River <b>Stort</b> is a {{river in}} Essex and Hertfordshire, England. It is 24 miles (38 km) long and flows from {{just south of}} the village of Langley to the River Lea at Hoddesdon.Unusually, the town of Bishop's Stortford does not derive its name from the River <b>Stort,</b> but the other way around. 16th-century cartographers Saxton & Camden named the river <b>Stort,</b> {{assuming}} the town of Stortford was named for its ford.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Stort</b> Navigation is the canalised {{section of}} the River <b>Stort</b> running 22 km {{from the town of}} Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, {{downstream}} to its confluence with the River Lee Navigation at Feildes Weir near Rye House, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire.|$|R
50|$|Hunsdon Mead {{is located}} between the River <b>Stort</b> and the <b>Stort</b> Navigation. It is {{unimproved}} grassland which {{is subject to}} winter flooding. As {{a result of its}} location and traditional management it supports a number of uncommon plants. Notable grass species include meadow brome and the quaking grass briza media, and there are other unusual flora such as pepper saxifrage and green-winged orchid. Roydon Mead lies east of the <b>Stort</b> Navigation, and both have large flocks of over-wintering birds.|$|R
25|$|The Ministry of Finance {{sets up the}} Governments tax program, {{which is}} {{included}} in the fiscal budget proposal. The Budget is submitted to the <b>Storting</b> as Proposition No. 1 to the <b>Storting.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Storting</b> determines {{each year}} the maximum tax rates applied to the {{municipal}} income and wealth tax to the county income tax. Municipalities and county councils shall, in connection with their budget, adopt the tax rates applied to the local income and wealth tax within the maximum rates set by the <b>Storting.</b> In addition, municipalities can levy a property tax.|$|E
25|$|Red has 10 {{county council}} representatives {{nationwide}} and 80 municipal representatives. In the 2013 parliamentary election, {{it was the}} largest party which failed to win a seat. The party entered parliament in the 2017 election, winning 2.4% of the votes and its first seat ever in the <b>Storting.</b> The last time a far-left party had representation in the <b>Storting</b> was when its predecessor party, the Red Electoral Alliance, won a seat in the 1993 election.|$|E

50|$|The River <b>Stort</b> {{is named}} after the town, and not the town after the river. When cartographers visited the town in the 16th century, they {{reasoned}} that the town must have been named for the ford over the river and assumed the river was called the <b>Stort.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} the tax program decided by the <b>Storting,</b> the Ministry of Finance is supported by two subordinate agencies and bodies.|$|E
25|$|Taxes, excise {{and customs}} are {{adopted by the}} <b>Storting</b> for one year through the annual (plenary) {{decision}} on taxes, excisse and customs. The <b>Storting</b> must therefore each year decide to what extent it is desirable to amend the tax scheme. It rests basically no other limitations on the Storting's taxation authority under the Constitution § 75 a than those required by the Constitution itself. The prohibition against retroactive laws in the Constitution § 97 {{is an example of}} such a restriction.|$|E

[...] After some delay, the trial for Schwartz began in March 2006. Bigger's trials would not begin until the following March. Schwartz was provided with a court-appointed defense attorney named Brick <b>Storts.</b> Early on, <b>Storts</b> suggested that the attorney-client relationship between Schwartz and Lopez precluded the case from going to trial. Other arguments <b>Storts</b> used revolved around discrepancies between the time of death, Bigger's whereabouts, {{and the fact that}} the $10,000 had seemingly vanished.|$|R
25|$|Sweden refused Christian's {{conditions}} {{and a short}} military campaign ensued in which the Norwegian army was defeated {{by the forces of}} the Swedish crown prince Charles John. The brief war concluded with the Convention of Moss on 14 August 1814. By the terms of this treaty, King Christian Frederick transferred executive power to the <b>Storting,</b> then abdicated and returned to Denmark. The <b>Storting</b> in its turn adopted the constitutional amendments necessary to allow for a personal union with Sweden and on 4 November elected Charles XIII of Sweden as the new king of Norway.|$|E
25|$|In June 1905 the <b>Storting</b> {{unilaterally}} dissolved the 91-year-old {{union with}} Sweden. After a short but tense {{period during which}} both armies were mobilized, Sweden agreed to the peaceful dissolution of the union.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} battles of the war, a hundred year old fortification, manned by recruits and pensioners and armed with 40- to 50-year-old weaponry of German and Austro-Hungarian manufacture had destroyed a ship so new, its crew was still finishing training. Oscarsborg had fulfilled its mission and denied an invader the way to the capital. Even though it and the country ultimately were captured and occupied, the effects of delaying the German advance were immediate and considerable. On board Blücher were troops specially designated to capture the King, the Norwegian cabinet, the <b>Storting</b> (Norwegian Parliament) and the national gold reserve; the delay made it possible for all these to escape from Oslo. Later on 9 April, the <b>Storting</b> was able to convene at Elverum and give the cabinet a wide authorization to govern until a <b>Storting</b> could again assemble. Thus, the Norwegian government was able to continue the defence of Norway until it had evacuated to exile in the United Kingdom on 7 June, with the Norwegian Army laying down their arms on 10 June.|$|E

25|$|After Sweden {{left the}} union in 1523, Norway became the junior partner in Denmark–Norway. The Reformation was {{introduced}} in 1537 and absolute monarchy imposed in 1661. In 1814, Norway was ceded to the king of Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel. Norway declared its independence and adopted a constitution. However, no foreign powers recognized the Norwegian independence but supported the Swedish demand for Norway {{to comply with the}} treaty of Kiel. After a short war with Sweden, the countries concluded the Convention of Moss, in which Norway accepted a personal union with Sweden, keeping its Constitution, <b>Storting</b> and separate institutions, except for the foreign service. The union was formally established after the extraordinary <b>Storting</b> adopted the necessary amendments to the Constitution and elected Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway on 4 November 1814.|$|E
