5000|$|The {{transmission}} was {{a common}} problem; a clutch {{did not seem to}} exist which combined the ability to withstand [...] on a regular basis with the ability to give a smooth <b>start.</b> <b>Clutch</b> failures were commonplace. Competitor GE's cars used an electric transmission, and that or a hydraulic torque converter have been used on the vast majority of successful internal combustion-engined rail vehicles since.|$|E
50|$|Push {{starting}}, {{also known}} as bump <b>starting,</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>starting,</b> popping the <b>clutch</b> or crash <b>starting</b> is a method of starting a motor vehicle with an internal combustion engine by engaging the manual transmission whilst the vehicle is in motion. The technique is most commonly employed when other starting methods (automobile self starter, kick start, jump start etc.) are unavailable.|$|R

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) was studied on Gull Island, Presqu'ile Provincial Park, Ontario, in 1976 and 1977. Early <b>started</b> <b>clutches</b> (comprising {{the majority of}} clutches on Gull Island) in 1977 produced more chicks per nest (2. 20 ± 0. 09) than late <b>started</b> <b>clutches</b> (0. 86 ± 0. 13) {{as a result of}} reductions in mean clutch size, hatching success and fledging success with date of clutch initiation. Seasonal changes in mean clutch size, hatching success and fledging success also resulted in early clutches, initiated at the peak of <b>clutch</b> <b>starts,</b> producing more chicks per nest (2. 34 ± 0. 11) than either pre-peak (2. 13 ± 0. 20) or post-peak (1. 82 ± 0. 29) clutches. Possible reasons for these trends, including the observed predominance of immature plumaged, breeding gulls in late started areas, are discussed. Clutches were deserted at night for varying lengths of time from at least 15 April until 10 May, 1977. It is suggested that this nocturnal desertion behaviour resulted in the enhancement of inter- and intra-clutch hatching synchrony in early started areas and further, that this may in part explain the existence of the behaviour in terms of its adaptive significance...|$|R

50|$|The nest is {{a shallow}} {{depression}} on open ground {{and has no}} lining, although {{there may be a}} circle of stomes around the nest as the birds move any small stomes within the depression to the rim when they <b>start</b> laying. <b>Clutch</b> is 2-3 eggs which are incubated for just over three weeks and the chicks fledge in 24-28 days.|$|R
40|$|Several factors {{influencing}} reproductive success were investigated at a Common Tern colony at Port Colborne, Ontario in 1976. In general three egg clutches hatched better than two egg <b>clutches</b> and early <b>started</b> <b>clutches</b> hatched eggs and fledged chicks better than late clutches; the fledging success {{of two and}} three egg clutches was similar. Early clutches took longer to hatch and hatched more synchronously than did late clutches.

40|$|An {{electric}} {{oil pump}} (EOP) was {{integrated into the}} hydraulic system and an automatic transmission (AT) mechanical oil pump (MOP) was downsized. These processes were performed to combine a start-stop function with the AT and further improve the transmission efficiency. Furthermore, this study established a dynamics model of power loss and leakage of an 8 -speed AT; a flow-based control algorithm of the EOP was then developed to realize the start-stop function and support the MOP to meet the flow requirement of the system. Based on a driving simulation method, sizes of the MOP and EOP that ensured optimal fuel economy were selected. A control strategy for the <b>starting</b> <b>clutch</b> was also developed to minimize the starting delay of the test vehicle. A test environment on a rig and prototype vehicle was established to verify the feasibility of the proposed control strategies. The test {{results indicated that the}} transmission functioned favorably with the novel two-pump system presented, and a quick and smooth starting performance was achieved when the engine was restarted. The findings in this study are extremely valuable for forward designs of an AT for realizing start-stop function and improving efficiency...|$|R

Webber was running third, having initially been passed by Jarno Trulli before the Australian regained his position.

40|$|In this Master degree {{work there}} is a {{description}} of a safety clutch of a perforator with SDS + chuck. Perforrator‘s main purpose is to drill holes in concrete, metal and wood. Safety clutch purpose is to ensure safety of electrical engine from overworking, which occurs in drilling with drill bit or crown. Safety <b>clutch</b> <b>starts</b> working when electrical engines spins pinion which is placed on cylinder. Pinion is being presseed by the spring to the cylinder‘s knuckles. Drill bit is being placed in the cylinder and when drill bit stucks or if there‘s too high resistance, knuckle goes up and overcomes spings tensile strength – pinion‘s and cylinders knuckles excel. When safety <b>clutch</b> <b>starts</b> working, pinions slide at each other and as friction exists safety clutch‘s pinions worn out. Changing worned out pinions is not complicated, but price of repair takes up to 50 % of a new perforator price. In this Master Degree work {{there is a}} comparison of four similar types of perforator safety clutches. Parameters which are included in the comparison is maximum drilling diameter in concrete, perforator price, clutch elements and safety clutch elements repair price. According to these parameters, manufacturer‘s no. 4 clutch is decided to be the weakest link. Also there is stated clutch‘s stiffness coefficient – 333. According to the stiffness coefficient, spring pushes pinion with a force of 667 N or 6, 67 kg. Averange torque is also stated in this work, as it is needed to make safety clutch work – 73 Nm. In the researched safety clutch knuckles are changed by rolls – rolls can be repaired independently from other safety clutch‘s elements. Maximum torque is set which is needed to <b>start</b> the modernized <b>clutch</b> work. The max torque is 78 Nm...|$|R
50|$|Incubation {{is assumed}} to <b>start</b> at <b>clutch</b> {{completion}} (however this is not confirmed). The incubation period lasts for approximately 27-29 days, but can last up to 33 days. Both sexes incubate the nest during the day, and partly or fully cover the eggs with sand during the day {{in response to an}} approaching threat. Egg covering was not found to occur during normal breaks in incubation of the nest but only in response to a threat, and rarely at night. It is therefore hypothesised that egg covering is not related to temperature and insulation of eggs, but rather to predation avoidance. It is thought that the male undertakes the majority of incubation during the night. If a clutch is lost, it is highly likely that a pair will re-lay eggs.|$|R

50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{application of}} the lock-up principle was Packard's Ultramatic transmission, introduced in 1949, which locked up the converter at cruising speeds, unlocking when the throttle was floored for quick acceleration or as the vehicle slowed down. This feature was also present in some Borg-Warner transmissions produced during the 1950s. It fell out of favor in subsequent years due to its extra complexity and cost. In the late 1970s lock-up <b>clutches</b> <b>started</b> to reappear in response to demands for improved fuel economy, and are now nearly universal in automotive applications.|$|R
