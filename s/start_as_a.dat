5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes <b>start</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5|$|Gromek {{entered the}} 1948 Cleveland Indians season {{fighting}} for {{a spot on the}} pitching staff after spending the offseason recovering from a knee injury, which had bothered the season prior, and while he did make the roster, he remained solely a relief pitcher to start the season. He made one <b>start</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> replacement for Don Black on June 6 against the Athletics, and won the game 11–1 in a complete game effort. Boudreau considered moving him into the starting rotation, but instead considered it a one-time appearance due to Black's injury, and he remained in a relief role though mid-July. After a second complete game victory against the Athletics on July 15, Gromek was moved to a part-time starter role, where he remained the rest of the season.|$|E

5|$|Polled Dorsets are an all-white, {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free from dark fibers. Since its development, the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not <b>start</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E

However, he was struggling in other aspects of his game. In an October game against Georgia Tech, Zolak was sacked 10 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and had a pass intercepted 12 times. By {{the end of the}} season, as Maryland was preparing to face Louisiana Tech in the , he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589yards and 10 touchdowns.
