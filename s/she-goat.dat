It forms an asterism with the stars Epsilon Aurigae, Zeta Aurigae, and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as the Haedi (the Kids). Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a nymph. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans' defeat, because Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis. The asterism containing the three goats had been a separate constellation; however, Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd-century Almagest. Before that, Capella was sometimes seen as its own constellation—by Pliny the Elder and Manilius—called Capra, Caper, or Hircus, all of which relate to its status as the [...] "goat star".

[...] The Midrash deduced that God thus showed Abraham three kinds of bullocks, three kinds of goats, and three kinds of rams that Abraham’s descendants would need to sacrifice. [...] The three kinds of bullocks were: (1) the bullock that [...] would require the Israelites to sacrifice on the Day of Atonement ( [...] , Yom Kippur), (2) the bullock that [...] would require the Israelites to bring on account of unwitting transgression of the law, and (3) the heifer whose neck [...] would require the Israelites to break. [...] The three kinds of goats were: (1) the goats that [...] would require the Israelites to sacrifice on festivals, (2) the goats that [...] would require the Israelites to sacrifice on the New Moon ( [...] , Rosh Chodesh), and (3) the goat that [...] would require an individual to bring. [...] The three kinds of rams were: (1) the guilt-offering of certain obligation that [...] for example, would require one who committed a trespass to bring, (2) the guilt-offering of doubt to which one would be liable when in doubt whether one had committed a transgression, and (3) the lamb to be brought by an individual.

40|$|Observations on the {{repeated}} use of gonadotropin treatments in the dairy goat. Our studies {{have attempted to}} determine if the absence of oestrus observed in some goats after fluorogestone acetate-pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (FGA-PMSG) treatments could be due to its repeated use. An experiment was carried out in a Saanen flock, in which <b>she-goats</b> were submitted to FGA-PMSG treatment each year. The first treatment of the year was performed on 169 shegoats between March and August 1989. Of the females diagnosed as non-pregnant following the first treatment, 38 were treated a second time during the same period. The proportion of females which went into oestrus after the first treatment was lower in 59 multiparous goats than in 64 nulliparous and in 46 primiparous goats (64. 4 vs 100 and 97. 8 %; P < O. Oi). For the <b>she-goats</b> treated twice, the percentage of females which went into oestrus after the second treatment was lower than that observed after the first treatment (44. 7 vs 71. 0 %; P < 0. 05). The presence of anti-PMSG antibodies in plasma was investigated in blood samples taken before and after each treatment. Results are expressed as % of radioactive PMSG bound by 10 pl of blood plasma. Before the first treatment, the percentage of bound PMSG was higher in multiparous than in nulliparous and primiparous goats (17. 5 t 23. 1 vs - 0. 06 t 0. 7; 1. 2 ± 1. 9; P < 0. 01), and increased after treatment for all parities. In goats treated twice, the percentage of bound PMSG before the second treatment was higher than that observed before first treatment (22. 8 t 23. vs 11. 2 f 19. 7; P < 0. 05). For both treatments, females which did not come into oestrus showed a percentage of bound PMSG which was significantly higher than that of goats in which oestrus was observed (multiparous first treatment: 30. 5 f 23. 6 vs 1 I 2. 9 20. 1 %; <b>she-goats</b> in second treatment: 33. 9 ± 23. 1 vs 9. 2 ± 14. 5 T.). When the percentage of bound PMSG before treatment was low (< 5 °l) in multiparous goats, the oestrus and kidding rates after the first treatment did not differ from those observed in nulliparous and primiparous goats. The decrease in the efficiency of the treatments was therefore not due to the age of animals. The repeated use of FGA-PMSG during the lifetime of goats or within the same year is followed by an increase in the levels of antibodies against PMSG. The presence of those antibodies may explain the decrease in the efficiency of these treatments in inducing and synchronizing oestrus. Trente huit chèvres Saânen ont reçu 2 fois au cours de la même période un traitement gonadotrope de maîtrise des cycles (FGA-PMSG). Le pourcentage de femelles venues en oestrus après le second traitement est inférieur à celui observé après le premier traitement (44, 7 vs 71, 0 %; P < 0, 05). Avant le premier traitement, le pourcentage de liaison de PMSG (% de PMSG radioactive liée par 10 0 él de plasma) est plus élevé chez les multipares que chez les nullipares et primipares (19, 2 ± 22, 8 vs - 0, 06 ± 0, 7 et 1, 2 ± 1, 9; P < 0, 01), et il augmente après traitement pour toutes les parités. Chez les chèvres traitées 2 fois, le taux de liaison de PMSG avant le second traitement est supérieur à celui observé avant le premier traitement (22, 8 ± 23, 1 vs 11, 2 ± 19, 7; P < 0, 05). Quand chez les multipares, le pourcentage de liaison de PMSG avant traitement est faible (< 5 %), les taux de venues en oestrus et de mises-bas après premier traitement ne diffèrent pas de ceux observés chez les nullipares et primipares: la diminution de l’efficacité des traitements ne serait donc pas due à l’âge des animaux. L’utilisation répétée de PMSG durant la vie de la chèvre ou au cours d’une même année est suivie d’une augmentation du niveau d’anticorps anti-PMSG. La présence de ces anticorps expliquerait la diminution de l’efficacité des traitements d’induction et de synchronisation des chaleurs nécessitant l’utilisation de PMSG. Peer reviewe...|$|R

60|$|Goats and Sheep.--Goats {{are much}} more {{troublesome}} to drive than sheep, neither are they such enduring walkers, nor do they give as much meat; but their skins are of such great use to furnish strong leather, that it is seldom convenient {{to make up a}} caravan without them. <b>She-goats</b> give some milk, even when travelling fast, and in dry countries; but a ewe-sheep is not worth milking under those circumstances, as her yield is a mere nothing. Goats are very mischievous--they make their way out of all enclosures, and trespass everywhere. They butt at whatever is bright or new, or strange to them; and would drive an observer, who employed astronomical instruments on stands, to distraction. In an open country, where there are no bushes for a kraal, nets must be taken, and stakes cut, to make enclosures for the sheep. If they stray at all, the least thing scares them, and they will wander very far, and scatter. Goats are far more social and intelligent. If one, two, or three sheep only be driven, long thongs must be tied to their legs, and allowed to trail along the ground, by which they may be re-caught if they gallop off. When the Messrs. Schlagintweit were encamped at vast heights, among the snows of the Himalaya, they always found it practicable to drive sheep to their stations. When sheep, etc., are long hurdled at night, near the same encampment, the nuisance of flies and ticks becomes intolerable. Sheep-dogs seem to prove of less use to travellers than might have been expected; perhaps the other dogs corrupt them.|$|R

No; the domestic whom I had bred from infancy made mouths at me as he stood behind my chair; the friend whom I had supported with my fortune, and for whose sake I had even stained--(he stopped with a strong convulsive shudder), even he thought me more fit for the society of lunatics--for their disgraceful restraints--for their cruel privations, than for communication with the rest of humanity. Hubert alone--and Hubert too will one day abandon me. All are of a piece, one mass of wickedness, selfishness, and ingratitude--wretches, who sin even in their devotions; and of such hardness of heart, that they do not, without hypocrisy, even thank the Deity himself for his warm sun and pure air." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vulpescu was {{a target}} of {{particular}} vehemence from writer Tudor Arghezi, who in a 1913 article in Seara titled [...] "Unghiile si sexul lui popa Iapă" [...] ("The Fingernails and Sex of Father She-Goat") named him [...] "His Most Porcine Excellence", [...] "model pig of the Romanian Synod", [...] "bishop louse" [...] and [...] "big bird". Later that year, Arghezi referred to the bishop as a [...] "scabby and decayed he-goat", a worm emerged from pig feed, with a voice recalling {{the cries of the}} pig, skunk and hyena. The latter also received the appellation [...] "three-way mongrel formed of a donkey, a mole cricket and a dog", a [...] "mix of wild snouts and rotten meat", with a ram's hairdo and a goose's teary eyes. In Facla in 1911, Arghezi had already attacked Vulpescu as a risible mongrel, the offspring of a dog and a hen, both a shaggy dog-headed beast and a foolish egg-layer. He also alleged that the bishop was rabid, that he had a [...] "stinking hand" [...] and, being [...] "foul-mouthed", had a double stench emanating from his mouth and his feet. Likening him to an outhouse due to the emanations from his mouth and his rectum, Arghezi accused Vulpescu of spitting into the mouths of altar boys, as though the [...] "bishop's drool and mucus" [...] were the Eucharist. The cleric was called [...] "a big bird, recently raised out of a <b>she-goat's</b> roadside excrement", and said to deserve a gob of spit ten times the normal size. All sorts of repulsive material was said to come out of him: from the hair, [...] "specks of mud, dandruff, bits of ground cereal"; mucus from the eyes, nasal material from the beard. Accused of being a sexual pervert and corruptor of minors, he was called [...] "the libidinous bishop", with a [...] "pornographic mouth". His corpulence and sexual appetite was said to give him female attributes, namely [...] "massive tits and an open sex", while his nose was likened to a [...] "soft testicle".|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} to engage him in any conversation on his own personal affairs; nor was he communicative or accessible in talking on any other subject whatever, although {{he seemed to have}} considerably relented in the extreme ferocity of his misanthropy, or rather to be less frequently visited with the fits of derangement of which this was a symptom. No argument could prevail upon him to accept anything beyond the simplest necessaries, although much more was offered by Earnscliff out of charity, and by his more superstitious neighbours from other motives. The benefits of these last he repaid by advice, when consulted (as at length he slowly was) on their diseases, or those of their cattle. He often furnished them with medicines also, and seemed possessed, not only of such as were the produce of the country, but of foreign drugs. He gave these persons to understand, that his name was Elshender the Recluse; but his popular epithet soon came to be Canny Elshie, or the Wise Wight of Mucklestane-Moor. Some extended their queries beyond their bodily complaints, and requested advice upon other matters, which he delivered with an oracular shrewdness that greatly confirmed the opinion of his possessing preternatural skill. The querists usually left some offering upon a stone, at a distance from his dwelling; if it was money, or any article which did not suit him to accept, he either threw it away, or suffered it to remain where it was without making use of it. On all occasions his manners were rude and unsocial; and his words, in number, just sufficient to express his meaning as briefly as possible, and he shunned all communication that went a syllable beyond the matter in hand. When winter had passed away, and his garden began to afford him herbs and vegetables, he confined himself almost entirely to those articles of food. He accepted, notwithstanding, a pair of <b>she-goats</b> from Earnscliff, which fed on the moor, and supplied him with milk.|$|R
