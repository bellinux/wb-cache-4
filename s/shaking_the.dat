A 1959 event in Huntsville, although smaller, damaged chimneys, wrecked plaster, and threw objects from shelves and tables. More recently, events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne, registering magnitudes of 4.9 and spawning <b>shaking.</b> <b>The</b> Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks.|$|E

5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the shaking.

On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start <b>shaking.</b> <b>The</b> epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of Dementors {{emerge from}} the {{darkness}} while one descends and attempts to suck out the riders' souls. This effect is achieved by projecting the riders' faces onto a cloud of fog {{in front of the}} Dementor, blasting cold air towards the riders, and using a heartbeat-like sound played through the sub-woofers built into the benches. After <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> riders out of the trance, Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus Charm. After the final Dementor, and while Harry uses his Patronus, the riders enter the final video dome segment, where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in. They fly over the Black Lake, back into Hogwarts and through the Main Hall and Grand Staircase, where they are cheered on by a series of onscreen characters from the movies who appear three-dimensional. Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement, where they exit their bench.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E

5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E

As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin's camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{dreadnought}} race {{stepped up}} in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships {{each year and}} the United Kingdom five. Tension {{came to a head}} following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice of building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when social welfare provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean and <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> stability of the British Empire. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, was to break with the policies of the past and make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} for Sigma is {{very similar}} to the original version, albeit with some modifications made to the game. Like the original version, the player's movements and combat system are directed using the console gamepad, which comprises the left thumbstick, two attack buttons, and a block button. The game features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. A new addition to Ryu's arsenal is a pair of dual-wield swords, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang. It also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo, which allows him to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. By <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> Sixaxis controller, players are able to increase the power of their ninpo spells. Rachel, a non-playable character in the 2004 game, became playable in three new chapters, featuring the new bosses, Gamov and Alterator. Some of the design elements of the old levels was also changed and several new enemy types were introduced.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{she began}} a storyline where she acted {{friendly}} and nice, seemingly diminishing her heel characteristics, later <b>shaking</b> <b>the</b> hand of rival Kaitlyn following a match and teaming {{with her and}} Layla on the September 10 episode of Raw. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view, Kaitlyn was attacked and injured by a masked figure backstage, and as a result, she was replaced by Eve in a match against Divas Champion Layla, which Eve won. In doing so, {{she became the first}} ever three-time Divas Champion. After Kaitlyn revealed that her attacker was a blonde, Eve accused Phoenix, attacking her on the September 24 episode of Raw. The following week, pending an investigation into Kaitlyn's attack, Eve suspended Phoenix, which was reversed by Booker T. It was later revealed that Kaitlyn was attacked by Aksana on Eve's orders. At the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Eve retained the Divas Championship against Layla and Kaitlyn in a triple threat match. Eve then continued her feud with the duo, facing them in tag team matches with various partners, and defeating Kaitlyn at Survivor Series to retain the championship. At , she defeated Naomi to retain the title. After winning a non-title match against Eve, Kaitlyn went on to defeat Eve by disqualification on December 18, with Eve retaining the championship. A rematch occurred on the January 7, 2013, episode of Raw, in which Eve successfully defended the championship after losing the match via count-out. The following week, Eve dropped the Divas Championship to Kaitlyn. Following the loss, Eve immediately quit WWE in storyline. In reality, Torres had asked for her release from the company in December 2012 to focus on her role as an instructor for the Gracie Women Empowered self-defense program.|$|E
