5|$|Lacking the {{resources}} to rebuild <b>Sarawak</b> after the war, Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede <b>Sarawak</b> as British Crown Colony and a Cession Bill was put forth in the Council Negri (now <b>Sarawak</b> State Legislative Assembly), which was debated for three days. The bill was passed on 17 May 1946 with a narrow majority (19 versus 16 votes). This caused hundreds of Malay civil servants to resign in protest, sparking an anti-cession movement and {{the assassination of the}} second colonial governor of <b>Sarawak</b> Sir Duncan Stewart. Despite the resistance, <b>Sarawak</b> became a British Crown colony on 1 July 1946. Anthony Brooke opposed the cession of <b>Sarawak</b> to the British Crown, for which he was banished from <b>Sarawak</b> by the colonial government. He was only allowed to return 17 years later after <b>Sarawak</b> had become part of Malaysia. In 1950 all anti-cession movements in <b>Sarawak</b> ceased after a clamp-down by the colonial government.|$|E
5|$|Major {{political}} parties in <b>Sarawak</b> {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members from more than one group. The first political party, the <b>Sarawak</b> United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara <b>Sarawak</b> (PANAS) in 1960 and the <b>Sarawak</b> National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as Parti Pesaka <b>Sarawak</b> (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined the national coalition of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled <b>Sarawak</b> since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in <b>Sarawak</b> has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of <b>Sarawak</b> from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 <b>Sarawak</b> constitutional crisis.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of <b>Sarawak</b> ended in 1945, the last Rajah of <b>Sarawak,</b> Charles Vyner Brooke, decided to cede {{the state as}} part of the British crown colony. This proposal had met with fierce opposition from the Sarawakians which later developed into the anti-cession movement of <b>Sarawak.</b> Rosli Dhobi was a <b>Sarawak</b> nationalist from Sibu {{and a member of the}} Malay Youth Movement (Gerakan Pemuda Melayu) where the main objective of the movement was to achieve <b>Sarawak</b> independence from the British rule. At the age of 17, he assassinated Sir Duncan George Stewart, the second governor of colonial <b>Sarawak</b> on 3 December 1949. He and three of his friends (Awang Ramli Amit, Bujang Suntong, and Morshidi Sidek) were then sentenced to death by hanging and were buried at the Kuching Central Prison on 2 March 1950.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Kuomintang at {{mainland}} China in 1949, Sibu communist members started to establish themselves in <b>Sarawak</b> in the early 1950s. Huang Sheng Zi (黄声梓) from Bintangor became the president of Borneo Communist Party (BCP). BCP activities mostly concentrated in Sibu, Sarikei, and Bintangor. His brother, Huang Zeng Ting (黄增霆), {{who was also a}} communist, {{played an important role in}} the formation of first political party in <b>Sarawak,</b> <b>Sarawak</b> United Peoples' Party (SUPP) and became the party's first executive secretary. <b>Sarawak</b> Liberation League (SLL) was formed in 1954 following the consolidation of BCP with several other communist organisations.|$|E

5|$|Although Islam is the {{official}} religion of the federation, <b>Sarawak</b> has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of <b>Sarawak</b> was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} Islam in <b>Sarawak</b> and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in <b>Sarawak</b> and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in <b>Sarawak</b> with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} form of Malay, Bahasa Malaysia, is spoken {{by the government}} administration, it is used infrequently in colloquial conversation. The local dialect of Bahasa <b>Sarawak</b> (<b>Sarawak</b> Malay) dominates the vernacular. Bahasa <b>Sarawak</b> {{is the most common}} language of <b>Sarawak</b> Malays and other indigenous tribes. The Iban language, which has minor regional variations, is the most widely spoken native language, with 34 percent of the <b>Sarawak</b> population speaking it as a first language. The Bidayuh language, with six major dialects, is spoken by 10 percent of the population. The Orang Ulu have about 30 different language dialects. While the ethnic Chinese originate from a variety of backgrounds and speak many different dialects such as Hokkien, Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochew, they also converse in Malaysian Mandarin.|$|E

5|$|English was the {{official}} language of <b>Sarawak</b> from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of <b>Sarawak</b> Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the Malay language in <b>Sarawak.</b> In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of <b>Sarawak.</b> This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, <b>Sarawak</b> opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of <b>Sarawak.</b> English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E
