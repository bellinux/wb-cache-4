40|$|Abstract — When {{designing}} the control loops for tokamaks, {{it is important}} to acknowledge the effects of time delays. An assumption sometimes made for tokamaks having supercon-ducting coils is that these extra time delays will not have any undesirable effects on control. In fact, introducing extra delays into the axisymmetric control loops of certain <b>superconducting</b> <b>tokamaks</b> can have significant detrimental consequences. Aside from qualitative observations, the detrimental effects of extra time delays in tokamak control loops are not always well understood outside the control community. This study exposes and quantifies the detrimental effects imposed by time delays in the control loop in <b>superconducting</b> <b>tokamaks,</b> by focusing on plasma current control and radial position control in a vertically stable circular plasma in the KSTAR tokamak. Delays in the power supplies, data acquisition, and vessel structure are taken into account. Extremum-seeking-based optimal tuning of PID controllers is proposed as a possible method for remediating the negative effects of time delays. The Nyquist dual locus technique is employed to assess stability of the optimally tuned closed-loop system in the presence of time delays. I...|$|R

40|$|Ion Cyclotron Wall Conditioning (ICWC) discharges, in pulsed-mode operation, {{were carried}} out in the {{divertor}} tokamaks ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) and JET to simulate the scenario of ITER wall conditioning at half-field (AUG) and full-field (JET). ICWC-plasma and antenna coupling characterization results obtained during the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) -Wall Conditioning experiments performed in helium-hydrogen mixture in AUG and helium-deuterium mixtures in JET are presented here. Safe operational regimes for optimum ICWC in ITER could be explored for different magnetic fields. Satisfactory antenna coupling in the Mode Conversion scenario along with reproducible generation of ICRF plasmas and reliable wall conditioning were achieved by coupling RF power from one or two ICRF antennas at two (AUG, JET) different resonant frequencies. These results are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of 1 -D TOMCAT code. Present study of ICWC indicates towards the beneficial effect of application of an additional (along with toroidal magnetic field) stationary vertical (BV ≪ BT) magnetic field on antenna coupling and plasma parameters.

Hybrid and AT discharges with identical control targets were repeated after the initial boronization {{at the beginning of}} the 2006 campaign, and again just before and after a second boronization near the end of the 2006 campaign. After a long entry vent between the 2006 and 2007 campaigns, similar discharges were again repeated after the standard high temperature baking and plasma cleanup, but prior to a boronization. Performance metrics, such as {beta}, confinement quality, and density control, were extremely well repeated. A low performance daily reference shot (DRS) was also established as a routine monitor of impurity influx. Over the 2006 campaign, the DRS database indicated little to no secular increase in impurity content. Oxygen content and Ni line emission were higher after the intervening vent, but were still minor contributors to plasma contamination. This indicates that erosion of boron films used for wall conditioning will not be a limitation to establishing long pulse high performance discharges in the new generation of <b>superconducting</b> <b>tokamaks</b> if graphite is used as the primary plasma facing material.

40|$|In <b>superconducting</b> <b>tokamaks,</b> the {{cryoplant}} {{provides the}} helium needed to cool different clients, among which {{by far the}} most important one is the superconducting magnet system. The evaluation of the transient heat load from the magnets to the cryoplant is fundamental for the design of the latter and the assessment of suitable strategies to smooth the heat load pulses, induced by the intrinsically pulsed plasma scenarios characteristic of today's tokamaks, is crucial for both suitable sizing and stable operation of the cryoplant. For that evaluation, accurate but expensive system-level models, as implemented in e. g. the validated state-of-the-art 4 C code, were developed in the past, including both the magnets and the respective external cryogenic cooling circuits. Here we show how these models can be successfully substituted with cheaper ones, where the magnets are described by suitably trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the evaluation of the heat load to the cryoplant. First, two simplified thermal-hydraulic models for an ITER Toroidal Field (TF) magnet and for the ITER Central Solenoid (CS) are developed, based on ANNs, and a detailed analysis of the chosen networks' topology and parameters is presented and discussed. The ANNs are then inserted into the 4 C model of the ITER TF and CS cooling circuits, which also includes active controls to achieve a smoothing of the variation of the heat load to the cryoplant. The training of the ANNs is achieved using the results of full 4 C simulations (including detailed models of the magnets) for conventional sigmoid-like waveforms of the drivers and the predictive capabilities of the ANN-based models in the case of actual ITER operating scenarios are demonstrated by comparison with the results of full 4 C runs, both with and without active smoothing, in terms of both accuracy and computational time. Exploiting the low computational effort requested by the ANN-based models, a demonstrative optimization study has been finally carried out, with the aim of choosing among different smoothing strategies for the standard ITER plasma operatio...|$|R

Europe (EU) is expected to provide to Japan (JA) the totality of the toroidal field (TF) magnet system, while JA will provide both Equilibrium field (EF) and Central Solenoid (CS) systems. All magnet designs were optimized trough the past years and entered in parallel into ex-tensive experimentally-based phases of concept validation, which came to maturation in the years 2009 and 2010. For this, all magnet systems were investigated by mean of dedicated samples, e. g. con-ductor and joint samples designed, manufactured and tested at full scale in ad hoc facilities either in EU or in JA. The present paper, after an overall description of magnet systems layouts, presents in a general approach the different experimental campaigns dedicated to qualification design and manufacture processes of either coils, conductors and electrical joints.

40|$|World energy {{demands are}} {{increasing}} while {{the ability to}} generate that energy currently requires relying on non-renewable, and increasingly unsustainable, sources. If this trend {{is going to be}} curbed, either the energy demands will have to be limited, or new methods of sustainable energy need to be found. The former option {{is beyond the scope of}} this research so focus here is on new energy sources. Nuclear fusion is a possible option due to the output energy possible and the ease of access to fuel. Radioactive byproducts are also very limited. The tokamak uses magnetic fields to achieve fusion conditions and is one of the leading contenders for a working fusion reactor. The topic of this research is the construction of a probe used on the tokamak to measure ion temperature in the edge region of the plasma. A model was also constructed to aid in the interpretation of experimental data. The probe itself was constructed, along with the electrical circuits required for its operation, in Hefei, China, and was mounted on a reciprocating drive on the HL- 2 A tokamak in Chengdu, China. Reciprocation allowed for the construction of an ion temperature profile. A profile was constructed showing the evolution of temperature throughout a single shot. However, due to some noise constraints on the data, another profile was constructed averaging several shots together. This increased the quality of the temperature data at the expense of seeing how temperature changes over single shots.

This fact indicates that the vessel wall had been covered with Mo deposition in the long history. The amount of deposited Mo was estimated quantitatively and the distribution in the radial direction was discussed. The surface modification will change the initial hydrogen recycling property. It is especially important for long pulse discharges because the plasma density control is greatly influenced by recycled hydrogen. In addition, damage (melting) due to fast electrons was observed.

40|$|Tokamak {{nuclear fusion}} {{reactors}} {{based on the}} magnetic confinement of the plasma, such as the ITER, under construction in France, are characterized by very large temperature differences (from the 108 K of the plasma core to the few K of the superconducting magnets) over a few meters. Heat transfer is therefore a critical issue, especially at the interface between different reactor subsystems, for instance the magnet - cryoplant interface, at which pulsed heat loads coming from the <b>superconducting</b> coils during <b>tokamak</b> operation are released to the cryoplant. The smoothing of these variable heat loads is a critical issue {{in order to avoid}} the oversizing of the refrigerators as well as to ensure a stable operation with power loads as constant as possible. Experimental devices, like the HELIOS loop at CEA Grenoble (France), as well as detailed computational tools, such as the 4 C code, have been used to study possible control strategies to smooth the pulsed heat loads to the cryoplant. These tools can provide a detailed overview of the magnets dynamics, up to the conductors cooling channels, requiring a large computational effort to solve sets of partial non-linear differential equations. However, from the cryoplant side, simplified models of the magnetic system response to the different operating scenarios, predicting the evolution of the heat load, are sufficient to carefully design the control scenarios and strategies. Simplified models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been developed and tested on cryogenic loops, and have proved to be fast and accurate in predicting the power released from the magnets to the cryoplant during nominal operation, i. e. without any regulation acting on the system. The present work proposes a new approach for a simplified modeling of the heat transfer to the cryoplant, based again on ANNs, easy to handle and able to cope with control and regulation of the plant. The feasibility of the new approach is demonstrated and validated on different HELIOS test cases, adopting the state-of-the-art 4 C code as source of data for the ANN training. Next, an optimized ANN-based model is developed for the ITER CS and TF magnets and its predictive capability demonstrated against 4 C data. Thanks to their high speed of computation, the ANN-based models are used to address different control strategies for the smoothing of the pulse heat loads released to the cryoplant and perform fast parametric studies for the optimization of the control and regulation acting on the system. Once the best control strategy has been identified, a detailed 4 C simulation is used as a benchmark to prove the accuracy of the ANN-based model...|$|R
