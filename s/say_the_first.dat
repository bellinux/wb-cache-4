25|$|It is {{customary}} that, {{once the}} Kohanim are assembled on the platform, the cantor or prayer leader will prompt them by reciting each {{word of the}} blessing and the Kohanim will then repeat that word. This custom is especially followed if only one Kohen is available to give the blessing. Apparently this prompting is done to avoid errors or embarrassment {{if any of the}} Kohanim should be ignorant of the words of the recitation. However, if {{there are a number of}} kohanim, they may <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> word of the blessing ("Yevorekhekhaw") without the prompting, presumably to demonstrate their familiarity with the ritual.|$|E
25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} when the ALF first emerged in the United States. The FBI writes that animal rights activists {{had a history of}} committing low-level criminal activity in the U.S. dating back to the 1970s. Freeman Wicklund and Kim Stallwood <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ALF action there was on May 29, 1977, when researchers Ken LeVasseur and Steve Sipman released two dolphins, Puka and Kea, into the ocean from the University of Hawaii's Marine Mammal Laboratory. The North American Animal Liberation Press Office attributes the dolphin release to a group called Undersea Railroad, and says the first ALF action was, in fact, a raid on the New York University Medical Center on March 14, 1979, when activists removed one cat, two dogs, and two guinea pigs.|$|E

25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Morgan played [...] "FRAN", the [...] "Friendly Replicator Android". Morgan was {{originally}} set to play Linara, Davos' daughter {{from a previous}} episode, [...] "The Seer". However, the role was given to Kimberley Warnat when Morgan had {{to participate in a}} reshoot of her role in Diary of the Dead. Morgan was disappointed that she did not get the role of Linara, but stated after her casting as FRAN that it was fun to play a character that is highly dangerous and yet completely innocent. Jill Wagner returned as Larrin for this episode, after her debut appearance in [...] "Travelers". Torri Higginson returned as Elizabeth Weir in her fourth appearance in the season, {{at the very end of}} the episode. The script intended her to have two lines of dialog in the episode, but producers knew that the audience would recognize Higginson's voice and hence used a stand-in to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> line instead.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't understand when people <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half lacked pace. A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Double Indemnity is an {{important}} (and some <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>first)</b> example of a genre of films called film noir. [...] According to Robert Sklar, a former chairperson of the Department of Cinema Studies at New York University, classic film noir is marked by major thematic elements: a plot about how a crime told {{from the point of}} view of the criminal, psychosexual themes are explored, and a visually [...] "dark and claustrophobic framing, with key lighting from sources within the mise-en-scène casting strong shadows that both conceal and project characters’ feelings". Double Indemnity includes all of these traits.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas found Stern's next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I {{was going to say}} whatever the fuck I was going to <b>say</b> ... <b>The</b> <b>first</b> step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would come in and do the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept chipping away at management's archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E
2500|$|The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT Docomo's {{manufacturers}} {{have succeeded in}} creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided {{the positions of the}} necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To [...] "copy" [...] a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.|$|E
