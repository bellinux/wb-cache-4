The frame is then covered with muslin over chicken wire with {{a thin layer of}} cotton batting used to span large open areas and over this a top layer of fabric, usually a pigmented synthetic leather, is placed. Any exposed joints in the fabric are covered with aluminium mouldings. The seats are fixed directly to the chassis.|$|E
50|$|In {{missions}} of this nature, FITS integrates {{large volumes of}} information and also evaluates potential threats at the same time. An intuitive man-machine interface forms {{the core of the}} modular FITS. This interface significantly enhances mission efficiency. Apart from numerous operational sensors, this <b>system</b> <b>comprises</b> <b>an</b> aircraft navigation and communication system. Each system is controlled by an operator using one of four multifunction consoles. The consoles are linked together via a high-speed LAN (Local Area Network) with central processors which facilitate fast processing of all incoming signals. Despite the high level of complexity, the acquisition costs for FITS are low, particularly {{in view of the fact}} that commercial hardware, standard interfaces and modular software are used. Something that initially sounds mass-produced is actually the trump card for this system. This is because using standardized components is the only way of integrating such a large number of sensors within a system of this nature. These standards also provide the potential for expansion and this is what ultimately ensures the projected service life of a marine reconnaissance aircraft over several decades. Depending on technical progress, this design allows numerous other sensors to be integrated within the FITS system in the future.|$|E
