The Hunters were used by Nos. 1, 3 and 9 Wings but did not serve for long; the aircraft with 1 Wing were replaced in 1958 by the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck, and most were scrapped afterwards.|$|E

25|$|European railway {{air brakes}} include the Kunze-Knorr brake (invented by Georg Knorr and {{manufactured}} by Knorr-Bremse) and the Oerlikon. The working principle {{is the same}} as for the Westinghouse air brake. In the steam era, Britain's railways were divided– <b>some</b> <b>using</b> vacuum brakes and <b>some</b> <b>using</b> air brakes– but there was a gradual standardization on the vacuum brake. Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that they could work with either vacuum- or air-braked trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to air-braked rolling stock in the 1960s.|$|E

The scheme was expanded to include cathedrals in Belgium as well. In some cases, the cathedrals had been badly damaged, and the placement of tablets was delayed until reconstruction had been completed. Other considerations included the placement of the tablet in the available space within the cathedrals, with <b>some</b> <b>using</b> a horizontal design instead of a vertical one. The prototype tablet, produced for Amiens Cathedral, featured the Royal Coat of Arms and an inscription that referred to the armies of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In the United States military, each branch {{has its own}} flag, an {{organizational}} colour, sometimes also called a ceremonial flag. Each of these is 4ft 4in × 5ft 6in, <b>some</b> <b>using</b> 2.5-inch gold fringe during specific instances. The ceremonial flag is paraded with a National Colour of equal dimensions in a colour guard, with gold fringe as necessary. The National Color is never dipped in salute, but remains vertical at all times, while the organizational colours and any guidons are dipped as necessary. When the National Colour is not cased, all persons salute the Colors. The finial is a nickel or chrome-plated spearhead, though the Navy uses different finials on occasion.|$|E

At the launch of the operation, on October 29, Israeli P-51D Mustangs, <b>some</b> <b>using</b> their propellor blades, severed telephone lines in the Sinai, while 16 IAF DC-3s – escorted by fighters – dropped Israeli paratroopers behind Egyptian lines at the Mitla Pass and Et-Tur. The Israeli Air Force also conducted attacks on Egyptian ground units and assisted the Israeli Navy in capturing the Egyptian Navy destroyer Ibrahim el Awal, which had bombarded the Israeli city of Haifa – an airstrike damaged the Egyptian ship's engines, enabling Israeli ships to reach it and capture it.|$|E

25|$|Various {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} driver mounting arrangements {{to create a}} specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (<b>some</b> <b>using</b> this approach are called monitors, as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later Bose models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in high fidelity circles, but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.|$|E

Its lyrics, had different interpretations with <b>some</b> <b>using</b> its denotative meaning, saying that Mars tries to escape [...] "to ecstasy in a bottle of his favorite vice", while others took a connotative approach by writing that [...] "Moonshine" [...] is about [...] "longing for the high water mark of a relationship", which becomes [...] "impossible to reach".

The team used [...] "more than 100 video cards" [...] throughout development. Deus Ex was built using Visual Studio, Lightwave, and Lotus Notes. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit. The team used UnrealEd atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was [...] "superior {{to anything else}} available". Their trust in UnrealScript led them to code [...] "special-cases" [...] for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code. Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this was a lesson to always prefer [...] "general solutions" [...] over [...] "special casing", such that the tool set works predictably.|$|E

500|$|As {{members of}} the crowd began {{to break into the}} vehicle, <b>some</b> <b>using</b> {{makeshift}} weapons, one of the corporals drew and fired a pistol, which momentarily subdued the crowd, before both men were dragged from the car, beaten and disarmed. Shortly afterwards, the corporals were dragged across the road to Casement Park, where they were beaten further. A local priest intervened to stop the beating, but was pulled away when a military identity card was discovered, raising speculation that the corporals were {{members of the}} SAS. The two were bundled semi-conscious over a wall by IRA operatives, who jumped over the wall and forced the corporals {{into the back of a}} black taxi and sped away. The taxi took the corporals and the IRA men to an area of waste ground in West Belfast, the IRA men continuing to beat the soldiers en route. Six men were seen leaving the vehicle. The two corporals, apparently dazed from their injuries, staggered from the taxi, but were quickly restrained. Another IRA man arrived with a pistol taken from one of the soldiers, with which he repeatedly shot each of the corporals before handing the weapon to another man, who shot the corporals' bodies multiple times. Margaret Thatcher described the corporals' killings as the [...] "single most horrifying event in Northern Ireland" [...] during her premiership.|$|E
