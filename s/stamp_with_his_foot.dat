6000|$|... "O Arthur!" [...] the Curate {{began to}} cry with clasped hands, and a scared face, but Arthur gave another <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and began to pull at the bell. [...] "Don't let's have any more of this. We'll have some coffee, if you please," [...] {{he said with a}} majestic air; and the old butler {{entering}} at the summons, Arthur bade him to serve that refreshment.|$|E
60|$|One man, for instance, named Lilburne, {{was brought}} before the Star Chamber, charged with {{publishing}} seditious pamphlets. Now, in all ordinary courts of justice, no man is called upon to say any thing against himself. Unless his crime can be proved by the testimony of others, {{it can not be}} proved at all. But in the Star Chamber, whoever was brought to trial had to take an oath at first that he would answer all questions asked, even if they tended to criminate himself. When they proposed this oath to Lilburne, he refused to take it. They decided that this was contempt of court, and sentenced him to be whipped, put in the pillory, and imprisoned. While they were whipping him, he spent the time in making a speech to the spectators against the tyranny of bishops, referring to Laud, whom he considered as the author of these proceedings. He continued to do the same while in the pillory. As he passed along, too, he distributed copies of the pamphlets which he was prosecuted for writing. The Star Chamber, hearing that he was haranguing the mob, ordered him to be gagged. This did not subdue him. He began to <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and gesticulate; thus continuing to express his indomitable spirit of hostility to the tyranny which he opposed. This single case would be of no great consequence alone, but it was not alone. The attempt to put Lilburne down was a symbol of the experiment of coercion which Charles in the state, and Laud in the Church, were trying upon the whole nation; it was a symbol both in respect to the means employed, and to the success attained by them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Death {{to all who}} resist--life {{to those}} who surrender!" [...] exclaimed Cromwell, <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> [...] "Who {{commands}} this garrison?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{king had}} <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> upon the carpet {{more than once}} during this frank address, but his anger blazed into a fury at its conclusion.|$|R
60|$|He went North, Best Beloved, and {{he found}} All-the-Elephant-there-was digging <b>with</b> <b>his</b> tusks and <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in the nice new clean earth {{that had been made}} ready for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get home!" [...] said Jonas, in a {{stern and}} severe tone; [...] "get home!" [...] and he <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> upon the ground, {{and looked at}} Franco with a countenance of displeasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! {{heard you}} that, Pearson?" [...] said Cromwell to the officer; then, <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> he added, [...] "Undo the spring, or I will else use levers and wrenching-irons--Or, ha! another petard were well bestowed-- Call the engineer." ...|$|R
6000|$|Out in the Wild Woods all {{the wild}} animals {{wondered}} {{what had happened}} to Wild Dog, and at last Wild Horse <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and said, 'I will go and see and say why Wild Dog has not returned. Cat, come with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{character}} of the sentry's walk had changed. He had been relieved some four hours before, and his walk at times ceased, {{as if he were}} leaning against the wall to rest himself, while at times he gave an impatient <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "HERE, sir!" [...] {{said the}} old General, <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> in a passion, and the A.D.C. shrugged his {{shoulders}} and galloped away. In five minutes we heard the trumpets in our camp, and in twenty more {{the greater part of}} the cavalry had joined us.|$|R
6000|$|Then the boy wept aloud; 't {{was a fair}} sight yet sad [...] To see {{the tears}} run down the sweet blooms he had: [...] He <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> said--"The saints know I lied [...] Because truth that is wicked is fittest to hide: [...] Must I utter it, mother?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then Mr. Mnason <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> and <b>his</b> {{daughter}} Grace came up; {{so he said}} unto her, Grace, go you, tell my friends, Mr. Contrite, Mr. Holy-man, Mr. Love-saint, Mr. Dare-not-lie, and Mr. Penitent; that I have {{a friend}} or two at my house that have a mind this evening to see them.|$|R
6000|$|God says also, {{that he had}} smitten {{his hands}} together, at {{the sins of the}} {{children}} of Israel. (Eze 22:13) God also bids the prophet <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and smite <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand upon his thigh, upon sundry occasions, and at several enormities, but the Publican here is said to smite upon his breast. (Chron 6:11, 21:12) And, ...|$|R
60|$|As the claret circulated, the glee of {{the company}} increased; and Smith placing the dishes which had been made use of upon the side-table, <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> on the floor, and the table sinking down a trap, again rose, loaded with olives, sliced neat's tongue, caviare, and other provocatives for the {{circulation}} of the bottle.|$|R
6000|$|God says also, {{that he had}} smitten {{his hands}} {{together}} at {{the sins of the}} children of Israel. God also bids the prophet <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and smite <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand upon his thigh (Num. xxiv. 10; Ezek. xxii. 13; vi. 11; xxi. 12), upon sundry occasions, and at several enormities; but the Publican here is said to smite upon his breast. And, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And who was doubtless {{aiding and}} abetting in the horrible sacrilege," [...] said the Duke, {{starting}} up and <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> such fury that he dashed in pieces the footstool which was placed before him. [...] "Bar the doors of this hall, gentlemen--secure the windows--let no stranger stir from his seat, upon pain of instant death!--Gentlemen of my chamber, draw your swords." ...|$|R
6000|$|As the Doctor {{received}} the card, and stopped <b>his</b> harangue <b>with</b> rather a seared look, {{the laughter of}} the boys, half constrained until then, burst out in a general shout. [...] "Silence!" [...] roared out the Doctor <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> Pen {{looked up and saw}} who was his deliverer; the Major beckoned to him gravely <b>with</b> one of <b>his</b> white gloves, and tumbling down his books, Pen went across.|$|R
5000|$|The {{event was}} first {{reported}} in English print in 1757 by Giuseppe Baretti {{in his book}} The Italian Library: [...] The moment he was set at liberty, he looked {{up to the sky}} and down to the ground, and, <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> in a contemplative mood, said, Eppur si muove, that is, still it moves, meaning the Earth. The book was written 124 years after the supposed utterance and became widely published in Querelles Litt√©raires in 1761.|$|R
6000|$|MNAS. Then Mr. Mnason <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> and <b>his</b> {{daughter}} Grace came up. So he said unto her, [...] "Grace, go you, tell my friends, Mr. Contrite, Mr. Holy-man, Mr. Love-saint, Mr. Dare-not-lie, and Mr. Penitent, that I have {{a friend}} or two at my house who have a mind this evening to see them." [...] So Grace went to call them, and they came; and, after salutation made, they sat down together at the table.|$|R
60|$|Dick lazily hauled {{himself off}} the couch and stood up, shaking his head mutinously, as if tossing a mane, and <b>stamping</b> ponderously <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in {{simulation}} of Mountain Lad.|$|R
60|$|And now {{the sound}} of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned to the dance. The {{musician}} was an old gray-headed negro who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood {{for more than half a}} century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head, bowing almost to the ground and <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> whenever a fresh couple were to start.|$|R
60|$|It was long, however, before Captain Baumgarten had {{satisfied}} himself {{upon the}} point. It {{was a difficult}} house to search. Thin stairs, which only one man could ascend at a time, connected lines of tortuous corridors. The walls were so thick that each room was cut off from its neighbour. Huge fireplaces yawned in each, while the windows were 6ft. deep in the wall. Captain Baumgarten <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> tore down curtains, and struck with the pommel of his sword. If there were secret hiding-places, he was not fortunate enough to find them.|$|R
6000|$|Then Wild Horse <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wild <b>foot</b> and said, 'O my Friends and O my Enemies, {{why have}} the Man and the Woman made that great light in that great Cave, and what harm will it do us?' ...|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} Jew saw {{the jewels}} he falls a-jabbering, in Dutch or Portuguese, to the merchant; and I could {{presently}} perceive {{that they were in}} some great surprise, both of them. The Jew held up his hands, looked at me with some horror, then talked Dutch again, and put himself into a thousand shapes, twisting his body and wringing up his face this way and that way in <b>his</b> discourse, <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and throwing abroad his hands, as if he was not in a rage only, but in a mere fury. Then he would turn and give a look at me like the devil. I thought I never saw anything so frightful in my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Master Shelton," [...] replied Lawless, [...] "I {{have been}} a Grey Friar--I praise fortune--an archer, a thief, and a shipman. Of all these coats, I had the best fancy {{to die in the}} Grey Friars, as ye may readily conceive, and the least fancy to die in John Shipman's tarry jacket; and that for two {{excellent}} good reasons: first, that the death might take a man suddenly; and second, for the horror of that great salt smother and welter under my <b>foot</b> here"--and Lawless <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> [...] "Howbeit," [...] he went on, [...] "an I die not a sailor's death, and that this night, I shall owe a tall candle to our Lady." ...|$|R
60|$|At the isle of Tenedos the Greeks had {{to leave}} behind Philoctetes, the friend of Hercules, who had his quiver of {{poisoned}} arrows, because the poor man had a wound in his heel, which {{was in such a}} dreadful state that no one could bear to come near him. One story was that he was bitten by a water-snake, another that when he was just setting off he had been over-persuaded to show where he had buried the ashes of Hercules. He did not say one word, but <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> on the place, and an arrow fell out at the moment and pierced his heel. At any rate, he and the arrows were left behind, while the Greeks reached the coast of Troy.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{any man who}} touches them--dies--dies on the spot!" [...] shrieks Harry, {{starting}} from his seat, and reeling towards his sword; which he draws, and then <b>stamps</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> and says, [...] "Ha! ha!" [...] and then lunges at M. Barbeau, who skips away from the lunge behind the chaplain, who looks rather alarmed. I know {{we could have had}} a much more exciting picture than either of those we present of Harry this month, and the lad, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hair dishevelled, raging about the room flamberge au vent, and pinking the affrighted innkeeper and chaplain, would have afforded a good subject for the pencil. But oh, to think of him stumbling over a stool, and prostrated by an enemy who has stole away his brains! Come, Gumbo! and help your master to bed! ...|$|R
60|$|He pointed as {{he spoke}} {{to a man who}} {{approached}} them from the town, and whose appearance as well as his actions were well calculated to surprise them. He was a fine-looking man of gigantic size, with a poncho over his shoulders and a Spanish-looking sombrero on his head, but the most curious thing about him was his gait. At one moment he sauntered, holding his face between both hands, next moment he bent double and appeared to <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> Then he hurried forward a few paces but paused abruptly, bent down and stamped again. Presently he caught sight of the travellers. At once his antics ceased. He raised himself erect, and advancing quickly, lifted his sombrero and saluted them with the air of a prince.|$|R
6000|$|... "So," [...] said he, <b>stamping</b> violently <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> {{partly from}} anger, and partly {{with the view}} of shaking off the {{unexpected}} covering, which stuck all over his dress in little patches, producing a somewhat piebald effect,--"so you are pleased to jest, gentlemen. Pray, who placed that piece of snow over the door?" [...] Mr Rogan glared fiercely round upon the culprits, who stood speechless before him.|$|R
6000|$|He {{crossed the}} deck in one bound. By the immemorial {{custom and usage}} of the sea the captain's room is on the {{starboard}} side. You {{would just as soon}} expect your captain to have his nose {{at the back of his}} head as to have his state-room on the port side of the ship. Powell forgot all about the direction on that point given him by the chief. He flew over as I said, <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and then putting his face to the cowl of the big ventilator shouted down there: [...] "Please come on deck, sir," [...] in a voice which was not trembling or scared but which we may call fairly expressive. There could not be a mistake as to the urgence of the call. But instead of the expected alert [...] "All right!" [...] and the sound of a rush down there, he heard only a faint exclamation--then silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{took the}} Letter from me, cast his eye upon it; and seeing {{it to be}} Grumkow's hand, said to me with all the anger imaginable [fancy the thunder-burst!], 'Messieurs, j'ai eu assez de ces choses la;' threw the Letter upon the ground, and {{immediately}} turning his back {{went out of the}} room, and shut the door upon us,"--probably with a slam! And that is the naked truth concerning this celebrated Intercepted Letter. Majesty answered explosively,--his poor heart being in a burdened and grieved condition, not unlike growing a haunted one,--"I have had enough of that stuff before!" [...] pitched the new specimen away, and stormily whirled out with a slam of the door. That he <b>stamped</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> is guessable. That he [...] "lifted <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> as if to kick the Honorable English Excellency," [...] [Wilhelmina, i. 228.] which the English Excellency never could have stood, but must have died on the spot,--of this, though several Books have copied it from Wilhelmina, there is no vestige of evidence: and the case is bad enough without this.|$|R
6000|$|The {{way which}} {{was taken by}} the holy man, was to send to the {{governor}} the grand vicar John Suarez, attended by the most considerable persons of the town, to shew him the letters of King John III., which expressly made out his intentions, that Father Xavier should extend the faith, {{as far as he was}} able, through all the kingdoms of the East, and that the governors should favour him on all occasions. Suarez read also to the governor, the letter of the vice-king Don Alphonso de Norogna, in which he declared criminal of state, whosoever should hinder or oppose this particular voyage of the saint. That which ought to have reduced Don Alvarez to reason, or at least to have terrified him, served only to make him more unreasonable, and more audacious. He rose from <b>his</b> seat, <b>with</b> the action of a madman, and <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> sent back the grand vicar, with this dutiful expression: [...] "The king's interest, you say, requires this to be performed; and I will not suffer it to be performed: Here I am, and will be master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my word, Madam,' I had begun, and {{was going}} {{on to say that}} I didn't know one word about all these matters which seemed so to {{interest}} Mrs. Major Ponto, when the Major, giving me a tread or <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> large <b>foot</b> under the table, said--'Come, come, Snob my boy, we are all tiled, you know. We KNOW you're one of the fashionable people about town: we saw your name at Lady Clapperclaw's SOIREES, and the Champignon breakfasts; and as for the Rubadubs, of course, as relations ---' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{boat was}} in such an unsound state as to render her unfit for the passage. The unfortunate {{accident}} happened by a sheep putting its leg {{through one of the}} planks, which produced a leak, in order to stop which one of the passengers applied his great coat to the aperture and <b>stamped</b> it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> In doing so he started one of the planks altogether, which caused the boat's immediate sinking, having been overloaded; ten sheep, a quantity of lumber, and about 31 persons being on board.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the tidings of Caesar's having passed the Rubicon, {{and of the}} triumphant success which he was meeting with at the {{commencement}} of his march toward Rome, reached the Capitol, and added greatly to the prevailing consternation. The reports {{of the magnitude of}} his force and of the rapidity of his progress were greatly exaggerated. The party of Pompey and the Senate had done every thing to spread among the people the terror of Caesar's name, in order to arouse them to efforts for opposing his designs; and now, when he had broken through the barriers which had been intended to restrain him, and was advancing toward the city in an unchecked and triumphant career, they were overwhelmed with dismay. Pompey began to be terrified at the danger which was impending. The Senate held meetings without the city--councils of war, as it were, in which they looked to Pompey in vain for protection from the danger which he had brought upon them. He had said that he could raise an army sufficient to cope with Caesar at any time by <b>stamping</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> They told him they thought now that it was high time for him to stamp.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} here?" [...] he demanded, red-eyed. [...] "Isn't {{somebody}} {{going to tell}} me? Have I got to stop here all night? Who on earth is this?" [...] He glared at Miss Trimble. [...] "What's she doing with that pistol?" [...] He <b>stamped</b> incautiously <b>with</b> <b>his</b> bad <b>foot,</b> and emitted a dry howl of anguish.|$|R
