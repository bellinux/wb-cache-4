25|$|The pulsar's extreme {{energy output}} creates an unusually dynamic region at {{the centre of}} the Crab Nebula. While most astronomical objects evolve so slowly that changes are visible only over {{timescales}} of many years, the inner parts of the Crab Nebula show changes over timescales of only a few days. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar's equatorial wind <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the nebula, forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into {{the main body of the}} nebula.|$|E
25|$|When they arrive, {{they find}} a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol {{to get rid of the}} rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is {{evacuated}} to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all they did was realize the existing love they had for each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw and Ashpaw, Brindleface's kits, took part in leading the dogs; they did it as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar, her old self returned once more, <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the dog —and herself— over the side of the gorge.|$|E

The motion condemned the proposal, describing humans as [...] "obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal", and proposed that the House [...] "looks {{forward to the day}} when the inevitable asteroid <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Earth and wipes them out thus giving nature the opportunity to start again". It was signed by only two other MPs, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, both left-wingers, and future Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Rearmed 2 also {{features}} new gameplay mechanics. [...] Some {{of these were}} first introduced in the [...] 3D shooter Bionic Commando. [...] These include the ability to jump and maneuver known as Death From Above in which the player <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground upon landing from a fall, causing a shockwave to affect nearby enemies. [...] Once the game is completed players may opt to activate the game's Retro mode which disables the ability to jump. [...] Players can also climb over small obstacles, or onto slightly higher elevations. [...] Entirely new to the series are Components; items and attributes that can be equipped to enhance the player character. [...] Components include a grenade launcher attachment for the bionic arm and a passive heath regeneration ability. [...] The player can upgrade or change Spencer's abilities in the enhancements screen during gameplay. [...] Also new to the series will be the ability to enter a scanning mode known as Bio Vision. [...] While in this mode players can search for secrets and scan facts about enemies and locales which may help them progress through the game.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a pack of}} dogs {{begins to}} run wild in the forest, Fireheart, deputy of ThunderClan, {{suspects}} that Tigerstar, ShadowClan's new leader, is behind it. To find out, he asks Brightpaw, who gets mauled by the dogs, if she remembers what happened. Brightpaw can only remember the words [...] "Pack, pack, kill, kill". A trail of dead rabbits is then found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the Clan is evacuated from their camp to Sunningrocks. Fireheart and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will attempt to lead the dogs over the edge of a nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dog, who releases its grip on Fireheart. The dog and Bluestar are thrown {{over the side of the}} gorge.|$|E
