40|$|For meticulous {{calibration}} of ultrasonic probes, hydrophones {{are usually}} used {{but it is}} difficult to find hydrophones that can operate up to 30 MHz with a very large bandwidth. Our group has a long experience in fabrication of the new cMUT transducers; these devices can easily operate in the high frequency range due to the silicon micromachining technology used. In order to calibrate large bandwidth high frequency cMUT array probes, we designed and fabricated a single element transducer on the same wafer used for the cMUT array. Since the sensor is fabricated on the same wafer, it has the same characteristics of the probe and, hence, the measurements are possible in the same operative range (3 - 20 MHz). Our initial results for cMUT <b>single-element</b> <b>sensor</b> are promisin...|$|E
40|$|Pyroelectric single-element and multielement {{infrared}} sensors for {{application in}} pyrometry, gas analysis and thermography {{have been developed}} and tested using lithium tantalate LiTaO_ 3 as the pyroelectricum. LiTaO_ 3 wafers were prepared and their pyroelectric and dielectric properties were characterized for different chip layouts. Chip thickness of < 5 #mu#m was achieved by ion beam etching. INDAB (induced absorption) layers obtained by on-chip layering of LiTaO_ 3 wafers and chips were structurated by the lift-off technique. A high-sensitivity <b>single-element</b> <b>sensor,</b> 4 -channel and 2 -channel multispectral sensors and a 128 -element-line sensor were constructed and the sensor characteristics of these prototypes were measured {{as a function of}} ambient temperature and chopper frequency.

40|$|The {{performances}} of four different pyroelectric <b>single-element</b> <b>sensor</b> configurations {{have been evaluated}} The sensing element is either a composite of nanometer-size particles of lead titanate (PT) embedded in vinylidene-trifluoroethylene [P(VDF-TrFE) ] copolymer or P(VDF-TrFE). Configuration I consists of the sensing element spin-coated on a silicon substrate. Configuration II, comprising the same sensing element but with the substrate etched away, has voltage (RV) and current (RI) sensitivities which, at an incident radiation modulation frequency of 10 - 100 Hz, are more than one order of magnitude {{higher than those of}} configuration I. High RV and R 1 can also be achieved by depositing a 13 μm thick polyimide (PI) thermal buffer layer between the sensing element and the silicon substrate (configuration III). Configuration IV, fabricated by etching away the substrate of configuration III, has similar RV and R, values as configuration II if the thickness of the PI layer is below 2. 3 μm. Moreover, configuration IV is mechanically more robust than configuration II. For each configuration, the PT/P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite sensor has higher voltage and current sensitivities than the copolymer sensor. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to the measurement of mechanical stresses is presented. The new sensor design utilizes the fact that shear stresses in the silicon lattice generate an electric field perpendicular to an electric current. The sensor effect {{is characterized by a}} new piezo-bridge-coefficient, which relates the sensitivity of the sensor structure to its crystallographic orientation. The sensor is based on a CMOS-compatible structure. It offers the possibility to realize highly sensitive <b>single-element</b> stress <b>sensors</b> for use in MEMS or in smart force measurement strips, as well. An example of a signal conditioning circuit is shown. Special designs with improved sensitivity and low noise are presented. The response to parasitic magnetic fields is measured and strongly reduced. Furthermore, the temperature behavior was analyzed and finally optimized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging {{provides}} excellent {{image quality}} {{at a high}} cost and low frame rate. Ultrasound (US) provides poor image quality at a low cost and high frame rate. We propose an instance-based learning system to obtain {{the best of both}} worlds: high quality MR images at high frame rates from a low cost <b>single-element</b> US <b>sensor.</b> Concurrent US and MRI pairs are acquired during a relatively brief offline learning phase involving the US transducer and MR scanner. High frame rate, high quality MR imaging of respiratory organ motion is then predicted from US measurements, even after stopping MRI acqui-sition, using a probabilistic kernel regression framework. Experimental results show predicted MR images to be highly representative of actual MR images. ...|$|R

According to Section 2, the random symmetric Bernoulli distribution-based sensing matrix can be achieved using the optical multiplexing. The combination of PIR sensor and the Fresnel lens supports the physical implementation of optical multiplexing. To be specific, for the random matrix stated as in Equation 15, the compressive infrared sampling is achieved by the <b>single-element</b> PIR <b>sensor</b> and Fresnel lens encoded with random masks; for the random matrix satisfying Equation 16, the compressive infrared sampling is achieved by the random-rotated quad-element PIR sensors and Fresnel lenses encoded with random masks. In this article, we adopt the second physical method for designing the compressive infrared sensing.|$|R
40|$|Nanocrystalline {{calcium and}} {{lanthanum}} modified lead titanate (PCLT) powder was prepared by a solgel process followed by annealing at 850 °C. 0 - 3 nanocomposite thin films of PCLT powder dispersed in a vinylidene fluoride /trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) copolymer matrix were fabricated on glass substrates using the spin-coating technique. The permittivity, pyroelectric coefficient, specific heat and pyroelectric figures-of-merit were measured as {{functions of the}} volume fraction (φ) of ceramic for φ up to 0. 16. <b>Single-element</b> pyroelectric <b>sensors</b> with PCLT/P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposites as the sensing elements were fabricated and characterized. The voltage and current responsivities Rv and Ri of the sensors were measured as functions of frequency and found to agree well with the calculated values. Since the pyroelectric coefficients of PCLT and P(VDF-TrFE) have like signs while the piezoelectric coefficients have opposite signs, the poled composite has high pyroelectric but low piezoelectric activity, thereby reducing the vibration-induced electrical noise in pyroelectric sensor applications.
