40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{root system}} {{architecture}} for increased tree anchorage {{has not yet}} been determined and in particular, the role of the tap root remains elusive. In Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), tap roots may {{play an important role in}} anchoring young trees, but in adult trees, their growth is often impeded by the presence of a hard pan layer in the soil and the tap root becomes a minor component of tree anchorage. To understand better the role of the tap root in young trees, we grew cuttings (no tap root present) and seedlings where the tap root had (-) or had not (+) been pruned, in the field for 7 years. The force (F) necessary to deflect the stem sideways was then measured and divided by stem cross-sectional area (CSA), giving a parameter analogous to stress during bending. Root systems were extracted and root architecture and wood mechanical properties (density and longitudinal modulus of elasticity, E L) determined. In seedlings (-) tap roots, new roots had regenerated where the tap root had been pruned, whereas in cuttings, one or two lateral roots had grown downwards and acted as tap roots. Cuttings had significantly less lateral roots than the other treatments, but those near the soil surface were 14 % and 23 % thicker than plants (+) and (-) tap roots, respectively. Cuttings were smaller than seedlings, but were not relatively less resistant to stem deflection, probably because the thicker lateral roots compensated for their lower number. Apart from stem volume which was greater in trees (+) tap roots, no significant differences with regard to size or any root system variable were found in plants (-) or (+) tap roots. In all treatments, lateral roots were structurally reinforced through extra growth along the direction of the prevailing wind, which also improved tap root anchorage. Predictors of log F/CSA differed depending on treatment: in trees (-) tap roots, a combination of the predictors stem taper and %volume allocated to deep roots was highly regressed with log F/CSA (R 2 = 0. 83), unlike plants (+) tap roots where the combined predictors of lateral root number and root depth were best regressed with log F/CSA (R 2 = 0. 80). In cuttings, no clear relationships between log F/CSA and any parameter could be found. Wood density and E L did not differ between roots, but did diminish with increasing distance from the stem in lateral roots. E L was significantly lower in lateral roots from cuttings. Results showed that nursery techniques influence plant development but that the architectural pattern of Maritime pine root systems is stable, developing a <b>sinker</b> <b>root</b> system even when grown from cuttings.

Ks values (on the basis of organ transectional area) for <b>sinker</b> <b>roots</b> (range from 30 to 780 x 10 ~ 3 m 2 MPa~ 1 s~ 1) were consistently greater than in associated laterals (2 to 50 x 10 ~ 3 m 2 MPa~ 1 s~ 1), and much greater again than in trunks (0. 5 to 9 x 10 ~ 3 m 2 MPa" 1 s" 1).

Don, grown at Eyrewell State Forest after {{a range of}} ground preparation treatments, were tested by winching over sample trees and recording resistance with a strain gauge. The study included naturally regenerated and hand-planted stock on unripped ground, and machine-planted stock on ripped ground that had been treated in four different ways. Altogether 62 trees were winched over during February and March 1978. An increase in anchoring ability of roots in deep rips (to 120 cm) resulted in a tendency towards stem failure rather than the uprooting that characterised other treatments and which is the usual mode of failure in windthrow on the Canterbury Plains. Sixty-one root systems were excavated in April and May 1978 and measured to examine the main differences between treatments. Natural regeneration had a greater total root weight than did planted stock. Laterals contributed two-thirds of the total root weight in all treatments and were mostly located near the surface. Deep ripping treatments markedly altered root distribution but not total root weights. The greatest differences between treatments were in the <b>sinker</b> <b>roots.</b> Increased depth of ripping resulted in redistribution of <b>sinker</b> <b>roots</b> down-wards which accounted for the increased root anchorage of the trees in these treatments.

50|$|Tagasaste has {{two types}} of roots. There are a few large 'sinker' roots that can extend down to at least 10 metres.

The tree uprooting process was described by sequential stiffness reduction and the overall failure of the root-soil system both driven by sequential root failure. Root responses to tree overturning were identified with respect to root classes then directly linked to the tree overall response during the process. Through a systematic evaluation of main root components in relation to tree anchorage strength, the taproot, large shallow <b>roots</b> and windward <b>sinker</b> <b>roots</b> are found to contribute most significantly to tree stability.

40|$|Ecology. —In Puerto Rico, bitter bush {{grows in}} dry and moist forests that receive from 750 to about 1700 mm of annual precipitation. Usually rocky or {{otherwise}} poor sites are colonized {{in areas of}} both igneous and sedimentary (including limestone) rocks. The species grows from near sea level to about 400 m in elevation. Bitter bush requires full or partial sunlight. It grows in open, disturbed areas and low basal area, secondary and remnant forest. It withstands competition from herbs and shrubs well but eventually succumbs to competition from tall grass swards and closed forests. Although never abundant, the species becomes more common in overgrazed areas. General Description. —Bitter bush, also known as bellyache bush, balsam, sassafras, milk tree, and ti bois-lait, is a branchy shrub to 2. 5 m in height (Howard 1989, Liogier 1995). The species rarely becomes a small tree to 4 m in height (Liogier 1995) and 7 cm in diameter at breast height (Weaver 1990). Usually, there are multiple stems, as suckers arising from lateral roots, especially after fire or other disturbance. The root system is dominated by lateral <b>roots,</b> which support <b>sinker</b> <b>roots</b> and a moderate amount of fine roots. The ovate or ovate-elliptic leaves are 5 to 15 cm long by 3 to 5 cm broad, and grow in whorls of four or rarely three leaves. The several- to many-flowered inflorescences are usually terminal. The tiny flowers are tubular and white. The fruits are spherical or slightly flattened and 5 to 8 mm in diameter. Each contains two seeds (Howard 1989...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of the protea hybrid ‘Sylvia’ (Protea susannae X Protea eximia) to irrigation was investigated to determine the water requirements of this commercial floriculture crop. Both field and glasshouse trials were conducted in which plants were exposed to different irrigation levels. The effects of the irrigation regimes were determined by measuring the δ 13 C, δ 15 N, gas exchange characteristics, biomass accumulation, yield and root development. The plants in the glasshouse were exposed to watering regimes maintaining water at 20 %, 40 % and 60 % of field capacity in sand-filled pots. Higher water supply resulted in increased growth of the roots in particular, {{but also of the}} shoots, reaching a maximum at 40 % of field capacity. There were no significant changes in the gas exchange characteristics of the plants associated with this increased growth. In the field trial the intensity of irrigation (dry-land, normal and double-irrigation) did not influence the vegetative or reproductive biomass accumulation. Although the water content of the upper 30 cm of soil was significantly different between treatments, there were no differences in δ 13 C, relative water contents or in elemental compositions of the leaves. The gas exchange characteristics of the plants were only slightly influenced by the irrigation intensity maintaining very similar water use efficiencies between treatments, concurring with δ 13 C results. However, the development of cluster roots was strongly increased by irrigation. Dryland plants had extensive <b>sinker</b> <b>roots</b> penetrating the deeper (> 1 m) soil layers. It was concluded that the dimorphic and deep roots of ‘Sylvia’ allow access to water deep in the soil profile once the root system is established. Although maintenance of cluster roots for nutrient uptake is important, management practices should take cognisance of the fact that surface soil water contents only partially determine the availability of water for these deep-rooted perennial shrubs, if at all...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{redistribution}} (HR) is {{the phenomenon}} where plant roots transfer water between soil horizons of different water potential. When dry soil is a stronger sink for water loss {{from the plant}} than transpiration, water absorbed by roots in wetter soil horizons is transferred toward, and exuded into dry soil via flow reversals through the roots. Reverse flow is a good marker of HR and {{can serve as a}} useful tool to study it over the long-term. Seasonal variation of water uptake of a Quercus suber tree was studied from late winter through autumn 2003 at Rio Frio near Lisbon, Portugal. Sap flow was measured in five small shallow roots (diameter of 3 – 4 cm), 1 to 2 m from the tree trunk and in four azimuths and at different xylem depths at the trunk base, using the heat field deformation method (HFD). The pattern of sap flow differed among lateral roots as soil dried with constant positive flow in three roots and reverse flow in two other roots during the night when transpiration ceased. Rain modified the pattern of flow in these two roots by eliminating reverse flow and substantially increasing water uptake for transpiration during the day. The increase in water uptake in three other roots following rain was not so substantial. In addition, the flux in individual roots was correlated to different degrees with the flux at different radial depths and azimuthal directions in trunk xylem. The flow in outer trunk xylem seemed to be mostly consistent with water movement from surface soil horizons, whereas deep roots seemed to supply water to the whole cross-section of sapwood. When water flow substantially decreased in shallow lateral roots and the outer stem xylem during drought, water flow in the inner sapwood was maintained, presumably due to its direct connection to deep roots. Results also suggest the importance of the sap flow sensor placement, in relation to <b>sinker</b> <b>roots,</b> as to whether lateral roots might be found to exhibit reverse flow during drought. This study is consistent with the dimorphic rooting habit of Quercus suber trees in which deep roots access groundwater to supply superficial roots and the whole tree, when shallow soil layers were dry...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean {{evergreen}} oaks have {{to survive}} a long summer drought. Roots may play a relevant role under these conditions. We studied their structure and function in a mature Quercus suber L. tree in central Portugal. The root system was mapped till the lowest water table level (4. 5 m depth). Xylem anatomy was analyzed in a vertical profile belowground. Sap flow was continuously monitored for 1. 5 yrs in the stem and roots of this intensively studied tree (heat field deformation method) and in the stem of four trees (Granier method), in relation to environmental variables and predawn leaf water potential. The sources of water uptake were assessed by stable isotope analyses in summer. Results showed a dimorphic root system with a network of superficial <b>roots</b> linked to <b>sinker</b> <b>roots,</b> and a taproot diverting into tangles of deep fine roots submerged for long periods, with parenchyma aerenchyma. Transpiration was not restricted in summer due to root access to groundwater. The isotopic d 18 O signature of twig xylem water {{was similar to that}} of groundwater in the dry season. Two functional types of superficial roots were identified: shallow connected and deep connected roots. A modeling approach was built considering that each superficial root was linked to a sinker, with part of the root deep connected (between the stem and the sinker) and part shallow connected (between the sinker and topsoil). This conceptual framework simulated tree stem sap flow from root sap flow with a high efficiency (R 2 = 0. 85) in four plot trees. On an annual basis, soil water and groundwater contributions were 69. 5 % and 30. 5 % of stem flow, respectively. Annual hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent were 0. 9 % and 37. 0 % of stem flow, respectively. The trees maximize the exploitation of the environmental resources by using the topsoil water during most of the year, and groundwater together with hydraulic lift (nutrient supply) in the dry summer. This study shows that a dimorphic root system, with roots reaching groundwater, is an efficient strategy of Q. suber trees to cope with seasonal drought. Knowledge of the functional behavior of Q. suber trees under shallow water table conditions may contribute to the definition of better adapted management practices and to anticipate their responses to climate chang...|$|R

40|$|The {{life history}} {{strategy}} of Carex pumila Thunb. (Cyperaceae), a major colonist of raw moist sand {{on the sand}} plains of coastal Manawatu, New Zealand, is outlined. By virtue of the continuous formation of sand plains, sites suitable for colonization are a permanent feature of this habitat and vegetation of increasing seral maturity is represented {{at any one time}} across a series of adjoining deflation hollows and low dunes. It is proposed that the species is an r-strategist well suited to exposure, nutrient stress and seasonal flooding. Amelioration of these conditions by deliberate perturbation treatments resulted in this seral species responding in a way that ultimately lead to its more rapid demise. The species has a rhizomatous perennial growth habit. Tne modular construction of its rhizome system is described for the first time. Similarly, the occurrence of both long and short sympodial rhizome branches and of large-diameter <b>sinker</b> <b>roots</b> have not been previously described in the literature on this species. Its floral development appears to be environmentally cued. Emergence of inflorescences occurrs in early October. Maximum size of dissemules is obtained by early January. Subsequently seeds are shed and the shoots bearing them die. The species is essentially allogamous, although in a laboratory experiment, it was found to be partially self-compatible. Self-pollination must be expected in the field since neighbouring shoots are likely {{to be part of the}} same genet. Field studies are reported in which the performance of Carex pumila was monitored, firstly at sites of increasing seral maturity both in space and in time, and secondly in response to perturbation treatments. Populations showed a pattern of development that included a juvenile phase of rhizome expansion, an adolescent phase of increasing shoot density, a mature phase in which a proportion of the shoots were reproductive, and a senile phase of diminished growth and seed production. Phasic development was more protracted on the more stressed and more exposed sites. Other species more rapidly filled the space made available by the death and decay of Carex pumila shoots, than the colonist itself. As a pioneer, the species is doomed to extinction on the sites it colonizes. In a perturbation experiment, the sward mass of the total vegetation per unit area was increased at all sites by nitrogen fertilizer, applied as ammonium ions at a rate of 50 kg N / ha. Where the Carex pumila population was in a senile phase in an old deflation hollow, the increase was made mainly by other species. In younger populations on a low dune, the density of shoots and expanding buds of Carex pumila were markedly increased by the fertilizer treatment. Associated with this, a significant increase occurred in the proportion of the total dry weight of vegetative branches in rhizomes and in green leaves. A nitrogen limitation to seed yeild was indicated at the older low dune site. Here nitrogen fertilizer addition increased seed output per unit area by increasing both seed number per culm and seed size. By contrast on the younger low dune site, seed output per unit area was unchanged by the perturbation. In this population, reallocation of resources within fertile shoots, which was seen as an increased number of seeds per culm, was offset however by a reduction in fertile shoot density. Seed reproductive effort varied between 0 and 16 % of total biomass, whereas rhizome allocation was more variable; up to 100 % of biomass where the species was invading an embryonic deflation hollow. As a proportion of the biomass of fertile shoots alone, seed reproductive effort estimates of up to 32 % were obtained. The post-anthesis photosynthetic contribution of female spikes to final seed weight was estimated at 26 %, in a growth room experiment. This estimate is considered conservative given that final seed weight was not significantly reduced by defoliation and shading of the culm. Thus, the allocation of biomass to seeds cannot be considered a drain on the carbon resources of the plant that might otherwise be allocated to growth or some other plant function. Total nitrogen concentrations were dissimilar in different plant parts and, for comparable organs, between populations of different ages. Thus, allocation patterns to component parts based on dry weight and total nitrogen were different. Given that nitrogen was seen to be limiting growth in this seral habitat, the allocation of this resource is likely to be of greater significance in the evolution of life history strategies than is that of dry weight...|$|R
40|$|Root {{systems of}} woody plants {{generally}} display {{a strong relationship}} between the cross-sectional area (CSA) or cross-sectional diameter (CSD) of a root and the dry weight of biomass (DWd) or root volume (Vd) that has grown (i. e., is descendent) from that point. Specification of this relationship allows one to quantify root architectural patterns and estimate the amount of material lost when root systems are extracted from the soil. However, specifications of this relationship generally do {{not account for the}} fact that root systems are comprised of multiple types of roots. We assessed whether the relationship between CSD and Vd varies as a function of root type. Additionally, we sought to identify a more accurate and time-efficient method for estimating missing root volume than is currently available. We used a database that described the 3 D root architecture of Pinus pinaster root systems (5, 12, or 19 yr) from a stand. We determined the relationship between CSD and Vd for 10, 000 root segments from intact root branches. Models were specified that did and did not account for root type. The relationships were then applied to the diameters of 11, 000 broken root ends to estimate the volume of missing roots. CSD was nearly linearly related to the square root of Vd, but the slope of the curve varied greatly as a function of <b>root</b> type. <b>Sinkers</b> and deep <b>roots</b> tapered rapidly, as they were limited by available soil depth. Distal shallow roots tapered gradually, as they were less limited spatially. We estimated that younger trees lost an average of 17 % of root volume when excavated, while older trees lost 4 %. Missing volumes were smallest in the central parts of root systems and largest in distal shallow roots. The slopes of the curves for each root type are synthetic parameters that account for differentiation due to genetics, soil properties, or mechanical stimuli. Accounting for this differentiation is critical to estimating root loss accurately...|$|R
