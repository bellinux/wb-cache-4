After training with the 8th U-boat Flotilla at Danzig, U-338 was transferred to the 7th U-boat Flotilla for front-line service on 1 March 1943.|$|E

5000|$|Isaac H. Evans has a sparred {{length of}} 99 ft, 65 ft on deck, 20 ft at the beam and draws 6 ft with the {{centerboard}} up, and 13 ft with the centerboard down. She is a two-masted gaff-rigged topsail schooner with low sides and an elegant clipper bow, using a yawl boat for auxiliary power {{as one might}} a <b>small</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> to maneuver the vessel {{on and off the}} dock and when she is becalmed. [...] Her framing is double-sawn oak, originally fastened with treenails but now spikes, and has oak planking. Her complement of sails includes a mainsail, maintopsail, foresail, staysail, and jib. The hold, although it has been fitted for passenger occupancy, has retained its original joinery.|$|E
5000|$|The tug {{was built}} in 1965 for Harry [...] "Smitty" [...] Smith, of Smith's Marina in Gibsons, by local boat builder John F Gooldrup. As John Henry, the tug {{was used as a}} <b>small</b> <b>tug</b> and work <b>boat</b> in the waters of the Sunshine Coast. In 1972, the vessel was {{chartered}} by CBC Television to portray a log salvage boat owned by the central character Nick Adonidas in the series [...] "The Beachcombers". The tug's television name, taken from the Greek goddess Persephone, reflects Nick Adonidas' Greek heritage. The tug appeared in most episodes of the long-running series. Her battered, black hull became one of the show's iconic backdrops. Despite her small size and modest speed, her strength, seaworthiness and reliability made Persephone something of a character in her own right, often contrasted with the fast and aggressive jet boat piloted by Relic, Nick Adonidas' longtime rival.|$|R

5000|$|Assigned to the [...] carrier battle group, Merrill again {{deployed}} to the Middle East in 1991. On {{the way to}} Persian Gulf Merrill took part in Operation Fiery Vigil in June 1991. Arriving in the region after the ceasefire of the Gulf War, Merrill became the flagship for the coalition minesweeping forces in the Persian Gulf and was the second warship to visit the liberated port of Kuwait City after the Iraqi invasion. 1992 found Merrill underway on a counter-narcotics deployment in the Central America area of operations. In September 1992 Merrill was sent to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which lasted into late 1993. This overhaul consisted of upgrades to the control panels of the radar systems, an entire level added to the ship to contain previously installed CIWS control computers, and most importantly, RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) {{was added to the}} entire ship, a first for a destroyer. Upon receiving notice of the planned closure of Long Beach, The USS Merrill relocated to San Diego Naval Base in 1994 and spent the next few months as a test platform in deployment for the RAM material, which was designed to make the ship appear as <b>small</b> as a <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> on radars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{storage facility}} for the Milk River Project was initially {{intended to be}} a dam on the St. Mary Lakes (Upper St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park and Lower St. Mary Lake just east of the park), but no suitable damsite could be found. The Sherburne Lakes in Swiftcurrent Valley were selected as an alternate site, with work beginning in 1914. Building material was borrowed from {{the upper end of the}} Sherburne Lakes. In order to expedite transportation of materials, a <b>small</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> and several barges were purchased for $1900 and hauled overland from Seattle to the project site. Work continued through 1915 and 1916. Swiftcurrent Creek was diverted through the dam's outlet works in April 1916. Work was hampered by delays from spring flooding. The outlet tower and gatehouse were built in 1917, together with the spillway. In October observations indicated that the spillway was being displaced by a slide originating in a hill to the north of the spillway. Drainage of lakes above the slide did not cure the problem. Work on the dam and its control works continued through 1918, but the spillway problems continued. Water storage began in 1919. Eventually the spillway walls and floor were built of wood timbers to allow for movement. Work was complete in 1921. As originally built, Lake Sherburne impounded [...] behind the 94 ft dam.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Method {{of design}} and {{analysis}} of bollard pull harbour tug focuses in its stability and straight movement. Research includes {{a brief review of}} general description of bollard pull harbour <b>tug,</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> functions, <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> characteristics, functions, operation modes, requirements for <b>tug</b> <b>boats,</b> stability standard and factor affecting stability, stability requirements, displacement and buoyancy, fundamental {{of design and}} a very last, fundamental of analysis. This research also discuss about the methodology to implement the design and analysis to measure the stability and movement of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat.</b> The purpose of design modelling is to identify the error of the existing design and to redesign to eliminate or reduce errors. The error consists of the hull structure and skeg design. However to redesign the hull and skeg must be done during design stage. For this report, it will discuss only the basis of the design methodology. The analysis of the stability and straight movement of the bollard pull harbour tug are using software analysis. SolidWorks and ANSYS are the proposed analysis software that will implement for this thesis. The analysis of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> is study on static and dynamic analysis that discuss about finite element analysis and hydrodynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis is important part because it deals with how the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> moving in a stable and balanced during its operation...|$|R

25|$|A {{relatively}} minor sideline, {{started in the}} 1890s, was the company's <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> operations.

With the decline of coastal shipping however, towage assumed more importance. By the 1960s, towage and associated operations represented a very significant part of the company's activities.|$|R
2500|$|Final {{preparations}} to refloat {{the ship}} began on 28 June 2007 when the ballast water, added earlier to stabilise the vessel, was pumped out to aid buoyancy.
