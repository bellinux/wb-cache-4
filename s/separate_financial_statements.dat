40|$|Recent {{corporate}} scandals have highlighted abuses by firms overstating profits to capital markets. In a related but less noticed vein, {{the reporting of}} profits to tax authorities has come under increased scrutiny with heightened concerns over the spread of tax avoidance activities. How could firms simultaneously be inflating profits reported to the capital markets and understating profits reported to tax authorities? The practical answer is that American firms keep two sets of financial statements: a <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> that reports "book profits" to the capital markets and a <b>separate</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> that reports "tax profits" to the government. These two profit reports can bear little resemblance {{to each other and}} follow distinct rules. This paper argues that the latitude afforded managers by the dual nature of corporate profit reporting has contributed to the simultaneous degradation of profit reporting to capital markets and tax authorities. The distinction between book and tax profits allows managers the ability to mischaracterize tax savings to capital markets and to mischaracterize profits to tax authorities. Examination of three high-profile cases of managerial misreporting of profits and tax avoidance—at Enron, Tyco and Xerox—reveals how the drive to improve reported book profits fosters tax avoidance and how the drive to limit taxes gives rise to the manipulation of accounting profits and managerial malfeasance. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{a direct}} result of the {{accession}} into EU, IFRSs have been introduced in Slovakia as a framework for compilation of <b>separate</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of various businesses since 2006. Because of traditionally strong ties between accounting and tax regulation, taxpayers and tax authorities were exposed to an unprecedented situation. Consequently, national parliament and the government have tried to address major identified issues. Apparently, two underlying principles have been established for carrying out these initiatives 2 ̆ 013 to comply with the Regulation No. 1606 / 2002 and to keep the tax burden at the same level. Still, there is serious concern about the effectiveness of the measures adopted, as there are at least three approaches for determination of income taxes of IFRS adopters in Slovakia. Because the relevance of accounting information is partially driven by their ability to predict future order and results of events, our paper is focused on the assessment of the disclosures related to current income tax determination, presented in the <b>separate</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of the said companies.

These events may lead to the independent auditor being required to provide an internal control opinion <b>separate</b> from a <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit. Consequently, the auditor may be required to aggregate the evaluation of system parts into a statement as to the performance of the system or major subsystem as a whole in addition to the reports currently made to management on the adequacy of internal control. Although mathematical models for internal control evaluation have been proposed, these have failed to receive acceptance by auditors. As an alternative to these models, this paper proposes the use of a procedure for aggregating the evaluation of parts of an internal control system employing the linguistic values commonly in use by auditors such as "strong," "weak," and "adequate. " The linguistic model (1) uses the theory of fuzzy sets to aggregate these common linguistic values and (2) returns a linguistic aggregate evaluation of the control system under review.
