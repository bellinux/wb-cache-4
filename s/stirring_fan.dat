40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} technologically {{advanced}} developments in South Africa. In order to build a commercially viable demonstration power plant, all the specifically and uniquely designed equipment must first be qualified. All the prototype equipment is tested at the Helium Test Facility (HTF) at Pelindaba. One of the largest components that are tested is the Core Unloading Device (CUD). The main function of the CUD is to unload fuel from the bottom of the reactor core to enable circulation of the fuel core. The CUD housing vessel forms part of the reactor pressure boundary. Pebble-directing valves and other moving machinery are installed inside its machined inner surface. It is essential that the interior surfaces of the CUD are case hardened to provide a corrosion- and wear-resistant layer. Cold welding between the moving metal parts and the machined surface must also be prevented. Nitriding is a case hardening process that adds a hardened wear- and corrosion-resistant layer that will also prevent cold welding of the moving parts in the helium atmosphere. Only a few nitriding furnaces exist that can house a forging as large as the CUD of the PBMR. Commercial nitriding furnaces in South Africa are all too small and have limited flexibility in terms of the nitriding process. The nitriding of a vessel as large as the CUD has not yet been carried out commercially. The aim of this work was to design and develop a custom-made nitriding plant to perform the nitriding of the first PBMR/HTF CUD. Proper process control is essential to ensure that the required nitrided case has been obtained. A new concept for a gas nitriding plant was developed using the nitrided vessel interior as the nitriding process chamber. Before the commencement of detail design, a laboratory test was performed on a scale model vessel to confirm concept feasibility. The design of the plant included the mechanical design of various components essential to the nitriding process. A special <b>stirring</b> <b>fan</b> with an extended length shaft was designed, taking whirling speed into account. Considerable research was performed on the high temperature use of the various components to ensure the safe operation of the plant at temperatures of up to 600 °C. Nitriding requires the use of hazardous gases such as ammonia, oxygen and nitrogen. Hydrogen is produced as a by-product and therefore safety was the most important design parameter. Thermohydraulic analyses, i. e. heat transfer and pressure drop calculations in pipes, were also performed to ensure the successful process design of the nitriding plant. The nitriding plant was subsequently constructed and operated to verify the correct design. A large amount of experimental and operating data was captured during the actual operation of the plant. This data was analysed and the thermohydraulic analyses were verified. Nitrided specimens were subjected to hardness and layer thickness tests. The measured temperature of the protruding fan shaft was within the limits predicted by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models. Graphs of gas flow rates and other operation data confirmed the inverse proportionality between ammonia supply flow rate and measured dissociation rate. The design and operation of the nitriding plant were successful as a nitride layer thickness of 400 μm and hardness of 1 200 Vickers hardness (VHN) was achieved. This research proves that a large pressure vessel can successfully be nitrided using the vessel interior as a process chamber. Master...|$|E

5000|$|The third lunar landing {{expedition}} Apollo 13 in April 1970, was aborted and {{the lives}} of the crew, James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, were threatened by failure of a cryogenic liquid oxygen tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal <b>stirring</b> <b>fans</b> in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by fuel cells to the command spacecraft. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the lunar landing craft as a [...] "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test, which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation, because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.|$|R

60|$|She {{had been}} a lissom maid of sixteen in those far-off days, the child of humble peasant-folk, and she had gone uncomplaining to the arms of her swarthy ravisher. To-day, at thirty-four, she was still {{beautiful}}, more beautiful indeed than when first she had fired the passion of Asad-Reis--as he then was, one of the captains of the famous Ali-Basha. There were streaks of red in her heavy black tresses, her skin was of a soft pearliness that seemed translucent, her eyes were large, of a golden-brown, agleam with sombre fires, her lips were full and sensuous. She was tall and of a shape that in Europe would have been accounted perfect, {{which is to say}} that she was a thought too slender for Oriental taste; she moved along beside her lord with a sinuous, languorous grace, gently <b>stirring</b> her <b>fan</b> of ostrich plumes. She was unveiled; indeed it was her immodest habit to go naked of face more often than was seemly, which is but the least of the many undesirable infidel ways which had survived her induction into the Faith of Islam--a necessary step before Asad, who was devout to the point of bigotry, would consent to make her his wife. He had found her such a wife as it is certain he could never have procured at home; a woman who, not content to be his toy, the plaything of his idle hour, insinuated herself into affairs, demanded and obtained his confidences, and exerted over him much the same influence as the wife of a European prince might exert over her consort. In the years during which he had lain under the spell of her ripening beauty he had accepted the situation willingly enough; later, when he would have curtailed her interferences, it was too late; she had taken a firm grip of the reins, and Asad was in no better case than many a European husband--an anomalous and outrageous condition this for a Basha of the Prophet's House. It was also a dangerous one for Fenzileh; for should the burden of her at any time become too heavy for her lord there was a short and easy way by which he could be rid of it. Do not suppose her so foolish as not to have realized this--she realized it fully; but her Sicilian spirit was daring to the point of recklessness; her very dauntlessness which had enabled her to seize a control so unprecedented in a Muslim wife urged her to maintain it in the face of all risks.|$|R
40|$|The {{first stage}} of this {{investigation}} involved two years of field tests in three 5. 5 -m diameter drying bins, two of which were equipped with single-auger grain stirrers. The first year, 24 % moisture (wet basis) corn was dried using 3. 7 - to 5. 2 -kW fans. One bin was unstirred and another was stirred 48 h per week. The third bin was stirred at bin filling, when average moisture reached 20 %, and again when average moisture fell below 15. 5 %. Both stirred bins used less energy and had less overdrying than the unstirred bin, with least energy use in the bin stirred three times;In the second field test, 20 % moisture corn was dried. One bin was unstirred {{and the other two}} were stirred {{at the beginning and end}} of drying. The 3. 7 - to 5. 2 -kW fan on one stirred bin was replaced with a 2. 2 -kW model. Again, the stirred bins used less energy and had less overdrying. The stirred bin with the small fan used the least Oil, Gas, and Energy;The initial stirring was found to decrease bulk density and airflow resistance and greatly increase airflow. Subsequent stirring had unpredictable effects on bulk density and generally increased airflow resistance. Stirring shifted fines toward the drying floors and produced a small quantity of fines;In the second stage of the investigation, field test results were used to modify and calibrate a computer model to simulate natural-air stir drying. It was found that airflow had to be reduced to 74 % of the input value and only 57. 5 % of the input electrical power could be used to calculate air temperature rise or the model would overpredict drying. Simulated natural-air drying of 20 and 24 % moisture corn harvested mid-October in central Iowa showed that <b>stirring</b> reduced required <b>fan</b> size, electric-energy use, and overdrying;In the final stage, an economic analysis was conducted using corn physical properties from the field studies, average energy use and overdrying from the simulations, and local equipment and operating costs. The analysis showed that stirring increased net revenues for natural-air drying of 24 % moisture corn and did for 20 % moisture corn when electricity prices were high...|$|R
