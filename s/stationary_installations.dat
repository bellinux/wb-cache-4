40|$|The Selective Catalytic Reduction by NH 3 /urea is a world-wide {{established}} {{after treatment}} {{technology for the}} removal of NOx in the stack gases of power plants and of other stationary sources. Typical SCR catalysts operate between 300 and 400 degrees C, however for some applications SCR systems with reasonable DeNO(x) activity at temperatures as low as 180 degrees C are required nowadays. It was recently shown that over both V 2 O 5 -WO 3 /TiO 2 and Fe-ZSM- 5 commercial SCR catalysts the addition of aqueous solutions of NH 4 NO 3 to a NO-NH 3 containing feed stream results in the occurrence of the "Enhanced SCR" (E-SCR) reaction (2 NH(3) + 2 NO + NH 4 NO 3 > 3 N(2) + 5 H(2) O), characterized by superior NO reduction efficiencies in the 200 - 350 degrees C range. In this paper we present a systematic experimental study of the E-SCR reaction over a commercial V-based Haldor Topsoe catalyst. The effects of three operating variables, namely space velocity (18 - 75 k h(- 1)), temperature (180 - 250 degrees C) and ammonium nitrate feed content (0 - 100 % of stoichiometric feed), are addressed in order to identify the best process conditions in view of the specific application of this new technology to <b>stationary</b> SCR <b>installations.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of studies carried on in the frame of conceptual, multi-variant dewatering project for the hard-coal mines of the so-called Sosnowiec sub-system. The project ensures the safety existence of the adjacent mines. Several hydrogeological and mining-engineering factors have been taken into consideration, the multi-year inflow statistics were analyzed for the individual mines together with the technical conditions of existing dewatering systems and hydraulic connections between the mines. The project contains the concept of an in-coming dewatering system of the Sosnowiec Mine referred to the changes in dewatering systems of the Saturn and Paris mines, and to the results of closure of the Porąbka-Klimontów Mine. The mathematical model was applied to calculate the prognosed inflow rates. Results of three selected variants were characterized in details and preliminary timing of mine flooding was calculated. The best solution of dewatering problem of the mines belonging to the so-called Sosnowiec sub-system is the variant 1. In comparison with the current system, the solution proposes the replacement of <b>stationary</b> dewatering <b>installations</b> at the Paris, Sosnowiec and Porąbka-Klimontów mines by the submersible pumps installed in the shafts. The main dewatering system of the Kazimierz-Juliusz Mine would remain unchanged. The volume of waters derived from the regional dewatering of mines and discharged to surficial flows will decrease. Also the costs of dewatering of the closed and remediated mines will be significantly reduced.

40|$|We {{developed}} a geospatial model that calculates ambient high-frequency electromagnetic field (HF-EMF) strengths of <b>stationary</b> transmission <b>installations</b> such as mobile phone base stations and broadcast transmitters with high spatial {{resolution in the}} order of 1 m. The model considers the location and transmission patterns of the transmitters, the three-dimensional topography, and shielding effects by buildings. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the suitability of the model for exposure monitoring and for epidemiological research. We modeled time-averaged HF-EMF strengths for an urban area in the city of Basel as well as for a rural area (Bubendorf). To compare modeling with measurements, we selected 20 outdoor measurement sites in Basel and 18 sites in Bubendorf. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients between modeling and measurements. Chance-corrected agreement was evaluated by weighted Cohen's kappa statistics for three exposure categories. Correlation between measurements and modeling of the total HF-EMF strength was 0. 67 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 33 - 0. 86) in the city of Basel and 0. 77 (95 % CI: 0. 46 - 0. 91) in the rural area. In both regions, kappa coefficients between measurements and modeling were 0. 63 and 0. 77 for the total HF-EMF strengths and for all mobile phone frequency bands. First evaluation of our geospatial model yielded substantial agreement between modeling and measurements. However, before the model can be applied for future epidemiologic research, additional validation studies focusing on indoor values are needed to improve model validity.

40|$|Purpose. The {{development}} of the free-piston diesel engine-and-hydraulic pump for the continuously variable hydrostatical transmission of mobile power vehicles. Methodology. For a long time engine builders have been interesting in the problem of developing free piston engines, which have much bigger coefficient of efficiency (40 … 80 %). Such engines don’t have the conversion of reciprocating motion for inner combustion engine piston into rotating motion of crankshaft, from which the engine torque is transferred to the power machine transmission. Free-piston engines of inner combustion don’t have the crank mechanism (CM) that significantly reduces mechanical losses for friction. Such engines {{can be used as}} compressors. Free-piston engine compressor (FPEC) – is a free-piston machine in which energy received from engine’s cylinder is being transferred direct to compressor’s pistons connected with operational pistons of engine without crank mechanism. Part of the pressed air is being consumed for engine cylinder drain and the other part is going to the consumer. Findings. The use of free-piston engines-and-hydraulic pumps as power-transmission plants of power vehicles (diesel locomotives, combine harvester, tractors, cars and other mobile and <b>stationary</b> power <b>installations)</b> with the continuously variable transmissions allows cost effectiveness improvement and metal consumption reduction of these vehicles, since the cost effectiveness of FPE is higher by 25 - 30 %, and the metal consumption is lower by 40 - 50 %. Originality. One of the important advantages of the free-piston engines is their simplicity and engine balance. As a result of the crank mechanism absence their construction is much simplified and the vibrations, peculiar to the ordinary engines are eliminated. In such installation the engine pistons are directly connected through the rod to compressor pistons and therefore there are no losses in the bearing bushes. Practical value. The free-piston engines are now used only as gas generators and diesel compressors, and the hydraulic transmission is arranged with the ordinary heat-engine, which operates the hydraulic pumps...|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{approach}} to risk assessment {{is defined in}} the National Plan for Environmental Protection Policy (NMP) of 1988. The goal is {{the present and future}} protection of humans, animals, plants, the ecosystem, and property through measures designed to provide for a sustainable development. The safety goals are defined in "Premises for Risk Management," an annex to the NMP, in 1989. Safety goals are determined with quantitative values. Maximum permitted risks are differentiated from negligible risks. Risks that fall between these two values must be reduced to a negligible level within one generation (ALARA-principle). The safety thresholds for existing and new hazards are also differentiated. Hazards include <b>stationary</b> <b>installations,</b> transport systems (road, rail, water, and air transport), hazardous substances (chemical, radioactive), and genetically-altered organisms. The two most important criteria for risk assessment are the individual probability of death and the probability of death for groups.

40|$|Two-coordinate {{platforms}} {{equipped with}} orientation systems are 40 - 45 % {{more effective than}} <b>stationary</b> <b>installations.</b> However, {{there are other factors}} affecting the efficiency of solar installations. In particular, the shading on the panels’ surfaces when panels, located in rows, are casting shadows on each other. This negatively affects the efficiency of photovoltaic installations. Previous experience in the design of photovoltaic systems shows that neither stationary platforms nor two-coordinate installations completely eliminate energy losses due to shadow formation. The only way to mitigate this negative impact is to increase the distance between the panels. At the same time, and the density ratio (the ratio of the panel area to the area of the land) does not exceed 0. 2. Our goal is to develop kinematic schemes and software control systems for three coordinate platforms that can avoid shadow formation on panels placed in constrained spaces. The result of our work is a numerical method that solves the optimization problem for controlling the motion of a set of platforms and a rational kinematic scheme for three coordinate platforms. This problem is especially relevant for solar photovoltaic systems located on space stations. In space, the changes in temperature between shaded and shadow-free sections of panels is enormous, due to temperature stress, the panels get destroyed and require expensive repairs. Three-coordinate tracking can reduce the surface occupied by solar panels by about 3 times compared to the currently used solutions and increased module placement densities from 0. 2 to 0. 6...|$|E
40|$|Direct reading {{instruments}} (DRIs) {{are popular}} devices for measuring aerosols {{because they provide}} rapid on-site measurement of particle size and/or concentration. However, the output of DRIs may drift over time requiring frequent manufacturer calibration. Given the possibility of drift, the output of DRIs should ideally be verified to ensure proper response before and after field use. Methods for verifying the output of DRIs particle size reading are available for use in laboratory and field. However, methods for verifying the DRIs concentration reading are complex and often use of <b>stationary</b> <b>installations</b> that are not suited for field work. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a verification device that can be used in the field to verify the output of DRIs for measuring aerosol concentration. The new device uses a nebulizer that produces aerosols through vibrating mesh technology. This vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) uses only electrical input to generate aerosols and does not require compressed air. The verification device was able to produce stable output of aerosols at low concentrations (0. 2 mg/m 3 to 1. 2 mg/m 3). It was also possible to produce different concentration levels of aerosol by changing the electrical current to the VMN. The verification device was used to monitor and validate the output of a condensation particle counter and a photometer. Results showed that both instruments having valid output and did not require manufacture calibration. The verification device made it possible to monitor and verify the output of two DRIs. This was achieved by generating reproducible aerosol output with specific composition.

40|$|The Russian {{retail trade}} sector has {{adjusted}} {{itself to the}} new free market conditions within an extremely short period of time. Different purchasing habits and completely new forms of companies have developed. Thousands of kiosks have been set up. In the form of kiosk complexes, these often take over the exclusive supply function for large tenement estates with considerably more than 100 000 inhabitants. It is rare to find shopping malls around {{the borders of the}} city or in the "green belt", such as {{can be found in the}} new Länder of Germany, in major Russian cities. Using the example of two city districts in St. Petersburg, the causes and conditions, as well as the regional location patterns for the formation of these ephemeral institutions were examined. The kiosk trade has developed to become a permanent aspect of the entire municipal retail trade system. In addition to the drastic deficit in sales' space, the lack of starting capital, the state regimentation and the greater level of flexibility of running a kiosk, the causes for the formation of this phenomenon are to be found primarily in the low level of personal motorisation and the preferred use of public transport by the population. Consequently, the larger shop location complexes, which demonstrate the range of goods to be found in a shopping centre, have been set up in the metro stations, followed by the locations of bus and tram stops, close to the <b>stationary</b> trade <b>installations,</b> as well as at cross-roads with pedestrian footbridges. The most important precondition for the operation of a kiosk is: the kiosk trade will become more efficient in a direct proportionate relationship to the spatial proximity and the daily quantities of passers-by, recruited from all social classes. The numbers of kiosks amount to 2, 5 - 3 kiosks per 1000 passers-by.

It is important, however, to realise that CCS will always require additional energy compared to projects without CCS, so will not be used unless project operators see an appropriate value for reducing CO 2 emissions from their operations or legislation is introduced that requires CCS to be used.

Hazardous zones for a "generic hydrogen refuelling station"(HRS) are assessed, based on this method. The method is consistent with the EU directive 1999 / 92 /EC "Safety and Health Protection of Workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres" which is the basis for determination of hazardous zones in Europe. This regulation is focused on protection of workers, and is relevant for hydrogen installations, such as hydrogen refuelling stations, repair shops and other <b>stationary</b> <b>installations</b> where some type of work operations will be involved. The method is also based on the IEC standard and European norm IEC/EN 60079 - 10 "Electrical apparatus for explosive gas atmospheres. Part 10 Classification of hazardous areas".

40|$|A {{central issue}} for the {{protection}} of {{human health and the environment}} will also be the reduction in future of the new inputs of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, generally designated dioxins, into the environment. Effective measures have already been taken in Germany in recent years to fulfill this matter of concern. One example of this is the 17 th Ordinance for the implementation of the Federal Imission Control Act (Waste Incineration Installations Ordinance). This ordinance applies to all installations in which certain waste materials in solid or in liquid form, or similar substances are incinerated. As well as strict requirements for an extensive range of airpolluting materials, it also lowers the emission-limit values for dioxins to 0. 1 ng TE/m" 3 in waste gases. Against this background and commissioned by the Conference of the Ministers for the Environment and by the State Commission for Immission Control, it shall be investigated whether the limit values 0. 1 ng TE/m" 3 for emissions can also be applied to other emitting groups. In order to respond to this question, a working group has been set up under the direction of the Federal Ministry for the Environment. The information available on emissions of dioxins from installations which do not fall under the Ordinance for Installations for Waste Material Incineration, has been compiled.
