6000|$|By {{the time}} they had {{concluded}} their investigations, aunt Dorcas joined them, and <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd smile on her withered face: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which {{of those}} two {{surveyor}} fellows is it, Clemmy?" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> engaging smile, yet halting at a strategic distance.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> travel-tired smile - [...] Who shall {{lift the}} years O! - [...] She <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> travel-tired smile, [...] Half scared by scene so strange; [...] She said, outworn by mile on mile, [...] The blurred lamps wanning her face the while, [...] "O Love, I am here; I am with you!" [...] . Ah, {{that there should}} have come a change! ...|$|R
60|$|No, La Certe {{had come}} to do none of these things, he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conciliatory smile.|$|R
6000|$|For {{another five}} minutes this continued, when Aunt Mildred withdrew her hand <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effort, and <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nervous laugh: ...|$|R
6000|$|The breakfast which {{mother had}} been {{preparing}} was neglected until some time later, when Simon Kenton <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> evident effort at cheerfulness: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{amount of}} small change, Missis,' he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{abstracted}} air, {{after a little}} meditation, 'might you call a morsel of money?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As usual," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{underhung}} sneer-"bowin' your heads {{before the}} Oppressor {{that comes to}} spend his leisure gloatin' over you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The prince {{took several}} small pieces, tasted and {{examined}} carefully, and then <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mysterious and sarcastic smile: ...|$|R
6000|$|She guessed his thought--from the {{beginning}} Stella had this curious power of discovering his mind--and <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile: ...|$|R
60|$|The judge bowed slightly. 'The {{question}} {{requires no}} answer,' he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quiet emphasis. I burned bright scarlet.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{your head}} is level, Lottie!" [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> admiration that was not, however, without a weak reserve of suspicion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon so," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{exasperating}} smile. [...] "Most fellers do. But she ain't Miss Johnson no more. She's married." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he <b>said,</b> <b>with,</b> <b>an</b> almost equal severity, [...] "Miss Triscoe is on board. Miss Triscoe-and-her-father. She {{wishes to}} come down and see you." ...|$|E
60|$|Mark {{touched his}} hat, and <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very sudden {{decrease}} of vivacity, {{that he was}} going to Salisbury.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] <b>said</b> Lady Corisande, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long-drawn sigh. [...] "Their {{manoeuvres}} never cease. However, I think Monday must be safe. Would you come?" [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> serious, searching glance, {{and in a}} kind of coaxing murmur.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} again stared curiously at him. After <b>a</b> pause he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> half-pitying, half-humorous smile: [...] "Pike--aren't you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You are {{an outspoken}} girl, Sally,' Mr. Warbles <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{unpleasant}} {{attempt at a}} laugh. 'Why shouldn't {{you be able to}} love me?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't cry--don't cry," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd simplicity. His {{heart was}} calm and numb {{with a sort}} of innocence of love, now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Herbert," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affectionate smile, [...] "forgive me {{for being}} a little late. Baroness, I am delighted to see you--and Louise." ...|$|E
6000|$|Josie O'Gorman {{went back}} to Washington well pleased with her success, {{although}} she <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little grimace of feigned regret: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Ernest!' Edie <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> face {{of horror}} and surprise. 'Not after the shameful way they've treated poor Max Schurz!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you have}} seen the colonel already?" [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{scarcely}} perceptible alteration of expression, which, however, struck Paul.|$|R
