40|$|Abstract. To {{overcome}} {{the shortcomings of}} assembly lightweight steel structure residential system in our country. A new type of lightweight energy-saving composite wall is proposed, which is composed by light-gauge shaped steel and thin panel. In order to investigate the load-bearing behaviour and failure mode of the composite wall, 4 wall specimens in full ratio were designed and manufactured. The experiment study is carried out under lateral and vertical loads. The {{results show that the}} <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screw</b> integrate the light-gauge shaped steel and thin panel to bear loads. The decrease of <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screw</b> spacing can effectively enhance the load-bearing capacity of the composite wall, and the best choice of the <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screw</b> pitch is 150 mm.

When the end slip between the C-Channels and the foam concrete are noticeable, the joints were shearing the concrete block that provided a huge mechanical interlocking to prevent the relative slip between C-Channels and foam concrete. This force was transferred to steel by <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws,</b> which effectively increased the shear resistance of the components. The increased slope of AB segment shows that the bearing force of connectors was increasing gradually. And the peak force is also increased. When the shear stresses of the <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws</b> reached their ultimate shear strength, screws fail make the connectors stop moving.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCold-formed steel (CFS) with {{variety of}} shape, {{thickness}} and steel grade {{is becoming a}} popular choice of structure in civil engineering work and building, especially for roof truss system, pallet racking, wall panel and etc. Curved steel element {{is important in the}} analysis that be suited by the architectural drawing and structural demand. CFS with a curved section for unique roof truss design is studied. The CFS is curved by using the method of cut-curving in which the CFS section is cut at a certain length and then curved into desired profile. The experiment for determining the mechanical behaviour of the section is by using the compression strength of the column. The height of column is fixed at 600 mm but the method for strengthening the cut-curving is varied. There are four types of cut-curving with a variation of strengthening method.

The criteria need to be considered in improving the structural strength is the fabrication method. Fast and easy fabrication can produce an efficient structure. Built-up of normal CFS into new member with higher strength can be produced efficiently by attaching the normal steel using <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screw.</b> CFS channel with constant size has been used to produce built-up, back to back (BTB), and box-up (BU) with varieties of length. The constant spacing were used at 400 mm centre to centre along its length and supported by using an angle plate that screw through its web. 18 nos of columns were tested for compression until the column cannot resist any increment of load. The ultimate loads were compared to the predicted buckling load using EC 3 - 1 - 3. The prediction of column capacity is based on flexural buckling and torsional buckling failure. BTB column results in higher load except for 2. 5 m length, while the differences of experimental load are up to 24 % to the experimental. Meanwhile, BU results in higher load for all columns with differences up to 80 % compared to the code and the code is considered too conservative for this column type...|$|E
40|$|Through cold-forming, thin gauge {{structural}} members and structural sheeting can be shaped. This structural sheeting and supporting {{structural members}} are joined together {{by means of}} <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screw</b> fasteners, resulting in a load-bearing system transmitting the surface loads to the main steel frame. Uplift (wind suction) and gravity (self-weight, snow, maintenance) loading in general generate both bending and torsion within the purlins. Since the roof sheeting and steel purlin are connected, this connection both provides lateral and rotational restraint. This positive effect is accounted for within a design. Several design rules are available and proposed {{for this type of}} complex systems. In most cases the amount of lateral restraint is very large. On the contrary, the rotational restraint is flexible. Recent Ph. D. studies [Katnam, 2007] propose a design rule as an extension for available rules within Eurocode 3, part 1. 3 (2003), based on detailed numerical analysis and validated by means of a set of well chosen experiments, so-called Pekoz-tests. In the framework of a collaborative research with an industrial partner, a large number of Pekoz tests were performed for different types of sheeting and Z- and -members. These tests provide a unique opportunity for external validation of the proposed design rules. Based on this extensive experimental validation, this contribution gives a critical appraisal of the proposed design rules to incorporate the rotational restraint within the combined steel purlin-sheeting system. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The use of cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{very popular}} in the {{construction}} of steel truss system. The research in CFS is also getting more attention in wall panel and column structure. However, an assemblage of CFS with lipped C-channel section into a column alone does not provide significant increase in the compression capacity. Therefore, the purpose of this research study was to enhance the compressive capacity of composite column of CFS with lipped C-channel assembled with ferro-cement jacket by means of shear connectors. Tests were carried out to evaluate the behavior of shear connectors of the proposed composite column assembled together as precast member. Eight push-out test specimens of CFS with lipped C-channel sections assembled with ferro-cement jacket were prepared and tested. In addition, three types of shear connectors namely, bolts (10 mm and 12 mm in diameters), bar angle bolts (10 mm in diameter), and <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screw</b> (6. 3 mm in diameter × 12 mm long) were evaluated. Their behavior was analyzed in terms of load-slip relationship and failure mode. The results and discussion are presented by varying the number of wire meshes used and types of installed shear connector. The results showed that as the number of layers of wire mesh and the diameter of bolts increased the ultimate load carrying capacity of composite section also increased. The tested results show that the shear connector with 12 mm diameter bolt showed the highest shear capacity. The behavior of shear connectors was also simulated by finite element modeling (FEM) and when compared with the experimental results, they showed a close agreement...|$|E

The fabrication of connections is the most labour intensive aspect of the cold-formed thin-gauge steel construction process, thus {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of screw connections could lead to optimum connection design and reducing the cost of the fabrication.

The focus of this study is on the influence of the number of screws and screw spacing on the strength of self drilling screw connection. These parameters are varied to determine their influences on the connection strength. The failure load and failure modes were obtained and observed from the tests carried out in the laboratory. Bearing and tilting failures occurred during the testing of these specimens. The predicted connection strengths were calculated using American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) design equations. A total of 24 specimens of single shear test showed that connection strength is linearly proportional to the number of screw in the connection.

For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|R

40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. <b>Self-drilling</b> <b>screws</b> or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. Blind rivets and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws.</b> They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind rivets, zinc-coated steel blind rivets, stainless steel blind rivets and blind nuts. The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets.

30|$|The {{superposition}} of {{the longitudinal}} shear {{capacity of the}} shear connector and natural bonding function provide longitudinal shear resistance of composite members, but they are relatively independent. However, considering the superposition effect of the two should depend on the shear connectors because the natural bonding function between cold-formed thin-walled C steel and foam concrete is not changed by shear connectors. The main influence factor is the buried depth of shear connector. For instance, when the shear connector buried depth is too small and near to the loading end, it will be premature to reach the ultimate shear capacity. That means the failure of shear connectors shall occur in the increasing segment of natural bond-slip. Otherwise the shear connectors will fail in the descending phase of natural bond-slip. Therefore, the maximum value will happen on the situation that the two peaks overlap. It’s best to make the <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws</b> are being cut off as the same displacement as the peak force of natural bond.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{longitudinal}} shear resistance between foam concrete and C-Channels, an investigation is carried out on the shear connectors in foam concrete with cold-formed steel double C-Channels embedment. Twenty-four tests {{have been carried out}} in two groups. Two types of connectors: flange connectors and web connectors are installed using <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws</b> for a rapid construction. The experimental results show that they can effectively improve the longitudinal shear-resist capacity of the concrete. After the experiment, the specimens are dismantled for an interior observation. Based on the observation, the form of damage, the failure mechanism was discovered, and the equation of longitudinal shear capacity was developed. It is concluded that the failure involves independent slippage between two C-Channels and the shear connection fractures. Since the composite structure requires sufficient slip between the two materials, these types of shear connectors will have good enhancement for this type of composite structures subjected to dynamic loads.|$|R

The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws</b> or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with <b>self-drilling</b> <b>screws.</b> The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single flange).
