5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. His strongest technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers as <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to. His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to. I also think finding some new Marvel characters to pull into the universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series {{has the opportunity to}} explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E

500|$|Bourque {{has been}} {{involved}} in many charitable endeavours both in Calgary and Lac La Biche. He says this lifestyle was tough growing up, which is why he started the Bourque Buddies charity to help Metis children have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to and work towards. “You see the effects of stuff that goes on in small towns or even in reserves and it’s a tough life for a lot of those kids,” Bourque says. He started the Rene Bourque Hockey Fund with the goal of providing hockey equipment to underprivileged kids, and has appeared as a spokesman for Native Americans in sport at youth symposiums. His fund led to the donation of 50 sets of equipment to underprivileged children in Northern Alberta during the 2008–09 season, and over 100 sets in 2010–11. [...] Also in 2010–11, he started a program called [...] "Bourque's Buddies" [...] that rewards kids from the Tsuu T'ina Nation who have made positive contributions in their schools with tickets to Flames games.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{said it was}} [...] "a very Sparksian {{undertaking}} – painstaking {{and slightly}} ludicrous – to make a musical about an art-house film director, with a very complicated plot, for the radio (even Rick Wakeman's King Arthur on Ice had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at)." [...] It said the orchestral arrangements by Ron Mael were [...] "great, actually, recalling the skyscraper bustle of Bernstein and the triumphant fanfares of Michael Nyman", and stated that [...] "the central concept – pursue your own idea of art, regardless of whether anyone will buy it – seems to be their rule of thumb, too. And you can't knock that." [...] The review by Stephen Dalton, also in The Times, found the [...] "modernist musical backdrop" [...] dominated by [...] "electro-orchestral fragments" [...] "less seductive" [...] and, [...] "despite plenty of arch and witty lyrics", regretted the scarcity of [...] "memorable melodies or fully realised songs". Dalton concluded that the work was [...] "not wholly successful, perhaps, but still an alluringly barmy and glamorous affair", and a [...] "fascinating folly from two enduringly inventive oddballs".|$|E
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not there, stupid!" [...] said she. [...] "Over by the Park railings. Where {{the crowd}} is. Oh no, it's not an accident, it's <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at! What's them lights?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was not. The fishermen, {{who were}} used to such things, did not think much of it; but I am glad to have been out on such a night, if only for the {{magnificent}} sensation it gives to realize one's own powerlessness and His might. As for the rock, there was <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> one's footing, and cling on; no time to think.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That ghost {{must have}} been <b>something</b> awful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at," [...] was Shep's remark, {{as he and his}} chums rowed back to camp. [...] "If ever a crowd was scared they were." ...|$|R
2500|$|Among the lesser-known {{facets of}} Hundertwasser's {{personality}} is {{his commitment to}} constitutional monarchy: Austria needs <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up to, consisting of perennial higher valuesof which one now hardly dares to speaksuch as beauty, culture, internal and external peace, faith, richness of heart [...] Austria needs an emperor, who is subservient to the people. A superior and radiant figure in whom everyone has confidence, because this great figure is a possession of all. [...] The rationalist way of thinking has brought us, in this century, an ephemeral higher, American standard of living {{at the expense of}} nature and creation, which is now coming to an end, for it is destroying our heart, our quality of life, our longing, without which an Austrian does not want to live. It is outrageous that Austria has an emperor who did no evil to anyone but is still treated like a leper. Austria needs a crown! Long live Austria! Long live the constitutional monarchy! Long live Otto von Habsburg!- Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Für die Wiederkehr der konstitutionellen Monarchie (For the Return of the Constitutional Monarchy).Kaurinui, New Zealand, 28 March 1983; [...] dedicated, on 14 May 1987, to Otto von Habsburg for his 75th birthday.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 December Satono Diamond was matched against older {{opposition}} {{when he was}} one {{of sixteen}} horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama. He was made the 2.6/1 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Kitasan Black and the 2015 winner Gold Actor. The other runners included Sounds of Earth (second in 2015), Cheval Grand (Hanshin Daishoten, Copa Republica Argentina), Marialite (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Takarazuka Kinen) and Mikki Queen (Yushun Himba, Shuka Sho). Satono Diamond raced in mid-division on the outside as the Maltese Apogee set the pace from Kitasan Black. He moved up to third place entering the straight before producing a late burst of acceleration to overtake Kitasan Black well inside the last 100 metres and win by a neck with Gold Actor half a length away in third place. Lemaire said [...] "He is such an easy ride. He makes my job so easy. He was a little slow to react on the last turn. But he was so strong in front of goal. He has such a big heart", whilst Ikee commented [...] "It’s a huge relief. He’ll be able to take it up a notch or two next season. He should really come into his own by the fall. He just beat the best horses in all of Japan as a 3-year-old, which is great and gives us <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to next year." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was gaining}} something, <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to. Colonel Brandon {{must have some}} {{information}} to give.|$|E
60|$|Grace grew calmer, but {{she clung}} with strange {{weakness}} to her lover. She {{felt he had}} saved her from something, {{she did not know}} what, but it was <b>something</b> terrifying <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back upon.|$|R
60|$|He murmured <b>something</b> about liking <b>to</b> <b>look</b> tidy, {{and then}} remarked that she seemed rather finely dressed herself.|$|R
60|$|Florence felt, {{more than}} ever, {{that there was}} <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come; and <b>looked</b> earnestly for it. So earnestly, that Cousin Feenix answered, {{as if she had}} spoken.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're after {{something}} definite this trip," [...] he said. [...] "We've got <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{forward to}} specially if that Sid Merrick starts a rival hunt." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Catherine {{thought to}} herself, 'If I say a happy youth, then I {{shall have to}} suffer {{all the rest of}} my life. No, I would bear trouble now, and have <b>something</b> better <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to.' So she looked up and replied, 'Give me a happy old age.' ...|$|R
60|$|But since Mamma Tone {{had gone}} away the old life had lost its charm and become dull and stupid. Lory was not sure she could be happier elsewhere, but her crushed and dispirited nature responded to the {{suggestion}} of change.

6000|$|... "Very good. Go and get <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat. You <b>look</b> fagged. And tell Hyson {{to bring}} up some liqueurs, will you! I shall be engaged for a short time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{have always}} some of 'em to look up, or <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after. But I like business,' said Pancks, {{getting on a}} little faster. 'What's a man made for?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, ha!" [...] she laughed, [...] "now I have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to, I shall heed {{little when}} the dame flouts me and scolds me, and Joan twits {{me with her}} cousin the 'prentice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come along then. Ah! you {{may well}} look at him.' He {{happened}} to have turned his eyes towards the offender whom Mr Meagles had so angrily collared. 'He's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, that fellow is.' ...|$|E

60|$|Karain {{seemed to}} take no notice of us, but when Hollis threw open {{the lid of the}} box his eyes flew to it--and so did ours. The quilted crimson satin of the inside put a violent patch of colour into the sombre atmosphere; it was <b>something</b> {{positive}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at--it was fascinating.|$|R
6000|$|Another {{turn in the}} road, and Mr Sudberry met a drove of shaggy cattle, each cow {{of which}} looked sturdy and fierce enough for any {{ordinary}} bull; while the bull himself was <b>something</b> awful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon. There is nothing ladylike or at all feminine in the aspect of a Highland cow! ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{held out}} his hand. Romayne refused to let him go. [...] "Penrose!" [...] he said, [...] "I can't match your resignation. Give me <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to. I must and will see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go away," [...] almost {{shouted the}} aged patient; [...] "I have crushed my finger in a door, {{and it hurts}} most confoundedly. You are <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at in this hole, and {{distract}} my attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mother," [...] George said. [...] "It will be comfort {{indeed to}} have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to. Nothing can comfort me much to-day; but if {{anything}} could {{it would be}} some such plan as that." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{the older}} man stood about and vainly tried to impress people who came in and asked {{questions}} which invariably had {{to be referred to}} his repair boy, the precocious expert stripped the wheel down <b>to</b> <b>something</b> that <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Claire distressingly like an empty milk-pan. Then the boy didn't seem to know exactly what to do. He scratched his ear a good deal, and thought deeply. The older man could only scratch.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have tricked them nicely, dear boy," [...] he said; [...] "we {{are safe}} now. Long {{before they can}} lower a boat and get here we shall be safe in shelter, and our five Glasgow bodies will have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for us here." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{explained}} {{that her husband}} was a curate, a good deal older than herself, who had difficulty in getting permanent work since vicars wanted young men to assist them; he earned a little now and then by doing locums when someone took a holiday or fell ill, and a charitable institution gave them a small pension; but her life was lonely, it would be <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after a child, and the few shillings a week paid for it would help her to keep things going. She promised that it should be well fed.|$|R
