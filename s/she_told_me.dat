During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi had told her that he wanted to sleep for {{a day and a half}} before he went to America. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he did not intend to kill himself." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah my mama <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> don't worry about your size / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by, {{it would seem that}} the message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one". However, O'Niell went on to highlight that the lyrics [...] "have outraged some listeners, with YouTube comments criticizing Trainor for her 'thinly veiled hypocrisy'".|$|E
500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she {{performed}} [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, {{while she was}} also interviewed on the program. Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{she had never been}} that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At the end of the performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|On 19 December David Smith, then 38, also {{returned}} to the moor. He spent about four hours helping police pinpoint areas where he thought more bodies might be buried. Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in which, I believe, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> just as much as she wanted me to know, and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, in the bathroom and even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen". Topping concluded that he felt he [...] "had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession".|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was all true." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E

It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself.

2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill.

This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend!

He is a very exploitative man." [...] Thomson said she showed herself in a manner to gain the largest amount of attention or sympathy, avoided reality and created a fantasy world : [...] "Now it makes me question a lot of things <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about her past." [...] In June 2007, Vine said that the marriage was consummated in 2001, {{a few weeks after the}} ceremony—"I owed him that"—and Thomson then paid off her debts of £20,000, after which [...] "I've never seen him again." ...|$|E
