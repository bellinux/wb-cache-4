40|$|The {{need for}} post-CMOS {{nanoelectronics}} {{has led to}} the investigation of innovative device structures and materials. Graphene, a zero bandgap semiconductor with ballistic transport properties, has great potential to extend diversification and miniaturization beyond the limits of CMOS. The goal of this work is to study the growth of graphene on SiC using the novel method of selective graphitization. The major contributions of this research are as follows - First, epitaxial graphene is successfully grown on selected regions of SiC not capped by AlN deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. This contribution enables the formation of electronic-grade graphene in desired patterns without having to etch the graphene or expose it to any detrimental contact with external chemicals. Etching of AlN opens up windows to the SiC in desirable patterns for subsequent graphitization without leaving etch-residues (determined by XPS). Second, the impact of process parameters on the growth of graphene is investigated. Temperature, time, and argon pressure are the primary growth-conditions altered. A temperature of 1400 oC in 1 mbar argon for 20 min produced the most optimal graphene growth without significant damage to the AlN capping-layer. Third, first-ever electronic transport measurements are achieved on the <b>selective</b> <b>epitaxial</b> graphene. Hall mobility of about 1550 cm 2 /Vs has been obtained to date. Finally, the critical limitations of the <b>selective</b> <b>epitaxial</b> graphene <b>growth</b> are enumerated. The advent of enhanced processing techniques that will overcome these limitations will create a multitude of opportunities for applications for graphene grown in this manner.

40|$|This work {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} device structures and fabrication routes required for the realisation of lateral SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). After a comprehensive study of BJT and HBT device technologies our own designs of lateral SiGe HBT are introduced. The first design investigated is a device proposed in earlier work that utilises "SOI cavities" and confined <b>selective</b> <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth.</b> Process and device characteristic simulations were performed for devices of modest lithographic mode and thick SOI suggested the device would be reach typical SiGe Hbt performance levels with a cut off frequency (fT) of 15 - 22 GHz, common emitter gain of 58 - 92 and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 14 GHz. The fabrication {{of the types of}} lateral HBT that been have explored require detailed understanding and control of <b>selective</b> <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> and etching techniques and each of these two important processes have been developed. Selective epitaxy growths on different crystallographic planes and seed window alignments have been carried out, and, as would be expected, <b>selective</b> <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> rate are seen to vary for each crystal plane. These different growth rates lead to different facet formations on lateral growth fronts that can inhibit lateral growth rates and thereby prevent the formation of suitable structures for HBT design. A mathematical model is developed that enables a prediction of these growth phenomena. The epitaxy and etching development studies have allowed us to propose a new design of lateral SiGe HBT, based on non-selective growth on SOI sidewalls. Simulations of this new design indicate high-speed performance with fT /fmax of 395 / 983 GHz and 1. 58 ps ECL delay time on the 0. 13 mm lithographic node at collector currents of ~ 8 mA and a common emitter gain around 600.
