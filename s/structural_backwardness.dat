40|$|The {{outbreak}} of the recent crisis that began {{at the end of}} the last decade eventually uncovered the problems that almost all Western economies had been able to camouflage thanks to economic growth fueled by an unprecedented expansion in the financial industry. Within this context the Italian economy is a special case: its annual growth rate has been lower than that of its traditional partners and competitors for the last 15 years. Even the most optimistic forecasts for the next several years do not indicate significant improvements in the Italian competitive position. The success it enjoyed following its participation in the European Monetary Union brought to the fore the <b>structural</b> <b>backwardness</b> of the Italian economy, which is the main reason behind its low growth rates. The complexity and costs investors face when starting a business, the complexity and inefficiency of the fiscal, credit, and the legal systems, the difficulties associated with investor protection are only some of the obstacles that entrepreneurs face at the time of investing in Italy. More recently, we need to add a new weakness, that – until a few years ago – was considered a key factor in its success, i. e., the size of Italian firms...|$|E
40|$|The {{restructuring}} {{of the economy and}} transition to a market economy have had different impacts on the economic position of regions. The level of impact that changed economic and socio-political circumstances caused in the individual regions depended on various factors: the economic structure of the regions, their ability to reroute onto foreign markets, development potentials, development strategies, and their strategic decisions. Development problems are distinctive predominantly in areas suffering from <b>structural</b> <b>backwardness</b> and economic weakness with predominantly rural orientation, areas facing demographic problems, low income per inhabitant and high unemployment rate. The peripheral nature of the underdeveloped areas caused the emptying of the countryside and concentrating of the population in urban centers. Unfavorable demographic picture, emigration of the young, poor educational structure and shortage of adequate staff, and absence of strategic decisions had led to an increasing setback of the underdeveloped regions compared to the developed ones. The results of empirical analyses of division NUTS 3 regions in Slovenia into groups, taking into account the selected development indicators, lead to the conclusion that economic development has not been conducted in the context of modern understanding of balanced regional development and in accordance with the principle of integrity of implementing regional policy in the entire state territory. The existing regional developmental differences confirm the thesis that market mechanism on its own will not reduce economic inequality and substantiate the need for efficient conduct of regional policy...|$|E
40|$|The present {{stage of}} the {{development}} of agrarian and industrial complex of Russia is characterized by activization of processes of intereconomic cooperation, vertical integration, promoting structural reorganization of agrofood subcomplexes, transformation of the exchange and distributive relations, activization of investment processes and innovative modernization of production and technological base of agro-industrial production. In the conditions of preservation of disparity of the prices of an agricultural and industrial output, structural disproportions in a level of development of branches of agrarian and industrial complex, an unstable financial position of many agricultural producers, growth of cost of credit resources of the most demanded strategy of the integrated growth is. Vertical integration acts as a way of structural modernization of agrarian and industrial complex meso - level due to creation of associations which participants form a complete production and cost chain. Formation of the vertically integrated business groups in agrarian and industrial complex of Russia promotes consolidation of the capital, considerable reduction of level of transaction expenses, growth of controllability of the relations of an interindustry exchange and distribution, and respectively and to growth of competitiveness of subjects of agrobusiness, the enterprises of the food industry.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade all {{industrial}} countries attracted sizeable inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), excluding Italy and Japan: this fact has been interpreted as evidencing a deterioration in ItalyÂ’s structural competitiveness. This paper {{presents the results of}} a survey conducted by the Bank of Italy through its net of foreign representative offices, aimed at identifying the main factors that influenced the countryÂ’s attractiveness of FDI in the most recent years. The first section contains a brief survey of the literature on factors of attraction and obstacles to FDI. ItalyÂ’s position vis-Ã -vis other advanced countries is examined in the light {{of a wide variety of}} indicators: these latter include macroeconomic, qualitative and structural variables gathered from various sources (as well as other indicators expressly built for this paper), which are meant to outline circumstances relevant to different FDI strategies (Â“horizontalÂ”, Â“verticalÂ”, and Â“regionalÂ”). Italy enjoys two major Â“localization advantagesÂ”, namely, (1) a large, although somewhat stagnant domestic market, and (2) low unit labor costs, comparable to those prevailing in other Â“peripheralÂ” European countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece. In the backdrop of a general improvement of ItalyÂ’s qualitative and institutional indicators in recent years, one of the major obstacles to FDI in Italy pertains to the continuing low quality of its transport and product distribution infrastructuresÂ–a circumstance that cannot alone explain the very low level of FDI inflows. Another major impediment is represented by the dominance of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the Italian industry. On the one hand, this dimensional factor has been associated with the diffusion of ownership structures hostile to foreign mergers and acquisitions (M&A, the prevailing type of FDI in recent years); on the other hand, it may have clashed with the preferences of international investors, which are skewed towards the acquisition of medium- and large-sized enterprises. In either way, this circumstance may have strengthened the negative effects of Â“environmental barriersÂ” that remain elevated anyhow in our country. The results of the survey are presented in the second section. The survey confirms some of the countryÂ’s improvements mentioned earlier; however, it also confirms the perception, on the part of foreign investors, of continuing institutional and <b>structural</b> <b>backwardness,</b> as well as the importance attached by these investors to such factors while formulating their investment plans. investimenti diretti e loro determinanti, fusioni e acquisizioni internazionali, competitivita' strutturale...|$|E
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} potential for foreign trade {{in five of the}} ten Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) {{with the help of a}} foreign trade model. The main exogenous variables in this model are the size of the countries (sum of GDP of a pair of trading partners as well as the GDP ratio) and each country's factor endowment (population, capital), a geographical component (distance between the economic centers of two trading partners as an approximation to transportation costs in foreign trade), and various other variables which reflect trade preferences between the countries (common language and common border). The approach which was chosen for the specification of the model allows the identification of country-specific deviations from the average export relations in intra-EU trade and in trade between the EU and the five Central and Eastern European countries. The question is raised in this article whether the <b>structural</b> <b>backwardness</b> (small degree of openness toward the EU) of the five Central and East European countries (qua exporters to the EU and importers from the EU) will be gradually reduced by the process of accession itself. In order to evaluate the effects of a ceteris paribus reduction in these deviations, the simulations were based on the assumptions that the structural divergences of the CEECs would be completely eliminated by the hypothetical time of accession (2004 for Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia, and 2010 for Slovakia). The average annual growth rates predicted by the model for bilateral trade flows between Austria and the five CEECs are very high (between 14. 4 and 13. 2 percent), but they do not deviate in a striking way from the growth rates of Austria's nominal exports to these countries actually observed during the 1990 s: Poland 15 percent (1993 - 1997), Hungary 19 percent (1989 - 1997), the Czech Republic 17 percent (1993 - 1997), Slovakia 24 percent (1993 - 1997), and Slovenia 18 percent (1992 - 1997). Even though the structural weaknesses of the CEECs will probably be eliminated over a long time period, it should be emphasized that the growth rates recorded for trade with the CEECs indicate that structural change is already under way; this process is likely to continue and is being facilitated by the so-called Europe agreements (reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade, support for infrastructure investment, inflow of direct foreign investment, concomitant transfer of know-how, etc.) and the current accession negotiations.

40|$|The {{economic}} structure {{and rates of}} growth across the states in India are markedly different, with significant disparities in income per capita growth as well as sector-specific performance. The high-income states have typically led the Indian growth story with their high growth rates, while regional inequality continues to increase. The recent policy focus in India has been to encourage inclusive growth across sectors and disparate regions within the country through development of core public services (water, education, transport, healthcare, etc), especially in the poor and special status states. To understand the structural challenges facing India, {{it is important to}} understand which economic sectors have been the most critical in driving regional inequality over the years and how these sectors impact economic growth. Given the new thrust in developmental capital expenditure in the special states (with special economic incentives to help enhance economic growth) and poorer states to boost economic well-being, it is pertinent to evaluate whether such public expenditure has helped alleviating inequality and triggered structural change. We use income and disaggregated sector-specific output data of 31 Indian states and union territories to examine the structural change experienced over the last three decades from 1980 through 2008. Considering the major regime shift implemented in India through economic reforms of deregulation and liberalization during the early- 1990 s, we also determine how this impacted the structural performance and regional disparity in the country. We examine these relationships in an augmented Chenery-Syrquin model, and test whether the state capital and development expenditure has had structural impact and whether it has lowered regional inequality. We find at the macro level, India experienced higher economic growth with increasing inequality in both the agricultural and the manufacturing sector during 1980 - 2008, however, as the disaggregated regional growth analysis reveals, at the micro-level, the states with higher agricultural and manufacturing orientation enjoyed higher average economic growth. The high growth states also gained in the post-reform period, indicating that laggard states have lost out even on the trade front due to their <b>structural</b> <b>backwardness.</b> Our estimated Chenery model indicates that liberalization has had significant positive impact on services share in state output, but no significant manufacturing orientation. Moreover, state capital/ development expenditure has also had no significant effect on the manufacturing –orientation of the states, and indeed inequality has further increased for the special states. The special states have increased their service-orientation even as their manufacturing share significantly declined in the last two decades. We conclude that although the state development expenditure can play a critical role in reducing regional disparity, the special status poorer states have failed to utilize state development investment to trigger structural economic change and reduce regional inequality. ...|$|E
