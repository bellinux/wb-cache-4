5|$|The Central African Republic is {{a former}} French colony of {{approximately}} 5 million people situated {{in the heart of}} Africa. The nation borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo for most of its southern border, the coastal nation of Cameroon to its west, South Sudan to its east, and Chad to its north. The nation declared its independence from France in 1960. Some eight years after its independence at the Mexico City 1968 Summer Olympics, the first Central African delegation debuted in the Olympic games. It sent a single male athlete to participate at those games, and did not send another delegation again for another three Olympics. The nation returned at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and <b>sent</b> <b>its</b> largest delegations (15 athletes) at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and <b>sent</b> <b>its</b> first female athletes to the Barcelona games.

Scouting is represented in Madagascar by its own local federation of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was {{the manner}} in which it led to the emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia <b>sent</b> <b>its</b> own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began to take a more assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E

5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories {{in the first three}} months of 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya <b>sent</b> <b>its</b> own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E

5|$|The Ljubija miners were {{on strike}} between 2August and 8September 1940. Some {{of the leaders}} of the strike were members of a secret KPJ cell in Ljubija, which was formed in January 1940. The KPJ had been outlawed in Yugoslavia since 1921. The KPJ {{organisation}} of Banja Luka <b>sent</b> <b>its</b> experienced member Branko Babič to help the strike leaders. According to Babič, a communist from Prijedor introduced him to Stojanović at the beginning of September 1940. Babič stayed for several days at the doctor's house, running the strike. Seeing Stojanović as a communist sympathiser, Babič proposed that he join the KPJ. Stojanović at first declined, saying that he still had bourgeois habits, though he had read much of the Marxist literature. After further conversations with Babič, Stojanović agreed to become a member of the party.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Civil War, fought between 1936–39, {{provided}} an opportunity for many European countries to evaluate new technologies and tactics, including armored warfare.

Italy began supplying Nationalist Spain with L3/35 tankettes in August 1936. The Soviet Union soon followed suit by supplying the Popular Front with T-26 light tanks in October 1936. Germany <b>sent</b> <b>its</b> first shipments of Panzer I light tanks to the Nationalist Front in September 1936. During the war, France and Poland provided the Popular Front with a number of additional FT light tanks. A considerable number of tanks delivered to the Popular Front were subsequently captured; many of these were put into service against their former owners.|$|E
