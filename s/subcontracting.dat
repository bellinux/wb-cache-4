In Dallas, he designed aircraft missile models and founded Gulf Industries, a Grand Prairie-based model <b>subcontracting</b> firm. Pezzullo died on May 16, 1990, of cancer.

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered <b>subcontracting,</b> and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the progress of}} the Photovoltaic (PV) <b>Subcontract</b> Program of the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) from October 1, 1989 through September 30, 1990. The PV <b>Subcontract</b> Program is responsible for managing the <b>subcontracted</b> portion of SERI's PV Advanced Research and Development Project. In fiscal year 1990, this included more than 54 <b>subcontracts</b> with a total annualized funding of approximately $ 11. 9 million. Approximately two-thirds of the <b>subcontracts</b> were with universities at a total funding of nearly $ 3. 3 million. The six technical sections of the report cover the main areas of the <b>subcontract</b> program: the Amorphous Silicon Research Project, Polycrystalline Thin Films, Crystalline Silicon Materials Research, High-Efficiency Concepts, the New Ideas Program, and the University Participation Program. Technical summaries of each of the <b>subcontracted</b> programs provide a discussion of approaches, major accomplishments in FY 1990, and future research directions.

25|$|Many {{workplaces}} {{through history}} have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; {{but the concept}} of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the sweater, directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms sweater for the middleman and sweat system for the process of <b>subcontracting</b> piecework were used in early critiques like Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty, written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the sweating system, a system of <b>subcontracting</b> in the tailoring trade were called sweatshops and might contain only a few workers or as many as 100 and more.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} observed in practices that prime contractors solicit <b>subcontract</b> bids, prior to submitting their bids in procurement auctions: the auctioneers in <b>subcontract</b> auctions will become bidders in a procurement auction.

We presented a simple model of such <b>subcontract</b> auctions and conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the bidding behavior derived theoretically. We observed that in the <b>subcontract</b> auction, (1) subjects bid following the equilibrium bidding function derived theoretically, (2) the revenue equivalence between first-price and second-price mechanisms breaks down, and (3) the first-price mechanism more likely achieves ex post efficient allocations than the second-price mechanism. ...|$|R

25|$|According to Christopher B. Doob, {{outsourcing}} is companies' <b>subcontracting</b> {{of services}} to other companies instead of continuing to provide those services themselves. This takes away from jobs offered in the United States and {{makes it more difficult}} to maintain and get jobs. Outsourcing raises the unemployment rate, and while outsourcing has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, data on the subject is limited by the power elite. Companies like Apple and Nike outsource jobs overseas so they can have cheaper labor to make their products and keep from raising prices in the States.|$|E

The manufacturers signaled their willingness to talk on May 26, but the union kept up its demand for the 40-hour week. A mediator was called in, and a new contract reached on June 11, 1926. The contract provided for the 40-hour, five-day work week; an end to overtime from December through August; time-and-a-half overtime pay for half-days from September to November; a 10 percent wage increase; 10 paid holidays; and a ban on <b>subcontracting.</b>|$|E
25|$|During his tenure, Liu's {{ministry}} {{was criticized}} for its illegitimate business interests and relationships with large companies, its inability to improve conditions for migrant workers during the Chinese New Year travel season, its slow response to widespread winter storms in 2008, and its failures to prevent the 2008 train collision in Shandong and a smaller collision in Hunan a year later.

The union then struck a number of manufacturers to bar the <b>subcontracting</b> of work to non-union or cut rate contractors in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

40|$|To {{supplement}} {{its health}} physics staff, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Brookhaven) <b>subcontracted</b> with a support service business (the subcontractor) {{to obtain the}} services of health physics technicians. During the pefiormance of these <b>subcontracts,</b> certain issues arose concerning per diem payments to the subcontractor for local technicians. The objective of this audit {{was to determine whether}} Brookhaven fi. dly etiorced the terms and conditions of its <b>subcontracts</b> for health physics technicians. Brookhaven had not fully enforced the terms of its <b>subcontracts,</b> and as a result, Brookhaven and the Department paid about $ 288, 000 more than necessary for health physics technicians. For example, Brookhaven reimbursed the subcontractor for per diem on days when work was not performed and when the subcontractor did not pay subsistence expenses to its technicians. Brookhaven also increased the subcontracts' fixed reimbursement rates without adequate justification and reimbursed the subcontractor for overtime even though the <b>subcontract</b> did not provide for an overtime reimbursement rate. We recommend that the Manager, Chicago Operations Office, recover the unreasonable costs identified in the audit and require Brookhaven to strengthen its <b>subcontract</b> administration practices. Management agreed in principle with the audit finding and recommendations. However, management - stated that additional time was needed to further examine the issues...|$|R

25|$|The {{argument}} {{supporting the}} need for the GPFs were based on Canadian foreign policy at the time. Canada's destroyers had been the first Canadian military units deployed to the Korean War in 1950 and the Royal Canadian Navy had carried a Canadian battalion to Egypt following the Suez Crisis. It was argued that a GPF should then be capable of being deployed on United Nations missions. The Conservative government also sought to support the Canadian shipbuilding industry, with a plan to build the eight planned frigates in several yards with <b>subcontracting</b> to Canadian businesses. This was done partially for political expediency and because by 1961, the Canadian shipbuilding industry was in need of work following the collapse of the Canadian merchant shipping fleet in the 1950s.|$|E

Construction proper on the section from Kongsvinger to Flisa commenced on 16 September 1891, led by Alfred Kielland. The work was split in two sections. The southern subcontracted the groundwork to P. T. Melby and S. Sørensen, while the railway did this itself on the northern part. The permanent way was built by the railway for the entire line.
