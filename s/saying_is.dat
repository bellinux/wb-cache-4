5|$|When {{you think}} about Goya, who painted the most horrendous {{pictures}} of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's <b>saying</b> <b>is,</b> 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that it is not through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E
25|$|What ontological hermeneutics is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> {{here that}} the {{therapist}} strives to avoid an attitude of “expert” or “specialist” on human suffering and healing. Even though many mainstream counseling theories assume such roles, the position of ontological hermeneutics is that such roles create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client and should therefore be avoided. In fact, hermeneutic theory states that such positions are nonexistent. Therefore, therapist does not intervene with objective truths that are intended to disprove the client’s previously perpetuated ways of thinking and feeling. Fusing horizons “is, instead, a matter of integrating another’s horizon {{in such a way}} that the one’s own outlook is changed in the process”) so that both therapist and client are thus both authentically benefited. And, ontological hermeneutics holds that this process is only possible via authentic dialogue during which both therapist and client utilize their memory and imagination to develop therapeutic possibilities. Furthermore, through this process, empathy is seen as a deeper phenomenon (intropathy) for relating to others; the entire process being what may be referred to as empathic envisioning, and compels therapists to become subjective in their value-laden conversations.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Fowler (1869) {{states the}} paradox as follows: [...] "Epimenides the Cretan says, 'that all the Cretans are liars,' but Epimenides is himself a Cretan; {{therefore}} he is himself a liar. But if he be a liar, what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> true; <b>saying</b> the Cretans <b>are</b> liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, {{and what he}} <b>says</b> <b>is</b> untrue.

500|$|Prior to 1994 {{other terms}} for the {{suspected}} psychological effect were used sporadically. Onomastic determinism {{was used as}} early as 1970 by Roberta Frank.

Outside of science, cognomen syndrome was used by playwright Tom Stoppard in his 1972 play Jumpers.

500|$|English statesmen William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester {{had worked}} to obtain Darnley's licence {{to travel to}} Scotland {{from his home in}} England. Although her advisors had thus brought the couple together, Elizabeth felt {{threatened}} by the marriage, because as descendants of her aunt, both Mary and Darnley were claimants to the English throne and their children, if any, would inherit an even stronger, combined claim. However, Mary's insistence on the marriage seems to have stemmed from passion rather than calculation. The English ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton stated [...] "the <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> that surely she [...] is bewitched", adding that the marriage could only be averted [...] "by violence". The union infuriated Elizabeth, who felt the marriage should not have gone ahead without her permission, as Darnley was both her cousin and an English subject.|$|E

500|$|The {{connection}} between Calvert's resignation and his conversion to Roman Catholicism was a complex one. George Cottington, {{a former employee}} of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert's conversion had been in progress {{a long time before}} it was made public.
