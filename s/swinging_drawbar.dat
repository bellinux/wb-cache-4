50|$|Until the 1940s, plows {{and other}} tillage {{equipment}} usually {{were connected to}} the tractor via a drawbar. The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast {{as part of the}} rear transmission housing) to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by a loop and clevis. The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis. If the tractor was equipped with a <b>swinging</b> <b>drawbar,</b> then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.|$|E
50|$|However, a {{major power}} {{shortage}} occurred in 2002 across the Brazilian narrow-gauge systems. As new locomotives {{would be too}} expensive for many railways, or would take to long to be delivered for others, the solution was to buy second-hand standard gauge locomotives and fit them with new metre gauge bogies. The number of axles was increased due to limitations with tractive effort output from the smaller metre-gauge traction motors. The dual-truck axle conversion was fairly expensive, so not all railways could afford it; some, such as ALL (América Latina Logística) retained the original trucks, narrowing them to fit the new gauge and fitting smaller traction motors. Additional issues arose with the extra axles, primarily due to the increased length of locomotives creating excessive <b>drawbar</b> <b>swing,</b> causing some derailments on tighter curves.|$|R
