5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or <b>spermatogonia,</b> which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as <b>spermatogonia)</b> and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Spermatogenesis {{continues}} after birth. In the 3rd to 5th months of life, {{some of the}} fetal <b>spermatogonia</b> residing along the basement membrane become type A <b>spermatogonia.</b> More gradually, other fetal <b>spermatogonia</b> become type B <b>spermatogonia</b> and primary spermatocytes by the 5th year after birth. Spermatogenesis arrests at this stage until puberty.|$|E
25|$|Each cell {{division}} from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected {{to one another}} by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. It {{should also be noted}} that not all <b>spermatogonia</b> divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of <b>spermatogonia</b> would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of <b>spermatogonia</b> to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|These choanoflagellates {{are capable}} of forming colonies via fine {{intercellular}} bridges that allow the individual cells to attach. These bridges resemble ring canals that link developing <b>spermatogonia</b> or oogonia in animals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} seminiferous epithelium, studies by Leblond and Yves Clermont {{in the early}} 1950s had deciphered how <b>spermatogonia</b> gave rise to spermatocytes, which then {{differentiated}} into mature sperm cells in a specific cycle.|$|E
25|$|Most normal-appearing undescended testes {{are also}} normal by {{microscopic}} examination, but reduced <b>spermatogonia</b> can be found. The tissue in undescended testes becomes more markedly abnormal ("degenerates") in microscopic appearance between 2 and 4 years after birth. There {{is some evidence}} that early orchiopexy reduces this degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called <b>spermatogonia</b> divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside a Fallopian tube or the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{necessary}} for normal sperm development. It activates genes in Sertoli cells, which promote differentiation of <b>spermatogonia.</b> It regulates acute HPA (Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis) response under dominance challenge. Androgen including testosterone enhances muscle growth. Testosterone also regulates the population of thromboxane A2 receptors on megakaryocytes and platelets and hence platelet aggregation in humans.|$|E
25|$|Large {{molecules}} cannot {{pass from}} the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due {{to the presence of}} tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. The <b>spermatogonia</b> are in the basal compartment (deep {{to the level of the}} tight junctions) and the more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids are in the adluminal compartment.|$|E
25|$|The {{fertility}} reduction after orchiopexy for bilateral cryptorchidism is more marked, about 38%, or 6 {{times that}} of the general population. The basis for the universal recommendation for early surgery is research showing degeneration of spermatogenic tissue and reduced <b>spermatogonia</b> counts after the second year of life in undescended testes. The degree to which this is prevented or improved by early orchiopexy is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Investigation {{into the}} human {{karyotype}} took many years to settle the most basic question: How many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in <b>spermatogonia</b> and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man is 46 or 48, at first favouring 46. He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an XX/XY system.|$|E
25|$|The testes {{begin as}} an {{immigration}} of primordial germ cells into testicular cords along the gonadal ridge in the abdomen {{of the early}} embryo. The interaction of several male genes organizes this developing gonad into a testis rather than an ovary by the second month of gestation. During the 3rd to 5th months, the cells in the testes differentiate into testosterone-producing Leydig cells, and anti-Müllerian hormone-producing Sertoli cells. The germ cells in this environment become fetal <b>spermatogonia.</b> Male external genitalia develop during the 3rd and 4th months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.|$|E
25|$|FSH stimulates {{both the}} {{production}} of androgen binding protein (ABP) by Sertoli cells, {{and the formation of}} the blood-testis barrier. ABP is essential to concentrating testosterone in levels high enough to initiate and maintain spermatogenesis. Intratesticular testosterone levels are 20–100 or 50–200 times higher than the concentration found in blood, although there is variation over a 5- to 10-fold range amongst healthy men. FSH may initiate the sequestering of testosterone in the testes, but once developed only testosterone is required to maintain spermatogenesis. However, increasing the levels of FSH will increase {{the production of}} spermatozoa by preventing the apoptosis of type A <b>spermatogonia.</b> The hormone inhibin acts to decrease the levels of FSH. Studies from rodent models suggest that gonadotropins (both LH and FSH) support the process of spermatogenesis by suppressing the proapoptotic signals and therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival.|$|E
25|$|The {{next stage}} took {{place after the}} {{development}} of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that the set of chromosomes (the karyotype) was the carrier of the genes. Levitsky {{seems to have been}} the first to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes, in contrast to their genic contents. Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in <b>spermatogonia</b> and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man was 46 or 48, at first favoring 46. He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on man having an XX/XY system. Considering their techniques, these results were quite remarkable.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} <b>spermatogonia</b> distribution, the {{structure}} of teleosts testes has two types: in the most common, <b>spermatogonia</b> occur all along the seminiferous tubules, while in [...] fish they are confined to the distal portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic spermatogenesis {{in relation to the}} release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules lumen.|$|E
2500|$|Here, {{germ cells}} develop into <b>spermatogonia,</b> spermatocytes, {{spermatids}} and spermatozoon {{through the process}} of spermatogenesis. The gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{maintain}} {{the population of}} <b>spermatogonia,</b> the seminiferous epithelium was shown to contain a population of stem cells which divided to produce differentiated cells {{as well as to}} {{maintain the}}ir own number. As noted in a seminal publication by Leblond, [...] "the reappearance at each cycle of a new dormant cell which acts as the stem cell of spermatocytes is described as the 'Stem Cell Renewal Theory'" [...] This article is the first one in which nests of cells dividing in an adult organ are designated as “stem cells”.|$|E
2500|$|Spermatogenesis [...] is {{the process}} in which an animal {{produces}} spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis. The initial cells in this pathway are called <b>spermatogonia,</b> which yield primary spermatocytes by mitosis. The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte [...] divides into two spermatids by Meiosis II. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Thus, the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two cells, the secondary spermatocytes, and the two secondary spermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or <b>spermatogonia,</b> which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis. The aedeagus can be quite pronounced or de minimis. The base of the aedeagus may be the partially sclerotized phallotheca, also called the ...|$|E
50|$|The {{second step}} {{involves}} {{the production of}} differentiating A1 <b>spermatogonia</b> from Apr or Aal <b>spermatogonia.</b> These A1 <b>spermatogonia</b> undergo a further five divisions to produce A2, A3, A4, intermediate and type B <b>spermatogonia,</b> which can enter meiosis I.|$|E
50|$|Ad <b>spermatogonia</b> are reserve stem cells. These {{cells are}} capable of {{dividing}} to produce more SSCs but usually do not. Ap <b>spermatogonia</b> are actively dividing to maintain the stem cell pool. B1-B4 <b>spermatogonia</b> encompass the differentiating <b>spermatogonia</b> and are no longer considered to be stem cells.|$|E
50|$|Spermatogenesis {{continues}} after birth. In the 3rd to 5th months of life, {{some of the}} fetal <b>spermatogonia</b> residing along the basement membrane become type A <b>spermatogonia.</b> More gradually, other fetal <b>spermatogonia</b> become type B <b>spermatogonia</b> and primary spermatocytes by the 5th year after birth. Spermatogenesis arrests at this stage until puberty.|$|E
50|$|Three {{functionally}} separate {{spermatogonial cell}} types are recognised {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the nuclei: type A dark <b>spermatogonia</b> (Ad), type A pale <b>spermatogonia</b> (Ap), and type B <b>spermatogonia</b> (B).|$|E
50|$|There are {{two primary}} {{differentiation}} stages, {{the first of}} which involves the transformation of As (single) <b>spermatogonia</b> into daughter progeny Apr (paired) <b>spermatogonia,</b> which are predestined to differentiate. These can divide further to create Aal (A-aligned) <b>spermatogonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|PAX7 {{may also}} {{function}} in the recovery in spermatogenesis. Unlike other <b>spermatogonia,</b> PAX7+ <b>spermatogonia</b> are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. The surviving PAX7+ <b>spermatogonia</b> are able to increase in number following these therapies and differentiate into the other forms of <b>spermatogonia</b> that did not survive. Additionally, mice lacking PAX7 had delayed recovery of spermatogenesis following exposure to busulfan when compared to control mice.|$|E
50|$|PAX7 {{functions}} as a marker for a rare subset of spermatogonial stem cells, specifically a sub set of Asingle <b>spermatogonia.</b> These PAX7+ <b>spermatogonia</b> are rare in adult testis but are much more prevalent in newborns, making up 28% of germ cells in neonate testis. Unlike PAX7+ muscle satellite cells, PAX7+ <b>spermatogonia</b> rapidly proliferate and are not quiescent. PAX7+ <b>spermatogonia</b> are able to give rise to all stages of spermatogenesis and produce motile sperm. However, PAX7 is not required for spermatogenesis, as mice without PAX7+ <b>spermatogonia</b> show no deficits in fertility.|$|E
50|$|Both As and Apr <b>spermatogonia</b> are undifferentiated. Chains {{of these}} cells form and are {{referred}} to as A Aligned (Aal). Aal <b>spermatogonia</b> differentiate and thus are no longer classed as stem cells. They go on to divide 6 times eventually forming B type <b>spermatogonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{spermatogonium}} (plural: <b>spermatogonia)</b> is an undifferentiated male germ cell. <b>Spermatogonia</b> undergo spermatogenesis to form mature spermatozoa in the {{seminiferous tubules}} of the testis.|$|E
50|$|A Single (As) <b>spermatogonia</b> {{are capable}} of {{creating}} 2 separate daughter SSCs when they divide or the daughter cells can join and form A Paired (Apr) <b>spermatogonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of <b>spermatogonia</b> is maintained by type Ad <b>spermatogonia.</b> These cells do not directly participate in producing sperm, instead serving {{to maintain the}} supply of stem cells for spermatogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Each cell {{division}} from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected {{to one another}} by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. It {{should also be noted}} that not all <b>spermatogonia</b> divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of <b>spermatogonia</b> would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of <b>spermatogonia</b> to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|During development, {{primordial}} {{germ cells}} migrate into the seminiferous tubules and downward towards the basement membrane whilst remaining {{attached to the}} sertoli cells where they will subsequently differentiate into SSCs, {{also referred to as}} Asingle <b>spermatogonia.</b> These SSCs can either self-renew or commit to differentiating into spermatozoa upon the proliferation of Asingle into Apaired <b>spermatogonia.</b> The 2 cells of Apaired <b>spermatogonia</b> remain attached by intercellular bridges and subsequently divide into Aaligned <b>spermatogonia,</b> which is made up of 4-16 connected cells. Aaligned <b>spermatogonia</b> then undergo meiosis I to form spermatocytes and meiosis II to form spermatids which will mature into spermatozoa. [...] This differentiation occurs along the longitudinal axis of sertoli cells, from the basement membrane to the apical lumen of the seminiferous tubules. However, sertoli cells form tight junctions that separate SSCs and <b>spermatogonia</b> in contact with the basement membrane from the spermatocytes and spermatids to create a basal and an adluminal compartment, whereby differentiating spermatocytes must traverse the tight junctions. These tight junctions form the blood testis barrier (BTB) and have been suggested {{to play a role in}} isolating differentiated cells in the adluminal compartment from secreted factors by the interstitial tissue and vasculature neighboring the basal compartment.|$|E
50|$|Plzf (Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger) {{has also}} been implicated in {{regulating}} SSC self-renewal and is expressed by Asingle, Apaired and Aaligned <b>spermatogonia.</b> Plzf directly inhibits the transcription of a receptor, c-kit, in these early <b>spermatogonia.</b> However, its absence in late <b>spermatogonia</b> permits c-kit expression, which is subsequently activated by its ligand SCF (stem cell factor) secreted by sertoli cells, resulting in further differentiation. Also, the addition of BMP4 and Activin-A have shown to reduce self-renewal of SSCs in culture and increase stem cell differentiation, with BMP4 shown to increase the expression of c-kit.|$|E
50|$|Spermatogonial {{stem cells}} (SSCs) are a subtype of {{undifferentiated}} <b>spermatogonia.</b>|$|E
