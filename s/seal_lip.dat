40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the shape optimization {{process for the}} automotive wheel bearing <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> using the finite {{element method and the}} response surface method. First, to predict performance of the bearing <b>seal</b> <b>lip,</b> we used the non-linear finite element analysis. And then, we compared the analysis results with the test results to verify the finite element model. The objective function in optimizing process was obtained from results of the mud slurry test, which is one of many tests for evaluating performance of wheel bearing. After the mud slurry test for the four models which have the similar cross-sectional shape, we measured the wear area of the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> and the moisture content in grease. The objective function has been chosen by comparing the results of mud slurry test and characteristics of <b>seal</b> <b>lip,</b> such as contact force, contact area, contact pressure, and interference.

40|$|The film {{formation}} in lip seals, {{due to the}} non-Newtonian rheology of the lubricant, has been a topic of speculation. Earlier work suggests that normal stresses in grease would be favorable for the film buildup between the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> and shaft or bearing ring. In the current article, we evaluate this earlier work and our earlier theoretical <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> model {{with a series of}} experiments. We use a modified concentric cylinder geometry and a model fluid to study the fluid pressure distribution in the seal-type geometry. The results are then related to grease-lubricated seals and our earlier theoretical predictions. The present analysis shows that this earlier work and our earlier predictions are not correct and indicate that normal stresses in the grease pull the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> toward the shaft, increasing the contact pressure. However, normal stresses also ensure the presence of grease on the shaft or bearing inner ring, which enhances replenishment of the sealing contact...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{approach for}} {{the selection and}} design of seals for helicopter transmissions is presented. There are two major types of seals presently being used and they are <b>lip</b> type <b>seals</b> and mechanical type <b>seals.</b> <b>Lip</b> type <b>seals</b> can be divided in conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> and hydrodynamic <b>lip</b> <b>seals.</b> Conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be used for}} slow-speed, low-pressure, low-temperature <b>sealing.</b> Hydrodynamic <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> although they are as pressure and temperature limited as conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals,</b> can operate at a higher speed. Mechanical types seals are comprised of face seals and circumferential seals. Face seals are capable of high speed, high pressure, and high temperature.

40|$|Purpose: We {{have been}} using myofunctional therapy in {{orthodontic}} treatment to improve orofacial disorders. Our previous study showed that lip training increased orbicularis oris muscle strength and endurance. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effectiveness of hypoxic lip training for improving lip incompetence. Subjects and methods: Twenty healthy subjects (10 males and 10 females, 23. 6 +/- 2. 3 years old) with lip incompetence participated in this study. We recorded the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratio calculated by using the formula "(lip-sealingtime/totalrecorded time) x 100 " during relaxation (listening to soothing music) and during concentration (performing a mathematical calculation). Then the subjects performed a standardized hypoxic lip training (5 repetitive contractions with 80 % of maximum tensile strength of the orbicularis oris muscle) with a traction plate. Training was repeated daily for 4 weeks. To estimate training effects, the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios during relaxation and concentration were recorded before training (T 1), at 2 weeks (T 2) and 4 weeks (T 3) after the start of training, and at 4 weeks (T 4) and 8 weeks (T 5) after the end of training. Results: The <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios in both the relaxation and concentration conditions significantly (p < 0. 003 after Bonferroni correction) increased during the training period. Although the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios slightly decreased during the post-training period, they were not significantly different from those at T 3. Conclusions: Hypoxic lip training increases the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratio and is thus effective for improving <b>lip</b> incompetence. <b>Sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios were maintained after 8 weeks of training.

40|$|In general, most {{analyses}} of radial lip seal behavior assume a statie deformation {{state in the}} <b>seal</b> <b>lip.</b> Nevertheless, a dynamic excitation of the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> always occurs in practice, due to unroundness of the shaft or motions of the shaft center. In this first part of a two part paper the influence of dynamic excitation on the occurrence of clearances in a dry seal-shaft contact is studied, taking into account viscoelasticity and inertia of the seal material. The {{ultimate goal is to}} determine whether viscoelastic seal behavior can result in a continuous fluid film or not. First, attention is paid to the mechanical behavior of synthetic rubber under an oscillating load. The seal elastomer shows a glass transition, resulting in a strong increase in stiffness with frequency. Next, a FEM analysis of the seal-shaft contact under dynamic conditions is presented. The Steady-state response of the seal is represented by a transfer function approach. It is shown that clearances develop due to viscous and inertial seal material behavior. In practice, these clearances are filled with fluid. Due to entrainment and squeeze effects a fluid film is generated. This phenomenon is designated viscoelastohydrodynamic (VEHD) lubrication, and is subject of Part 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear of unfilled and fiber-filled elastomers was studied both with experiments and with finite element simulations. Wear experiments with elastomer seals exhibited two distinct regimes: an initial, "break-in" period {{followed by an}} "aggressive wear" period. During the break-in period, few abrasive particles are able to penetrate the seal's contact band, and no substantial seal wear occurs. During the aggressive wear period, abrasive particles aggregate into distinct clusters which advance at a linear rate and abrasively wear the seal. Filled elastomer seals were shown to have break-in periods significantly longer than those of unfilled elastomer seals. The aggressive wear rates and mechanisms of filled and unfilled elastomer seals were determined to be virtually identical. Abrasion patterns typical of the {{abrasive wear}} of elastomers were observed. Micromechanical modeling of the abrasive wear of unfilled elastomers predicted {{the formation of the}} observed abrasion patterns. Modeling of fiber-filled elastomers indicated that fibers should have no effect on the aggressive wear process. Additional modeling of fiber-filled elastomers suggested several mechanisms by which the fibers might extend the break-in period of the seal. Seal wear experiments with well-defined slurries offered strong evidence that the fibers extend the break-in period of the seal by inhibiting particle ingestion and cluster formation. A <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> surface geometry is proposed to simulate the effect of the fibers. by Ethan M. Parsons. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 165 - 167). Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Sliding {{lip seals}} {{are used in}} {{pneumatic}} cylinders to prevent leakage past the piston and rod. Though they guarantee excellent sealing, the friction forces at contact between lip and counterpart can be relatively high. This results in energy losses and problems with wear on components in relative motion, as well as difficulties in controlling actuator positioning. Standards for compressed air cleanliness restrict the use of greases and lubricants, especially in applications such as the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. A number of studies are thus under way {{in order to find}} effective alternatives to the use of common lubricants. These studies address both seal configuration [1 - 4], and the use of innovative materials [5 - 7]. Other approaches employ systems permitting small amounts of air leakage that operate as lubricated supports, variable-profile pistons [8], or rings with special micromachined surfaces [9 - 10]. Such solutions are not always economical, both because they require precision tolerances and geometries, and because they use special seals, often produced ad hoc. This paper discusses the possibility of using commercial lip seals with a non-conventional mounting on the piston in order to obtain a simple controlled-leakage system that reduces friction forces in pneumatic cylinders economically and effectively. The non-conventional mounting consists of positioning the lip seal in the direction opposite to that used in a conventional installation, so that the contact pressure reduces as air pressure in the chamber rises. In this way, an air gap is created at the sliding interface which allows air in the pressurized chamber to escape past the <b>seal</b> <b>lip,</b> thus reducing the contact force on the barrel. The piston is provided with a hole which exhausts the leakage flow to the atmosphere. To evaluate the validity of this approach, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in [11] to measure flow rate on a type of spring-loaded lip seal consisting of graphite-filled PTFE for barrel diameters of 50 mm. In particular, the tests determined air leakage behavior for different mounting tolerances. This paper presents further tests conducted on the same samples examined in [11] and on another PTFE and graphite-filled PTFE configuration, measuring leakage flow rates and friction forces. Leakage flow rate measurements were carried out with single and double seal installations. The results obtained are discussed together with the advantages of the proposed solution compared to the conventional mountings in ordinary us...|$|E
40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contaminants outside the bearing system. These systems are often lubricated with grease; the grease {{acts as a}} lubricant for the bearing and seal and improves the sealing efficiency. In this thesis, the influence of lubricating grease on bearing seal performance is studied. Rheological properties of the grease, i. e. shear stress and normal stress difference, are evaluated and related to the lubricating and sealing performance of the sealing system. This includes the seal, grease and counterface. The grease velocity profile in the seal pocket in-between two sealing lips {{is dependent on the}} rheological properties of the grease. The velocity profile in a wide pocket is evaluated using a 1 -dimensional model based on the Herschel-Bulkley model. The velocity profile in a narrow pocket, where the influence of the side walls on the velocity profile is significant, is measured using micro particle image velocimetry. Subsequently, the radial migration of contaminants into the seal pocket is modelled and related to the sealing function of the grease. Additionally, also migration in the axial direction is found {{in the vicinity of the}} sealing contact. Experimental results show that contaminant particles in different greases consistently migrate either away from the sealing contact or towards the sealing contact, also when the pumping rate of the seal can be neglected. Lubrication of the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> contact is dependent on several grease properties. A lubricant film in the sealing contact may be built up as in oil lubricated seals but normal stress differences in the grease within the vicinity of the contact may result in an additional lift force. The grease, which is being sheared in the vicinity of the contact, will also contribute to the frictional torque. It is important to maintain a lubricant film in the sealing contact to minimize friction and wear. Here the replenishment of oil separated from the grease, also referred to as oil bleed, is of crucial importance. A model is presented to predict this oil bleed based on oil flow through the porous grease thickener microstructure. The model is applied to an axial sealing contact and a prediction of the film thickness as a function of time is made. The work presented in the thesis gives a significant contribution to a better understanding of the influence of lubricating grease on the sealing system performance and seal lubrication conditions.
