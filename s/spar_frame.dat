2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit <b>spar</b> <b>frame</b> with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|E

50|$|The VFR750F was {{the first}} of the 750 class to have an {{aluminium}} twin <b>spar</b> <b>frame,</b> weighing just 14 kg and the nearest thing on the road to the VFR, the GSX-R also had an aluminium frame but it was of a conventional twin cradle design.|$|E
50|$|The Pegasus was {{designed}} and built by Walter Schretzmann, who began its construction in April 1968. It first flew in November 1972. It is an all wood aircraft with wooden <b>spars,</b> <b>frames</b> and entirely plywood covered. All flying surfaces are cantilever structures, the wings low set. The latter have constant chord and carry flaps. The fin and rudder are swept, with a shallow dorsal fin.|$|R
50|$|The A 210 {{is entirely}} built from carbon and glass fibre {{reinforced}} plastics (CFRP and GFRP). CRFP {{is used for}} the more highly stressed members, <b>spars,</b> <b>frames</b> and stringers, GFRP for shells and control surfaces, the latter with GFRP/polyurethane sandwich construction. The low wing has straight tapered inboard sections with increasing sweep outboard and winglets at the tips on production examples. It has a laminar flow section and 4.5Â° of dihedral. The ailerons are balanced and the inboard single slotted Fowler flaps have two positions.|$|R
50|$|A {{hollow steel}} {{perimeter}} frame {{is used to}} reduce size and cost as well as improve comfort. Achieving the same strength with aluminum would require much larger <b>frame</b> <b>spars</b> making the <b>frame</b> much wider (and less comfortable). The hollow steel frame allows leg reliefs which are blended into {{the contours of the}} tank and bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The ZB50 was {{available}} in 1988 in the United States, Canada and western Europe. Only 3058 were produced for the US market as the bike proved too expensive to mass-produce. The ZB50 was offered as a street & trail alternative to the Z50R, which was geared more towards dirt track riders. The ZB50 {{is characterized by a}} perimeter twin <b>spar</b> <b>frame,</b> giving it the appearance of a miniature sportbike.|$|E
50|$|However, D'Ascanio {{fell out}} with Innocenti, {{who wanted to}} produce his frame from rolled tubing, rather than a stamped <b>spar</b> <b>frame,</b> thereby {{allowing}} him to revive both parts of his pre-war company. General D'Ascanio dissociated himself from Innocenti, and took his design directly to Enrico Piaggio, who produced the spar-framed Vespa from 1946. Innocenti, faced by design problems and production issues surrounding his tube frame, produced the Lambretta from 1947. In the decades of its history, the Vespa scooter {{has become one of}} the most famous brand designs worldwide, with 16 million units produced in 130 different models as of 2005.|$|E

D'Ascanio disassociated himself from Innocenti and took his design to Enrico Piaggio who produced the spar-framed Vespa from 1946 on. The final design of the Lambretta was done by aeronautical engineers Cesare Pallavicino and Pier Luigi Torre. Pallavicino had been Technical Director at the Caproni airplane factory during World War II before working on the Lambretta design. Torre was an engine designer at Italo Balbo's Idros; he designed the engine and organized Innocenti's factory for mass production.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{have been widely}} used as structural elements in aircraft structures due to their superior properties. Aircraft structure is a huge assembly of skins, <b>spars,</b> <b>frames</b> etc. The structure consists of an assembly of sub-structures properly arranged and connected to form a load transmission path. Such load transmission path is achieved using joints. Joints constitute the weakest zones in the structure. Failure may occur due to various reasons such as stress concentrations, excessive deflections etc. or a combination of these. Therefore, to utilize the full potential of composite materials, the strength and stress distribution in the joints has to be understood so that suitable configuration can be chosen for various applications. ...|$|R
2500|$|Later alloys, such as R.R.66, {{were used}} for sheet, where high {{strength}} was needed in an alloy capable of being worked [...] by deep drawing. This became increasingly important with the faster jet aircraft post-war, as issues such as transonic compressibility became important. It was now necessary for an aircraft's covering material to be strong, not merely the <b>spar</b> or <b>framing</b> beneath.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} of the cabin is a tapered section of simple {{semi-monocoque}} construction, which is closed by a robust hinged rear loading ramp, which serves as the main entrance for bulky loads or equipment. The loading ramp is jettisonable in emergency situations. Additionally, there is a sliding door located on the forward starboard side, while a small hinged emergency door is set on the aft port side. The tail boom uses conventional semi-monocoque construction, supported by closely spaced notched channel-section frames and continuous stringers, absent of any major longitudinal sections or longerons. The cranked section carrying the tail rotor and trim plane is more robust, strengthened by a solid-web <b>spar,</b> <b>frames,</b> and stiffeners. The juncture of the main boom and cranked section is hinged {{in order to reduce the}} rotorcraft's folded length to 58ft. Along the top of the boom, the shaft for the tail rotor is covered by a fairing.|$|R

5000|$|D'Ascanio, {{who hated}} motorbikes, {{designed}} a revolutionary vehicle. It {{was built on}} a <b>spar</b> <b>frame</b> with a handlebar gear change and the engine mounted directly onto the rear wheel. The front protection [...] "shield" [...] kept the rider dry and clean {{in comparison to the}} open front end on motorcycles. The pass-through leg area design was geared towards women, as wearing dresses or skirts made riding conventional motorcycles a challenge. The front fork, like an aircraft's landing gear, allowed for easy wheel changing. The internal mesh transmission eliminated the standard motorcycle chain, a source of oil and dirt. This basic design allowed a series of features to be deployed on the frame which would later allow quick development of new models.|$|E

50|$|The Honda CBR600F4 was {{produced}} between 1999 and 2000. It {{is the last}} of the CBR600 series of Honda sportbikes to be carbureted. An aluminium twin <b>spar</b> <b>frame</b> which reduced frame weight was used, and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger valves, shorter stroke, and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark plug caps had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter. A new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used Fireblade parts. The front brakes were upgraded, and the rear rim increased to 5.5â with new 3-spoke wheels. The F4 was fitted with Hondaâs HISS engine immobiliser system.|$|E

Kinematic shaping techniques have been widely used in solving these tasks. Summary of the application of elaborated design techniques in other CAD/CAM/CAE systems to develop such parts and components of aircraft has been made.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for automated generation of fully connected finite-element meshes for all internal structural components and skins of a given wing-body geometry model, controlled by a few conceptual-level structural layout parameters. Internal structural components include <b>spars,</b> ribs, <b>frames,</b> and bulkheads. Structural layout parameters include spar/rib locations in wing chordwise/spanwise direction and frame/bulkhead locations in longitudinal direction. A simple shell thickness optimization problem with two load conditions is used to verify versatility and robustness of the automated meshing process. The automation process is implemented in ModelCenter starting from an OpenVSP geometry and ending with a NASTRAN 200 solution. One subsonic configuration and one supersonic configuration are used for numerical verification. Two different structural layouts are constructed for each configuration and five finite-element meshes of different sizes are generated for each layout. The paper includes various comparisons of solutions of 20 thickness optimization problems, as well as discussions on how the optimal solutions {{are affected by the}} stress constraint bound and the initial guess of design variables...|$|R

The wing was in three parts, with a twin <b>spar,</b> steel tube <b>framed</b> centre section welded to the central fuselage which supported the tailbooms on its upper surfaces at their outer ends. The ribs were also formed from steel tube. The forward part of the centre section was plywood covered, with fabric aft. The outer wing panels were ply covered, each with a single wooden single spar. There was a split flap over the whole centre section trailing edge and slotted ailerons which filled the trailing edges of the outer panels.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the strategy used for designing the structural modular layout for the Blended Wing Body (BWB) Baseline II-E 2 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) airplane. In {{order to give}} UAV more flexibility in terms of availability of flight mission, {{there was a need}} for a quick and ease of assembly and disassemblyâs process for the airframe. The goal of this research was to design a BWB modular airframe, focusing on the ease of airframe assembly and disassembly. Morphological Method and Pugh Method were used as the concept generation and evaluation tools in designing the BWB airframe. The BWB was divided into 5 main modules; wing-body module, starboard and portside module and, right-side and left-side canards module. CATIA, a Computational Aided Design (CAD) software was used to build the three dimensional (3 -D) model of the airframe. MSC Patran/Nastran was used as the finite element (FE) analysis tool to analyze the BWB airframe static strength. Analysis was done focusing on the stress and deflections results. FE models for the airframe were developed in MSC Patran. CQUAD 4, CTRIA 3, CBEAM and CBAR elements were used to represent the individual components of the airframe such as <b>spar</b> and <b>frames.</b> Validation of FE static analysis was done using the static theoretical analysis in the form of stress calculations using simple beam theory. The airframe design was based on the + 3. 8 g flight load. Sizing of joints between modules was done through the use of empirical analysis. Internal forces induced in the connector between modules were used to size the joints. Approach using the CAD and Computational Aided Engineering (CAE) platform for designing the modular BWB airplane has been shown in this research. Design of the airframe proposed here had been analytically proven to be safe...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{construction}} {{began an}} experimental section was constructed. This {{used a variety}} of construction techniques: one end used hollow timber <b>spars,</b> the centre <b>frame</b> used a combination of timber and aluminium, while the other end used aluminium only. Although wood proved the most satisfactory, the Admiralty preferred metal. In late 1909 duralumin became available, and it was decided to use this new alloy, which would allow a considerable weight saving while also forming a stronger structure. The hull was made up of [...] 40 twelve-sided transverse frames spaced [...] apart: some of which were cross-braced by wires, dividing the structure into 17 bays of irregular length, varying from 12.5ft to 37.5ft (3.8m to 11.4m). The frames were connected by 12 longitudinal girders and a triangular section keel below the main structure. The hull shape was based on work by the American aerodynamicist Albert Zahm, and its head resistance was claimed to be 40% of that of contemporary Zeppelins. [...] A fully streamlined shape had been proposed, but was rejected by the Admiralty as being too difficult to construct. It was not until 1917/18 that a truly streamlined airship, the R80, was constructed.|$|R
40|$|Subtilin is a lanthionine-containing peptide {{antibiotic}} (lantibiotic) {{which is}} produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Upstream from the structural gene of subtilin, spaS, three genes (spaB, spaT, and spaC) which {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of subtilin have been identified (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, N. Schnell, and K. -D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58 : 132 - 142, 1992). By using a hybridization probe specific for these genes, the DNA region downstream from spaS was isolated. Further subcloning revealed a 5. 2 -kb KpnI-HindIII fragment on which two open reading <b>frames,</b> <b>spaR</b> and spaK, were identified approximately 3 kb downstream from spaS. The spaR gene encodes an open reading frame of 220 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 25. 6 kDa. SpaR shows 35 % similarity to positive regulatory factors OmpR and PhoB. The spaK gene encodes an open reading frame of 387 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 44. 6 kDa and was highly similar to histidine kinases previously described (PhoM, PhoR, and NtrB). Hydrophobicity blots suggested two membrane-spanning regions. Thus, spaR and spaK belong to a recently identified family of environmentally responsive regulators. These results indicated a regulatory function of spaR and spaK in subtilin biosynthesis. Indeed, batch culture experiments confirmed the regulation of subtilin biosynthesis starting in the mid-logarithmic growth phase and reaching its maximum in the early stationary growth phase. Gene deletions within spaR and spaK yielded subtilin-negative mutants, which confirms that subtilin biosynthesis is under the control of a two-component regulatory system.
