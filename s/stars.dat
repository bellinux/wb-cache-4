5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound <b>stars</b> that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more <b>stars</b> are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary <b>stars.</b> Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few <b>stars,</b> up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of <b>stars.</b> Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable <b>stars</b> known as Cepheid variables. These <b>stars</b> vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F <b>stars,</b> which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating <b>stars</b> in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence <b>stars</b> in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence <b>stars,</b> like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|As all the <b>stars</b> of a {{globular}} cluster are at {{approximately the same}} distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence <b>stars</b> in the {{globular cluster}} will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar <b>stars</b> in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae <b>stars</b> and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E

5|$|As {{the more}} massive <b>stars</b> appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma.

5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between <b>stars</b> outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between <b>stars</b> {{are thought to be}} rare.

5|$|During their stellar evolution, some <b>stars</b> {{pass through}} phases {{where they can}} become {{pulsating}} variables.

This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like <b>stars,</b> and long-period variables such as Mira.|$|E
5|$|Early {{in their}} development, T Tauri <b>stars</b> follow the Hayashi track—they {{contract}} and decrease in luminosity while remaining {{at roughly the}} same temperature.

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of <b>stars</b> occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of <b>stars,</b> such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two <b>stars,</b> possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable <b>stars</b> in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence <b>stars</b> formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of <b>stars</b> occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of <b>stars.</b> Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of <b>stars</b> and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that <b>stars</b> were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of <b>stars</b> were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve <b>stars</b> in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy.

This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for <b>stars</b> within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.)

5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual <b>stars</b> in the Local Group (see Cepheids).

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} <b>stars</b> occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of <b>stars</b> in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole.
