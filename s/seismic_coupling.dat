50|$|The North Andean {{convergent}} margin is {{a region}} of large crustal deformation. The North Andes block moves northeastwards relative to the South America {{at a rate of}} 6±2 mm/yr. The Nazca Plate is subducting beneath the South American Plate along the Colombia-Ecuador Trench. The subduction of the Carnegie Ridge into the Colombia-Ecuador Trench affected the crustal deformation in this region and the coupling between the Nazca Plate and the South America Plate. In addition, the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge may be an important drive contributing to the relatively northeastward movement of the North Andes block. Although there was no large earthquakes in the Gulf of Guayaquil segment of the subduction zone in the late 20th century, the strong earthquakes in 1953 and 1959 suggested that this was because of the strong coupling rather than being aseismic, and the <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> may be quite high and be able to produce large earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} part of Honshu and Hokkaido lie above the convergent plate boundary, where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Okhotsk Plate. The convergence rate across this boundary lies {{in the range of}} 7.9 - 9.2 cm per year. The plate interface {{in the area of the}} earthquake epicenter shows an abrupt increase in dip from about 5° to about 15°, 80 km landward of the Japan Trench. This part of the plate boundary has been the location of many powerful historical earthquakes, dating back to the 869 Sanriku earthquake and most recently of the devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Most of these events relate to rupture along the plate interface, but some, such as the 1933 Sanriku earthquake, involved deformation within the subducting plate. According to the studies of past great earthquakes, a weak <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> is suggested in the offshore Sanriku region. From the distribution of past seismicity, the width of coupling at 40°N was assumed to be about 150 km.|$|E
40|$|Three Eastern Tyrrhenian {{continental}} margin areas {{with very different}} depositional and tectonic settings were analyzed using single-channel very high-resolution reflection <b>seismics</b> <b>coupled</b> with sea-floor sampling. Fourth- and fifth-order depositional sequences derived from Quaternary glacio-eustatic processes are now buried at shallow depths within the continental shelf. The sequences have been reconstructed in detail with great lateral continuity. The tectonic setting did not influence the development of high-order sequences, which are probably synchronous at a global scale. Within these sequences, it has been possible to recognize all the systems tracts hypothesized by sequence stratigraphy models, confirming that this method does not depend upon time or scale. The geometry of depositional sequences {{is strongly dependent on}} sedimentation rate, i. e., on the distance from sources. Local factors such as transport pattern variations caused by sea level changes, paleotopography of the transgressed surface, characteristics of feeding hydrographic nets, and interactions with bioconstructions must be considered because they {{play an important role in}} the geometrical development of depositional sequences. In high-order depositional sequences, low-stand systems tracts are volumetrically predominant. High-stand and transgressive systems tracts seem to be linked to point sources because they have a three-dimensional (3 -D) geometry. On the contrary, low-stand systems tracts are related to linear sources parallel to the shelf break; they cause the progradation of the whole margin so that they form the margin structure almost entirely...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> {{for many of}} the world's {{subduction}} zones has been reevaluated. Geodetic estimates of <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> obtained from GPS measurements of upper plate deformation during the interseismic period are summarized. We compared those with new estimates of <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> obtained from seismological data. The results show that with a few notable exceptions the two methods agree to within about 10 %. The seismological estimates have been greatly improved over those made 20 - 30 years ago because of an abundance of paleoseismological data that greatly extend the temporal record of great subduction earthquakes and by the occurrence, in the intervening years, of an unusual number of great and giant earthquakes that have filled {{in some of the most}} critical holes in the seismic record. The data also, again with a few notable exceptions, support the frictional instability theory of <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling,</b> and in particular, the test of that theory made by Scholz and Campos (1995). Overall, the results support their prediction that high coupling occurs for subduction zones subjected to high normal forces with a switch to low coupling occurring fairly abruptly as the normal force decreases below a critical value. There is also considerable variation of coupling within individual subduction zones. Earthquake asperities correlate with areas of high coupling and hence have a semblance of permanence, but the rupture zones and asperity distributions of great earthquakes may differ greatly between seismic cycles because of differences in the phase of seismic flux accumulation...|$|E

However, GPS data analyses in the recent 5 – 7 years (e.g., Nishimura et al., 2004; Suwa et al., 2006; Hashimoto et al., 2009) have indicated a higher interplate coupling in this area (50 – 120 %). The interplate coupling for the past 14 years from small repeating earthquakes is also found to be higher (an average value of about 66 % in the rectangle in Fig. 2). Therefore, there are discrepancies between the observed seismic moment release and the estimated <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> from geodetic and small repeating earthquake data.

The downdip limit of interplate earthquakes, i.e., the maximum {{depth of the}} seismically coupled zone, is where the transition from seismic (stick-slip) to aseismic (stable-sliding) behavior occurs along the plate interface, and this limit presumably correlates with transitions in mineral and physical properties along the plate interface as well (e.g., Pacheco et al., 1993; Hyndman et al., 1995; Scholz, 1998; Oleskevich et al., 1999).

40|$|The megathrust fault {{between the}} underthrusting Cocos plate and {{overriding}} Caribbean plate recently experienced three large ruptures: the August 27, 2012 (M_w 7. 3) El Salvador; September 5, 2012 (M_w 7. 6) Costa Rica; and November 7, 2012 (M_w 7. 4) Guatemala earthquakes. All three events involve shallow-dipping thrust faulting {{on the plate}} boundary, but they had variable rupture processes. The El Salvador earthquake ruptured from about 4 to 20 km depth, with a relatively large centroid time of ∼ 19 s, low seismic moment-scaled energy release, and a depleted teleseismic short-period source spectrum {{similar to that of}} the September 2, 1992 (M_w 7. 6) Nicaragua tsunami earthquake that ruptured the adjacent shallow portion of the plate boundary. The Costa Rica and Guatemala earthquakes had large slip in the depth range 15 to 30 km, and more typical teleseismic source spectra. Regional seismic recordings have higher short-period energy levels for the Costa Rica event relative to the El Salvador event, consistent with the teleseismic observations. A broadband regional waveform template correlation analysis is applied to categorize the focal mechanisms for larger aftershocks of the three events. Modeling of regional wave spectral ratios for clustered events with similar mechanisms indicates that interplate thrust events have corner frequencies, normalized by a reference model, that increase down-dip from anomalously low values near the Middle America trench. Relatively high corner frequencies are found for thrust events near Costa Rica; thus, variations along strike of the trench may also be important. Geodetic observations indicate trench-parallel motion of a forearc sliver extending from Costa Rica to Guatemala, and low <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> on the megathrust has been inferred from a lack of boundary-perpendicular strain accumulation. The slip distributions and seismic radiation from the large regional thrust events indicate relatively strong <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> near Nicoya, Costa Rica, patchy zones of strong <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> in the shallowest megathrust region along Nicaragua and El Salvador, and small deeper patchy zones of strong <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> near Guatemala, which can be reconciled with the geodetic observations as long as the strong coupling is limited to a small fraction of the megathrust area...|$|E
30|$|We have {{compared}} the estimated thermal model with the along-strike variations in tectonic tremor, SSE, and <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> transition depth. The {{depth of the}} brittle-ductile transition on the plate interface in these numerical models coincides closely with the estimated depths of tectonic tremors and the down-dip limit of SSEs.

The brittle-ductile transition is thought to be controlled mainly by temperature, which means by inference that the occurrence of tectonic tremors is also mostly dependent on temperature. Consequently, as there are many different factors controlling the temperature, and these factors may differ significantly among different subduction zones, comparisons of tectonic tremor activity and thermal profiles in parts of a single subduction zone are more efficient in terms of evaluating the possible dependency of tectonic tremor activity on temperature.|$|E

30|$|In the Hikurangi {{subduction}} zone, situated {{along the}} east coast of the North Island, New Zealand, where the old oceanic Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Australian Plate, several slow slip events and tectonic tremors have recently been documented. These observations are somewhat surprising because such slow seismic phenomena tend to be common in subduction zones where relatively young oceanic plate is subducting. The locations of tectonic tremors, down-dip limit of slow slip events and <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> transition change along strike from greater depths in the south to shallower depths in the north, suggesting significant along-strike variations in the characteristics of the plate interface. Similar along-strike variations have been observed for other characteristic features of the Hikurangi subduction zone. Here, we demonstrate that along-strike variations observed for tectonic tremors, slow slip events, and <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> can be explained by lateral differences in the thermal structure of the subduction zone, which are controlled mainly by variations in convergence rate and friction along the plate interface. To demonstrate this, we first confirm that tectonic tremors occur around the plate interface. Then, we calculate the thermal structure of the Hikurangi subduction zone using a two-dimensional finite difference code. To explain the along-strike variation in the heat flow observed in the forearc region, temperatures along the plate interface should be systematically higher in the northern region than in the southern region, which we interpret as a consequence of higher convergence rates and greater frictional heating in the northern region. We compare the along-strike variation of seismic characteristics with calculated thermal structure and highlight that this along-strike variation in temperature controls the depth of the brittle-ductile transition, which is consistent with the observed spatial variations in tectonic tremors, down-dip limit of slow slip events and <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling.</b> Our results suggest that tectonic tremors recorded within subduction zones reflect the transient rheology of the materials being subducted, which is controlled by variations in temperature along the plate interface.|$|E
40|$|<b>Seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> {{has been}} used as a {{qualitative}} measure of the “interaction” between the two plates at subduction zones. Kanamori (1971) introduced <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling</b> after noting that the characteristic size of earthquakes varies systematically for the northern Pacific subduction zones. A quantitative global comparison of many subduction zones reveals a strong correlation of earthquake size with two other variables: age of the subducting lithosphere and convergence rate. The largest earthquakes occur in zones with young lithosphere and fast convergence rates, while zones with old lithosphere and slow rates are relatively aseismic for large earthquakes. Results from a study of the rupture process of three great earthquakes indicate that maximum earthquake size is directly related to the asperity distribution on the fault plane (asperities are strong regions that resist the motion between the two plates). The zones with the largest earthquakes have very large asperities, while the zones with smaller earthquakes have small scattered asperities. This observation can be translated into a simple model of <b>seismic</b> <b>coupling,</b> where the horizontal compressive stress between the two plates is proportional to the ratio of the summed asperity area to the total area of the contact surface. While the variation in asperity size is used to establish a connection between earthquake size and tectonic stress, it also implies that plate age and rate affect the asperity distribution. Plate age and rate can control asperity distribution directly by use of the horizontal compressive stress associated with the “preferred trajectory” (i. e. the vertical and horizontal velocities of subducting slabs are determined by the plate age and convergence velocity). Indirect influences are many, including oceanic plate topography and the amount of subducted sediments. All subduction zones are apparently uncoupled below a depth of about 40 km, and we propose that the basalt to eclogite phase change in the down-going oceanic crust may be largely responsible. This phase change should start at a depth of 30 – 35 km, and could at least partially uncouple the plates by superplastic deformation throughout the oceanic crust during the phase change...|$|E
