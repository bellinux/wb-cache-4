40|$|The {{browning}} {{of fruits}} {{can be considered}} as an enzymatic oxidation which is believed {{to be one of the}} main causes of quality loss during post-harvest handling. The enzymes responsible for this are the oxidoreductases; the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) (monophenol, o -diphenol, oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1. 14. 18. 1) belongs to this group. This enzyme, which is found in the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>plum</b> (Achras sapota), was purified using a phenylsepharose and a SephacrylS- 200 columns. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be about 66 kDa by gel filtration and 29 kDa by SDS-PAGE. A single protein band was found using the latter system (SDS-PAGE), which shows that the PPO of the pulp of the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>plum</b> may be composed of two protein subunits with similar molecular weight. The optimum pH was 7. 0 and the optimum temperature 60 ℃. The most effective inhibitors tested were ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite and acetic acid...|$|E
