50|$|The major likely {{benefit of}} <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation</b> is plant/crop improvement. <b>Somaclonal</b> <b>variation</b> {{leads to the}} {{creation}} of additional genetic variability. Characteristics for which somaclonal mutants can be enriched during in vitro culture includes resistance to disease pathotoxins, herbicides, high salt concentration, mineral toxicity and tolerance to environmental or chemical stress, as well as for increased production of secondary metabolites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Somaclonal</b> <b>variation</b> is not {{restricted}} to, but is particularly common in, plants regenerated from callus. The variations can be genotypic or phenotypic, {{which in the}} latter case can be either genetic or epigenetic in origin. Typical genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers (polyploidy and aneuploidy), chromosome structure (translocations, deletions, insertions and duplications) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related event would be gene methylation. If no visual, morphogenic changes are apparent, other plant screening procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation.</b> The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation.</b>|$|E

However, the nature of an observed variation is often complicated.

50|$|<b>Somaclonal</b> <b>{{variation}}</b> is {{the variation}} seen in plants {{that have been}} produced by plant tissue culture.

The term <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation</b> is a phenomenon of broad taxonomic occurrence, reported for species of different ploidy levels, and for outcrossing and inbreeding, vegetatively and seed propagated, and cultivated and non-cultivated plants.

50|$|Different steps {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation.</b> It is well known that {{increasing}} numbers of subculture increases the likelihood of <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation,</b> so the number of subcultures in micropropagation protocols should be kept to a minimum. Regular reinitiation of clones from new explants might reduce variability over time. Another way of reducing <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variation</b> is to avoid 2,4-D in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce variation. Vitrification, commonly referred to as hyperhydricity in the tissue culture world, may be a problem in some species. Hyperhydricity is a physiological malformation that results in excessive hydration, low lignification, impaired stomatal function and reduced mechanical strength of tissue culture-generated plants. In case of forest trees, mature elite trees can be identified and rapidly cloned by this technique.|$|E
30|$|Tissue {{culture is}} a {{powerful}} tool in plant gene transformation and molecular breeding. Phenotypic and genotypic <b>variations,</b> collectively called <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations,</b> have long been known to be induced during dedifferentiation and regeneration of plants in tissue cultures (Larkin and Scowcroft 1981; Filipecki and Malepszy 2006). Several studies have reported the involvement of plant growth regulators used for regeneration of tissue culture and antibiotics used for transformant selection in <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> (LoSchiavo et al. 1989; Bregitzer et al. 1995; Schmitt et al. 1997; Rakoczy-Trojanowska 2002; Bardini et al. 2003). Factors such as explant genotypes and types of explants have also been known {{to play a role}} in <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> (Gaj 2004). Additionally, some studies show that accumulation of genetic changes during long-term culture in vitro also contribute to <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> (Peredo et al. 2006; Smýkml et al. 2007). Therefore, these data indicate the significance of determining the factors that influence the rate of variations during tissue culture and plant gene transformation.|$|R
30|$|Most {{transformation}} protocols {{currently available}} for plants require tissue {{culture and the}} use of selectable markers, which exert stress that may result in <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations.</b> Four factors that could affect the frequency of <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> were determined in this study. The pollen viability of plants regenerated from sequentially subcultured explants was examined. Pollen viability gradually decreased from R 3 to R 9 and was significantly reduced at R 9 compared to that at R 0. The variation frequency of pollen viability continuously increased from R 1 to R 9. Prolonged culturing has previously been reported to contribute to accumulation of genetic changes (Peredo et al. 2006). However, the leaves of late regenerants have been shown to exhibit significantly less genetic and epigenetic divergence from the source leaves than those exposed to short periods of callus growth (Rodríguez López et al. 2010). When torenia explants were subcultured on the same shoot induction medium for 20, 80, and 120  days, the regenerated R 1 plants showed similar pollen viability as the control (data not shown). This suggests that prolonged explant culturing is not associated with the accumulation of <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> in torenia.|$|R
30|$|Plant growth {{regulators}} have previously {{been reported to}} influence the degree of <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> and to induce an increase in DNA methylation (LoSchiavo et al. 1989; Bregitzer et al. 1995). In the current study, when the concentrations of 6 -BA and NAA were both increased to five times those in the primary shoot induction medium, the mean pollen viability was significantly lower (78.9 %) {{than that of the}} control (88.7 %) and the variation frequency of pollen viability also increased to 42.9 %. This indicates that both growth regulators contributed to the accumulation of <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations.</b> Aside from plant growth regulators, antibiotic application is also known to be associated with tissue culture-induced variations. In particular, Kanamycin has been reported to cause hypermethylation in tobacco plants (Schmitt et al. 1997; Rakoczy-Trojanowska 2002; Bardini et al. 2003). Kanamycin was hence used as a selection agent to generate transgenic plants in our study. The mean pollen viability of the transgenic plants grown in the presence of antibiotics was 53.5 %, which is significantly lower compared to that of the control (88.3 %). Additionally, the variation frequency of pollen viability also increased to 75 % in the transgenic plants. Taken together, our results show that plant growth regulators, antibiotics, and the number, not the duration, of subculture generations influence <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> in torenia.|$|R

30|$|Kuznetsova et al. (2005) {{investigated}} decreased pollen viability in pea regenerants and detected completely sterile pollen in pea plants regenerated from long-term callus cultures. They did {{not find}} relation between genetic variations and duration on tissue culture medium, {{but they did not}} examine epigenetic variations of the regenerants (Kuznetsova et al. 2005). In the current work, we found that the transgenic plants with the expression vector incorporated with nine genes were all infertile (data not shown), indicating that the variation of infertility in all the transgenic lines could not have resulted from the insertion effect or the function of inserted genes (Filipecki and Malepszy 2006). Furthermore, we found that the variation of decreased pollen viability in seed-derived generations is not inherited, indicating that the variation in the regenerated plants is epigenetic. Many studies have shown that changes in the level and pattern of DNA methylation are involved in <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations,</b> and changes in methylation have been detected in almost every study on <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> (Guo et al. 2007; Li et al. 2007). We found that the methylation level of the R 9 plants decreased 0.28 % to 3.95 % compared with that of the R 0 plants. Frequent reversions to the normal phenotype of somatic embryo-derived oil palm were also shown to be associated with a 2 %- 4 % decrease in methylation (Rival et al. 1998; Jaligot et al. 2000; Matthes et al. 2001). Although Jaligot et al. (2004) found poor correlation between <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> and the methylation pattern using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP), this method can still reveal changes in methylation levels in small regions that are masked in global measurements (Smýkml et al. 2007). In the case of peas, no significant difference was found at the DNA methylation level, but subtle genomic DNA mutations/rearrangements were detected only by amplified fragment length polymorphism (Smýkml et al., 2007).|$|R

Cotyledons isolated from Golestan landrace seeds cultivated on MS medium supplemented with 0. 1 [*]mg/L kinetin proved to be the best primary explant for the induction of somatic embryogenesis as well as the regeneration of the whole plantlet. Results indicated that different developmental stages of somatic embryos were simultaneously observed on a callus with embryogenic potential. The high content of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline, and terpenic hydrocarbons and low content of alcoholic and phenolic compositions had a stimulatory effect on somatic embryogenesis. Band patterns of RAPD markers in regenerated plants were {{different from those of the}} mother plants. This may be related to <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variations</b> or pollination system of cumin.
