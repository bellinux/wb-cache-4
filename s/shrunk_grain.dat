As they are fluctuating interfaces and have a width comparable to the lattice spacing of the surrounding grains, the determination of their local geometrical characteristics is difficult.

In this paper, the model formulation, application and simulation results are compared for two of these approaches. First, we derive relations between the parameters in both models that represent {{the same set of}} grain boundary energies and mobilities. Then, simulation results obtained with both models, using equivalent model parameters, are compared for grain structures in 2 D and 3 D. The evolution of the individual grains, grain boundaries and triple junction angles is followed in detail. Moreover, the simulation results obtained with both approaches are compared using analytical theories and previous simulation results as benchmarks.

40|$|Abstract. A 3 D Vertex Model {{has been}} {{successfully}} implemented to investigate {{the evolution of a}} special grain assembly during grain growth. The model considers the mean curvature as driving force for the motion of the vertices and allows the consideration of all parameters affecting the motion of the system, i. e., grain boundary energy and line tension of the triple lines, as well as grain boundary (GB), triple line (TL) and quadruple point (QP) mobility as well. The used special configuration makes it possible to study the influence of all structural elements of a grain boundary network on the evolution of the system by allowing the steady-state motion of the boundaries of a <b>shrinking</b> <b>grain.</b> In the present work the different mobilities have been systematically varied and the evolution of the grain size with time has been studied as a function of TL and QP mobility.

40|$|Grain {{growth in}} a {{polycrystal}} is a capillarity-driven process with {{the driving force}} equal to γ(K 1 + K 2) = γκ (this is the reduction in excess interfacial free energy per unit volume swept out by the grain boundary as it moves). Grain boundaries (and other single-phase interfaces) migrate toward their center of curvature. • Three-dimensional polycrystals have grains that occupy volumes, grain boundaries that are twodimensional imperfections at which two grains abut, grain edges which are one-dimensional imperfections along which three grain boundaries meet, and grain corners which are point imperfections at which four grain edges meet. • Models for two-dimensional grain growth such as would occur in a thin polycrystalline film can be developed starting {{with the assumption that}} the local interfacial velocity is linearly proportional to driving force. For a grain entirely embedded within a second grain (no grain-boundary junctions), this leads to the law dA/dt = constant, where A is the instantaneous area of the <b>shrinking</b> <b>grain.</b> A circular grain will disappear with a parabolic “growth ” law.

Nanocrystalline aluminum has been of particular intrest among the nano-materials. This thesis describes the results of three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations that have been performed to study grain growth in nanocrystalline FCC aluminum. This project built the models by using the Voronoi geometry method to study the grain growth mechanism, grain boundary structure and the effects of temperature and grain size on the crystal structure and grain growth by Energy Analysis, Radial Distribution Function (RDF) analysis, and investigating changes in Centro symmetric parameters. The results show that nanocrystalline grains are organized and have low energy, whereas grain boundaries consist of distorted regions. The grain growth is controlled by curvature driven grain boundary migration. By analyzing the effect of the temperature and grain size on grain growth, the rate of grain growth increases with increasing temperature. The grain boundary mobility increases with increasing grain size. Grain boundary mobility refers to how easily grain boundaries move, and the grain growth rate is the product of mobility and a driving force term, the later which is inversely proportional to grain size. When the sizes of grains are approximately equal, the curvature direction of initial grain boundary will determine <b>grain</b> growing or <b>shrinking.</b> <b>Grain</b> boundary migration always occurs toward the center of curvature...|$|R

The experimental conditions were drained, at 5 ~MPa fluid pressure, and confining pressures ranging from 15 to 55 MPa. One test was performed with a constant applied differential stress of 30 ~MPa. The reaction is marked by (1) a porosity increase and homogeneous compaction, (2) a swarm of acoustic emissions, (3) a large decrease in P- and S-wave velocities, and (4) a decrease in VP/VS ratio. Wave velocity data are interpreted in terms of crack density and pore aspect ratio, which, modeling pores as spheroids, is estimated at around 0. 05 (crack-like spheroid). Complementary tests performed in an environmental scanning electron microscope indicate that cracks first form inside the gypsum grains, and are oriented preferentially along the crystal structure of gypsum. Most of the visible porosity appears at later stages when <b>grains</b> <b>shrink</b> and <b>grain</b> boundaries open. Extrapolation of our data to serpentinites in subduction zones suggest that the signature of dehydrating rocks in seismic tomography could be a low apparent Poisson's ratio, although this interpretation may be masked by anisotropy development due to preexisting crystal preferred orientation and/or deformation-induced cracking. The large compaction {{and the absence of}} strain localization in the deformation test suggests that dehydrating rocks may be seen as soft inclusions and could thus induce ruptures in the surrounding, nonreacting rocks...|$|R

40|$|Could {{the world}} be facing peak water? Or has it already peaked? Summary Peak oil has {{generated}} headlines in recent years, {{but the real}} threat to our future is peak water. There are substitutes for oil, but not for water. We can produce food without oil, but not without water. We drink on average four litres of water per day, {{in one form or}} another, but the food we eat each day requires 2, 000 litres of water to produce, or 500 times as much. Getting enough water to drink is relatively easy, but finding enough to produce the ever-growing quantities of grain the world consumes is another matter. Grain consumed directly supplies nearly half of our calories. That consumed indirectly as meat, milk, and eggs supplies {{a large part of the}} remainder. Today roughly 40 per centof the world grain harvest comes from irrigated land. It thus comes as no surprise that irrigation expansion has played a central role in tripling the world grain harvest over the last six decades. During the last half of the twentiethcentury, the world’sirrigated area expanded from close to 250 million acres (100 million hectares) in 1950 to roughly 700 millionin 2000. This near tripling of world irrigation within 50 years was historically unique. But since then the growth in irrigation has come to a near standstill, expanding only 10 per centbetween 2000 and 2010. In looking at water and our future, we face many questions and few answers. Could the world be facingpeak water? Or has it already peaked? Key points 	Peak water poses a greater threat to our future than peak oil. We can produce food without oil but not without water. 	Overpumping of aquifers has created water-based food bubbles, which will burst once aquifers are depleted. Among the countries currently overpumping their aquifers are the world’s three biggest grain producers- China, India and the United States- which together, produce half of the world’s grain. 	As competition for water resources from urban and industrial sources increases, agriculture will become the residual claimant on water supplies. As countries approach or arrive at peak water, aquifer depletion and <b>shrinking</b> <b>grain</b> harvests could lead to peak grain. 	Water, not land, has emerged as the principle constraint on the expansion of food supplies.  ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. Color group {{theory and}} {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations {{were used to}} study the faceting and rotation of grains in nanocrystalline materials and their interactions. Color group arguments {{were used to determine}} symmetry-dictated extrema with respect to misorientation of the grains and with respect to grain boundary normal orientations. MD simulations were used to study the evolution of the system and to elucidate the interactions between grain rotation and faceting in nano-scale systems. The systems of study were fcc bicrystalline systems with two grains sharing their [110] directions. Two geometric parameters were studied: the misorientation between two grains with a common rotation axis in the [110] direction of both grains, and the grain boundary normal orientation of fcc (110) tilt grain boundaries. The symmetry-dictated extremum (SDE) with respect to misorientation around both grains' [110] direction is 90 degrees. The SDE with respect to GB normal orientations for (110) tilt GBs are located on top of the color and classical mirror planes of their dichromatic patterns. By using periodic boundary conditions and a cylindrical embedded grain structure in our simulations, grains are only free to vary the misorientation between grains around the common [110] direction, and the normal of the grain boundaries are always perpendicular to both grains [110] direction. All SDE studied in our simulation are observed to be local energy minimum states. We observed the systems reducing their excess energy through three main modes: forming facets at the boundaries, rotating between the two grains, and reduction of grain boundary area through grain shrinkage. Facets are formed in low-energy grain boundaries and oscillating rotation occurred when the initial misorientation was not a SDE. A new algorithm was developed to quantitatively measure the grain rotation. The ovsered rotations are not rigid-body rotations and have strong interaction with faceting. Systems with lower energy facets rotate less. Low energy facets are also impede the continuous rotation and shrinkage of the grains.

40|$|In {{this present}} {{dissertation}} thesis experimental investigations and simulations {{were conducted to}} improve the understanding of dynamic recrystallization. The aim {{of the study was}} to propose a coherent concept of dynamic recrystallization based on the results of the experiments and simulations along with some former work. The study's focus was mainly drawn to the single peak behavior owing to a higher relevance for industrial processes. In the first part of the study high-temperature compression tests were conducted at constant and transient deformation conditions on two materials, copper and the austenitic steel "alloy 800 H". The tests were carried out at strain rates of 5 · 10 - 4 s- 1 to 5 · 10 - 2 s- 1 and temperatures of 450 °C and 500 °C for copper and 1100 °C and 1150 °C for alloy 800 H. At transient deformation conditions abrupt changes of the strain rate or as well of the temperature for the steel samples were performed. Several conclusions could be drawn from the determined values of the flow curves and microstructure images. First, a physical based relationship between the steady-state flow stress σS and grain size DDRX, based on the grain size sensitivity of the flow stress, was validated by means of the conducted jump tests. The relationship is described by σS = C/DDRX, with C being a constant. Due to a similar relationship between flow stress and subgrain size, a correlation between recrystallized grain size and subgrain size could be drawn. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the activation energy of grain boundary migration could be calculated from the strain interval from the onset of dynamic recrystallization to steady-state for single peak flow curves. Based on annealing experiments to obtain the activation energy of grain boundary motion during normal grain growth, the method could be approved. Additionally, it was demonstrated that not only the grain size but also its distribution stayed constant within the steady-state regime. By means of distinguished distributions of growing (newly formed) and <b>shrinking</b> (consumed) <b>grains,</b> the steady-state flow stress could be calculated as the weighted sum of both contributions. In the second part of the study a modeling of dynamic recrystallization in terms of the experimental results was performed. For this purpose, the model 3 IVM+, which was developed at IMM, was extended to the processes of dynamic recrystallization. 3 IVM+ was originally developed as a work-hardening model based on three internal variables, which were on the one hand the dislocation densities of the mobile dislocations and on the other hand the dislocation densities of immobile dislocations in the cell walls and cell interior in deformation structures. By means of their evolution rates, the stress contributions of cell walls and interior and hence the overall flow stress and flow curve were determined. The onset of dynamic recrystallization was simulated as the condensation of cell walls to subgrain boundaries that become mobile at a critical point. The velocity of the grain boundaries during bulging is then determined by means of the calculated activation energy and under the assumption that the driving force of dynamic recrystallization matches approximately the driving force of normal grain growth. To simulate the complete flow curve, the adjustment of the grain size to its steady-state value is incorporated in the code. The recrystallized grain size is thereby calculated by its relation to the steady-state flow stress mentioned above. These extensions to the model render the description of dynamic recrystallization possible and allow the determination of single peak flow curves. From the experimental results and the modeling a coherent concept of dynamic recrystallization was derived which described the mechanisms as follows:In contrast to the common interpretation, the onset of dynamic recrystallization is caused by the mobilization of deformation induced subboundaries instead of only the attainment of a critical energy within the material. The subgrain boundaries are developed by the condensation of deformation cell walls and subsequently possess grain boundary properties like surface tension and mobility. The imbalance at the junctions of subgrain and high angle grain boundaries then results in a curvature driven grain boundary motion which resembles the nucleation of grains. In the course of further deformation, a new subboundary network is developed which stabilizes the new grains at their steady-state size, according to the correlation with the subgrain size. In this manner, the necklaces with steady-state grain size are successively built until the initial microstructure is completely consumed. In the following steady-state regime the grain size distribution stays constant which can be described by means of the distribution functions of the growing and <b>shrinking</b> <b>grains...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{in the aftermath of}} the Chinese post- 1978 reforms has resulted in a <b>shrinking</b> of <b>grain</b> grown area in the southern and eastern regions of the country which in turn is believed to have put the marginal northern regions under increased pressure. This paper examines key indicators of agricultural performance as well as cultivated land area development of the pre- and post- 1978 reform periods focusing on the agro-pastoral Tongliao City Prefecture, eastern Inner Mongolia. The results are related to the village level development through a case study as well as to the provincial level. Average annual grain per capita production increased from about 400 kg in the late 1970 s to more then 1000 kg in the late 1990 s. This was achieved through a combination of intensification and reclamation of cropland, with the latter restricted to pastoral classified counties. Production variability, in particular for the low producing counties, has also increased possibly as an effect of the substitution of traditional mixed pattern of crops with HYV monocultures. Average living standards have improved but have been accompanied by widening income gaps. Poor farmers' livelihoods continue to be insecure, particularly during dry years. Concern is raised regarding the sustainability of the rapid agricultural development; an increased use of costly fertilisers constrains poorer farmer's economy and may lead to deteriorating water quality while increasing irrigation depletes water resources. © Springer 2006...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies on}} {{mechanisms}} under drought stress {{have been based}} on gene expression. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (QRT-PCR) is the most sensitive method to detect the transcript of interest gene. To avoid bias, expression of the target gene is usually normalized relative to one or multiple reference genes which should not fluctuate in all samples. The most widely used reference genes are those which belong to actin family; however, many researchers make use of paralogous genes for actin without proper validation of their presumed stability of expression. If an unstable housekeeping gene (HKG) is selected to normalize the target, the results obtained may be spurious. So, we evaluated the gene expression of 10 HKGs, including 8 paralogous genes for actin, together with b-tub and eEF- 1 a in rice. For the entire sample pools analyzed, ACT(X 16280) 1 and eEF- 1 a were the most stable genes in the different stages of rice panicle development. In this study, we used ACT(X 16280) 1, eEF- 1 a and the geometric mean of ACT(X 16280) 1 and eEF- 1 a as internal controls to study the relative expression of gene GS 3, controlling grain length and weight, during different stages of panicle development under drought stress.

40|$|A full {{diffusion}} kinetic Monte Carlo {{algorithm is}} used to model nanocrystalline film deposition, and study the mechanisms of grain nucleation and microstructure formation in such films. The major finding of this work is that new grain nucleation occurs predominantly on surface peaks. Consequently, development of a nanocrystalline structure is promoted by a growth surface with nanoscale roughness, on which new grains can nucleate and grow separately from one another. The grain minor dimension (in {{the plane of the}} film) is primarily dictated by surface peak spacing, which in turn is reduced at low temperatures and high deposition rates. The grain major dimension (in the growth direction) is related to the probability of nucleating new grains on top of pre-existing ones, with finer grains being formed at low temperatures and low grain boundary energies. Because vacancies kinetically pin grain boundaries, high vacancy content, which is obtained at high deposition rate, also favors nanograins. Consistent with empirical observations common in the experimental literature, it is found that as <b>grains</b> <b>shrink,</b> they transition from elongated to equiaxed.
