The objectives were to determine if 4 -H involvement is associated with the psychological and social maturation of adolescent members, and to investigate how several variables such as age, urban/rural residence, and S.

To accomplish these objectives 165 youths (103 4 -H, 62 non 4 -H) and one parent of each youth, responded to mail-out questionnaires, answering questions of biographical content, and items from the Psychosocial t~aturity inventory. Responses were compiled and analyzed by the use of several statistical summary techniques. The author considers the following findings to be of the greatest theoretical significance.

40|$|Social {{insurance}} schemes {{have proved to}} be rather stable welfare state institutions enjoying broad popular support. It is widely assumed that the high degree of legitimacy is due to the insurance analogy because those schemes provide individually equitable returns on prior contribution payments. In this article it is demonstrated that all social {{insurance schemes}} contain interpersonal redistributions on a large scale, resulting from uniform contribution rates, provisions geared at <b>social</b> <b>adequacy</b> of benefits, and unequal treatment of different birth cohorts. In Germany, those redistributive elements are most pronounced in the statutory health care scheme. It is argued that the unchallenged functioning of social insurances is dependent on a prevailing culture of solidarity. It denotes an immunity to the temptation of individual utility maximization based upon recognized moral duties which then facilitates ongoing redistributive processes. Results from qualitative interviews with persons insured with the German statutory health care scheme clearly indicate the presence of those solidary virtues. The continued existence of this moral infrastructure appears to be less threatened by progressing individualization. Rather, it might be eroded by current political attempts to shift the balance between solidarity and self-reliance which intensify mistrust in the permanence of comprehensive health care protection.

Adaptive changes made to the original design of the dwellings have been recorded, as well as the space use patterns of the main living areas.

The present study also examined the measurement invariance between men (n = 186) and women (n = 316) in a university sample. Different models for each measure were identified through a review of the literature, and the models were examined through confirmatory factor analyses. The best-fitting models for each measure were retained for subsequent model modification to improve fit and for invariance testing across gender. The results of the confirmatory factor analyses and subsequent exploratory models provided general support for invariance in the configural models, but only the RRQ displayed measurement, scalar, and latent mean structure invariance. Results of the bootstrapped regression analyses indicated that summated scores derived from the exploratory models demonstrated different relationships between anxiety and depression in men and women. Frequency of worry, metaworry, and general anxiety symptoms significantly contributed to prediction of anxiety in men, whereas metaworry, social worry, lethargy, general anxiety symptoms, and health worries predicted anxiety in women.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the acute methodology problem: elicitation {{of the fundamental}} principle of modern education. In the course of retrospective analysis, the author attempts to trace the essence and comparative historical specificity of the principle in question, and {{find out whether the}} currently declared one actually corresponds with the society demands and time requirements. Consequently, the author singles out three successive historical types of education, each of them based on the respective ideological and methodological assumptions. The first one (the 17 th – mid- 19 th century), based on the ontological system of the «Man and Nature», regards the man as a natural creature and proclaims a fundamental educational principle of adequacy to nature. The second type, formed {{by the end of the}} 19 th century and based on the ontological system of the «Man and Society», takes the man as a social creature and puts forward a fundamental educational principle of adequacy to society. And finally, the multi-dimensional ontological system of the «ManNature-Culture-Society», developed in the mid- 20 th century, defines the man as a bio-socio-cultural creature and forms a basis for a new fundamental educational principle of adequacy to culture. The paper maintains that the principle of adequacy to nature corresponds with the classical period of education history; orientation on the <b>social</b> <b>adequacy</b> represents its non-classical stage; and consequently, the principle of cultural adequacy signifies the post-non-classical phase. In conclusion, the author argues that resumption of the initial educational principle of adequacy to nature can be regarded as moving backward. </p...|$|E

The Ghanaian financial sector is also confronted by a large number of development challenges. The factual updates of Ghana’s observance of the three international standards and codes illustrate the limited progress that has been achieved on the regulatory and supervisory front. IMF staff encouraged the authorities to pursue passage of the money laundering bill and seek technical assistance from the IMF to develop the essential infrastructure.

40|$|Background and aims. This thesis took a {{life course}} {{approach}} to examining inequalities in {{quality of life}} in early old age using the French occupational cohort GAZEL. The cohort combines company administrative records with information from annual questionnaires for 20 625 electricity and gas industry employees. The thesis aimed to examine whether current circumstances, retirement routes, mid-life working conditions or occupational grade were associated with subjective quality of life, measured with CASP- 19, in retired participants. Results. Cross-sectional and change analyses using multiple regression demonstrated that <b>social</b> support, financial <b>adequacy</b> and, above all, mental and physical health were strongly associated with quality of life. There was a graded relationship between occupational grade in mid-life and quality of life following labour market exit, a relationship which was largely accounted for by health and financial circumstances in retirement. After adjusting for occupational grade and social class, exposures to physical hazards and ergonomic strain were associated with lower quality of life following retirement; accumulated exposures to carcinogens were not. Pathways from working conditions to poorer quality of life via physical and mental health accounted for the associations between earlier strenuous and dangerous working conditions and quality of life following retirement. Retiring tended to improve subjective quality of life, particularly if it was from difficult psychosocial working conditions. Retiring in ill health was associated with worse quality of life; this retirement route was more likely for individuals who had poor working conditions. Continuing professional activities after retirement was associated with better quality of life, a retirement route more likely for individuals working in higher grades. Conclusions. The thesis demonstrated small but persistent life course influences of employment characteristics upon quality of life which appeared to be mediated via current determinants of quality of life.
