500|$|In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club, a film {{adaptation}} of Chuck Palahniuk's {{novel of the}} same name, directed by David Fincher. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to [...] "have an experience, take a punch more and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{come out on the}} other end." [...] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be [...] "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than... his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise". In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1999, McCain said [...] "The {{only way}} to {{increase}} the yield on Social Security dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering American families to invest, in most robust portfolios, {{a portion of their}} earnings for Social Security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to Social Security."

2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the team selection, controversy arose regarding the two teams selected. Michigan State QB Kirk Cousins, whose team failed {{to qualify for a}} BCS game because it did not finish in the top 14 of the BCS standings, criticized the potential selection of Michigan after his team's debilitating 42-39 loss [...] to Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get punished for playing and someone else gets to sit on the couch and get what they want". Michigan State had defeated the University of Michigan 28-14 in East Lansing earlier that season. [...] Others criticized the selection of Virginia Tech, stating that both Kansas State and Boise State were more deserving of the bid and that the bowl committee had chosen a familiar team as opposed to a new one. [...] The bowl was considered the lowest-ranked match-up of two teams {{in the history of the}} BCS.|$|E
2500|$|References to Atlas Shrugged have {{appeared}} {{in a variety of}} other popular entertainments. In the first season of the drama series Mad Men, Bert Cooper urges Don Draper to read the book, and Don's sales pitch tactic to a client indicates he has been influenced by the strike plot: [...] "If you don't appreciate my hard work, then I will take it away and we'll <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do." [...] Less positive mentions of the novel occur in the animated comedy Futurama, where it appears among the library of books flushed down to the sewers to be read only by grotesque mutants, and in South Park, where a newly literate character gives up on reading after experiencing Atlas Shrugged. BioShock, a critically acclaimed 2007 video game, is widely considered to be a response to Atlas Shrugged. The story depicts a collapsed Objectivist society, and significant characters in the game owe their naming to Rand's work, which game creator Ken Levine said he found [...] "really fascinating".|$|E

2500|$|In President Teddy Roosevelt's 1905 Inaugural Parade Geronimo rode horseback down Pennsylvania Avenue {{with five}} real Indian chiefs, who wore full {{headgear}} and painted faces. The intent, one newspaper stated, {{was to show}} Americans “that they have buried the hatchet forever.” They created a sensation and brought the crowds along the parade route to their feet. [...] Later that same week Geronimo met with the President and made a moving request for the Chiricahuas at [...] Fort Sill to be relieved of their status as prisoners of war, and {{allowed to return to}} their homeland in Arizona. President Roosevelt refused, referring to the continuing animosity in Arizona for the deaths of civilian men, women, and children associated with Geronimo's raids during the prolonged Apache Wars. Through an interpreter, Roosevelt told Geronimo that the Indian had a “bad heart.” [...] “You killed many of my people; you burned villages…and were not good Indians.” [...] The president would have to wait a while “and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> and your people act” on their reservation.|$|E

Coretta {{was the only one}} remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met. She told him [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can say that. You don't even know me." [...] But King was assured and asked to see her again.

2500|$|While {{the eyes}} of the world were on Berlin, {{watching}} the Mauerfall (fall of the Wall), a simultaneous process of Grenzöffnung (border opening) was taking place along the entire length of the inner German border. Existing border crossings were opened immediately, though their limited capacity caused long tailbacks as millions of East Germans crossed over to the West. Within the first four days, 4.3million East Germans– a quarter of the country's entire population– poured into West Germany. At the Helmstedt crossing point on the Hanover–Berlin autobahn, cars were backed up for some drivers waited 11hours to drive across to the West. The border was opened progressively over the course of the next few months. New crossing points were created at many points, reconnecting communities that had been separated for nearly 40years. At Herrenhof on the Elbe, hundreds of East Germans pushed their way through the border fence to board the first cross-river ferry to run since April 1945. Hundreds of people from the East German town of Katherinenberg surged across the border to see the West German border town of Wanfried, while West Germans poured into East Germany [...] "to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> live on the other side". East German border guards, overwhelmed by the flood of people, soon gave up checking passports. Special trains were put on to transport people across the border.
