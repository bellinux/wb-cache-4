Originally, Michael Jordan, {{who played with}} the White Sox's Double-A Birmingham Barons in 1994, was signed to play the 1995 season as a non-drafted free agent for the Sounds. However, with the ongoing MLB strike, Jordan decided to quit the sport rather than becoming a replacement player and being labeled a <b>strikebreaker.</b> The team improved their record in 1996, ending up with 77wins and 67losses. Despite a decent winning percentage, Nashville failed to secure {{a spot in the}} playoffs. Outfielder Jeff Abbott won the Rookie of the Year Award, and Rick Renick earned his second Manager of the Year Award. Joey Vierra pitched in a career franchise-record 238games from 1990 to 1992 and 1994 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a <b>strikebreaker,</b> and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to Greyhound. While the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E

However the strikers now objected to the non-union <b>strikebreaker</b> crew which had come on board, and demanded that they be dismissed, which the White Star Line refused. 54 sailors then left the ship, objecting to the non-union crew who they claimed were unqualified and therefore dangerous, and refused to sail with them. This led to the scheduled sailing being cancelled.|$|E
25|$|As {{the strike}} wound down, Rand and his hired <b>strikebreaker</b> Pearl Bergoff were both indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury for violating the Byrnes Act. The Byrnes Act banned the interstate {{transportation}} of personnel for the purpose of breaking strikes. Both men were acquitted seven months later, but the United States Attorney in the case claimed Rand won acquittal only after suppressing evidence which would have led to his conviction. Four years later, the NLRB asked a federal court to have James Rand Jr. held in contempt of court for continuing to obstruct court-ordered implementation of the NLRB's order forcing the company to recognize and bargain with the union. The charge was dropped when the company relented and began implementing the order.|$|E
50|$|There were violent {{confrontations}} between strikers and <b>strikebreakers,</b> {{but also}} between <b>strikebreakers</b> and guards when the terrified workers demanded {{the right to}} leave.

The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the <b>strikebreakers</b> into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the <b>strikebreakers.</b> A riot began as the <b>strikebreakers</b> attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the <b>strikebreakers</b> launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital.

[...] Ward had strong socialist sympathies and was a supporter of organized labor; the Boy expresses this union solidarity by abandoning the only job he could find rather than work as a <b>strikebreaker.</b>|$|E
500|$|Idaho, {{a mining}} state, was fraught with labor tensions, and {{violence}} was not uncommon. [...] In 1899, {{there was a}} strike, and {{a large group of}} miners dynamited facilities belonging to a mining company that refused to recognize the union. [...] The explosion killed no one, but the mob of miners that had come by hijacked train to destroy the company's plant shot and killed a <b>strikebreaker.</b> Governor Frank Steunenberg declared martial law and had more than one thousand miners arrested. [...] Paul Corcoran, secretary of the union, was placed on trial for murder and Borah was engaged as a prosecutor in a trial that began at Wallace on July 8, 1899. Prosecution witnesses testified to seeing Corcoran sitting on top of the train, rifle in hand, and later leap to the platform. [...] The defense contended that given the sharp curves and rough roadbed of the rail line, no one could have sat on top of the train, nor jump from it without severe injury. Borah used his skills as a teenage rail rider to ride the top of the train, and jump from it to the platform without injury. [...] Corcoran was convicted, but his death sentence was commuted, and he was pardoned in 1901, after Steunenberg left office. [...] Borah gained wide acclaim for his actions.|$|E

2500|$|When {{non-union}} {{workers were}} deported, {{it was usually}} unclear if such deportations were directed or sanctioned by union officials, or were done by union members acting on their own. Deportations by union members were most commonly done to individuals or small groups of strikebreakers, or new arrivals regarded as potential strikebreakers, and driven away by threats or beatings.

2500|$|Tensions between strikers {{and those}} who worked {{continued}} after the return to work. Many strikebreakers left the industry and were shunned or attacked by other miners. Almost all the strikebreakers in Kent had left the industry by April 1986, after suffering numerous attacks on their homes. [...] At Betteshanger Colliery, posters were put up with photographs and names of the thirty strikebreakers. [...] A wildcat strike at South Kirkby Colliery was supported by neighbouring Ferrymoor-Riddings on 30 April 1985 after four men were dismissed for attacks on strikebreakers, and another wildcat strike occurred at Hatfield Colliery in April 1986 after it emerged {{that there was a}} <b>strikebreaker</b> had not been transferred away from the pit.

If workers tried to quit, the Coal and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work.

2500|$|After a few days, however, this stance {{was changed}} and terror was introduced. The change was also {{spurred by the}} actions of the peasants themselves, who had become more radical.

In some cases, radical activists attacked houses of the strikebreakers. In the course of the time, the strike turned into an uprising, which was noticed by activists of the Polish Communist Party, who appeared in the area, with their propaganda (in their appeal to the nation, the communist stated [...] "Let the cities and villages die! Long live the nationwide strike! They will not arrest millions"). First skirmishes took place in the area of JarosÅ‚aw on August 17, where members of the Peasants' Order Guard fought the police. On the same day, in Grebow near Tarnobrzeg, first peasant was killed. In response, the peasants blocked the main road of southern Poland, route KrakÃ³w - LwÃ³w (in the area of Brzesko), where transport of all goods was halted. Local police commandant wrote in his report: [...] "On the roads and in their vicinity there are gangs of peasants armed with knives, sticks, perhaps guns. We are defenseless against them. Today, they have formed a march of around 500, which started from Wielka Wies. On the way, more people joined them. Economy in our area has been completely paralyzed. We are requesting help and awaiting orders". General Marian Kukiel wrote to Wladyslaw Sikorski: [...] "The police are completely exhausted. There are losses. There are no police units in KrakÃ³w.

Wattles later wrote a booklet about the events entitled A Crime Against Labor: A brief history of the Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Strike, 1909.

2500|$|Thatcher was {{committed}} to reducing {{the power of the}} trade unions but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched strikes that were wholly or partly aimed at damaging her politically. [...] The most significant of these was carried out by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). However, Thatcher had made preparations long in advance for an NUM strike by building up coal stocks, and there were no cuts in electric power, unlike 1972. Police tactics during the strike concerned civil libertarians: stopping suspected strike sympathisers travelling towards coalfields when they were still long distances from them, phone tapping as evidenced by Labour's Tony Benn, and a violent battle with mass pickets at Orgreave, Yorkshire. But images of massed militant miners using violence to prevent other miners from working, along with the fact that (illegally under a recent Act) the NUM had not held a national ballot to approve strike action. Scargill's policy of letting each region of the NUM call its own strike backfired when nine areas held ballots that resulted in majority votes against striking, and violence against strikebreakers escalated with time until reaching a tipping point with the killing of David Wilkie (a taxi-driver who was taking a <b>strikebreaker</b> to work). The Miners' Strike lasted a full year, March 1984 until March 1985, before the drift of half the miners back to work forced the NUM leadership to give in without a deal. Thatcher had won a decisive victory and the unions never recovered their political power. This aborted political strike marked a turning point in UK politics: no longer could militant unions remove a democratically elected government. It also marked to beginning of a new economic and political culture in the UK based upon small government intervention in the economy and reduced dominance of the trade unions and welfare state.|$|E
2500|$|But {{his most}} {{important}} decision came in the 1994â€“95 Major League Baseball strike. Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) had negotiated contracts eight times, and each time a strike action of varying length had occurred. By the spring of 1994, {{the possibility of a}} strike was rising, as owners and players argued over a salary cap, revenue-sharing (which would [...] "tax" [...] the sport's top money-making teams and redistribute the funds to the weakest teams), and the extent of salary arbitration. The NLRB was closely monitoring the situation, (in no small part because Chairman Gould was an avid baseball fan). On July 28, the MLBPA set a deadline of August 12, 1994, for a new collective bargaining agreement or it would strike. The strike began on August 12, but despite the appointment of former Secretary of Labor William Usery, Jr. as a special mediator on October 13 the World Series was cancelled {{for the first time in}} history. On December 22, the owners unilaterally imposed a salary cap and eliminated salary arbitration. On Christmas Eve, MLB announced it would start spring training with <b>strikebreaker</b> players. Two days later, the owners and the players' association both filed unfair labor practice (ULP) complaints with the NLRB, with each side claiming the other had not negotiated in good faith. Meanwhile, the NLRB had initiated its own investigation into the strike (led by NLRB Regional Director Dan Silverman and NLRB General Counsel Fred Feinstein). The key issue for the board was whether the legal rules of negotiation had been followed. Under American labor law, the employer is permitted to implement its last offer if an impasse had been reached. But the two sides had been negotiating since November, and it was not entirely clear that an impasse had been reached. Congress was considering legislation to make baseball subject to United States antitrust law, and on January 26 President Bill Clinton announced that the two sides would have to make major progress to an agreement by February 6 or the federal government would intervene. On February 3, the owners unilaterally lifted their salary cap. But with no agreement even close, Usery hinted that he would recommend a legislative solution (perhaps removing the antitrust exemption, perhaps imposing binding arbitration) to the President. But Republicans in Congress (who had just won control of the House and Senate) signaled they would not enact any such legislation.|$|E
