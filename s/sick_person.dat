The Mountain Spirit {{dance was}} a masked dance, which was used for guidance or healing of a <b>sick</b> <b>person.</b> The masked dancers represented Mountain Spirits, who were believed by Yavapai to dwell in Four Peaks, McDowell Mountains, Red Mountain (near Fort McDowell), Mingus Mountain-(Black Hills) near Camp Verde, and Granite Mountain near present-day Prescott. The Yavapai also believe that the Mountain Spirits dwelled in the caves of Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well in the Verde Valley.|$|E

This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.|$|E
5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} persons in a cohort who are sick, over time. Methods: We calculated the number of <b>sick</b> <b>persons</b> in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a cohort study of older adults followed up to 14 years, using eight definitions of “healthy” and “sick”. We projected the number in each health state over time for a birth cohort. Results: The number of <b>sick</b> <b>persons</b> in CHS was approximately constant for 14 years, for all definitions of “sick”. The estimated number of <b>sick</b> <b>persons</b> in the birth cohort was approximately constant from ages 55 - 75, after which it decreased. Discussion: The relative excess of older <b>persons</b> who are <b>sick</b> in later life {{is caused by a}} {{decline in the number of}} healthy persons rather than an increase in the number who are sick.

5|$|On October 9, one {{day prior}} to Nicole forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale warning for the island. The agency also issued a Tropical Storm Watch {{shortly after the}} storm developed. All {{warnings}} were canceled after the storm passed the island. Winds on Bermuda peaked at 44mph (71km/h) in association with Nicole, while gusts peaked at 60mph (97km/h) prior to the storm developing. Nicole and the precursor extratropical storm dropped heavy precipitation, amounting to 5.86inches (148mm) over a three-day period at the Bermuda International Airport. Thunderstorms were also reported on the island. Poor weather conditions from Nicole forced the cancellation of several events at the tourist-driven Bermuda Music Festival, including acts by Isaac Hayes, Gerald Albright, and Anita Baker. Strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving over 1,800 homes and businesses without power. Unsettled conditions also resulted in airport delays. High winds delayed or altered the courses of four cruise ships. High waves of 10 to 12-foot (3 to 3.6 m) in height left several cruise ship passengers seasick; one <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> was rushed to a local hospital on Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|The ritual book on {{pastoral}} {{care of the}} sick provides three rites: anointing outside Mass, anointing within Mass, and anointing in a hospital or institution. The rite of anointing outside Mass begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction. There follows a penitential act, as {{at the beginning of}} Mass. If the <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> must confess during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany is said, and the priest lays his hands on the head of the <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> and then says a prayer of thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.|$|E

25|$|Pentecostals {{believe that}} prayer is central in {{receiving}} healing. Pentecostals look to scriptures such as James 5:13–16 for direction regarding healing prayer.

Verses 14–16 supply the framework for congregational healing prayer.

25|$|It is {{held that}} the cause of {{sickness}} is soul theft, in which someone (perhaps an enemy, whether human or a spirit) has stolen the soul of the <b>sick</b> <b>person.</b> It takes a spiritual healer to retrieve the stolen soul. The person remains alive because people have multiple souls, so stealing the appropriate soul causes illness or a moribund state rather than immediate death. According to another variant among Ammassalik in East Greenland, the joints of the body have their own small souls, the loss of which causes pain.|$|E
25|$|Deacons {{were not}} to be allowed to receive confessions or to provide penances, or to baptise except {{in the absence of a}} priest. Children had to be {{confirmed}} within a year of baptism. The Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer were to be learned in the mother tongue; priests were to celebrate mass in clean robes, to use a silver or golden chalice; thoroughly clean corporals and at least two consecrated palls were to be placed on the altar; the cross was to be planted in front of the celebrant; the bread was to be of the purest wheaten flour, the wine mixed with water. The elements {{were not to}} be kept more than seven days; when carried to a <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> to be enclosed in a pyx, and the priest to be preceded by a cross; a candle, holy water and bell.|$|E
25|$|Since it was {{perceived}} by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, {{it was important that}} the healer inquire about details of the past of the <b>sick</b> <b>person.</b> This was done in a methodological fashion, first inquiring about ascriptive attributes, followed by specific events of the person’s life, and lastly about circumstantial or acquired attributes. This aspect of the medicine man’s job would be similar to a modern-day therapy session. In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the medicine man had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used. After studying the symptoms of a sickness, a medicine man may prescribe a remedy to his patient. The number of times or days that the remedy should be ingested or applied depended on an individual’s gender; typically the number thirteen was associated with men, and the number nine with women.|$|E

25|$|One pottery {{tradition}} {{unique to}} the community {{is a set of}} figurines called a “juego de aire” (literally “air set”). This is a set of clay figures, which are used in ritual healing, especially of diseases associated with “bad air.” The last craftsperson to preserve the art of making these is Felipa Hernandez Barragan. The set demonstrates a ritual healing scene with one figure, representing the <b>sick</b> <b>person,</b> and another representing the “curandero” or shaman-healer with a bird in his hand at the center. Around them are various animals: a lizard, a millipede, a snake, a bull, a donkey, a spider, a scorpion and a frog, each of which has a cigarette tied to its back. These animals represent the various aspects of nature. Tradition states that certain illnesses are due to “bad air” or to supernatural forces that become offended if certain courtesies are not observed. One of these courtesies is to greet and/or offer food to an ant hill when walking by. Another is to make offering in ravines and other places where water flows. Most of these beliefs have pre-Hispanic roots.|$|E
25|$|Service members {{requiring}} observation or care {{beyond the}} unit level are evacuated to facilities {{in close proximity}} to, but separate from the medical or surgical patients at the BAS, surgical support company in a central location (Marines) or forward support/division support or area support medical companies (Army) nearest the service members' unit. It is best to send Service members who cannot continue their mission and require more extensive respite to a central facility other than a hospital, unless no other alternative is possible. The Service member must be encouraged to continue to {{think of himself as}} a war fighter, rather than a patient or a <b>sick</b> <b>person.</b> The chain of command remains directly involved in the Service member's recovery and return to duty. The CSC team coordinates with the unit's leaders to learn whether the over-stressed individual was a good performer prior to the combat stress reaction, or whether he was always a marginal or problem performer whom the team would rather see replaced than returned. Whenever possible, representatives of the unit, or messages from the unit, tell the casualty that he is needed and wanted back. The CSC team coordinates with the unit leaders, through unit medical personnel or chaplains, any special advice on how to assure quick reintegration when the Service member returns to his unit.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} case {{investigated by the}} after the war, the KBZPNP commission requested the prosecution of the commanders of the 10th and 17th Divisions, which {{took part in a}} mass murder of several dozen Poles in the village of Włyń near Łódź. All cases of the murder of Polish civilians in that village were turned down by the German prosecutors' office on 22 April 1974. The German authorities argued, that it is not impossible that all the civilians trying to escape from the German forces were in fact partisans. This was the reasoning in the case of certain Ochecki who was shot to death while trying to rescue his cattle from a barn set in flames by the German soldiers. The German authorities argued that it was fair to assume {{that he was trying to}} escape from the German soldiers. The same reasoning was given in the case of a mentally <b>sick</b> <b>person</b> shot the same day. In the case of Wawrzyn Piecyk, who was killed while being wounded and unconscious, it was argued that he might have been pretending to be unconscious in order to escape from the German soldiers, while the case of Józef Jawor, a man who did not stop when requested to and instead hid in his house, where he was shot through the doors, was explained as a killing done during a fight. The case of Maria Konieczna, a deaf woman who was shot after not responding to a German soldier, was considered a common crime, while the killing of Józef Gałka was explained as legitimate, since a picture of his brother in Polish military uniform found in Gałka's wallet was a proof that he might have been a partisan himself. In the same decision, the German authorities declared that the patients of the mental institution in the town of Warta, killed by the soldiers of the 17th Division in the hospital and dressed in hospital pyjamas, were victims of a common crime rather than a war crime or a murder.|$|E
