25|$|Children with fragile X {{have very}} <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> spans, are hyperactive, and show {{hypersensitivity}} to visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory stimuli.

Children with FXS pull away from light touch and can find textures of materials to be irritating. Transitions from one location to another can be difficult for children with FXS. Behavioral therapy can be used to decrease the child’s sensitivity in some cases.|$|E

25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

The anime received a mostly positive review from Bradley Meek THEM Anime Reviews. Bradley appreciated the animation, saying that [...] "It does wonders for the mood in the series, adding a tangible layer of mysticism and fantasy." [...] However, he criticized the series being [...] "cheesy and melodramatic more often than not." [...] He concluded the review saying, [...] "Despite some laughable melodrama, the raw emotions and Shaft's hypnotic animation makes ef ~a tale of memories~ a memorable romance.

500|$|Sesame Street {{reflected}} the prevailing view that preschoolers had <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> spans; it featured a magazine-like format consisting of varied segments. Based on research conducted over the 30 {{years since the}} launch of Sesame Street by theorists like Anderson, the producers of Blue's Clues wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but Blue's Clues {{was one of the}} first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected—for up to a half hour—and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional narrative format. As Variety magazine stated, [...] "...The choice for Blue's Clues became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page." [...] Every episode of Blue's Clues was structured in this way.|$|E
500|$|Speight {{was born}} in Seisdon, Staffordshire, {{and grew up in}} Tettenhall, Wolverhampton. Speight had two siblings, Tina-Louise Richmond (née Speight), and Jason Speight. His father, Oliver Warwick Speight, is a {{property}} developer, and his mother, Jacqueline Fordham Speight (née Parker), was an art teacher. Jacqueline died on 5 September 2008, aged 62, from a stroke allegedly brought on by the stress of her son's death. Speight attended the independent school Tettenhall College for a year, before moving to state comprehensive Regis School, now known as King's C.E. School, also in Tettenhall, at the age of 12. Speight stated in an interview he was a slow learner at school, with a <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span, and art was a way for him to communicate. He said he did [...] "very badly" [...] because he was a victim of bullying, and the [...] "daily ordeal for two years" [...] forced him to become the [...] "class joker". Speight left aged 16 and went on to attend Bilston Art School, where he took a degree in commercial and graphic art.|$|E
50|$|Young {{children}} have <b>shorter</b> <b>attention</b> spans so booktalks {{must be kept}} brief. Older children and teens are able to focus and sit at attention {{for longer periods of}} time and so booktalk presentations can be built in to fit within one class period (30-45 minutes). Within this timeframe 15-20 booktalks that are 2-3 minutes in length can be presented. The presenter will want to appeal to as many students as possible so the individual booktalks should consist of many genres.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{attribute}} {{the success of}} the show to its short length of 30 minutes, thus appealing to younger audience with <b>shorter</b> <b>attention</b> span. Also, the show was broadcast online and allowed viewers to post comments and discuss the storyline with others, making the watching experience more interactive. The transgender angle also makes the series more topical, helping break down barriers in discussing gender change and homosexuality. Oppositely, the series has been criticized for being [...] "lousy" [...] and appealing to [...] "low-brow tastes".|$|R

[...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E
500|$|Wentz {{referred}} to [...] "I Don't Care" [...] as a [...] "narcissist's anthem" [...] {{that addresses the}} current generation's <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span.

It's totally about 'Oh, I'm sad. I want this. I know somebody who knows this person. Me me me me me,' so that's what that song is about." [...] Additionally, [...] "America's Suitehearts" [...] discusses society's fixation with celebrities {{and the desire to}} let them do no wrong. [...] "27" [...] explores the hedonistic lifestyles common in rock and roll music. The title is a reference to the 27 Club, a group of influential musicians, including Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, and Jim Morrison, who all {{died at the age of}} 27. Wentz felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle, and was [...] "stoked" [...] to make it to his 28th birthday. Stump added [...] "There was a countdown clock and everything.

500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E

5000|$|In today’s {{interconnected}} world, {{communication and}} electronic devices {{have a huge}} effect on the micro-cellular structure and complex bio-chemistry of our brains which eventually affects our personality, behavior and characteristics. A research conducted by Harvard medical school, highlighted the power of human imagination and the structural changes it causes to the human brain at the micro-cellular level thus bringing about changes in character personality or behaviour.

500|$|Comedian Jon Stewart {{took over}} as host of the show, which was retitled The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, on January 11, 1999. Stewart had {{previously}} hosted <b>Short</b> <b>Attention</b> Span Theater on Comedy Central, two shows on MTV (You Wrote It, You Watch It and an eponymous talk show), {{as well as a}} syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television. In taking over hosting from Kilborn, Stewart initially retained much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like [...] "God Stuff", with John Bloom presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and [...] "Backfire", an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of [...] "This Week in God" [...] and Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell's [...] "Even Stevphen". Since the change, a number of new features have been, and continue to be, developed. The ending segment [...] "Your Moment of Zen", previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show. The show's theme music, [...] "Dog on Fire" [...] by Bob Mould, was re-recorded by They Might Be Giants shortly after Stewart joined the show.|$|E
500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind when things go badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a [...] "superb example" [...] of political satire, [...] "demonstrating the lengths people will go to to win votes. Marge, of course, sees straight through Burns and uses Blinky the three-eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction." [...] Phil Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Daily News called the episode a [...] "wonderful stab" [...] at American politics and the [...] "media machine that drives it", and added: [...] "The message is so subtle, the makers of The Simpsons might deny it is there at all for fear of turning off a portion of its audience. Truth is, you {{may very well be}} so busy laughing and taking in the fine details, such as the references to Citizen Kane, to notice." [...] Hal Boedeker of The Miami Herald said the episode took [...] "some well-aimed satirical jabs at American politics and the publics' <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span. The episode has the wit of the best of All in the Family, and benign mother Marge becomes a force for good, in the Edith Bunker tradition." [...] Virginia Mann of The Record called the episode [...] "terrific", though she believed its social and political [...] "overtones" [...] were more likely to appeal to adults than children. Tom Shales of the Washington Post described the episode as [...] "a bull's-eye political satire".|$|E
5000|$|The {{practice}} of mindfulness {{is taught in}} offices, prisons and the military, and in schools. [...] In the UK, {{the focus of the}} Mindfulness in Education movement has been on taking mindfulness programmes into secondary schools, where the approach has been shown to help in managing exam stress. Engaging young children with mindfulness requires an experienced approach that takes into account their <b>shorter</b> <b>attention</b> spans and emotional development. Dharma Primary School integrates mindfulness, as a deeper Buddhist ethos, for very young children. The practice may be of benefit to children during their primary school years when the brain’s limbic system (that controls emotion and behaviour) is still developing; scientific research has shown that core life skills, emotional literacy and personality traits formed during this crucial period help determine how we will function as adults.|$|R

500|$|Max is an {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "hyperkinetic, three-foot rabbity thing" [...] {{with white}} fur, but prefers {{being called a}} lagomorph. Max retains few characteristics consistent with a rabbit, with permanently rigid ears set in an excited posture and a huge jaw normally stuck in a crazed grin. Unhinged, uninhibited and near psychotic, Max enjoys violence and tends to prefer the aggressive way of solving problems, seeing the world {{as little more than}} a vessel for his [...] "pinball-like stream of consciousness". This creates a seeming disregard for self-preservation; Max will revel in dangerous situations with little impression that he understands the risks he faces. As a result, Max is usually enthusiastic to engage in any activity, including being used by Sam as a cable cutter or an impromptu bludgeon. Despite this, Max possesses a sharp mind and an observational nature, and enjoys interpreting new experiences in as unpredictable manner as possible. However, Max has a distaste for long stories and occasionally loses focus during lengthy scenes of plot exposition; by his own admission, Max possesses a particularly <b>short</b> <b>attention</b> span. Despite his seemingly heartless personality, he believes strongly in protecting Sam. However, Max can still act violently towards his friend, stating that when he dies he will take Sam with him. Moreover, Max is extremely possessive of Sam and their status as partners and best friends. Max traditionally carries a Luger pistol, but as he wears no clothes, other characters often make comments as to where Max keeps it on his person. Purcell considers Max to be representative of pure id, the uncoordinated instinctual trends of the human psyche.|$|E
