40|$|Model-scale {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} fire spread where the fire sources are placed in an open area, near a wall, under a ceiling, and under a ceiling with a <b>suspended</b> <b>wall.</b> The time required for a fire to spread between five liquid fuel pools arranged linearly is measured by igniting the central pool. The extension of the flames on a wall accelerates the fire spread; however, when the fire sources are placed away from the wall, the rate of fire spread is almost the same or is slightly lower than that in an open area. When the flames impinge continuously or they enter the smoke layer, the rate of fire spread increases significantly. Simple calculation methods are developed {{and the results are}} in fair agreement with the results of the experiments under a ceiling with <b>suspended</b> <b>wall...</b>|$|E

40|$|Microporous {{structures}} {{are central to}} many fields of science and engineering, {{but many of these}} systems are complex with little or no symmetry and are difficult to fabricate. We applied two-photon polymerization (2 PP) and femtosecond laser direct-writing techniques to fabricate broad-area large-format 3 D microporous structures (450 mu m x 450 mu m x 40 mu m) in the epoxy-based photoresist SU- 8. The appropriate exposure was determined by controlling average pulse energies and stage speeds to generate the exposure curves. Mechanical distortion exhibited in <b>suspended</b> <b>walls</b> fabricated by 2 PP laser writing was studied by controlling wall lengths and widths. A simple thermal-expansion model is presented to explain the distortion caused by axial loadings of the walls...|$|R

40|$|Several coastal bridges {{have been}} {{destroyed}} by historic and recent hurricanes. Currently no guidelines exist {{for the design of}} bridge superstructures when subjected to the action of waves. This document presents an introduction to weather and hurricanes, fundamental concepts of water waves, and a compilation of available sources of information that contain information related to forces produced by waves acting on engineering structures such as sea <b>walls,</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>walls,</b> and bridge decks. A section on the parameters most relevant to the design of bridge superstructures against hurricane waves is included in this document. This report provides a synthesis of data found in several historical databases and database maintained regularly by government organizations and research laboratories. A methodology to update the database is also presented. A plan of action to develop design methodology is also included and followed by a chapter on benefits of expanding this research beyond the synthesis stage.

Reliable production of high-performance SWNT FETs has been obtained by combining patterned growth of SWNT arrays with feed-back controlled electrical breakdown to select desired semiconducting SWNTs, making large-scale SWNT FET fabrication achievable. P-type and n-type passivated SWNT FETs have been realized through dopant-selective nanotube coatings, which enables the fabrication of active circuits based on complementary device structures.
