40|$|A {{number of}} psychophysical {{studies have shown}} that moving stimuli appear to last longer than static stimuli. Here, we report that the {{perceived}} duration for slow moving stimuli can be shorter than for static stimuli under specific circumstances. Observers were tested using natural movies presented at various speeds (0. 0 × = static, 0. 25 × = slow, or 1. 9 × = fast, relative to original speed) and indicated whether test duration was perceived as longer or shorter than comparison movies presented at their original speed. While fast movies were perceived as longer than <b>slow</b> and static <b>movies</b> (in accordance with previous studies), we found that <b>slow</b> <b>movies</b> were perceived as shorter (i. e., time compressed) compared to static images. Similar results were obtained for artificial stimuli consisting of drifting gratings. However, time compression for slow stimuli disappeared if comparison stimuli were replaced by a white static disk that removed repetitive exposures to moving stimuli. Results suggest that duration estimation is modulated by contextual effects induced by the specific diet – or distribution – of prior visual stimuli to which observers are exposed. A simple model, which includes a rapid recalibration of human time estimation via adaptation to preceding stimuli, succeeds in reproducing our experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{comparative}} data reveal that formant frequencies are cues to body size in animals, {{due to a}} close relationship between formant frequency spacing, vocal tract length and overall body size. Accordingly, intriguing morphological adaptations to elongate the vocal tract in order to lower formants occur in several species, with the size exaggeration hypothesis being proposed to justify most of these observations. While the elephant trunk is strongly implicated {{to account for the}} low formants of elephant rumbles, it is unknown whether elephants emit these vocalizations exclusively through the trunk, or whether the mouth is also involved in rumble production. In this study we used a sound visualization method (an acoustic camera) to record rumbles of five captive African elephants during spatial separation and subsequent bonding situations. Our results showed that the female elephants in our analysis produced two distinct types of rumble vocalizations based on vocal path differences: a nasally- and an orally-emitted rumble. Interestingly, nasal rumbles predominated during contact calling, whereas oral rumbles were mainly produced in bonding situations. In addition, nasal and oral rumbles varied considerably in their acoustic structure. In particular, the values of the first two formants reflected the estimated lengths of the vocal paths, corresponding to a vocal tract length of around 2 meters for nasal, and around 0. 7 meters for oral rumbles. These results suggest that African elephants may be switching vocal paths to actively vary vocal tract length (with considerable variation in formants) according to context, and call for further research investigating the function of formant modulation in elephant vocalizations. Furthermore, by confirming the use of the elephant trunk in long distance rumble production, our findings provide an explanation for the extremely low formants in these calls, and may also indicate that formant lowering functions to increase call propagation distances in this species’. Since two authors (Gunnar Heilman and Sean Hensman) are employed commercial companies the authors want to declare that they did not pay for using the equipment nor for doing research with the elephant at Bela Bela. Therefore, both companies had no financial interest concerning the research. The fact that these authors are employed by these companies does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. üšê½Movie S 1 Nasal rumble- 25 fps-sound: Sound visualization of a nasal rumble.

Figure S 1 Spectrograms and power spectra presenting two examples of rumbling vocalizations from a 29 year old female African elephant (Drumbo) recorded at the Vienna Zoo in 2003. Recordings were captured with a condenser microphone AKG 480 B CK 62 and a DA-P 1 DAT recorder. Figures A and B show a rumble recorded during spatial separation from a part of the group, and display the formant structure of a typical nasal rumble. Figures C and D show a rumble recorded during a bonding situation when the group was reunited, and resemble an orally emitted rumble based on the observed formant values. Figure S 2 Spectrograms and power spectra to show examples of rumbles from a 43 year old female African elephant (Jumbo) recorded at the Vienna Zoo in 2003 (using the same equipment as described in Figure S 1). Figures A and B also show a rumble recorded during spatial separation from the group, again with the formant structure of a typical nasal rumble. Figures C and D show a rumble recorded during the bonding situation when the group was reunited, again resembling an orally emitted rumble based on the formant values. Jumbo died in 2004 and her oral vocal tract was measuring at 93 cm (Weissengruber, personal communication). The formants 1 and 2 of the oral vocal tract would thus be (using equation 3) 92 Hz and 277 Hz, which corresponds very well with the formant location observed in Figures C and D.
