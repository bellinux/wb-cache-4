Elizabeth Holloway declared how Chaloner had bribed her husband, the coiner Thomas Holloway, {{to flee to}} Scotland and avoid giving evidence at the 1697 trial. Thomas Taylor the engraver in the major coining conspiracy. Catherine Carter, wife of Thomas Carter who had twice previously been named and blamed by Chaloner, testified to Chaloner's skill as a forger and {{his role in the}} lottery scam.|$|E
500|$|Eddy {{first used}} mental healing on {{a patient in}} March 1864, when one of Quimby's {{patients}} in Portland, Mary Ann Jarvis, suffered a relapse when she returned home to Warren, Maine. Eddy stayed with her for two months, giving Jarvis mental healing to ease a breathing problem, and writing to Quimby six times for absent treatment for herself. She called the latter [...] "angel visits"; {{in one of her}} letters to Quimby, she said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in her room. In April she gave a public lecture in Warren, contrasting mental healing with Spiritualism, entitled: [...] "P. P. Quimby's Spiritual Science healing disease, as opposed to Deism or Rochester Rapping Spiritualism." ...|$|E
500|$|The Billboard {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review for its moving story of true love {{shown by the}} actors playing the blind wife and facially disfigured husband. The reviewer {{also noted that the}} photography was up to the usual high standard of Thanhouser releases. The Moving Picture World opened with the declaration that, [...] "When this picture is past, the wonder will linger long in the memory whether the wife would have loved her husband just the same if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in the short time when her affliction was alleviated. And it must be admitted that the producers have added materially to the dramatic interest of the film by leaving that question unanswered." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror review praised the film for its photography, setting and acting, but highlighted technical inconsistencies in the progression of the fire and the overly drawn out struggle of the father in the smoke. Walton of The Moving Picture News also praised the film, stating that [...] "The situations are well handled; the acting of the principals shows the true grip of the characters. The work of this firm of late has been not only artistic but throbbing with that clean, human life which is winning high praise." [...] In local papers, the film was reviewed positively by theater advertisements, owing to the sentimental nature of the film and the technical execution of the fire scene.|$|E

50|$|Holder and Linden ask Adrian's adoptive mother, Tess Clarke (Ingrid Torrance), if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> grows worried {{when his}} {{backpack}} {{is found in}} the house and the back door is open. Adrian is missing.|$|R

6000|$|Our heroine thought, recollected {{there was}} something, {{whatever}} it was, {{that she knew}} after all much more of than Mrs. Jordan. She saw him again as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> come that morning to recover the telegram--she saw him as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> leave the shop. She perched herself a moment on this. [...] "Oh there was nothing public." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eleanor {{put on her}} happiest face as {{she heard}} her father on the stairs, for {{she thought she had}} only to congratulate him; but {{directly}} she saw his face she knew that there was but little matter for congratulation. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> with the same weary look of sorrow on one or two occasions before, and remembered it well. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> when he first read that attack upon himself in [...] "The Jupiter" [...] which had ultimately caused him to resign the hospital, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> also when the archdeacon had persuaded him to remain there against his own sense of propriety and honour. She knew at a glance that his spirit was in deep trouble.|$|E
60|$|As he wept Swanhild came to him, for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> from afar, {{and touched}} him {{gently on the}} arm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first time}} she sees Ryu, she feels that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> somewhere, but cannot {{remember}} (which, she feels is odd, since <b>she</b> <b>has</b> photographic memory). It turns out that both <b>she</b> and Ryu <b>had</b> studies at the okyo National Talent Development Research Center.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{will she}} love me? Oh! no, no, no! She will think only of him. She will not love her mother. She will yearn {{for her father}} now. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>she</b> will not rest until she is in his arms. She will desert me, I know it.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> indeed <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before, {{for it was}} {{no other}} than Reuben Butler himself.|$|R
60|$|Dinah {{always called}} Arthur so; {{she had never}} lost the image of him as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in the prison.|$|E
60|$|Mary talked, but {{she could}} not attend. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> They had met. They had been once more in the same room.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity {{these rooms}} are so small; we can't dance," [...] {{she said to}} Winterbourne, as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> five minutes before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> When a man dines at a {{house he}} is bound to call. Of course he has called,--I don't know how often. And <b>she</b> <b>has</b> met him round the corner."--"Round the corner," [...] in Manchester Square, meant Mrs. Roby's house in Berkeley Street.--"Last Sunday {{they were at the}} Zoo together. Dick got them tickets. I thought you knew all about it." ...|$|R
60|$|Little Dorrit {{gave him}} her hand, and smilingly said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> this long time.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her with {{gratitude}} and some embarrassment, which was something <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> show.|$|R
60|$|He {{had arrived}} late, {{and this was}} the first time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> since they had all gone their ways before Whitsun. He mixed himself a whisky and soda.|$|E
60|$|Claire roused; {{wanted to}} shout. She was palsied afraid that Milt would leave them. The last time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> she had {{suggested}} that leaving them would be a favor.|$|E
60|$|Allie {{looked at}} him steadily, {{as if this was}} the first time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> but she did not reply. And Larry, easily disconcerted, {{gathered}} up his burden and turned toward camp.|$|E
60|$|Alick's {{response}} was to bend over her, and kiss her brow. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> so much gratified.|$|R
6000|$|Over that glorious tea-table {{they became}} life-long friends. They {{had always known}} each other and always would. The Black Prince sat between them and was fed tit-bits. There was such {{a lot of good}} things on the table and nobody to say [...] "You have had enough, James." [...] James ate until he thought he had enough. Aunt Augusta would have thought he was doomed, could <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tess {{shook her}} head. But d'Urberville persisted; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seldom <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> so determined; {{he would not}} take a negative.|$|R
60|$|She {{knelt down}} on the hearth and took her friend's hands excitedly in her own. But after all she did not say when or how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> or what he had said.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the straw}} within, Winterborne {{lay in his}} clothes, just as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> during the whole of her stay here, except that his hat was off, and his hair matted and wild.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{under other}} aspects than the aspect which he {{presented}} now. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> {{the hero of}} the river-race, the first and foremost man in a trial of strength and skill which had roused the enthusiasm of all England. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> the central object of the interest of a nation; the idol of the popular worship and the popular applause. His were the arms whose muscle was celebrated in the newspapers. He was first among the heroes hailed by ten thousand roaring throats as the pride and flower of England. A woman, in an atmosphere of red-hot enthusiasm, witnesses the apotheosis of Physical Strength. Is it reasonable--is it just--to expect her to ask herself, in cold blood, What (morally and intellectually) is all this worth?--and that, when the man who is the object of the apotheosis, notices her, is presented to her, finds her to his taste, and singles her out from the rest? No. While humanity is humanity, the woman is not utterly without excuse.|$|E
60|$|The dog first {{attracted}} his attention; then {{he heard}} her, and turned round. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> looking so despondent.|$|R
60|$|Helen {{glanced at}} him with some {{surprise}} when {{he went back to}} the fence. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> look like that.|$|R
50|$|On January 3, 2012, James goes to Starr's {{house to}} warn her that Cole has broken {{out of prison}} and wonders if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> Starr assures him that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not, and James leaves. Later he returns, {{suspicious}} that Starr is hiding something. Sure enough, James walks in on Starr and Cole as they profess their love for one another. On January 10, realizing that Starr will never stop loving Cole, James breaks up with her.|$|R
60|$|Ross looked round for Virginia, {{but could}} not find her. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> come in, and {{was out in the}} kitchen doing what she could to have his food brought in and {{properly}} served.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not answer}} him at once. It was {{certainly}} better {{not to say that}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> driven rapidly away only a short time ago, with his horses' heads turned to Deringham Hall.|$|E
60|$|She had {{recognized}} him with reeling senses and through darkening eyes. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> leap before {{her father to}} confront that glittering-eyed Durade. She had neither fear for him nor pity for the Spaniard.|$|E
5|$|Liz {{is worried}} when she smells maple syrup in her {{apartment}} and Jack tells her {{that it could be}} the chemical agent Northrax. She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps in his apartment and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an agility course in the park. Liz is shocked to discover that the pair are auditioning for The Amazing Race and, in fact, not terrorists.|$|R
6000|$|She {{held her}} breath. She {{recognized}} the voice. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> fall. Was he pursuing her there dead, or perhaps [...] . alive? ...|$|R
60|$|Ursula {{looked at}} <b>him</b> closely. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> since Breadalby. He was very thin and hollow, with a ghastly {{look in his}} face.|$|R
