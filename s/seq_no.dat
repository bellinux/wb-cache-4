Little {{is known about the}} role of LBP in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Objectives: This study was to investigate the expression profile of LBP in gingival tissues under various periodontal conditions. Methods: Gingival biopsies were collected from 24 chronic periodontitis patients who underwent periodontal surgery. The samples included 22 periodontal pocket tissues (PoT) and 13 adjacent healthy gingival tissues (HT-P). Seven gingival tissue samples were obtained from 7 periodontally healthy controls (HT-C). LBP was detected by immunohistochemistry method. Results: LBP expressed in 20 of 22 PoTs, 11 of 13 HT-Ps and all HT-Cs. The expression of LBP was mainly confined to the cytoplasm of granular and keratinized layers of gingival epithelium, spreading from the oral sulcular epithelium to oral epithelium with the expression density decreasing gradually from coronal to apical portion. LBP was also found occasionally on endothelial surfaces and/or inside the lumen of blood vessels in connective tissues. Conclusions: We for the first time found the frequent expression of LBP in the cytoplasm of granular and keratinized cells of gingival epithelia in both healthy and periodontitis subjects. LBP was also detected in blood vessels of connective tissues. These findings suggest that LBP may {{play a crucial role in}} chronic periodontitis via the local expression and systemic circulation pathways. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 81 st General Session of the International Association for Dental Research, Goteborg, Sweden, 25 - 28 June 2003.

METHODS: Study was implemented in Guangzhou, China, in 2005. Primary molars with Class I caries lesions into dentine but not involving pulp in children aged 6 - 7 years were randomly allocated into one of two treatment groups: 1) glass ionomer restoration using the ART technique, and 2) caries arrest treatment by annual topical applications of SDF solution. Treatments were provided in school using hand instruments only. The treated teeth were clinically assessed every 6 months by two calibrated examiners using caries probes, disposable mouth mirrors and an intra-oral LED light source. ART treatment was classified as successful if the restoration was intact and had no major defects. SDF treatment was classified as successful if the treated lesion became arrested. For both treatments, failure was recorded if there was pain in the treated teeth, the tooth being non-vital, or received other treatments. RESULTS: At baseline, 67 and 73 Class I caries lesions in 103 children were treated with ART restoration and SDF application respectively. Three-quarters of the treated lesions (n= 105) were followed for 30 months. The 12 -month success rate of ART restorations was {{higher than that of}} SDF treatment (87 % vs. 63 %, p 0. 05). After 30 months, a higher success rate was obtained in the SDF treated teeth than the ART restorations (80 % vs. 54 %, p= 0. 004). CONCLUSION: The success rate of ART restorations started with a high value and decreased gradually while that of SDF treatment had increased throughout the study after annual applications. link_to_OA_fulltextThe IADR 86 th General Session & Exhibition, Toronto, Canada, 2 - 5 July 2008...|$|E

Children with parental consent were clinically examined in kindergartens by two calibrated examiners using intra-oral LED lights, mouth-mirrors and CPI probes. Diagnostic criteria for dental caries followed the recommendations by the World Health Organization. Oral hygiene was recorded by the visible plaque index (VPI). A questionnaire on the child's demographic background and oral health related behaviors was completed by the parents. RESULTS: A total of 579 children from 15 kindergartens were invited and 531 children were examined. Response rate was 91. 7 %. Their mean age was 44 months (SD= 4) and 55. 6 % of them were boys. Their prevalence of dental caries experience was 28. 6 %. The mean dmfs score was 1. 26, and active decay (ds) accounted for 96. 4 % of the score. Higher dmfs scores were found in children who had frequent intake of sweet snacks, 3 times or more a day, {{compared to those who}} had not (1. 1 vs. 2. 6, p 50 %).

Abstract no 0632 OBJECTIVES: Silver diammine {{fluoride}} (SDF) {{is used as}} an anticaries agent; however, its mode {{of action}} is uncertain, whether chemical, physical or mechanical. As a preliminary study, the effect of SDF on hydroxyapatite (HAp) and gelatine (as a chemical equivalent of collagen) was examined. METHODS: 2. 5 mg HAp powder specimens and 0. 5 mL 10 % gelatine (Riedel-de Haën) (initially as a sol at 37 °C), were mixed with 0. 5 mL of 38 % SDF (J. Morita), 4 % NaF (Sigma) or 40 % AgNO 3 (Sigma) and tumbled in 1. 5 mL polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt) for 48 h at 23 °C, in two series: exposed to laboratory lighting, and kept dark at all times. The HAp specimens were separated by centrifugation and decanting, then these and one set of gelatine specimens were dried at 60 °C in situ; a second parallel set of gelatine specimens were dried at 23 °C. Each was washed with 1 mL deionized water for 1 min, 3 times. Treated materials were observed, before and after washing, with Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM, TEM); Energy-Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). RESULTS: SDF appeared to produce globular particles of CaF 2 {{on the surface of the}} HAp, but these disappeared on washing, while with AgNO 3 yellow cubic crystals of Ag 3 PO 4 formed, not dissolved on washing, which darkened, converting gradually to metallic silver, on exposure to light. NaF had no effect on gelatine, while with SDF and AgNO 3 particles of silver were produced which were resistant to washing. CONCLUSIONS: Both principal components of tooth tissue react with SDF; the solubility of the putative CaF 2 formed weakens the case for it exerting a caries-protective effect. The importance of the persistent silver needs further study. The 86 th General Session & Exhibition of the International Association of Dental Research (IADR), Toronto, Canada, 1 - 5 July 2008...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary molars with caries lesions into dentine but not involving pulp in 218 primary school children aged 6 - 7 years in Guangdong Province, China, were randomly allocated into one of two treatment groups: 1) restored with glass ionomer using the ART technique, and 2) caries arrest treatment by annual topical applications with SDF solution. The treatments were provided in school using hand instruments only. The treated teeth were clinically assessed every 6 months by two calibrated examiners. ART treatment was classified as successful if the restoration was intact and had no major defects or secondary caries. SDF treatment was classified as successful if the treated lesion became arrested, i. e. surface hard on probing with a sharp explorer using a light force. For both treatments, failure was recorded if there was pain in the treated teeth, the tooth being non-vital, or received other treatments. RESULTS: At baseline, 240 and 228 caries lesions were treated with ART restoration and SDF application respectively. After 12 months, 98. 2 % and 92. 5 % of the ART and the SDF treated lesions were assessed, respectively.

METHODS: Primary incisors {{that were going to}} exfoliate in children who participated in a 30 -month clinical trial of SDF treatment were extracted after obtaining parental consent. Eight collected teeth, four had arrested caries and the other four had soft caries, were sectioned longitudinally along the midline of the carious lesion. On one half, the hardness of the carious lesions was measured by Knoop indenter on a micro-hardness tester using 5 -gram force for 10 seconds. Distribution of silver ions in the SDF treated lesion was observed using backscattered electron (BSE) imaging on the other half. RESULTS: The median Knoop Hardness (KH) in clinically diagnosed arrested caries was found to be more than 40 in the outer 50 μm of the lesion. It then lay mostly in the range of 20 to 30 at points deeper than 50 μm from the surface. The KH of soft dentine caries was below 10 in the outer 50 μm of the lesion and was less than 15 in the outer 100 μm. It then gradually increased to 20 at 200 μm from the surface. BSE image found a continuous layer of silver ions deposited {{on the surface of the}} caries lesion treated with SDF. Most silver ions were located in the outer 200 μm and only a trace of silver ions was found beyond 500 μm from the surface of the lesion. CONCLUSION: The Knoop Hardness in clinically diagnosed arrested dentine caries was higher than that of soft caries in the outer 100 μm of the surface.

There {{is a need to}} develop safe systems compared to viral gene delivery methods plagued with safety concerns. The objective {{of this study is to}} design a non-viral gene delivery for bone regeneration based on the long proven calcium phosphate systems whose biocompatibility and safety is well documented. We have uniquely synthesized a composite comprising fibrin gel and nanosized calcium phosphates (NanoCaPs) as a gene delivery carrier. METHODS: Fibrin gel matrix was synthesized in the presence of NanoCaPs and 100 μg of plasmid DNA (pDNA). The complex fibrin/NanocaPs/pDNA was implanted in the hind-leg muscle of C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. We initially used the luciferase reporter gene to determine the optimal concentration of NanoCaPs that would provide the best transfection efficiency. We assessed five different concentrations of NanoCaPs (1 X, 2 X, 3 X, 4. 5 X and 6 X). At days 5 and 10 post-implantation, the tissues were collected and luciferase expression was quantified. We then incorporated the BMP- 7 gene as the pDNA encoding for an osteoinductive agent.. The implant was assessed at week 1, 2, 4 and 8 following the implantation for bone formation employing radiography, micro-CT scan and histological assessment. RESULTS: At day 5 post-implantation, luciferase assay showed a significant increase in gene transfection when 3 X NanoCaPs complexed with pDNA was used compared to the other concentrations of NanoCaPs or controls. The X-ray analysis demonstrated ectopic bone formation at 4 and 8 weeks post-implantation. Micro-CT scan also showed that NanoCaPs complexed with BMP- 7 pDNA increased the volume of the new deposited bone at weeks 4 and 8 as compared with BMP- 7 without NanoCaPs. CONCLUSION: Nanostructured calcium phosphates can be a safe alternative gene delivery system for bone regeneration. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

ANOVA was applied to study severity of subjective dry-mouth symptoms on dental satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean unstimulated salivary flow-rate and the mean stimulated salivary flow-rate were 0. 18 ml/min and 0. 55 ml/min respectively with 83 % and 51 % of them below the norm. More than half of them had both reduced. The mean unstimulated salivary pH was 6. 9 while the stimulated salivary pH was 7. 1. There were significantly more people with reduced salivary flow-rates dissatisfied with their oral health (p= 0. 05). The mean XI score was 24. 6. Twenty-four (59 %) people had a score higher than the reported norm, i. e. with subjective symptoms of dry mouth. The most common symptom (41 %) noted by them was ‘The skin of my face feels dry'. CONCLUSIONS: About half of the Chinese people with scleroderma had reduced salivary flow-rates. Both unstimulated and stimulated salivary pH was either within or higher than normal range and 59 % of them had subjective symptoms of mouth dryness. Reduced salivary flow-rates were associated with dissatisfaction of oral health. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 22 nd International Association for Dental Research (SEA Division) & 19 th South East Asia Association for Dental Education, Manila, Philippines, 8 - 10 October 2008...|$|E

METHODS: Thirty-seven SSc adults (36 females; aged 21 - 76 years, mean 51. 2 ± 11. 9) attending a teaching hospital, and 37 age- and sex-matched controls who were systemically healthy attending a dental hospital were surveyed. RESULTS: Twenty-three (31. 1 %) of all subjects were regular dental attenders. Both groups showed similar demographies except that more in the SSc group were housewives (p= 0. 02). Both groups had similar numbers of standing teeth (control vs test: 23. 7 ± 6. 0, 24. 9 ± 5. 2), plaque % (66. 0 ± 14. 5 % vs. 68. 1 ± 21. 0 %), and mean full-mouth probing attachment level (PAL in mm: 3. 10 ± 1. 24 vs. 3. 15 ± 0. 82), while controls had less bleeding on probing (BOP%: 49. 4 ± 25. 6 % vs. 77. 1 ± 14. 6 %, p < 0. 0001) and shallower mean full-mouth probing pocket depth (PPD in mm: 1. 96 ± 0. 46 vs. 2. 47 ± 0. 54, p < 0. 0001). In particular, the SSc subjects had higher percentage sites with PPD 4 - 5 mm (control vs. test: 4. 57 ± 5. 30 % vs. 13. 29 ± 15. 10 %, p= 0. 0018). CONCLUSIONS: Hong Kong Chinese SSc adults while experiencing similar levels of plaque and PAL, exhibited greater periodontal inflammation and a greater prevalence PPD sites 4 - 5 mm than age- and sex-matched controls. Further studies are warranted to investigate associations between periodontal disease features and the systemic sclerosis state. link_to_OA_fulltext第二届国际牙科研究学会(IADR) 泛亚洲太平洋联盟(Pan-Asia Pacific Federation) 会议、第一届国际牙科研究学会亚洲太平洋地区(Asia-Pacific Region, APR) 、暨中国分会第十届科技年会, 中国, 武汉, 2009 年 9 月 22 - 24 日.

Purpose and procedures {{of this study were}} explained to the participants and written consents were obtained. This study consisted of a questionnaire survey and a clinical examination. Oral hygiene habit, knowledge and attitude towards dental care service utilization were assessed using the questionnaire. Periodontal condition and caries experience were assessed in the clinical examination. RESULTS: Seven hundred people participated in this study. The male to female ratio was about 1 to 1, {{with a mean age of}} 18. 8 +/- 0. 7 years. Oral health care knowledge was considered adequate. Most of them (84 %) practiced tooth brushing twice daily, while a quarter of them had flossing habit. Forty-four percent of the participants had not visited a dentist for more than 3 years, while 33 % had regular dental visit within a year, in which most of them were female. The mean DMFT score was 0. 32 and most of them (80 %) had no caries experience. Calculus was found in 86 % of the participants, amongst which 2. 3 % had shallow periodontal pockets. Young men were found to have higher DMFT (p= 0. 04) and poorer periodontal status (p= 0. 003) than young women. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of caries in young adults in Hong Kong was low and most of them had good oral health practices. Despite adequate oral health care knowledge, their attitude towards oral health care utilization needs to be improved. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 22 nd International Association for Dental Research (SEA Division) & 19 th South East Asia Association for Dental Education, Manila, Philippines, 8 - 10 October 2008...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral, Epidemiologic, and Health Services Research: <b>Seq.</b> <b>no.</b> 195 - Health Services Research I: {{abstract}} no. 1904 OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate the}} cost and effectiveness of four methods in preventing fissure caries in permanent teeth, namely: 1) a single application of resin fissure sealant (FS), 2) a single application of atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) sealant, 3) application of sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish every six months, and 4) annual application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution. METHODS: Children studying in grades 1 - 3 in two primary schools in Shenzhen, China, were clinically examined. Permanent first molars with deep occlusal fissures or fissures with signs of early caries were selected and randomly allocated {{into one of the}} above four groups. All included teeth in {{the same side of the}} mouth of a child received the same treatment. Follow-up examinations at 6 -month intervals were conducted by a single trained examiner using caries probes, disposable mouth-mirrors, and an intra-oral LED light source. Status of the molars and the sealants was recorded, especially the presence of caries into dentine, i. e. at the cavitation level. RESULTS: A total of 423 molars in 161 children (mean age 7. 9 years) were treated at baseline, and 396 (93. 6 %) of the teeth were examined after 18 months. No significant difference in effectiveness among the four caries preventive methods was found. The effectiveness were 97. 3 % for FS, 97. 2 % for ART, 98. 7 % for SDF, and 96. 4 % for NaF (Chi-square test, p> 0. 05). The material cost per tooth for the four treatments in the 18 months were FS US$ 0. 3, ART US$ 1. 0, SDF US$ 0. 7, and NaF US$ 0. 3. The treatment time for the resin and the ART sealants were similar, about 3 - 4 minutes per tooth, while that of topical fluoride application was much shorter, less than 30 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: The 18 -month effectiveness of the four methods in preventing fissure caries was similar but their material and time cost was different. link_to_OA_fulltextThe IADR 86 th General Session & Exhibition, Toronto, Canada, 2 - 5 July 2008...|$|E
40|$|Scientific Groups Program: <b>Seq.</b> <b>no.</b> 12 - Poster Session III: {{abstract}} no. 0532 OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} oral hygiene and periodontal status of pre-school children in Hong Kong. METHOD: Seven kindergartens were selected by stratified sampling {{according to their}} geographic location in Hong Kong. Letters {{were sent to the}} parents of all grades 2 and 3 children of the selected kindergartens to ask for consent to let their children participate in this survey. The examination was performed in the kindergartens by two calibrated examiners using CPI probes, dental mirrors, and intra-oral LED lights. The buccal and lingual sites of teeth 55, 52, 64, 75, 72 and 84 were selected for assessment of oral hygiene status and gingival health condition by using the Loe and Silness Plaque Index (PI) and the Gingival Index (GI) respectively. About 10 % of the children were re-examined to assess inter-examiner reliability. RESULTS: A total of 764 children were invited and 664 were examined, giving a response rate of 86. 9 %. Their mean age was 5. 0 ± 1. 0 years. Their mean PI and GI scores were 1. 3 and 1. 6, respectively. Only two children (0. 3 %) had healthy gum in all sites and 77 % of them had moderate gingival inflammation (bleeding on probing) in {{at least half of the}} sites examined. Results of the multi-factor ANOVA analysis showed that their oral hygiene status was significantly associated with the main caretaker and tooth brushing frequency of the child; and that their gingival health condition was significantly associated with the child's main caretaker, tooth brushing frequency, and use of other dental cleaning aids. CONCLUSION: In this sample of Hong Kong preschool children, poor oral hygiene was common and gingival inflammation was found in almost every child. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 2 nd Meeting of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR) Pan Asian Pacific Federation (PAPF) and the 1 st Meeting of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR) Asia/Pacific Region (APR), Wuhan, China, 22 - 24 September 2009. 第二届国际牙科研究学会(IADR) 泛亚洲太平洋联盟(Pan-Asia Pacific Federation) 会议、第一届国际牙科研究学会亚洲太平洋地区(Asia-Pacific Region, APR) 、暨中国分会第十届科技年会, 中国, 武汉, 2009 年 9 月 22 - 24 日...|$|E
