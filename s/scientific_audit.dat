Furthermore, Gramsci (1999) emphasises the power of praxis in Selections from the Prison Notebooks by stating that “The philosophy of praxis does not tend to leave the simple in their primitive philosophy of common sense but rather to lead them to a higher conception of life”.To reveal the inadequacies of religion, folklore, intellectualism and other such ‘one-sided’ forms of reasoning, Gramsci appeals directly in his later work to Marx’s ‘philosophy of praxis’, describing it as a ‘concrete’ mode of reasoning. This principally involves the juxtaposition of a dialectical and <b>scientific</b> <b>audit</b> of reality; against all existing normative, ideological, and therefore counterfeit accounts. Essentially a ‘philosophy’ based on ‘a practise’, Marx’s philosophy, is described correspondingly in this manner, as the only ‘philosophy’ {{that is at the}} same time a ‘history in action’ or a ‘life’ itself (Gramsci, Hoare and Nowell-Smith, 1972, p. 332).|$|E

40|$|For {{developing}} nations, {{soil erosion}} {{is among the}} most chronic environmental and economic burdens. Many of these nations are in the tropics where, in just a few hours, torrential downpours can wash away tons of topsoil. Many others are in the drier zones where swirling winds and flash floods can be equally devastating. By these processes, huge amounts of valuable soil are being lost every day. Worse the soil accumulates in rivers, reservoirs, harbours and estuaries causing siltation and further costly devastation. Erosion is thus a double disaster: a vital resource disappears from where it is desperately needed only to be dumped where it is equally unwanted. One practical solution for controlling erosion simply, cheaply and on a huge scale in both the tropics and semi-arid regions could be the use of a coarse grass called vetiver (Vetiver zizanioides). Planted in lines along the contours of sloping lands, vetiver quickly forms narrow but very dense hedges. Its stiff foliage then blocks the passage of soil and debris It also slows any runoff and gives the rainfall a better chance of soaking into soil instead of rushing off the slope. The report Vetiver grass is a <b>scientific</b> <b>audit</b> of the safety and effectiveness of the plant as used for erosion control. The book reviews existing research and experiences with the grass. It has been produced particularly for nonspecialist readers such as government ministers, research directors, university students and NGOs. A word of warning to those thinking of introducing vetiver grass into new environments: the erosion-control form of the plant produces no viable seed, and therefore does not spread and become a weed. It must be propogated vegetatively. There is another form of vetiver which does produce viable seed and which can become a 'colonizer'; this type should never be used to control erosion.

In addition to clinical and laboratory investigations, the patients were interviewed by the clinic’s psychologist, who used a structured interview schedule developed specifically for the study. Descriptive analysis and analysis of variance were used to investigate data. RESULTS: Most patients remained sexually active in spite of arousal failure and discomfort and engaged in unlubricated and often painful sexual intercourse. Most women engaged in potentially harmful genital hygiene and self-treatment behavior. Adverse self-treatment practices but not adverse genital hygiene practices were associated with greater symptom duration.

40|$|Undergraduate science {{students}} are given opportunities to link the descriptions of scientific phenomena presented in lectures to their own observations of similar scientific phenomena in practical classes so as to reinforce key concepts. Being able to conceptually move between the scientific phenomena and the abstracted figures or equations that represent those phenomena is a key skill. Developing this skill, and confidence with applying this skill, is the implicit objective of many undergraduate practical classes. However, students seem unable to adequately explain their observations, despite the implementation of many “how to” guides, and this is of concern, {{which is why we}} seek to identify some of the factors that seem to impede students from being able to correctly translate and explain <b>scientific</b> data. We <b>audited</b> 118 laboratory reports in from second year molecular biology students to assess students’ abilities to correctly record and calculate data, appropriately present data, and clearly explain the representation of their data.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{what counts as}} evidence and what constitutes an evidence-informed approach to health policy development, particularly policy with an equity focus. While health policy is increasingly aiming to be evidence-based, a narrow conceptualisation of this can neglect {{the importance of the}} powerful and dynamic context of public policy-making. An evidence-informed approach recognises and works with a broader range of contextual influences. The aim of this thesis was to extend and deepen understanding of how evidence informs policy that promotes health equity, through a tracer study of policy development in Australia. The objectives of the research were to examine influential types of evidence, their role and function; to investigate the context, processes and relationships that contributed to evidence informed health policy, and to gain a deeper understanding of how health equity, and evidence on equity, was conceptualised and considered in the policy process. Two Australian state government policy initiatives in the area of early childhood intervention were investigated through interviews with key policy actors in both states, and media, political and policy documentary analyses. A theory-informed framework was developed from the literature to guide this research. This thesis has {{led to the development of}} a number of theoretical models, insights and working principles to guide evidence-informed policy development. The models emerge from a conceptual framework that describes how clusters of information (contextual, expert opinion, <b>scientific</b> studies, policy <b>audit,</b> and economic) combine with a number of policy conditions (necessity, opportunity, capacity, relationships, actors and processes) to become a case for policy. What follows seems to be several primary insights to the types of evidence that inform health policy; the identification of an adopt, adapt, apply phase in policy-making; and the existence of an equity policy gap  exposing the rare translation of equity principles into policy action. Findings from this study call for recognition of research as only one information source in policy development. The successful integration of research and policy is more likely if research evidence is seen within, and as a part of, a more complex policy development system...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} audit {{has proven to}} be a relatively new, less researched and rapidly expanding field among large, medium and even small businesses (commercial and non-commercial organisations). The implementation rate has grown rapidly and presents a huge growth market for audit consultants due to the need for transparency and compliance with regulation (for example: Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the need to be competitive in the marketplace. The audit process is being conducted mainly by consultants following a traditional process but using different proprietary approaches and mostly done manually. The purpose of this study is to present a scientific method to attach a purely measurement focus to the auditing process so as to provide an auditing as well as a quantitative outcome of the performance to the various IS entities that are audited using a novel automated method that can save organisations considerable resources in terms of time, cost and effort. The nature of the topic directed the researcher to three domains of information system (IS) namely studies on IS measurement, IT governance and software engineering. These areas provided information on the nature of IS measurement and the models used; the process of auditing/measurement and the corresponding frameworks used; the principles and methodology of measurement of IS entities; and measurement models used both in the software engineering and information systems domain. The review of the literature gave rise to the research question and the COBIT-GQM (Control Objectives for Information Technology Audit) – Goal Question Metrics) model. The research question that had emerged out of the four propositions “How can an IT audit or governance framework be used to measure the effectiveness of IS entities in a scientific manner using customised and goal oriented metrics” along with the nature of data sought (positivist), guided the researcher to qualitative research using multiple case studies to test the theoretical model (grounded theory) that had emerged out of the literature review. The theoretical model was automated (with a front end interface and a back-end database) and initially tested for usability issues. Then the common COBIT control objective that was obtained through an initial survey was entered into the database along with a set of questions and metrics (developed by the researcher by following the given GQM guidelines). This application that was demonstrated, and given for evaluation in four organisations gave rise to expected and surprising results. While the respondents expressed their desire to incorporate a customised and goal oriented measurement perspective to their IT audit/performance functions, that would save them time, effort and cost, numerous suggestions were provided that need to be incorporated into the model to make it fully functional. Notable among them are the need to embed a multiple contextual qualifying layer, incorporating benchmarking feature to the model, and the need to link this with the maturity model. These were incorporated into the model and a comprehensive model incorporating all the suggestions was created. The qualitative case study method being used here more to evaluate a theory, provided a sound base for future studies to generate hypothesis that can be evaluated using quantitative survey methods for the model to be generalised. IT auditing being a relatively new, less researched, conventional and high growth oriented field, the use of an innovative, comprehensive, automated and <b>scientific</b> method of <b>audit</b> and measurement method will satisfy the implied need for organisations to incorporate the diverse audit/measurement/ control/standards into one comprehensive method and this research is a major step in this direction.

Irrespective of the nature of economic cycle the need for economising in terms of cost, time and effort is universal for all organisations...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The world steel {{industry}} {{plays a major}} role in energy use and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions now and in the future. Implementing energy efficiency measures is among one of the most cost-effective investments that the industry could make in improving efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. The goal of this thesis was to analyse the potential of energy efficiency measures in the world {{steel industry}}. Through characterizing energy-efficiency technology costs and improvement potentials, energy savings and carbon mitigation have been developed and presented for energy efficiency measures for the world steel industry in 2006. In order to properly analyse the total world steel industry, specific regions have been identified; the United States (US), Western Europe (WEU), Former Sovjet Union (FSU), India (IND), China (CHI), Japan (JAP) and Central- and South America (CSA). These regions together are responsible for over 80 % of the world steel production. First, an in depth study of 72 identified energy efficiency measures in the US steel industry in 2006 was conducted. Data for energy efficiency measure was collected from case studies, <b>scientific</b> reports, energy <b>audits,</b> etc. Measures were evaluated on cost-effectiveness by calculating Cost of Conserved Energy (CCE) and total energy savings. Once each measure was characterized individually, its applicability to the US iron and steel industry as a whole was assessed. The total of energy savings calculated for each measure represents the total potential for the US. Next, the potential of only cost-effective measures was calculated by adding only the energy savings potential of measures which were identified as cost-effective by CCE calculation. From the energy savings, the carbon mitigation was calculated. In summary, implementing all energy efficiency measures in the US steel industry showed major reduction potentials for both the energy use (385 PJ) and carbon emissions (7. 2 MtC). Even if only cost-effective measures are taken into account, the energy and carbon reductions add up to 300 PJ and 6. 2 MtC, respectively (equals 26 % and 22 % of total US steel industry energy use and carbon emissions). The assessment of energy efficiency measures in the US lead to a number of assumptions on key factors influencing the energy efficiency measures for the steel industry in different world regions. From the assessment in the US, it was clear that the energy use, production, industry structure and average weighted energy price were the most important factors influencing the potential of (cost-effective) energy efficiency measures. With these key factors, the analysis was expanded to the other identified world regions. For these world regions estimations were made of the effects of energy efficiency measures in in their steel industry, using the identified key factors and an adaptation of costs data by the PPP-index. The results of these estimations are provided in Table 1. The results of the in depth analysis of the US, the estimations for the selected world regions and an assumption for the remaining other world regions, provided an estimation of the potential for the world steel industry. Apparently, the application of energy efficiency measures all over the world resulted in a total potential energy savings of about 5. 7 EJ in 2006 (5. 3 - 6. 0 EJ when uncertainties are included). The cost-effective energy savings for the world steel industry are about 4. 1 EJ in 2006 (3. 5 - 5. 4 EJ, uncertainties included). The total potential for energy efficiency measures is about 23 % of the world steel final energy consumption. The cost-effective energy savings add up to about 16 % of the final energy consumption. For carbon mitigation the application of energy efficiency measures all over the world resulted in a total potential carbon reduction of about 107 MtC in 2006 (101 - 113 MtC, uncertainties included). The cost-effective carbon reductions for the world steel industry are about 82 MtC in 2006 (76 - 101 MtC, uncertainties included). The total potential for energy efficiency measures is about 20 % of the world steel carbon emission mitigation. The cost-effective carbon reductions add up to about 15 % of the total carbon emissions. In short, the application of energy efficiency measures in the world steel industry offers a major potential for final energy savings and carbon emission reductions. ...|$|R
