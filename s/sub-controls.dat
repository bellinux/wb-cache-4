30|$|As {{with the}} ISO analysis, Table 4 {{includes}} the average percentage of <b>sub-controls</b> addressed per control. The only factor affecting the scores relative to in Fig. 2 {{is the number}} of subcontrols, which range from 4 to 12. CSC 10 : Data Recovery Capability and CSC 17 : Security Skills Assessment had very few <b>sub-controls,</b> consequently they score higher. While CSC 12 : Boundary Defense, CSC 13 : Data Protection and CSC 16 : Account Monitoring and Control had many <b>sub-controls,</b> thus a lower score was asigned.|$|E
30|$|A low {{score in}} Table 5 {{suggests}} {{that many of the}} <b>sub-controls</b> have not been addressed, which suggests there is relevant information that has not been collected. It is unsurprising that Control 10, which relates to cryptography, scores well because there is only one sub-control and most of the forms mention cryptographic protocols. Similarly, Section 18 scores highly; this is because the first control relates to compliance and the second to external security audits, each of these <b>sub-controls</b> is well-represented in the proposal forms. This analysis reveals Control 12 : Operations Management has much room for improvement, despite the <b>sub-controls</b> relating to malware control, backups and patching scoring highly. Control 12 contains some <b>sub-controls</b> which were entirely ignored such as 12.5 Control of operational software and 14.1 Security requirements of information systems.|$|E

There are eight <b>sub-controls</b> comprising this control {{and none of the}} forms analysed contained a question corresponding to any of them.|$|E
30|$|In this section, our {{analysis}} follows ISO/IEC 27002 : 2013. Figure 1 presents {{the number of}} <b>sub-controls</b> that were addressed by a given form and we then aggregate this information for all the forms and each control. The number of <b>sub-controls</b> in each section increases the maximum possible score. We note that every ISO control was addressed {{by at least one}} form. The three highest scoring controls were Sections 8, 12 and 18 which relate to asset management, operational security and compliance respectively.|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{control is}} proposed {{for trajectory tracking}} of a 6 -DOF model-scaled helicopter with constraints on main rotor thrust and fuselage attitude. In the procedure of control design, the mathematical model of helicopter is simplified into three subsystems: altitude subsystem, longitudinal-lateral subsystem and attitude subsystem. The proposed control is developed by combining the <b>sub-controls</b> for the corresponding subsystems. The <b>sub-controls</b> for altitude subsystem and longitudinal-lateral subsystem are designed with hyperbolic tangent functions to satisfy the constraints; the sub-control for attitude subsystem is based on backstepping technique such that fuselage attitude tracks the virtual control for longitudinal-lateral subsystem. It is proved theoretically that tracking errors are ultimately bounded, and control constraints are satisfied. Performances of the proposed controller are demonstrated by simulation results.

Secondly, to deal with the increment of computer memory, total control periods aredivided into several <b>sub-control</b> periods. Then whole system is controlled through the proposedconnection methods such as 2 -Step-DP, Iterated Method of DP and non-linear optimizationmethods among the optimal solutions of <b>sub-control</b> systems.

40|$|Integrated chassis control (ICC) {{systems can}} be used to reduce the {{economic}} and social costs of road accidents. If these systems are to achieve their full potential for improved safety, however, two critical issues must be resolved: (i) the design of a controller integrating all <b>sub-control</b> systems, and (ii) rigorous evaluation to ensure their functionalities. A decentralized design that coordinates the commands from sub-chassis control systems is achieved under the current business practice, in which suppliers provide OEMs with proprietary controllers. For effective coordination of <b>sub-control</b> commands and for avoidance of liability, the coordination strategy of saturating <b>sub-control</b> commands is used. A coordinator based on a hybrid approach [...] an offline model predictive control and an online fixed-point control allocation method [...] is designed, which has superior computational efficiency and flexibility. The effectiveness of the decentralized ICC system is verified via commercial software, CarSim. The simulation results show that ICC can resolve conflicts among subsystems and achieve improved stability. Reconfiguration in the control, for dealing with actuator failure in <b>sub-control</b> systems and robust control under uncertainties is presented. For the evaluation of ICC, the worst-case scenario evaluation (WCSE) method is enhanced and applied to find the worst possible scenarios, for rigorous evaluation of vehicles, especially vehicles with chassis control systems. Two optimization methods (Sequential Quadratic Programming and Mesh Adaptive Direct Search) are used because of their convergence and computation efficiency. The worst allowable persistent bounded disturbance input generation method is applied to populate the initial points for the optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed WCSE method was shown through a rollover prevention case study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In view of {{different}} {{characters in the}} development period, the growth period and the stabilization period {{of a kind of}} fermentative process, this paper proposes one kind of nonlinear multi-stage dynamical system and its identification model. This model is a kind of special optimal control problem restrained by multi-level programming. Because the level set of <b>sub-control</b> problem is locally uniform bounded and lower semi-continuous, we obtain the controllability of the <b>sub-control</b> problem and nonempty compactness of its optimal solution set. Then we construct the optimization algorithm and apply it to the parameter identification in batch microbial fermentation. Numerical results show that this multi-stage model can not only characterize the practical process better than we’ve used before, but also increase the precision and make it more effective...|$|R
30|$|The <b>sub-controls</b> {{which were}} {{mentioned}} most often were 10.1 Cryptographic controls, 12.2 Protection from malware, 18.1 Compliance with legal and contractual requirements and 12.3 Backup {{with scores of}} 18, 23, 22 and 19 respectively. These scores correspond {{to the number of}} forms that ask about the sub-control. For example, 23 of the forms asked for information relating to the applicant’s protection from malware.|$|E
30|$|The {{results show}} that the {{information}} gathered by the forms is more aligned with the ISO/IEC 27002 framework. This is understandable given that the CSC relate to network security and many controls may be too detailed for the assessment process. In spite of this, there is still much we can learn from the CSC because appropriate network security is vital to mitigating many of the risks that cyber insurance covers. For example, the authors of the CSC deem CSC 5 : Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges to be of high priority. As a result, it was moved from being CSC 12 in Version 5.0 to CSC 5 in Version 6.0 of the CSC [49]. Yet none of the forms directly address any of the <b>sub-controls</b> pertaining to CSC 5. Similarly, CSC 7 : Email and Web Browser Protections relates to application security. However, none of the forms address the corresponding <b>sub-controls,</b> which is worrying given that applications are increasingly being considered as a “prime [attack] vector into an organisation” [53].|$|E
30|$|Figure 1 {{demonstrates}} that the controls with the lowest scores were Section 13 : Communications security, Section 14 : System acquisition, development and maintenance and Section 16 : Information security incident management. Section 13 contains two <b>sub-controls,</b> the first relates to secure networks and the second secure communication with third parties. The first was occasionally addressed through network segregation, which is mentioned in the sub-control. The second is addressed through non-disclosure agreements.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} and rigorous study on a TOPS (task optimization {{in the presence}} of signal-dependent noise) model with a hold-on or an end-point control. Optimal control signals are rigorously obtained, which enables us to investigate various issues about the model including its trajectories, velocities, control signals, variances and the dependence of these quantities on various model parameters. With the hold-on control, we find that the optimal control can be implemented with an almost &# 039;nil&# 039; hold-on period. The optimal control signal is a linear combination of two <b>sub-control</b> signals. One of the <b>sub-control</b> signals is positive and the other is negative. With the end-point control, the end-point variance is dramatically reduced, in comparison with the hold-on control. However, the velocity is not symmetric (bell shape). Finally, we point out that the velocity with a hold-on control takes the bell shape only within a limited parameter region...|$|R

50|$|Whilst the two-storey bunker {{was being}} {{designed}} and approved {{the structures of}} civil defence and London government were changing. Work on Pear Tree House started in 1963 but it was now merely {{going to be a}} borough control centre, the existing borough control in St Matthews Road, Brixton was to become a <b>sub-control.</b> It cost £31,850 of which the Home Office paid 75% (£23,250). The 18-room bunker and flats were completed in 1966 and the bunker went into care and maintenance when civil defence was stood down two years later.|$|R
30|$|Both {{frameworks}} {{consist of}} broad controls {{with a number}} of <b>sub-controls</b> containing more detailed guidance. The content of the proposal forms will be referred to as questions {{in the rest of the}} paper. Our approach was to count for each sub-control the number of forms requesting information about that sub-control. The process of classifying units of analysis under themes is “one of the most challenging aspects of the study” and “may be difficult to put into words” [45].|$|E
30|$|However, this {{presentation}} of results may not be appropriate for all purposes. Figure 1 suggests that ISO: Section 12 is well addressed. Yet Table 5 shows {{that there is a}} majority of <b>sub-controls</b> which are not accounted for. The first presentation may be appropriate for insurers with a relatively low maturity of assessment, where any additional information would help the underwriting process. Meanwhile, the second {{presentation of}} results is useful for high-maturity assessment seeking to collect information relating to all critical controls.|$|E
30|$|A {{degree of}} {{subjectivity}} is inevitable; {{a handful of}} questions corresponded loosely to a sub-control and a judgement was made. For example, both the CSC <b>sub-controls</b> 5.7 and 16.2 mention passwords ‘longer than 14 characters’, which did not correspond to the question ‘Does the company enforce passwords that are at least seven character...?’ asked in ACE’s Privacy Protection policy [43]. This method favoured controls phrased more generically because {{a higher degree of}} specificity means a given question is less likely to correspond to the control. This was done to maintain consistency throughout our analysis.|$|E
30|$|Further, {{only three}} forms {{mentioned}} operating systems; these related to standard configuration, {{the type of}} operating system (OS) in use and whether the OS continued to be supported by the manufacturer. The first falls under CSC 3 : Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software and was the only form to correspond to a <b>sub-control</b> under this control. CSC 5 outlines The processes and tools used to track, control, prevent, correct the use, assignment, and configuration of administrative privileges on computers, networks, and applications. Yet we found that {{only one of the}} form mentions administrative privileges, which was in connection with social media accounts.|$|R

40|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{building codes}} are written based on building occupancy classifications. However, with {{the abundance of}} multiplexes and highly efficient communication through advanced technology today, this principle of classification of buildings through specific use in building code-writing may cause problems in building controls. This is especially true when the trend of modern and future building occupancy is towards flexible, mixed, and transferable uses with non-distinction between working and habitation. In the highly dense urban environment and under current Hong Kong building regulation controls, all buildings are classified for domestic or non-domestic use, which imposes control barriers to any mixed-use, merged-use or adaptive re-functioned buildings. Furthermore, the local profit-oriented real estate market always pushes the architectural design of buildings to follow the control regulations tightly. Thus, innovations are limited and usually sacrificed for the maximization of development potential in terms of economy and quality only. This research investigates the relationship between building controls and the architectural design of buildings in Hong Kong, {{with a focus on}} the impact that building codes have imposed on the architectural design of buildings through its occupancy-based categorization of domestic or non-domestic use. It also aims to open a fresh look at the control of buildings in a high density environment. By reviewing the origin of building laws and basic principles of building code creation, the research takes a comprehensive study with focus on four building <b>sub-control</b> aspects: building density, building safety, building environmental health and building sustainable designs. Case-studies, literature reviews, interviews, surveys and data analysis, and correlation analysis are used. To explore the effect of categorization of buildings, relevant professional terms and their significance also are addressed and studied. Through various findings, this research uncovers the relationship between building controls and architectural design of buildings in Hong Kong. Results from <b>sub-control</b> aspects are concluded and compared. The key <b>sub-control</b> aspect of building density control and its control variables are identified, analyzed and re-evaluated. Comparative cases from international cities with similar environmental contexts are studied and applicable references are made. In brief, this research provides an original perspective and approach in the field of study of building controls that related to the architectural design of buildings. It also establishes a refreshing base to understand different practical design-control issues. Moreover, some progressive and holistic recommendations in future policy makings and code writings of building control are advised. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
30|$|Only four <b>sub-controls</b> had no {{corresponding}} {{questions in}} any of the analysed forms. In ISO, 12.1 looks at controlling and documenting changes to operating responsibilities and procedures, 12.5 relates to controlling the installation of software, 12.7 looks at minimising the adverse effects of IT audits and 14.1 to specify security control requirements. All of these scored zero. Only one form contained a question relating to 14.2, which looks at software/systems development processes. Only two forms contained questions corresponding to each of 13.2, about policies and agreements regarding communications with third parties, and 9.3, which relates to user’s responsibilities including choosing strong passwords.|$|E
30|$|Our {{results provide}} two {{distinct}} evaluations {{that can be}} used to improve the insurance process and address the problem of adverse selection. The first revolves around the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 that present the absolute number of <b>sub-controls</b> mentioned in the forms. The second focuses on the analysis provided in Tables 4 and 5 which explains what additional information is required to adequately represent the specific control into question. Regarding the first evaluation, it gives an overview of which controls are in the proposal forms and which controls have been overlooked. This analysis suggests systems development and acquisition, communications management and incident management deemed of the highest priority.|$|E
30|$|Section 14 {{relates to}} the {{development}} and procurement of products, particularly relating to security requirements. None of the forms addressed security requirements, though two US firms mentioned the use of open source code in development, which is relevant to the development process. Finally three forms asked about test procedures. Section 16 relates to incident response, which is mentioned in only eight forms; none of these forms mention insider threat. Since {{there is only one}} sub-control, however, this results in a relatively high score in Table 5. Table 5 shows, for each ISO control, the average percentage of <b>sub-controls</b> with at least one question relating to that sub-control in each form per control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust, scalable extension to the recently proposed multicast Group Key Management Protocol (GKMP) ([1], [2]), {{in terms of}} security administration. The GKMP has two major security related problems: (a) lack of any mechanism to remove a compromised group administrator, and (b) lack of scalability. We are able to remove a compromised single panel member from generating the group keys by setting the panel members with shared authority to generate the group keys. We then introduce the sub-controllers who have all the functionalities of the group control panel except the authority to generate the group keys. The <b>sub-control</b> panel helps scalability of the network {{in terms of the}} security operations. The sub-controllers are chosen using a threshold-based clustering algorithm.

40|$|We {{apply the}} viable system model (VSM) in the {{management}} control system (MCS) area {{in order to address}} the multifariousrelationships between enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and budgeting through the introduction of five researchcriteria: ERP system, budgeting, informal control, organizational hierarchy and the relationships among them. The researchquestion discussed is: How can we develop an MCS that addresses the relationships among budgeting, ERP systems,informal control and organizational hierarchy? It is found that the VSM application overcomes the limitations in MCSframeworks by addressing the relationships among formal and informal <b>sub-control</b> components across all the organizationlevels. The main conclusion of the research is that the amended VSM could be used to describe and explain the social aspectbetween ERP and budgeting in organizations. The unintended use and disconnection of ‘ERP as a database’ in VSM’s system 2 explains why the relationship between ‘ERP as a system’ and budgeting remains multifarious...|$|R
30|$|Many {{controls}} {{had very}} low scores, such as CSC 17, which relates to staff awareness and training. Only eight forms asked about delivering security training and two forms asked about periodic testing. The first two {{in terms of}} priority CSC controls relate to keeping an inventory of authorised software and hardware; yet none of the forms contain any of the followings words: inventory, authorised, unauthorised, blacklist or whitelist. One UK firm asks for ‘approximate number of devices on network’; while this necessitates some form of crude inventory, it does not sufficiently address any of the <b>sub-controls</b> in CSC 1 : Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices. We will discuss whether keeping an inventory is implicit in other controls in Section 6.|$|E
30|$|Assessing the {{existence}} of controls alone provides a ’check-box compliance’ view of network security. This has been raised as one criticism of regulation [54]. If the insurance industry is to evolve towards accurate risk assessment it must take a holistic and responsive view of risk management. We suggest that a wider coverage of the CSC <b>sub-controls</b> can provide provide guidance on how to manage {{the implementation of a}} control, rather than merely check of its existence. For example, many of the questions merely ask whether the firm is ‘conducting regular penetration tests’. More alignment with the specific advice contained within CSC 20 : Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises could provide a clearer view of the implementation of this control and help insurers better understand an applicant’s network security practices. However, {{it is important to be}} aware of the tension between the need for more information and the ease of the application process, which is the second largest obstacle to selling cyber insurance according to a 2015 survey [1].|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{improved}} mesoscopic {{model is}} presented for simulating the drying of porous media. The {{aim of this}} model is to account for two scales simultaneously: {{the scale of the}} whole product and the scale of the heterogeneities of the porous medium. The innovation of this method is the utilization of a new mass-conservative scheme based on the Control-Volume Finite-Element (CV-FE) method that partitions the moisture content field over the individual <b>sub-control</b> volumes surrounding each node within the mesh. Although the new formulation has potential for application across a wide range of transport processes in heterogeneous porous media, the focus here is on applying the model to the drying of small sections of softwood consisting of several growth rings. The results conclude that, when compared to a previously published scheme, only the new mass-conservative formulation correctly captures the true moisture content evolution in the earlywood and latewood components of the growth rings during drying...|$|R

Kraft and Steffensen (2005) analyze optimal investment in an asset defaulting when an economic state process falls below a given threshold. Bielecki and Jang (2006) derive optimal investment strategies for an investor allocating her wealth among a defaultable bond, risk-free account and stock, assuming constant default intensity. Bo et al. (2010) consider a logarithmic investor maximizing utility from consumption in market model consisting of a defaultable perpetual bond, default-free stock, and money market account.
