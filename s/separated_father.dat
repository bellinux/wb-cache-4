40|$|Marital {{separation}} {{is a complex}} and emotionally painful life experience, especially in instances where children are involved. This exemplar study investigated the separation experiences of fathers. Its findings suggest that many <b>separating</b> <b>fathers</b> are at an emotional disadvantage during separation, not only grieving {{the loss of their}} former marital relationship, but also their simultaneous loss of contact with their child/ren, their fathering role, and their former family routine. It is posited that <b>separated</b> <b>fathers</b> 2 ̆ 7 late start in the grieving process may put them at a psychoemotional disadvantage at the very time they are dealing with the complexities of formalizing their child contact arrangements.

40|$|Fathers {{parental leave}} use is often assumed to affect gender {{equality}} {{both at home}} and in the labour market. In the home, fathers parental leave is expected to improve father-child contact later on in the childs life. In this study the associations between fathers parental leave use and further adaption to family life and contact with children are investigated. The first research question is whether fathers who have used parental leave {{are more likely to have}} shorter working hours during their childrens first years compared to fathers who have not used the leave. The second question is whether the contact between <b>separated</b> <b>fathers</b> and their children is associated with the fathers previous parental leave use. We use a survey carried out in 2003 with a sample of approximately 4000 parents of children born in 1993 and 1999. The findings indicate that fathers parental leave is associated with both shorter working hours later in the childs life and more contact between <b>separated</b> <b>fathers</b> and their children...|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to the discussion of how adult children affect the well-being of their older parents by investigating the importance of living in close geographic proximity. We investigate whether having children at all, and/or having them geographically proximate, contributes differently to the well-being of older persons living with and without a partner. We enriched survey data for the Netherlands (N = 8, 379) with municipal register data and regressed life satisfaction of persons aged 65 + on having children and three different measures of geographic proximity. Having children contributes to the well-being of older men with a partner. There is evidence for a positive association between proximity of children and parental well-being, in particular for widowed and separated mothers and for <b>separated</b> <b>fathers.</b> Our findings suggest that close proximity may be a condition under which adult children can significantly add to the well-being of widowed and separated mothers and <b>separated</b> <b>fathers...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Separated</b> <b>fathers</b> {{often feel}} {{profound}} grief, distress, and {{anger at the}} end of their relationships with their partners and their children. Some are recruited into ‘fathers’ rights’ groups, a network which claims to advocate on behalf of men and fathers who are the victims of discrimination and injustice in the Family Court and elsewhere. Yet such groups do little to help fathers heal or to build or maintain ongoing and positive relationships with their children. Some men do find solace and support in these groups, but they also may be incited into anger, blame, and destructive strategies of litigation. The fathers’ rights movement prioritises formal principles of equality over positive parenting and the well-being of women and children. Some groups seem more concerned with re-establishing paternal authority and fathers’ decision-making related to their children’s and ex-partners’ lives than with actual involvements with children. However, other responses to <b>separated</b> <b>fathers</b> are more constructive. Positive responses to separated men involve service provision in the community sector, forms of mediation which prioritise children’s wellbeing and safety, accountable grassroots-based support groups, and above all, strategies aimed at increasing fathers’ involvements in the care of children prior to separation and divorce...|$|R

40|$|Custody abductions and filicides-suicides are {{not every}} day occurrences and {{typically}} become ‘media events’. Through an analysis of newspaper representations of two custody abductions and one filicide-suicide, {{this article examines the}} role played by fathers’ rights discourse {{in the construction of the}} <b>separated</b> <b>father</b> in each case. It argues that fathers’ rights discourse played a central role in the sympathetic portrayal of the two fathers involved in the custody abductions, but was less obviously present in the case of the filicide-suicide. These divergent representations indicate that news media representations are contingent on circumstances and also point to the limits of fathers’ rights discourses in legitimating and neutralising the actions of fathers in pain over the loss of intimate personal relationships. However, the use of a forensic approach to reporting meant that each case remained decontextualised from the pattern of violence and coercive control that typically characterises conflictual separations and custody disputes...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{findings}} that partnered and single fathers have less social contact than nearly all {{other types of}} men and women (Author 2011) suggest that fatherhood brings the risk of a loss in men 2 ̆ 7 s social networks. This in turn risks a significant reduction in social support, particularly amongst men who separate and lose the bonding social capital resources of their female partners (Emerick 2006). This paper examines social contact, efficacy and support amongst separated and partnered men and fathers using the 2006 ABS General Social Survey. Results show that fatherhood is not associated with any loss in social contact and support amongst married or defacto men. However, amongst separated men, fatherhood is associated with greater social contact, but less social support and efficacy in decision-making related to family and friends. The paper concludes that separated fathers feel less supported and empowered than partnered fathers, partnered mothers, or separated mothers; that this is potentially detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health; and that social engagement policies for men (ie Men 2 ̆ 7 s sheds) should be expanded with a greater focus on recently <b>separated</b> <b>father...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mental health {{disorders}} are highest among {{adults who are}} separated and divorced, with 23 % of men in this group reporting a mental illness. Separated {{men are more likely}} to commit suicide compared with married men. In Australia, there are over 53, 100 divorces per annum, involving almost 50, 000 children. To date, little research has been conducted on the mental health of separated men who are fathers. Aims: Using a pilot qualitative study, parenting and health issues reported by 23 south-east Queensland separated fathers were examined. The pilot study informed the selection of correlates and measurements for the quantitative study. The aims of the subsequent quantitative study of 80 Queensland separated fathers were to examine: (1) how postseparation stressors, conflict with the ex-partner, access to children, and generativity impact on fathers' grief; and (2) how grief impacts on the mental health of separated fathers. Model: Variables correlating with separated fathers' grief and mental health were entered into the health model proposed by Bartholomew, Parcel, and Kok (1995). Generativity (caring for others and providing support for the next generation) was a key construct in this research. Results: Results of grief analyses, as measured by the Separated Fathers Grief Scale, indicated that the more generative a <b>separated</b> <b>father,</b> and the fewer and less intense the stressors in his life, the less his grief. A grieving father's access to his children and his perception of his financial insecurity correlated with alcohol abuse, conflict with his expartner and stressors in his life. Parenting concerns were the predominant factor affecting conflict with the ex-partner and stressors for separated fathers. Results indicate that a generative father with a positive perception of his financial security and few stressors had low levels of depression anxiety and stress, unless he was unable to resolve his grief over separation from his children. Implications for Public Health: For separated fathers, findings that increased generativity serves as a preventive for grief and mental health problems, support the potential benefit of educational programs utilising an adult developmental approach. Social and legislative changes are required to ensure that: fathering is given equal importance to mothering; consensual rather than adversarial legal processes are promoted; and equitable maintenance and financial planning strategies are promoted to increase the financial security of all separated parents and their children...|$|E

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of divorced and <b>separated</b> <b>fathers</b> form new partnerships. The new partner’s preferences are likely to put a much lower weight (if any) on expenditures on the man’s children from his previous union. As a consequence, his own and his partner’s income would have different impacts on his child support payments if partners’ relative incomes affect bargaining power in household decisions. This paper exploits within-father variation in the British Household Panel Survey (1991 - 2003) to estimate the impacts of partners’ incomes on child support payments. We find that a higher share of father’s income in household income increases the probability of paying child support and its amount relative to household income. ...|$|R
