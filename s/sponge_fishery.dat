40|$|International audienceThe {{production}} of Mediterranean bath sponges collapsed {{during the past}} century {{as it is shown}} by Tunisian catches which went from 108 tons in 1920 down to 9 tons in 1988. Another illustration is given by the well-known sponge fishing island of Kalymnos which lost about 90 % of its active fishermen population in a century between 1858 and 1967. For what reasons a Mediterranean traditional fishery once prosperous did dramatically decline? What part of the decline {{can be attributed to the}} lessening of the bath sponge stock and what to a decreasing number of fishermen? How can this decline of the <b>sponge</b> <b>fishery</b> be related to changes in uses, overfishing, disease outbreaks triggered by climate events? How did sponge fishermen adapt to these Regional Changes in the past? What is the future of such a fishery? What kind of guidelines can we provide for this fishery facing the on-going Regional Change? To answer these questions, SACOLEVE looks through ecological and historical windows into past evolution of the <b>sponge</b> <b>fishery,</b> chosen here as a model of traditional fishery which suffered good number of upheavals over the last three centuries. The overreaching aim of this program is to propose a management strategy for traditional fisheries that will allow attaining eco-durable practices in the current environmental, socio-economic and geopolitical contexts. La production des éponges commerciales méditerranéennes s’est effondrée au cours du siècle dernier, à l’image de la production tunisienne qui est passée de 108 tonnes en 1920 à 9 tonnes en 1988. Un même phénomène peut être observable sur l’île de Kalymnos (Dodécanèse), où le nombre des actifs employés dans cette pêche a baissé de 90 % entre 1858 et 1967. Pour quelle raison cette pêche traditionnelle méditerranéenne a-t-elle connu un déclin aussi dramatique ? Quelle est la part dans cette évolution de la surpêche et des changements globaux ? Ces pêcheries ont-elles encore un avenir ? Le programme SACOLEVE propose une approche intersectorielle de cette thématique, dans le cadre d’une étude socio-environnementale de cette ressource spécifique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The article {{discusses}} {{several aspects}} of the Greek community of Tunis during the 19 th century. Initially, we will approach the anthropogeography of the Greek community focused {{on the characteristics of}} Greek migration in Tunisia. We will study a few demographic factors and will query why Greeks from certain geographical areas moved to Tunisia. Then we will refer to the main economic activities of the Greeks settled in Tunisia, including the operation of retail stores commerce and <b>sponge</b> <b>fishery.</b> We will define the framework through which, Greeks managed to get significant economic power and become Bey’s main partners. Therefore, we will question the political status of the Greeks located in Tunisia during the 19 th century, analyzing their tactics and the reasons for their way of acting. Finally, we will examine the case of a few Greeks who arrived in Tunisia as enslaved {{in the first quarter of}} 19 th century and gradually undertook import offices in the administrative mechanism of Tunisia government, supporting in parallel the Greek community’s interest...|$|E

25|$|An {{extinct volcano}} {{constitutes}} two-thirds of Aegina. The northern and western sides consist of stony but fertile plains, which are well cultivated and produce luxuriant crops of grain, with some cotton, vines, almonds, olives and figs, {{but the most}} characteristic crop of Aegina today (2000s) is pistachio. Economically, the <b>sponge</b> <b>fisheries</b> are of notable importance. The southern volcanic {{part of the island}} is rugged and mountainous, and largely barren. Its highest rise is the conical Mount Oros (531 m) in the south, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches northward with narrow fertile valleys on either side.|$|R

40|$|Natural bath sponges (genera Spongia and Hippospongia, Porifera, Demospongiae) {{have been}} {{harvested}} for millennia {{to be used}} as aids to beauty and body tools, in traditional and modem medicine as well as in painting. Recently, a series of severe epidemics have affected Mediterranean commercial sponges fostering the overexploitation of remaining fishing grounds. Furthermore, Mediterranean bath sponges attain the highest prices compared to Caribbean or Indo-Pacific ones but little or no correct information on origin is transferred to the final buyer. A complex network of re-selling activities and the lack of labelling make it almost impossible to track the pathway of sponge trade. Some of the finest Mediterranean natural bath sponges come from Libya. Nevertheless, little information on Libyan sponge banks and trade have been available mostly given the former international ban. Under an Italian-Libyan joint-project it was possible to assess the past and present situation of sponge fishing in Libya, roughly covering a period of 150 years. After rather low production in years 1860 - 1879, average crop exceeded 40 t/year between 1880 and 1929. The peak was recorded in years 1920 - 1929 (almost 70 t/year on average). Today Libyan <b>sponge</b> <b>fishery</b> and trade are mostly confined to the eastern area of the country. Less than 10 t/year are currently harvested. According to a preliminary SCUBA diving survey along the Libyan coasts, sponges belonging to the order Dictyoceratida appear to be the most conspicuous sessile invertebrates in the investigated areas. Here, sponges belonging to the genera Ircinia and Sarcotragus (commonly defined "wild sponges" with no commercial value) appear to be more abundant than those belonging to the genera Spongia and Hippospongia. Sustainable approaches to the exploitation of this valuable natural resource such as sponge farming are proposed and discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs {{are among}} the most {{degraded}} ecosystems worldwide, with declines in coral cover in excess of 80 % and overfishing prevalent on the majority of reefs. Human activities have affected coral reef ecosystems for at least 1, 000 years, and overfishing is typically the earliest human activity to impact coral reef environments. Thus, historical analyses of the effects of historical fishing are essential to assess changes that occurred before modern observations were made. My thesis assesses long-term change in a variety of species and ecosystems in the Caribbean region. I compiled documents from historical archives and other repositories, extracted ecological data, and developed methods to analyze these data. Across the wider Caribbean region, I found declines of more than 99 % in green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtle populations and a severe reduction in nesting habitat. Next, I estimated historical population sizes for the Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis) to be 233, 000 - 338, 000 individuals, and determined that the prey biomass remaining in Caribbean reefs is insufficient to feed historical populations. I then focused on the <b>sponge</b> <b>fishery</b> in the northern Caribbean and determined that the population crash in several species of marine sponges (Spongia spp., Hippospongia spp.) in {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century was likely related to overfishing, and precipitated broader ecological and social changes. In the Florida Keys, I quantified declines of large bodied fish using historical photographs, and determined that the largest fish are 50 % shorter today than fifty years ago. I then analyzed historical fishing records for the goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) and determined that this species was depleted several decades earlier than previously thought. Next, I assessed change for a variety of coral reef organisms over the last several centuries and determined that declines occurred at relatively low human population densities, and did not follow a pattern of fishing down the food web as has occurred in temperate and oceanic environments. Finally, I assessed historical reasons for the continuation of recreational fishing despite the severe degradation that has occurred. These results have conservation implications both at the species and ecological leve...|$|E
6000|$|A large {{concourse}} {{of boats}} watched the costuming of the divers, and breathless interest was aroused {{as they went}} calmly over the side and remained down {{for more than an}} hour, sending up immense quantities of oysters.

[...] Nevertheless, that day's trial of Western ingenuity has borne much fruit, for we are now told, by the best authorities, that at the present time the diving-dress is very extensively used in sponge, pearl, and coral fisheries {{in many parts of the}} world where naked divers alone were employed not many years ago; and that in the Greek Archipelago and on the Turkish and Barbary coasts alone upwards of three hundred diving apparatuses are employed in the <b>sponge</b> <b>fisheries,</b> with immense advantage to all concerned and to the world at large.|$|R
