If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) <b>street</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> box is not answered with 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical <b>street</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> box.|$|E
50|$|The City Council of Chicago {{passed a}} law {{requiring}} that a fire alarm box be installed in front of schools and other public assembly venues. The interior fire alarm systems of these buildings must {{be connected to the}} <b>street</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> box. Another requirement was that all schools where it was deemed vital would have sprinkler systems installed. However, nine months later, in September 1959, Fire Commissioner Quinn, when interviewed by WNBQ reporter Len O'Connor, admitted that although 400 of the 1040 schools in Chicago at that time had been deemed in critical need of sprinkler systems, only two had actually had sprinklers installed.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Holzter {{founded the}} company as [...] "Holtzer Co." [...] and began {{manufacturing}} simple electrical devices such as doorbells and electric igniters. In 1880, Seth W. Fuller partnered with Holzter, and the company became known as [...] "Seth W. Fuller & Holtzer", and later as [...] "Fuller, Holtzer & Company". George E. Cabot joined the business, and Fuller left in 1889. The company then {{changed its name to}} [...] "Holtzer-Cabot", which remained their name until their closing. In 1891, the company built an electric car that sat four people and moved approximately 16 MPH. It was the first to feature a steering wheel, and is known as the first successful electric vehicle in America, though other unsuccessful prototypes had been built before. Around the turn of the 20th century, the company branched out to create various telephone/telegraph-related products, clocks, and fire alarm systems. They invented the first shunt-type fire alarm system, where a local alarm pulled in a building would also trigger the nearest municipal <b>street</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> box. Most of their fire alarm systems were installed in hospitals, factories, and institutions. In 1927, Charles Holtzer died. Throughout World War II, the company branched out even more, but struggled to retain business. In 1972, the company officially closed its doors, and sold the remainder of their lines to Eastern Air Devices based in Dover NH (Now known as Electrocraft). The original factory in Jamaica Plain, MA still exists, but has now been converted to an apartment complex.|$|E

When Ansonia became a separate Town from Derby in 1889, the two fire departments continued to operate separately.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines China's {{attempts to}} incorporate new, seemingly democratic f̀ire alarm' oversight institutions into their authoritarian political system. China's market economic reforms created new principal- agent problems that their traditional top-down oversight institutions cannot rectify, and {{these problems are}} forcing Chinese leaders to look for new solutions. Democratic leaders solve principal-agent problems by transferring monitoring authority to the citizenry, and Chinese leaders are borrowing that strategy by giving their own citizens new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions for holding local-level officials accountable to national-level laws and policies. However, Chinese leaders do not deploy these institutions uniformly across all policy sectors. Instead, they vary their <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions on a sector-by- sector basis, and this dissertation attempts to explain that variation. I argue that Chinese leaders divide their <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions into two broad categories : governmental and non-governmental. Governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> operate through state agencies; non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> operate through non-state communication and organization networks. Governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> are relatively safe, {{but they do not}} work well in China's politically controlled administrative environment. Non- governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> are relatively effective despite China's political controls, but they also pose additional risks. I argue that the risks associated with non- governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> vary across policy sectors. I hypothesize that Chinese leaders distinguish between high- and low-risk policy sectors and enable the more dangerous (and also more useful) non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> in the low-risk sectors only. This strategy maximizes the benefits from <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> oversight while also minimizing the potential political risks from non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms.</b> Unfortunately, this strategy also limits <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> effectiveness - especially in the high-risk sectors with the most restrictive non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> policies - so China's <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions will not be as effective as their (relatively unlimited) democratic counterparts. I test my hypothesis by comparing Chinese <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> oversight strategies across three policy sectors: rural land expropriation (high risk), environmental protection (medium risk) and food and drug safety (low risk). The case studies from these three sectors support my argument that Chinese leaders differentiate between governmental and non-governmental institutions and only employ non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> when the sector-specific political risks are relatively lo...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system.

Measurements of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> sound pressure levels (SPLs) in five elder care centres showed that the sound output of a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> can be depreciated after installation. The alarm level of a new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> installation could alert most of the building occupants but could not awaken a sleeping person. Subjective ratings on the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> audibility in terms of minimum <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> SPL were studied with 230 awaken subjects divided by two age groups (22 - 48 and 66 - 88) in the five elder care centres.
