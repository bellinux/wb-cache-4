40|$|This {{research}} studies how homeless {{men and women}} in small city homeless shelters perceive their own health status {{and the manner in which}} they utilize medical services. The data are collected by ethnographic methods and semi-structured interviews. Suchman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Stages</b> of Illness (1965), Parsons 2 ̆ 7 Sick Role (1951), and Stryker 2 ̆ 7 s Structural Symbolic Interaction (1980) are integrated to form Suchman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Stages</b> of Illness for Homeless People. This adapted model will be used to explain observations regarding health perceptions and medical utilization. The analysis shows that length of the homeless episode makes no appreciable difference in reported ill health, but that the two groups differ in their use of conventional medical treatment. Short-term (ST) respondents are propelled toward medical treatment because they believe that the medical system will provide an avenue out of homelessness. Long-term (LT) respondents are propelled away from medical treatment because they believe that the medical system will treat them in a negative manner. Finally, the significance of this research as it relates to a revision of Parson 2 ̆ 7 s sick role, the utility of Suchman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Stages</b> of Illness, and future implications for other homeless populations are offered. ...|$|R

(1994) and finally, the synthesis (<b>S)</b> <b>stage</b> of the feminist identity composite scale designed by Fischer et al. (2000). Two main hypotheses were tested by moderated regression. The main findings of the paper were that perceived feminist identity at the <b>S</b> <b>stage</b> has a moderating effect on the relationship between transformational leadership and sales performance and transformational leadership has a positive effect on sales performance as expected.

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a motoneuron disease {{characterized by}} misfolded proteins aggregation in affected motoneurons. In mutant SOD 1 (mutSOD 1) ALS models, aggregation correlates to impaired functions of proteasome and/or autophagy, both {{essential for the}} intracellular chaperone-mediated protein quality control (PQC), and a reduced mutSOD 1 clearance from motoneurons. Skeletal muscle cells are also sensitive to mutSOD 1 toxicity, but no mutSOD 1 aggregates are formed in these cells, that might better manage mutSOD 1 than motoneurons. Thus, we analysed in spinal cord and in muscle of transgenic (tg) G 93 A-SOD 1 at presymptomatic (PS, 8 weeks) and symptomatic (S, 16 weeks) stages, and in age-matched control mice, whether mutSOD 1 differentially modulates relevant PQC players, such as HSPB 8, BAG 3, and BAG 1. Possible sex differences were also considered. No changes of HSPB 8, BAG 3 and BAG 1 at PS stage (8 weeks) were seen in all tissues examined in tg G 93 A-SOD 1 and control mice. At <b>S</b> <b>stage</b> (16 weeks), HSPB 8 dramatically increased in skeletal muscle of tg G 93 A-SOD 1 mice, while a minor increase occurred in spinal cord of male, but not female tg G 93 A-SOD 1 mice. BAG 3 expression increased both in muscle and spinal cord of tg G 93 A-SOD 1 mice at <b>S</b> <b>stage,</b> BAG 1 expression increased only in muscle of the same mice. Since, HSPB 8 -BAG 3 complex assists mutSOD 1 autophagic removal, we analysed two well-known autophagic markers, LC 3 and p 62. Both LC 3 and p 62 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in skeletal muscle of tg G 93 A-SOD 1 mice at <b>S</b> <b>stage</b> (16 weeks). This suggests that mutSOD 1 expression induces a robust autophagic response specifically in muscle. Together these results demonstrate that, in muscle mutSOD 1 -induced autophagic response {{is much higher than}} in spinal cords. In addition, if mutSOD 1 exerts toxicity in muscle, this may not be mediated by misfolded protein accumulation. It remains unclear whether in muscle mutSOD 1 toxicity is related to aberrant autophagy activation...|$|E
