40|$|Horizontal-component {{response}} spectra {{data for}} ground mo-tions recorded on hard-rock sites in eastern North America (ENA) {{are used to}} explore the aleatory and epistemic uncer-tainty in ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs). An all-station sigma, expressing the total calculated scatter of values about a GMPE, ranges from 0. 25 to 0 : 29 log 10 unit. Single-station sigmas, in which the scatter is evaluated station by station relative to a regional GMPE, average {{in the range of}} 0. 23 – 0. 28. The <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> about site-specific GMPEs (GMPEs developed from multiple events recorded at a single station), which comes the closest to measuring the actual aleatory variability, has average values of 0. 22 – 0. 26. Overall, aleatory variability of ground motions in ENA is no larger than that for California, at least for moderate events re-corded on hard-rock sites. Epistemic uncertainty is considered by looking at the standard deviation of GMPEs developed sep-arately for each station (i. e., the scatter of predictions rather than the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations).</b> This exercise suggests that the overall epistemic uncertainty in ENA GMPEs should be at least 0. 15 log unit (as a standard deviation of the median GMPEs) in the magnitude–distance range in which the prediction equa-tions can be anchored by empirical data (magnitude 50 km).

40|$|The {{observed}} <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> about {{air quality}} model predictions {{stems from a}} combination of naturally occurring stochastic variations that are impossible for any model to simulate explicitly and variations arising from limitations in knowledge and from imperfect input data. In this paper, historical tracer experiments of atmospheric dispersion were analyzed to develop algorithms to characterize the observed stochastic variability in the ground-level crosswind concentration profile. The algorithms were incorporated into a Lagrangian puff model (“INPUFF”) so that the consequences of variability in the dispersion could be simulated using Monte Carlo methods. The variability in the plume trajectory was investigated in a preliminary sense by tracking the divergence in trajectories from releases adjacent to the actual release location. The variability in the near-centerline concentration values not described by the Gaussian crosswind profile was determined to be on the order of a factor of 2. The variability in the trajectory was determined as likely to be larger than the plume width, even with local wind observations for use in characterizing the transport. Two examples are provided to illustrate how estimates of variability 1) can provide useful information to inform decisions for emergency response and 2) can provide a basis for sound statistical designs for model performance assessments. 1...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a basic investigation on {{the influence of}} discharge on the variable sediment concentrations in the Andit Tid, Anjeni, and Maybar watersheds of northern Ethiopia. With valuable sediment concentration and stage measurements recorded by the Soil Conservation Research Programme at monitoring sites starting in the 1980 's, it is possible to gain knowledge about the important processes that affect changing sediment concentrations. For the years of observation, sediment yield estimates were 5. 4 t[MIDDLE DOT]ha- 1 y- 1, 22. 5 t[MIDDLE DOT]ha- 1 y- 1, and 8. 8 t[MIDDLE DOT]ha- 1 y- 1 for Andit Tid, Anjeni, and Maybar respectively. Although catchments tend to exhibit positive correlation between runoff and sediment concentration, albeit with a degree of scatter, these catchments exhibit a peculiar <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> with high concentrations for low flows and low concentrations for high flows. Due to this behavior, a sediment rating curve for all observations was unsatisfactory and subsequently, using several cumulative precipitation divisions to group related observations, non-linear regression showed a weak correlation for the Andit Tid basin, for most of the Anjeni basin and during the early portion of the rainy season in the Maybar basin. Stratification of points into cumulative precipitation ranges served to bring some order to the scatter plots of sediment concentration versus discharge to demonstrate that higher concentrations are observed during the beginning of the rainy season and lower concentrations are observed {{towards the end of the}} rainy season. Still, the exhaustion of available soil for transport may prove to have an important role in limiting the ability of discharge to account for the variability of sediment concentration throughout the season...|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{chemical}} constituents and meteorological quantities obtained {{during the two}} Arctic phases of the airborne campaign ARCTAS (Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites) are analyzed using an observationally constrained steady state box model. Measurements of OH and HO 2 from the Penn State ATHOS instrument are compared to model predictions. Forty percent of OH measurements below 2 km are at the limit of detection during the spring phase (ARCTAS-A). While the median observed-to-calculated ratio is near one, both the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> and the model uncertainty for OH are at the magnitude of ambient values. During the summer phase (ARCTAS-B), model predictions of OH are biased low relative to observations and demonstrate a high sensitivity {{to the level of}} uncertainty in NO observations. Predictions of HO 2 using observed CH 2 O and H 2 O 2 as model constraints are up to a factor of two larger than observed. A temperature-dependent terminal loss rate of HO 2 to aerosol recently proposed in the literature is shown to be insufficient to reconcile these differences. A comparison of ARCTAS-A to the high latitude springtime portion of the 2000 TOPSE campaign (Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox) shows similar meteorological and chemical environments with the exception of peroxides; observations of H 2 O 2 during ARCTAS-A were 2. 5 to 3 times larger than those during TOPSE. The cause of this difference in peroxides remains unresolved and has important implications for the Arctic HO x budget. Unconstrained model predictions for both phases indicate photochemistry alone is unable to simultaneously sustain observed levels of CH 2 O and H 2 O 2; however when the model is constrained with observed CH 2 O, H 2 O 2 predictions from a range of rainout parameterizations bracket its observations. A mechanism suitable to explain observed concentrations of CH 2 O is uncertain. Free tropospheric observations of acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) are 2 – 3 times larger than its predictions, though constraint of the model to those observations is sufficient to account for {{less than half of the}} deficit in predicted CH 2 O. The box model calculates gross O 3 formation during spring to maximize from 1 – 4 km at 0. 8 ppbv d − 1, in agreement with estimates from TOPSE, and a gross production of 2 – 4 ppbv d − 1 in the boundary layer and upper troposphere during summer. Use of the lower observed levels of HO 2 in place of model predictions decreases the gross production by 25 – 50 %. Net O 3 production is near zero throughout the ARCTAS-A troposphere, and is 1 – 2 ppbv in the boundary layer and upper altitudes during ARCTAS-B...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Road {{changing}} i. s {{the activity}} of moving operating lines on a cable yarding operation to permit access to logs in an unyarded portion of a logging unit. The time required to perform this activity varies widely and may consume {{a significant portion of}} the total yarding time. With rising costs in the logging industry, the efficiency of cable logging systems is constantly under critical review. Additional research in the area of road changing has been suggested in several studies (Dykstra, 1974 and Peters, 1973) Road changing information was gathered on several yarding operations in conjunction with detailed production studies of cable logging systems. On six of the operations the total time consumed by road changing was noted and recorded as a delay in the yarding process. On four operations, road changing was segmented into various activities, and factors hypothesized to influence road changing time were identified and measured. On the four operations studied in detail, two crewmen timed the road changing operation as the activities involved occurred at widely separated locations on the logging unit. The continuous time study method used on the overall production study (Dykstra, 1975 a) was also used during road changing. The analysis of road changing involves a descriptive analysis of all the operations studied and a quantitative analysis of road changing on the four operations studied in detail. The descriptive analysis consists primarily of a comparative investigation of road changing time between the operations. The quantitative analysis consists of a regression analysis of the four operations examined in detail. In the comparison of road changing times for the ten operations observed, road changing time varied widely. Even among similar systems a wide range was observed. This variability was most likely due to the differences in the road changing methods themselves, varying characteristics of the logging units and lengthy delays encountered during road changing. This could not be confirmed for six of the operations as road changing was not recorded in detail. However, among those operations observed in detail, this influence could be seen. Following a breakdown of road changing into machine intensive activities, labor intensive activities and delays, a large percentage of road changing time is occupied by delays. Also, the greatest proportion of delay-free time involved labor intensive activities. This was expected on the operations where pre-layout of roads was not done. On the operation where roads were pre-layed, other activities requiring labor intensive action occurred. Some of the delays encountered may have been due to characteristics of the particular yarder being used. A quantitative analysis was made of four operations. Road changing time, excluding delays and the time required to relocate the yarder was used as the dependent variable. Delay-free road changing time was found to be a function of the distance from the landing to the tailhold (SPAN) and groundslope. For two of the operations, identical machines and methods were used. A combined regression equation was formed based on the independent variable SPAN. Also, based on the <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> for these systems, an equa. - tion using SPAN 2 as the independent variable was found to be a better predictor of delay-free road changing time than SPAN...|$|E

This work investigates the temporal variability of soil respiration using field measurements, which also included soil moisture, soil temperature and litterfall, from April 2003 to January 2004, in a southwest Brazilian tropical rainforest near Ji-Paraná, Rondônia. The experimental design deployed five automatic (static, semi-opened) soil chambers connected to an infra-red CO 2 gas analyzer. The mean half-hourly soil respiration showed a large scattering from 0. 6 to 18. 9 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 and the average was 8. 0 ± 3. 4 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1. Soil respiration varied seasonally, being lower in the dry season and higher in the wet season, which generally responded positively to the variation of soil moisture and temperature year round. The peak was reached in the dry-to-wet season transition (September), this coincided with increasing sunlight, evapotranspiration and ecosystem productivity. Litterfall processes contributed to meet very favorable conditions for biomass decomposition in early wet season, especially the fresh litter on the forest floor accumulated during the dry season. We attempted to fit three models with the data: the exponential Q 10 model, the Reichstein model, and the log-soil moisture model.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that convection electric fields {{have an important}} effect on the ionosphere-thermosphere system at high latitudes and that a quantitative understanding of their effect requires {{a knowledge of the}} plasma convection pattern. Consequently, convection electric fields have been measured by a variety of techniques, including satellite, rocket, and balloon-borne probes, optical tracking of ionized barium clouds, incoherent <b>scatter</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> drifting F region plasma, and coherent <b>scatter</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> drifting E region irregularities. Since all of these measurement techniques provide information on only a limited spatial region at any time, the construction of the overall convection pattern requires a synthesis of data obtained at a variety of places and times. Some of the problems associated with this procedure are examined in this study using incoherent scatter radar data as an example. In this case the main problem stems from the great variability of the convection electric field. Even for very similar magnetic and IMF conditions, the synthesis of convection data obtained on different days produces a convection pattern which has a fairly large uncertainty. For the case considered, the uncertainty is sufficiently large so that the characteristic differences between the H. Volland [1978] and R. A. Heelis et al. [1982] convection models cannot be clearly identified. In comparison to this uncertainty, the uncertainties associated with assuming how corotation is driven and with transforming velocities between geographic and geomagnetic coordinate systems are negligible.

She suggests that the concept of obliterating comfort zones with the costumes is incorrect, as the outfits would add a layer of comfort through anonymity.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> relativistic electrons in the nightside outer radiation belt (around the geostationary orbit). We consider the particular case of low geomagnetic activity (|Dst| 3 ̆c 20 nT), quiet {{conditions in the}} solar wind, and absence of whistler wave emissions. For such conditions we find several events of Van Allen probe <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> butterfly pitch angle distributions of relativistic electrons (energies about 1 – 3 MeV). Many previous publications have described such pitch angle distributions over a wide energy range as due to the combined effect of outward radial diffusion and magnetopause shadowing. In this paper we discuss another mechanism that produces butterfly distributions over a limited range of electron energies. We suggest that such distributions can be shaped due to relativistic electron scattering in the equatorial plane of magnetic field lines that are locally deformed by currents of hot ions injected into the inner magnetosphere. Analytical estimates, test particle simulations, and <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> the AE index support this scenario. We conclude {{that even in the}} rather quiet magnetosphere, small scale (magnetic local time (MLT) -localized) injection of hot ions from the magnetotail can likely influence the relativistic electron <b>scattering.</b> Thus, <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> butterfly pitch angle distributions can serve as an indicator of magnetic field deformations in the nightside inner magnetosphere. We briefly discuss possible theoretical approaches and problems for modeling such nonadiabatic electron scattering...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} small angle neutron <b>scattering</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> the flux line lattice (FLL) {{in a single}} crystal of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7. To probe the mass {{anisotropy}} ratio, m 3 /m 1, measurements were made {{as a function of}} angle, THETA, between the 8 kOe applied field and the crystallographic (001) axis for 0 -degrees less-than-or-equal-to THETA less-than-or-equal-to 80 -degrees. With the rotation about an a/b (or y) axis, two symmetry-related distorted hexagonal FLL domains formed. Contrary to theoretical prediction, the lattices formed are consistent with a rotation of the short basis vector, a 1, from the x axis by 15 -degrees, after the effects of anisotropy are removed. The mass ratio is 20 +/- 2, which is slightly lower than published values. The temperature dependence of the intensity is not conventional...|$|R
40|$|<b>Observations</b> <b>of</b> {{a continual}} {{erosion of the}} strahl and build up of the halo with {{distance}} from the sun suggests that, at least in part, the halo may be formed as a result <b>of</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> the strahl. This hypothesis is supported in this paper by <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> intense <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> strahl electrons, which {{gives rise to a}} proto-halo electron population. This population eventually merges into, or becomes the halo. The fact that <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> intense <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> the strahl are not common implies that the formation of the halo may not be a continuous process, but one that occurs, in part, in bursts in regions where the conditions responsible for the scattering are optimum...|$|R
