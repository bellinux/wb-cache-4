5000|$|Initial {{steps to}} {{restrict}} pornography on the Internet {{were taken by}} the UK police. In the 1990s they began to take a pro-active regulatory role {{with respect to the}} Internet, using existing legislation and working on a <b>self-tasking</b> basis. In August 1996, the Metropolitan Police Clubs & Vice Unit sent an open letter to the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) supplying them with a list of 132 Usenet discussion groups that they believed to contain pornographic images or explicit text and requesting that they ban access to them. The list mainly included newsgroups which carried child pornography. Ian Taylor, the Conservative Science and Industry Minister, warned ISPs that the police would act against any company which provided their users with [...] "pornographic or violent material". Taylor went on {{to make it clear that}} there would be calls for legislation to regulate all aspects of the Internet unless service providers were seen to wholeheartedly [...] "responsible self-regulation". Following this, a tabloid-style exposé of ISP Demon Internet appeared in the Observer newspaper, which alleged that Clive Feather (a director of Demon) [...] "provides paedophiles with access to thousands of photographs of children being sexually abused". During the summer and autumn of 1996 the UK police made it known that they were planning to raid an ISP with the aim of launching a test case regarding the publication of obscene material over the Internet. The action of the UK police has been described as amounting to censorship without public or Parliamentary debate. It has been pointed out that the list supplied to ISPs by the police in August included a number of legitimate discussion groups concerned with legal sexual subjects. These contained textual material without pictures that would not be expected to infringe UK obscenity laws.|$|E

40|$|This {{advice is}} {{situated}} in a <b>self-tasking</b> dossier aimed at formulating recommendations to optimize the methodology of the control program of the FASFC in order to enable the study of trends. In this regard a distinction {{has to be made}} between trend watching and trend analysis. It is examined to what extent the results of the control program can be used for trend analysis. On one hand, a model is developed to calculate the sampling sizes needed in order to determine statistically, at a particular assumed initial prevalence, the existing of a trend (trend analysis). On the other hand, a model is developed to calculate the sample sizes in order to confirm, with a particular confidence, an observed trend in a particular prevalence during subsequent years. These models are applied to several case studies. Finally, the Scientific Committee recommends to include trend watching or trend analysis for appropriate contaminant/matrix combinations in the long term evaluation {{of the results of the}} control program...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{identifying}} dysfunctions in brain networks that may underlie disturbed empathic behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, {{subjects were asked}} to identify the emotional state observed in a facial stimulus (other-task) or to evaluate their own emotional response (<b>self-task).</b> Behaviorally, ASD subjects performed equally to the control group during the other-task, but showed less emotionally congruent responses in the <b>self-task.</b> Activations in brain regions related to theory of mind were observed in both groups. Activations of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) were located in dorsal subregions in ASD subjects and in ventral areas in control subjects. During the <b>self-task,</b> ASD subjects activated an additional network of frontal and inferior temporal areas. Frontal areas previously associated with the human mirror system were activated in both tasks in control subjects, while ASD subjects recruited these areas during the <b>self-task</b> only. Activations in the ventral MPFC may provide the basis for one's "emotional bond" with other persons' emotions. Such atypical patterns of activation may underlie disturbed empathy in individuals with ASD. Subjects with ASD may use an atypical cognitive strategy to gain access to their own emotional state in response to other people's emotions...|$|R

40|$|In typical development, empathic {{abilities}} {{continue to}} refine during adolescence and early adulthood. Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show deficits in empathy, whereas adults with ASD may have developed compensatory strategies. We aimed at comparing developmental trajectories in the neural mechanisms underlying empathy in individuals with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) subjects. Using an explicit empathizing paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging, 27 participants with ASD and 27 TDC aged 12 – 31 years were investigated. Participants {{were asked to}} empathize with emotional faces and to either infer the face’s emotional state (other-task) or to judge their own emotional response (<b>self-task).</b> Differential age-dependent changes were evident during the <b>self-task</b> in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right inferior parietal cortex, right anterior insula and occipital cortex. Age-dependent decreases in neural activation in TDC were paralleled by either increasing or unchanged age-dependent activation in ASD. These data suggest ASD-associated deviations in the developmental trajectories of self-related processing during empathizing. In TDC, age-dependent modulations of brain areas may reflect the ‘fine-tuning’ of cortical networks by reduction of task-unspecific brain activity. Increased age-related activation in individuals with ASD may indicate the development of compensatory mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|EFSA is {{committed}} to assess and communicate the risks occurring in the food and feed chain from farm to fork and to provide other forms of scientific advice. This work, carried out by EFSA since its inception, {{has resulted in the}} adoption of thousands of scientific assessments. EFSA is obliged to re-assess past assessments in specific regulatory contexts such as those on food and feed additives, active substances in plant protection products and genetically modified food and feed. In other sectors, the consideration for updating past EFSA scientific assessments is taken on an ad hoc basis mainly depending on specific requests by risk managers or on EFSA <b>self-tasking.</b> If safety is potentially at stake in any area within EFSA's remit, the readiness to update past scientific assessments is important to keep EFSA at the forefront of science and to promote an effective risk assessment. Although this task might be very complex and resource demanding, it is fundamental to EFSA's mission. The present EFSA Scientific Committee opinion deals with scientific motivations and criteria to contribute to the timely updating of EFSA scientific assessments. It is recognised that the decision for updating should be agreed following careful consideration of all the relevant elements by the EFSA management, in collaboration with risk managers and stakeholders. The present opinion addresses the scientific approaches through which it would be possible for EFSA to increase the speed and effectiveness of the acquisition of new data, as well as, to improve the consequent evaluations to assess the relevance and reliability of new data in the context of contributing to the better definition of whether to update past scientific assessments. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Although empathy {{is rooted}} early in life, {{the ability to}} {{understand}} and share the emotions of others continues to develop after childhood. Here, we aimed at exploring developmental changes in the neural mechanisms underlying empathy from childhood to early adulthood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 47 healthy male subjects aged 8 - 27 years were investigated during an explicit empathy task. Emotional faces were presented and participants were either asked to infer the emotional state from the face (other-task) or to judge their own emotional response to the face (<b>self-task).</b> A perceptual decision on the width of faces {{was used as a}} control condition. Age-related activity increases were observed in the fusiform gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, depending on whether subjects attributed emotions to self or other. During the <b>self-task,</b> activity in the right precuneus and right intraparietal sulcus decreased as a function of age. No age-related differences were observed in behavioral performance measures. Increased activity in the fusiform gyrus and in the frontal component of the human mirror neuron system with increasing age may be explained by greater experience and expertise accumulated during socio-emotional interactions. Greater recruitment of right parietal structures in younger as compared to older subjects might reflect developmental differences in the cognitive strategies to infer one's own emotional response. This study is the first to show developmental changes in the neural mechanisms supporting empathy. Our findings may have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions in clinical conditions characterized by empathy deficits, such as autism spectrum disorder...|$|R
40|$|Empathy allows {{emotional}} psychological inference {{about other}} person's mental states and feelings in social contexts. We aimed at specifying the common and differential neural mechanisms of "self"- and "other"-related attribution of emotional states using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects viewed faces expressing emotions with direct or averted gaze and either {{focused on their}} own emotional response to each face (<b>self-task)</b> or evaluated the emotional state expressed by the face (other-task). The common network activated by both tasks included the left lateral orbito-frontal and medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), bilateral inferior frontal cortices, superior temporal sulci and temporal poles, {{as well as the}} right cerebellum. In a subset of these regions, neural activity was significantly correlated with empathic abilities. The self- (relative to the other-) task differentially activated the MPFC, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) /precuneus, and the temporo-parietal junction bilaterally. Empathy-related processing of emotional facial expressions recruited brain areas involved in mirror neuron and theory-of-mind (ToM) mechanisms. The differential engagement of the MPFC, the PCC/precuneus, and temporo-parietal regions in the <b>self-task</b> indicates that these structures act as key players in the evaluation of one's own emotional state during empathic face-to-face interaction. Activation of mirror neurons in a task relying on empathic abilities without explicit task-related motor components supports the view that mirror neurons are not only involved in motor cognition but also in emotional interpersonal cognition. An interplay between ToM and mirror neuron mechanisms may hold for the maintenance of a self-other distinction during empathic interpersonal face-to-face interactions...|$|R
50|$|Research on suicide {{can be a}} {{difficult}} process because suicidal patients are commonly covert about their intentions to avoid hospitalization. An implicit cognition associated <b>self-task</b> was applied in one experiment to unveil any suspicious behavior of people who might attempt suicide. This study found patients who were released from mental hospitals showed significant implicit association to attempt suicide. The Implicit Association Task would predict whether a patient was likely to attempt suicide depending on they respond. An individual's implicit cognition {{may lead to a}} behavior to best cope with stress. This behavior may be suicide, substance abuse, or even violence. However, implicit association with death will show those most at risk for attempting suicide because this individual is looking for the best solution for ending their stress.|$|R
40|$|Females {{frequently}} {{score higher}} on standard tests of empathy, social sensitivity, and emotion recognition than do males. It {{remains to be}} clarified, however, whether these gender differences are associated with gender specific neural mechanisms of emotional social cognition. We investigated gender differences in an emotion attribution task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects either focused on their own emotional response to emotion expressing faces (<b>SELF-task)</b> or evaluated the emotional state expressed by the faces (OTHER-task). Behaviorally, females rated SELF-related emotions significantly stronger than males. Across the sexes, SELF- and OTHER-related processing of facial expressions activated a network of medial and lateral prefrontal, temporal, and parietal brain regions involved in emotional perspective taking. During SELF-related processing, females recruited the right inferior frontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus stronger than males. In contrast, there was increased neural activity in the left temporoparietal junction in males (relative to females). When performing the OTHER-task, females showed increased activation of the right inferior frontal cortex while there were no differential activations in males. The data suggest that females recruit areas containing mirror neurons to a higher degree than males during both SELF- and OTHER-related processing in empathic face-to-face interactions. This may underlie facilitated emotional "contagion" in females. Together with the observation that males differentially rely on the left temporoparietal junction (an area mediating {{the distinction between the}} SELF and OTHERS) the data suggest that females and males rely on different strategies when assessing their own emotions in response to other people...|$|R
40|$|A {{deficit in}} empathy has been {{repeatedly}} described in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also, albeit less markedly, in their unaffected relatives. Here, we aimed {{to investigate the}} neural mechanisms of empathy in ASD, and to explore familial contributions to empathy correlates. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 15 boys with ASD, 11 fathers of adolescents with ASD, and two control groups comparable for age and IQ (n= 15 typically developing boys and their fathers (n= 9)) were investigated during an empathy task. Emotional faces were presented and participants were either asked to infer the emotional state from the face (other-task) or to judge their own emotional response to the face (<b>self-task).</b> When attributing emotions to self and other, the ASD group showed diminished fusiform gyrus activation compared to controls. Neural activity in the fusiform gyrus was inversely related to social deficits in ASD subjects. Moreover, when ASD subjects inferred their own emotional response to faces, they showed less congruent reactions and inferior frontal gyrus activity was decreased. Although fathers of ASD children scored higher on a self-rating scale for autistic symptoms compared to control fathers, their task performance was unimpaired. However, neurally, fathers of affected children also showed reduced fusiform gyrus activation when inferring others' emotions. Shared abnormalities in fusiform gyrus activation in affected adolescents and first-degree relatives suggest that this dysfunction constitutes a fundamental deviation in ASD. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that both aberrant neural face and mirroring mechanisms are implicated in empathy impairments in ASD...|$|R
