25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{financial}} management is to maximize or to continually increase <b>shareholder</b> <b>value.</b> Maximizing <b>shareholder</b> <b>value</b> requires managers {{to be able to}} balance capital funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form of dividends to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn high rates of return on invested capital) will use most of the firm's capital resources and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies reach maturity levels within their industry (i.e. companies that earn approximately average or lower returns on invested capital), managers of these companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders. Managers must do an analysis to determine the appropriate allocation of the firm's capital resources and cash surplus between projects and payouts of dividends to shareholders, as well as paying back creditor related debt.|$|E

By the time he took power, Fiat's market share in Italy had fallen to 41% from around 62% in 1984. However, a Jack Welch-like management style would be much harsher than that used by the Italians (e.g., precarious versus lifetime employment). Instead, Fresco focused on offering more incentives for good performance, including compensation using stock options for top and middle management.|$|E

[...] They subtly but quickly acquired 4.9 percent of Gulf Oil's stock by early fall 1983, just shy of having to declare themselves and their intent at 5 percent to the SEC. [...] In the ten days allowed to prepare the SEC filing, Mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of the company's stock, larger than the founding Mellon family's share, by October 1983. Gulf responded to Mesa's interest by calling a shareholders' meeting for late November 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing the corporation's by-laws to minimize arbitrage. Pickens made loud criticisms of the existing Gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release <b>shareholder</b> <b>value</b> through a royalty trust that management argued would [...] "slim down" [...] Gulf's market share. Pickens had acquired {{the reputation of being}} a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them. During the early 1980s alone, he made failed bids for Cities Service, General American Oil, Gulf, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal. The process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in the target companies. This is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost the current share price, although possibly at the expense of long-term strategic advantage. The target shares would rise sharply in price, at which point Pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit.|$|E

2500|$|This area {{is related}} to {{corporate}} finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to business and market risk {{is a direct result}} of previous capital financial investments. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or preserving, firm value. [...] There is a fundamental debate [...] relating to [...] "Risk Management" [...] and <b>shareholder</b> <b>value.</b> Per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking exposure to pure risk (a risk event that only has a negative side, such as loss of life or limb). The debate links the value of risk management in a market to the cost of bankruptcy in that market.|$|E
2500|$|He {{wanted to}} drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that {{initially}} lost money, but other partners prevailed and it eventually gained billions. Romney was {{on the board of}} directors of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once acquired. Beginning in 1989, the firm, which began as a venture capital source investing in start-up companies, adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies. [...] Their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets, partner with existing management to apply Bain methodology to their operations (rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios), and sell them off in a few years. Existing CEOs were offered large equity stakes in the process, owing to Bain Capital's belief in the emerging agency theory that CEOs should be bound to maximizing <b>shareholder</b> <b>value</b> rather than other goals. By the end of 1990, Bain had raised $175 million of capital and financed 35 companies with combined revenues of $3.5 billion.|$|E

2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits.

The company had continued to grow through acquisitions, achieving revenues of $800 million, despite having an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion by the end of 1998. Mattel CEO Jill Barad made a takeover bid in an attempt to overcome a downward slide in her company's stock price, [...] "seiz on educational software as a driver of future growth." [...] Mattel had found success with its series featuring Barbie due to the representation of the characters, and sought to replicate this formula by expanding the product line to include series like Madeline, which also included [...] "well-developed characters." [...] A few weeks after the sale, CFRA produced a critical report on Mattel, which claimed: [...] "TLC was already experiencing collapsing revenue, a surge in receivables and a deterioration of operating cash flow." [...] O'Leary, who had been hired as president of Mattel's new TLC digital division, soon sold his stock for $6 million, a few months before $2 billion in <b>shareholder</b> <b>value</b> was lost in a single day. The Learning Company's acquisition by Mattel in May 1999 resulted in a loss of nearly $300 million (once estimated at a loss of a $1 million a day) and represented the end of the [...] "boom-and-bust period" [...] of the [...] "edutainment" [...] era of the mid-1990s. Toby Levenson, former manager of The Learning Company's Educational Design Department, said [...] "edutainment" [...] had become [...] "a toxic word" [...] following the company's merger with Mattel, while Businessweek would describe the acquisition as one of [...] "the Worst Deals of All Time".

Growth within the sector is attributed to constantly emerging start-up and small micro medium enterprises, adding more competition and forcing incumbents to change the way they do business. Many companies struggle to adapt quickly to rapidly changing technologies that often disrupts existing markets and sometimes introduce new markets. Given TMT sector dynamics and challenges, small and large companies within the sector have recently started embracing mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as a growth and defence strategy to ensure that they remain relevant, retain existing markets, expand and venture into new markets in order to continue to create and sustain <b>shareholders</b> <b>value.</b> According to Institute of Management Accountants (1997), the linkage between strategy and value creation can be summarized by two simple laws of value creation; the first law is that management must create value for shareholders; and the second law is that all other stakeholders should also be satisfied in a way that contributes to shareholders value; and the company‟s ability to continue to attract capital by providing incremental <b>value</b> to <b>shareholders</b> is exactly what will allow it to continue to provide attractive products to its customers, attractive employment to its staff, and opportunities for its suppliers.
