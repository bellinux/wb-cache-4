50|$|The age and <b>sex</b> <b>structure</b> of the {{population}} are important in determining when a crash happens; for instance, adult males enter winter in a poor condition after the autumn rut, whereas females have been grazing all summer and so enter winter in a good condition. Survival rates of males (and lambs) are influenced by weather throughout winter (dependent {{on the strength of}} the North Atlantic Oscillation), whereas survival rates of females (and adolescents) are influenced most strongly by rainfall at the end of winter, when they will normally be heavily pregnant (the rain soaks the wool, increasing energy expenditure).|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to examine}} the age and <b>sex</b> <b>structure</b> of the {{population}} of Zimbabwe, based on an analysis of the 1982 census data. A study of the population based on the 1982 census was carried out by Zinyama and Whitlow (1986), but this was mainly concerned with spatial changes over time. This paper examines the vertical distribution of the population, that is its age and <b>sex</b> <b>structure,</b> at various sub-national levels and the factors that determine these vertical variations. Reference to the spatial distribution pattern is made only where this aids in the explanation of the vertical age-sex variations. The paper is divided into four main sections. The first part examines some of the theoretical issues involved in age-sex structure analysis. The second and third sections discuss variations in the age and <b>sex</b> <b>structure</b> {{of the population of}} Zimbabwe by provinces and local administrative units, respectively, as revealed in the 1982 census data.

50|$|Copulation and {{reproduction}} are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The clitellum becomes very reddish to pinkish in color. Some time after copulation, {{long after the}} worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. As the worm slips out of the ring, {{the ends of the}} cocoon seal to form a vaguely lemon-shaped incubator (cocoon) in which the embryonic worms develop. They emerge as small, but fully formed earthworms, but lack their <b>sex</b> <b>structures,</b> which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year. Scientists predict that the average lifespan under field conditions is four to eight years, while most garden varieties live only one to two years.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Sexual {{differentiation}} of the endocrine and behavioral {{components of the}} avian reproductive system occurs throughout embryonic development, initiat-ing {{some of the early}} cellular events that form the central nervous system (CNS) and culminating in the organization of male or female neuroendocrine responses. Early cellular events have been studied intensively in recent years and these de-velopmental processes appear to involve specific growth factors in the development of certain tissues. Subsequent to cellular differentiation, primordial germ cells mi-grate to the appropriate anatomical location and {{contribute to the development of}} the single ovary or testes; steroidogenesis begins soon thereafter. Other portions of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis also appear during early embry-onic development with migration of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from the olfactory region of the CNS to the midbrain and separate for-mation of the pituitary gland. The gonadal steroid hormones affect development of accessory <b>sex</b> <b>structures</b> as well as the later organization of neuroendocrine regulatory systems and secondary sex characteristics.

Method: This was a cross sectional study of consecutive diabetic patients seen at the diabetes clinic of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu, Nigeria between September 1, 2004 and April 30, 2005.

40|$|International audienceNatural selection, random processes, {{and gene}} flow {{are known to}} {{generate}} sex ratio variations among sexually polymorphic plant populations. In gynodioecious species, in which hermaphrodites and females coexist, the relative effect of these processes on the maintenance of sex polymorphism is still up for debate. The {{aim of this study}} was to document sex ratio and cytonuclear genetic variation at a very local scale in wind-pollinated gynodioecious Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima, and attempt to elucidate which processes explained the observed variation. The study sites were characterized by geographically distinct patches of individuals and appeared to be dynamic entities, with recurrent establishment of distinct haplotypes through independent founder events. Along with substantial variation in sex ratio and unexpectedly low gene flow within study sites, our results showed a high genetic differentiation among a mosaic of genetically distinct demes, with isolation by distance or abrupt genetic discontinuities taking place within a few tens of meters. Overall, random founder events with restricted gene flow could be primary determinants of <b>sex</b> <b>structure,</b> by promoting the clumping of sex-determining genes. Such high levels of <b>sex</b> <b>structure</b> provide a landscape for differential selection acting on sex-determining genes, which could modify the conditions of maintenance of gynodioecy in structured populations...|$|E

The results show that the â€œworkerâ€ in the â€œmigrant workerâ€ comes from the â€œwork for other peopleâ€; although the â€œmigrant workerâ€ has the sense of discrimination, it really reflects the survival states of a certain social class; comparing with the first class migrant workers, the new generation migrant workers are the second generation of migrant workers, and their social position has not changed basically. The unfairness of social mobility is included among the â€œpoor second generationâ€, â€œrich second generationâ€ and â€œofficer second generationâ€, which may lead to the hardening of social class and the appear of opposite classes; the new generation migrant workers are subverting their fathers’ psychological recognition of â€œman dominates the outside and the woman dominates the insideâ€ by the imbalanced <b>sex</b> <b>structure,</b> which is characterized by more women and less men.

40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{demographic}} features of two north-east coastal villages, Cullercoats and Seahouses, {{in the mid}} nineteenth century. It demonstrates that ostensibly similar localities had somewhat different trajectories of demographic development. Despite being of similar size, the two villages had very different <b>sex</b> <b>structures</b> {{largely due to the}} traditionally greater opportunities for female employment in Cullercoats, particularly in activities related to the fishing industry. Cullercoats was well established and had a stable population, remarkably so in relation to its proximity to populous areas in the rest of Tyneside. Seahouses was also a fishing village, albeit one with other economic activities present, and experienced greater dynamism characterised by high mobility rates and family sizes. More diverse but specifically male employment characterised its economic structure and the fishing industry was organised differently. This article represents a substantial extension of one of the key themes, namely the significance of intra-regional variation, in the submitted chapter on ‘Northumbrian Settlements’, where space to explore a number of issues was necessarily limited. This article is of methodological interest in that it highlights the dangers of linking functional similarities to expected norms without detailed analysis of case studies...|$|R
