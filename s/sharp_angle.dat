5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|Greene won {{his second}} AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award after the 1974 season, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} receive the award multiple times. That year, he developed a new tactic of lining up at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> between the guard and center to disrupt the opposition's blocking assignments. His coaches were at first skeptical of the tactic and did not allow him to try it during the regular season. He first implemented it against the Buffalo Bills in the division championship game. It proved to be highly effective, as it impeded Buffalo's blocking, and running back O. J. Simpson managed only 48 yards rushing. The following week, the Steelers faced the Oakland Raiders in the AFC championship game, with the defining match-up being Greene against All-Pro center Jim Otto. At one point Greene, consumed by emotions, kicked Otto in the groin. Later, on a third-down play, Greene threw Otto to the ground with one arm before leaping to sack quarterback Ken Stabler. Oakland was held to 29 rushing yards in the Steelers' 24–13 victory. On January 12, 1975, the Steelers won their first of four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 16–6 in Super Bowl IX. In that game, lined up against center Mick Tingelhoff, Greene recorded an interception, forced fumble, and fumble recovery in what {{is considered one of the}} greatest individual defensive Super Bowl performances. Pittsburgh limited the Vikings to only 119 total yards of offense, 17 of which were gained on the ground. After the season, Greene was honored by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at its 39th Dapper Dan dinner as Pittsburgh's outstanding sports figure of the year.|$|E

30|$|The {{unaffected}} acetabulum {{followed the}} normal age-dependent development of <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> {{as reported by}} Ozçelik et al. [17], whereas the affected side remained steep at the 5 -year-follow-up. One previous study has measured the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> in children with Perthes’ disease. Joseph showed that the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> of Perthes’ hips in male, skeletally immature patients was higher compared to the unaffected side (44.7 ° vs. 42.9 °) [5]. Furthermore, he found {{a significant difference in}} the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> between affected and unaffected hips in symptomatic adult patients with healed Perthes’ disease (40.1 ° and 36.1 °, respectively). These results are in accordance with our results, indicating that a steeper acetabulum is developed in Perthes’ hips during the course of the disease.|$|R
30|$|To our knowledge, no {{previous}} study has associated <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> {{at an early stage}} of Perthes’ disease with the later shape of the femoral head. We found no significant associations between this parameter at the time of diagnosis and at the 1 -year follow-up with the modified three-group Stulberg classification at the 5 -year follow-up. Thus, <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> is of no prognostic value in Perthes’ disease.|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{would then}} pull {{away at a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> from the flare (and the terminal trajectory of the missile) and reduce engine power in attempt to cool the thermal signature. Optimally, the missile's seeker head is then confused by this change in temperature and flurry of new signatures, and therefore follows the flare(s) rather than the aircraft. The most modern IR-guided missiles have sophisticated on-board electronics that help discriminate between flares and targets, reducing the effectiveness of countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most thermoplastics, {{polycarbonate}} can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can {{be processed}} and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as bending on a brake. Even for <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> bends with a tight radius, heating may not be necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. PMMA/Acrylic, which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> in {{the ridge}} {{is marked by}} a {{depression}} at 950ft, beyond which the ground climbs slowly for around a mile toward the top. This section of the fell is named Low Bank on Ordnance Survey maps and is clad primarily in bracken. The final section bears a series of rocky knolls, still rising slowly north westward. A tumbling descent of crag and scree then follows {{as the end of the}} ridge drops steeply to the valley floor, halfway along the shore of Crummock Water. Rannerdale farm lies below this terminal face.|$|E
30|$|A {{secondary}} change {{noted in}} patients treated with transphyseal screw fixation of the proximal femur was {{an improvement in}} acetabular geometry. <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> improved by 4.7 ° and the center edge angle improved by 5.8 °. The acetabular index was not measured in this study because it becomes increasingly difficult to measure as the triradiate cartilage closes when patients become skeletally mature. Meanwhile, <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> references landmarks present through development, and it shows little variation with pelvic tilt and pelvic rotation [15]. Furthermore, prior studies report good inter- and intra-rater reliability for <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> and center edge angle of Wiberg [20]. While the mean changes in <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> and the CE angle were small, in some children the improvement was remarkable. In reviewing and measuring many radiographs, {{it appears that the}} central third of the proximal femoral physis is relatively straight, while the superior and inferior margins droop. This central third of the physis corresponds to the roundest part of the femoral head, which could be a stimulus for acetabular improvement. However, this is difficult to document but deserves further investigation.|$|R

25|$|The frets {{are made}} of loops of gut tied around the neck. They fray with use, and must be {{replaced}} from time to time. A few additional partial frets of wood are usually glued {{to the body of}} the instrument, to allow stopping the highest-pitched courses up to a full octave higher than the open string, though these are regarded anachronistic by some (though John Dowland and Thomas Robinson describe the practice of gluing wooden frets onto the soundboard). Given the choice between nylon and gut, many luthiers prefer to use gut, as it conforms more readily to the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> {{at the edge of the}} fingerboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Walden has noted, in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} oblique intersection at {{the eastern end of}} the Route208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle,</b> with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut.|$|E
25|$|Like {{others before}} and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a {{noticeable}} parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles {{the center of the}} Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now know that it is about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).|$|E

25|$|In 1911, {{when the}} Sproul Road Bill was passed, Legislative Route 132 was {{designated}} on current PA 352 between Chester and Baltimore Pike west of Media, while Legislative Route 179 was designated {{on the part}} between Media and Paoli Pike in East Goshen Township. PA 352 was first designated by 1928 to run from US 13 in Chester north to US 30 in Frazer. By 1950, a portion of PA 352 north of Parkside was widened into a multilane highway and a straighter alignment for PA 352 was proposed from north of Parkside to south of US 1. The realigned PA 352 was completed during the 1950s, with the former alignment now Old Middletown Road. By 1980, PA 352 was realigned to form a short concurrency with PA 3 instead of intersecting it at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1974 {{terminal}} {{was built}} in the International style of architecture popular for American commercial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It consists of a single curved terminal with concourses radiating outward. Large floor to ceiling plate glass windows form curtain walls on the departure level of the terminal with horizontal bands of repetitive white architectural panels above and below. A slight departure from typical International style, the upper band of panels was decorated with raised circles of four sizes, two circles per size per panel. The roof is flat over the terminal and concourses; a series of steel columns painted white with stay cables for the terminal awning project from the roof. An enclosed white-clad Observation Deck jutted out from the airside terminal face at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> between the old concourses B and C. On the airside of the terminal, a large horizontal white sign with teal lettering identified the city as Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|Peristome is double; inner lip {{recognizable}} as a narrow ridge, contacting the body whorl and closing the umbilicus (visible in not fully grown specimens); outer lip is protruding, forming a small, free tube. Aperture is pear-shaped, whitish inside, with a sinulus {{which is not}} defined at the palatal side. Lamella parietalis (= superior) very prominent, reaching {{the margin of the}} peristome, which is conspicuously curved at that site; its inner end merging into the lamella spiralis. Inside the shell, the lamella columellaris reaches somewhat further than ventrally, whereas both the lamella subcolumellaris and the spiralis are slightly shorter; without a lamella inserta. In frontal view, the lamella columellaris is visible as a low, nearly straight lamella, not reaching the margin of the peristome, whereas the lamella subcolumellaris reaches the margin of the peristome in most specimens. With six plicae palatales: plica principalis, shortly visible in frontal view, ventro-laterally accompanied by five short, somewhat curved plicae, increasingly diverging from the principalis and nearly running parallel which each other, so that the lowest one runs most obliquely. Inside the body whorl, the plicae are connected by a lunella-like ridge of callus. Clausilial blade is simple, ending with a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The bass type, {{similarly}} to the theorbo and other baroque lutes, has a vaulted body (shell) constructed of separate ribs, a flat soundboard {{with either a}} carved rose or one which is inset into the soundhole, and a bridge (without a saddle) consisting of a wooden bar acting as a string-holder glued to the soundboard. Unique to this instrument is the neck, which is long enough to allow for ten to 12 tied gut frets. The pegbox is either straight and set at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> to the neck (much like a lute pegbox), or gently curving and set at a shallow angle, either case being fitted with laterally-inserted tuning pegs (although sometimes a flat pegboard with sagittal pegs is found). The strings were of gut and are strung either singly or, especially on Italian instruments, in double courses. However, on German-made instruments, the first course (highest in pitch) is usually single (a chanterelle) and often has its own separate raised peg rider/holder attached to the pegbox. The number of courses varies from six to eight. Open string lengths tend to be fairly long (6272cm) on German instruments, but shorter (5565cm) on late Italian ones, probably because they tended to be tuned to a higher pitch.|$|E
25|$|The keel {{consisted}} of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, {{holes in the}} prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off {{the sides of the}} ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand pounds each, used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> against the main shaft. Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a balanced rudder which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The balanced rudder placed as much of the rudder forward of the stern post as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800–900feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle.|$|E

50|$|On a carom table, the K-55 {{profile is}} used (with a {{somewhat}} <b>sharper</b> <b>angle</b> than pool cushions). K-55 cushions have cloth, usually canvas, vulcanized {{into the top}} of the rubber to adjust rebound accuracy and speed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sharpest</b> <b>angles</b> {{are usually}} {{seen on the}} frontal glacis plate, both {{as it is the}} hull side most likely to be hit and because there is more room to slope in the {{longitudinal}} direction of a vehicle.|$|R
500|$|The East Building {{was honored}} on 30 May 1978, {{two days before}} its public unveiling, with a black-tie party {{attended}} by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in The New York Times that Pei's building was [...] "a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture". The <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn {{from the hands of}} visitors.|$|E
500|$|German {{research}} {{during the}} Second World War had shown {{the onset of}} wave drag was greatly reduced by using airfoils that varied in curvature as gradually as possible. This suggested the use of thinner airfoils with much longer chord than designers would have used on subsonic aircraft. These designs were impractical because they left little internal room in the wing for armament or fuel. However, they also discovered {{it was possible to}} [...] "trick" [...] the airflow into the same behaviour if a conventional thicker airfoil was used swept rearward at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle,</b> creating a swept-wing. This provided many of the advantages of a thinner airfoil while also retaining the internal space needed for strength and fuel storage. Another advantage was that the wings were clear of the supersonic shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea (Old English Cealchyð, chalk wharf), about [...] west of Westminster on {{the north}} bank of the River Thames, has existed as a {{settlement}} since at least Anglo-Saxon times. The Thames at this point inflects through a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> from a south-north to an east-west flow, and the slow-moving and relatively easily fordable river here is popularly {{believed to be the}} site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. Chelsea enjoyed good road and river connections to the seat of government at Westminster and the commercial centre of the City of London since at least the 14th century. It was a centre of the British porcelain industry, and a major producer of baked goods– at peak periods almost 250,000 chelsea buns per day were sold. By the 18th century it had large numbers of very prosperous residents.|$|E
50|$|These kind of longboards include wheel cutouts {{which provide}} {{room for the}} wheels to turn at <b>sharper</b> <b>angles</b> while {{avoiding}} wheelbite. Hybrids {{also tend to be}} shorter than other longboards, which allows the rider to be more stable.|$|R
