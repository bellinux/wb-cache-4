Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad. Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area. Al-Maʿarri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Jackson {{released}} his only autobiography, Moonwalk, which took {{four years to}} complete and sold 200,000 copies. He wrote about his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse he had suffered. He also wrote about his changing facial appearance, attributing it to puberty, weight loss, a <b>strict</b> <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diet,</b> a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting. Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers' list. Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. Due to financial issues, the film was only released theatrically in Germany; in other markets it was released direct-to-video. It debuted {{at the top of}} the Billboard Top Music Video Cassette chart, staying there for 22 weeks. It was eventually knocked off the top spot by Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a <b>strict</b> <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diet.</b> Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

500|$|In his book, Jackson {{attributed}} {{the changes in}} the structure of his face to puberty, a <b>strict</b> <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diet,</b> weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. Jackson denied allegations that he had altered his eyes.

In June 1992, the Daily Mirror ran a full front-page picture, allegedly of Jackson's face, which they described as [...] "hideously disfigured" [...] by plastic surgery. Jackson sued the tabloid, and, in 1998, they agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Jackson. At the High Court, the paper's former editor acknowledged that after meeting Jackson in person, he believed that Jackson was neither hideously disfigured nor scarred at all. A Daily Mirror solicitor maintained that the publication did not tamper with the picture.|$|E
40|$|Vegetarians, {{those who}} avoid meat, and vegans, {{additionally}} avoiding dairy and eggs, represent 5 % and 2 %, respectively, of the US population. The {{aim of this}} review is to assess the effects of <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diets,</b> particularly <b>strict</b> <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diets</b> (i. e., vegans) on health and disease outcomes.

2500|$|In late antiquity {{and in the}} Middle Ages many {{monks and}} hermits renounced meat-eating {{in the context of}} their asceticism. The most {{prominent}} of them was St Jerome († 419), whom they used to take as their model. The Rule of St Benedict (6th century) allowed the Benedictines to eat fish and fowl, but forbade the consumption of the meat of quadrupeds unless the religious was ill. Many other rules of religious orders contained similar restrictions of diet, some of which even included fowl, but fish was never prohibited, as Jesus himself had eaten fish (Luke 24:42-43). The concern of those monks and nuns was frugality, voluntary privation, and self-mortification. William of Malmesbury writes that Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester (d. 1095) decided to adhere to a <b>strict</b> <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diet</b> simply because he found it difficult to resist the smell of roasted goose. Saint Genevieve, the Patron Saint of Paris, is mentioned as having observed a vegetarian diet—but as an act of physical austerity, rather than out of concern for animals. [...] Medieval hermits, at least those portrayed in literature, may have been vegetarians for similar reasons, as suggested in a passage from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur: 'Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure (mishap), and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage.

40|$|Healthy {{adult men}} and healthy adult nonpregnant, nonlactating women consum-ing a usual, varied diet {{do not need}} vitamin {{supplements}}. Infants may need dietary supplements at given times, as may pregnant and lactating women. Occasionally, vitamin supplements may be useful for people with unusual life=req- styles or modified diets, including certain weight reduction regimens and <b>strict</b> <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diets.</b> Vitamins in therapeutic amounts may be indicated {{for the treatment of}} deficiency states, for pathologic conditions in which absorption and utilization of vitamins are reduced or requirements increased, and for certain nonnutritional disease processes. The decision to employ vitamin preparations in therapeutic amounts clearly rests with the physician. The importance of medical supervision when such amounts are administered is emphasized. Therapeutic vitamin mixtures should be so labeled and should not be used as dietary supplements. (JAMA 1987; 257 : 1929 - 1936) VITAMIN preparations are used exten¬ sively in the practice ofmedicine and are valuable when used properly. It is im¬ portant that a clear distinction be made between vitamins as dietary supple¬ ments and vitamins as therapeutic agents. It is also important for the practitioner to understand the useful¬ ness and the limitations ofgiven vitamin preparations in given clinical situations. Vitamins are essential organic sub¬ stances whose usual source is food. They are required by man in amounts ranging from micrograms to milligrams per day. There are four fat-soluble vita¬ mins (A, D, E, and K) and nine water-soluble vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, folie acid, bio-tin, and vitamins B 6, B^, and C), and all are essential for the normal growth, development, and maintenance of the human organism.

40|$|International audienceBackground/Objectives: Consisting of ~ 1014 {{microbial}} cells, {{the intestinal}} microbiota represents {{the largest and}} most complex microbial community inhabiting the human body. However, the influence of regular diets on the microbiota is widely unknown. Subjects/Methods: We examined faecal samples of vegetarians (n= 144), vegans (n= 105) and an equal number of control subjects consuming ordinary omnivorous diet who were matched for age and gender. We used classical bacteriological isolation, identification and enumeration of the main anaerobic and aerobic bacterial genera and computed absolute and relative numbers that were compared between groups. Results: Total counts of Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae spp. were significantly lower (p=. 001, p=. 002, p=. 006 and p=. 008, resp) in the vegan samples compared to controls while others (E. coli biovars, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., other Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Citrobacter spp. and Clostridium spp.) were not. Subjects on a <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diet</b> ranked between vegans and healthy controls. The total microbial count did not differ between the groups and subgroups. In addition, subjects on a vegan or <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diet</b> showed significantly (p=. 0001) lower stool pH than controls, and stool pH and counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly correlated across all subgroups.

We applied Triandis’ Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (1977). The importance of <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diets</b> was rated lower than that of any other of the 36 items assessed. However, the feasibility of <b>vegetarian</b> <b>diets</b> was considered to be relatively good. We identified two types of barriers to a vegetarian diet: social groups and habits.
