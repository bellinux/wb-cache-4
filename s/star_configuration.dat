40|$|The graph {{isomorphism}} {{problem is}} of practical importance, {{as well as}} being a theoretical curiosity in computational complexity theory in that it is not known whether it is $NP$-complete or $P$. However, for many graphs, the problem is tractable, and related to the problem of finding the automorphism group of the graph. Perhaps the most well known state-of-the art implementation for finding the automorphism group is Nauty. However, Nauty is particularly susceptible to poor performance on <b>star</b> <b>configurations,</b> where the spokes of the star are isomorphic with each other. In this work, I present an algorithm that explodes these <b>star</b> <b>configurations,</b> reducing the problem to a sequence of simpler automorphism group calculations.

40|$|We {{study the}} strong gravity regime in viable models of {{so-called}} f(R) gravity {{that account for}} the observed cosmic acceleration. In contrast with recent works suggesting that very relativistic stars might not exist in these models, we find numerical solutions corresponding to static <b>star</b> <b>configurations</b> with a strong gravitational field. The choice of the equation of state for the star is crucial {{for the existence of}} solutions. Indeed, if the pressure exceeds one third of the energy density in {{a large part of the}} <b>star,</b> static <b>configurations</b> do not exist. In our analysis, we use a polytropic equation of state, which is not plagued with this problem and, moreover, provides a better approximation for a realistic neutron star.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to RS-422, {{which has a}} single driver circuit which cannot be switched off, RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. This allows RS-485 to implement linear bus topologies using only two wires. The equipment located along a set of RS-485 wires are interchangeably called nodes, stations or devices. The recommended arrangement of the wires is as a connected series of point-to-point (multidropped) nodes, i.e. a line or bus, not a star, ring, or multiply connected network. Star and ring topologies are not recommended because of signal reflections or excessively low or high termination impedance. If a <b>star</b> <b>configuration</b> is unavoidable, special RS-485 star/hub repeaters are available which bidirectionally listen for data on each span and then retransmit the data onto all other spans.|$|E
50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{starting}} a polyphase motor are used. Where a large inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the terminals (direct-on-line, DOL). Where {{it is necessary to}} limit the starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the short-circuit capacity of the supply), the motor is started at reduced voltage using either series inductors, an autotransformer, thyristors, or other devices. A technique sometimes used is star-delta (YΔ) starting, where the motor coils are initially connected in <b>star</b> <b>configuration</b> for acceleration of the load, then switched to delta configuration when the load is up to speed. This technique is more common in Europe than in North America. Transistorized drives can directly vary the applied voltage as required by the starting characteristics of the motor and load.|$|E
5000|$|To {{manufacture}} the Comstar wheels Honda used an extruded aluminium-alloy rim made by D.I.D {{that was}} {{fastened to the}} spokes using aluminium rivets. The spoke pieces were bolted to the rim with steel bolt and nut fastenings in either three, five or six pointed <b>star</b> <b>configuration.</b> What metal the spokes were made from depended {{on the model of}} motorcycle. The CB400T for example used steel for the spokes and alloy for the rim, whilst the CBX and the Super Dream used alloy for both the spokes and rims to further reduce unsprung mass. This type wheel was considered [...] "maintenance free" [...] with no user serviceable parts and Honda had [...] "Do Not Disassemble" [...] stamped on the wheel rim alongside other markings such as the fitment size. For its use on the NR500 GP machine, the wheels were made from magnesium with titanium used for the fasteners. Composite wheels were also cheaper to produce than their cast alloy equivalents.|$|E
