Much of the upper part of the walling is modern, also all the windows. The nave was lengthened about 10 ft. and the western porch and bell-turret was added early in the 19th century. The plan is a plain rectangle about 55½ ft. long inside, of which about 20½ ft. is the chancel, by 15½ ft. The chancel walls are 2 ft thick, built of lias rubble, mostly squared in the lower parts and with sandstone angle-dressings. It is probable the north wall has been partly rebuilt. The east window is a single light set high up, but there is a patching for a former lower window. The north and south windows are of two lights and were also formerly lower in the walls. About a yard east of them are short <b>straight</b> <b>joints</b> and pieces of sandstone that may indicate former windows. The nave has side walls 2 ft thick; the lower halves of them are of early shaly rubble with wide jointing, and above this are medieval sandstone courses. The north and south windows are of two lights and both have patchings below them for lower windows. In the north wall are the remains of a 12th-century doorway of sandstone, now blocked: it has jambs of two orders, the inner with an edge-roll; the outer is square and had nook-shafts, which have disappeared except for the western capital; this is of cushion form with cheveron ornament. The head is pointed and of one square order, probably a later alteration. In the south wall is another blocked doorway with square pilaster-jambs and pointed head, perhaps of the 13th century but difficult to date. The two buttresses to each wall are medieval.

It is very efficient both for relatively open configurations at high temperatures and for compact and frozen-in low-T states. This allows us to study in detail the phase diagram {{as a function of}} nn-attraction epsilon and stiffness x. It shows a theta-collapse line with a transition from open coils to molten compact globules (large epsilon) and a freezing transition toward a state with orientational global order (large stiffness x). Qualitatively this is similar to a recently studied mean field theory (Doniach et al. (1996), J. Chem. Phys. 105, 1601), but there are important differences. In contrast to the mean field theory, the theta-temperature increases with stiffness x. The freezing temperature increases even faster, and reaches the theta-line at a finite value of x. For even stiffer chains, the freezing transition takes place directly without the formation of an intermediate globule state. Although being in contrast with mean filed theory, the latter has been conjectured already by Doniach et al. on the basis of low statistics Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the present model as a very crude model for protein folding. Comment: 11 pages, Latex, 8 figure...|$|E

Yielding capacity of this support is realized in fric-tional joints, which due to their geometry can be divided to straight and arch joints. Occurring in steel frames arch frictional joints are characterized with more complex loading state than <b>straight</b> <b>joints</b> used in friction props. In the article, there is presented an analysis of the state of stress and de-formation of the arch frictional joint, which was carried out on the model of these joints using finite element method. The scope of the analysis included two methods of loading of arch frictional joint, namely its axial compression and bending. In both cases, joints were loaded dynamically with the impact of freely falling mass. Arch joints with and without passive pressure were submitted to an axial compression. Physical model of the frictional joint was developed {{on the basis of a}} system ap-plied during the stand tests. To solve mathematical model an explicit integration method was used. As a result of analyses carried out, temporal courses of force transmitted through the frictional joint, and displacements of section sliding down were determined. On the basis of the temporal courses, depen-dences between maximum value of force transmitted through the frictional joint and the height from which the impact mass falls down were determined. Distributions of reduced stresses in elements of frictional joint were also determined and the state of deformation was described. In order to emphasize the difference between straight and arch frictional joints, also an analysis of internal forces in arch fric-tional joint depending on its geometrical parameters without and with passive pressure was presented. 1...|$|E

Their widespread use {{is due to the}} strength characteristics and versatility, using various construction processes depending on the conditions of the work. However, it has the great disadvantage that the concrete should be done in phases. Because of the advantages of this section is really important develop new techniques to improve the performance, and reduce construction times. The construction of the top slab involves extension <b>straight</b> <b>joints.</b> It has been observed that this kind of joint requires additional measures during execution, either {{from the point of view}} of the danger to operators or remove the inside formwork. As a result, it is needed propose a new type of joint, by loops, reducing risks, minimizing the construction times and making easier the work on site. To understand the behaviour of a structure with this loop joint, are built concrete sections with representative dimensions of a railway bridge, with a concrete joint, reproducing, as far as possible, what happens in reality. These sections will be tested experimentally. In a previous study has been analysed the performance in a simple bending test. For this reason, in this study is checked the response in pure bending. Dynamic and static campaigns are done, using for this a total of 8 slabs, existing three types of union based on European codes: - Reference Slab (LR) with a continuous reinforcement - DIN Slab (LD) with a loop joint according to DIN 1045 - Experimental Slab (LE) with the proposed loop joint With these results it is possible to know the performance until failure, under static and dynamics loads with a number of cycles of 2 x 10 ^ 6. In static load campaign are tested 3 slabs, representatives of the different types of continuity. With these results is possible to make a comparison between the behaviour of the slabs associated with: longitudinal and transverse strain, deflections and concrete joint opening. In dynamic load campaign are tested 5 slabs, three of them with the same type of reinforcement and the other two representatives of the others types. In each of these tests are applied different load ranges, depending on the objectives, defining 5 tests: 1. LR:	 ¿s= 150 MPa [...] > Q_max= 141 kN y Q_min= 50 kN 2. LD: 	 ¿s= 150 MPa [...] > 	Q_max= 141 kN y Q_min= 50 kN 3. LE_ 2 : 	¿s= 150 MPa [...] >	Q_max= 141 kN y Q_min= 50 kN 4. LE_ 3 : 	¿s= 150 MPa [...] >	Q_max= 210 kN y Q_min= 119 kN 5.

The faces of the walls are finely point-dressed, with claw-chisel trimming at the margins. In the chamber, two floor blocks remain in situ, unusually laid up against rather than running underneath the walls. The floor blocks are 0. 15 m thick, and the exposed joints have fine anathyrosis dressing (the contact bands are claw-chisel dressed; the recessed areas beneath are point-dressed). The walls continue down {{to the level of the}} bottom of the preserved floor slabs and then appear to rest on more coarsely laid rubble masonry. ** The walls are built up in five courses, laid in pseudoisodomic fashion. (The thickness of the wall blocks where exposed ranges from 0. 3 m to 0. 5 m.) There are no signs of clamps. Several fragments of a single marble couch, in the form of a simple slab with a rounded depression on top, are lying in the rubble fill of the dromos. It was likely supported by marble legs and placed up against the back wall of the chamber, but no trace of its supports or any other interior feature of the chamber has been found. The chamber is roofed by four marble ceiling slabs. ** The front wall of the chamber is bonded with the side walls (rather than being a separately built monumental doorframe). The door is centered in the front wall (H of threshold above chamber floor: 0. 03 m; H of opening: 1. 04 m; W of opening: 0. 61 m; D of opening: 0. 36 m). A door-plug cut to fit exactly to this opening is lying in the fill of the dromos. ** Antechamber and Dromos. The masonry of the antechamber is very similar to that of the dromos.

In a spring-mass model, running proves to be self-stable in terms of {{external}} pertur-bations or variations in leg properties (e. g. landing angle). However, biological limbs are not made of springs but, rather, consist of segments where spring-like behavior can be localized at joint level. Here, we use a two-segment leg model to investigate the effects of leg compliance originating from joint level on run-ning stability. Due to leg geometry a nonlinear relationship be-tween leg force and leg compression is found. In con-trast to the linear leg spring, the segmented leg is ca-pable of reducing the minimum speed for self-stable running from 3. 5 m/s in the spring-mass model to 1. 5 m/s for almost <b>straight</b> <b>joint</b> configurations which is below the preferred transition speed from human walk-ing to running (≈ 2 m/s). At moderate speeds the tolerated range of landing angle is largely increased (17 degrees at 5 m/s) com-pared to the linear leg spring model (2 degrees).

The influence of modelling assumptions implemented in FEA models for directly buried and force-cooled cable circuits has been previously quantified, but without direct consideration of the joint bay.
