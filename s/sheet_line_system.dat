40|$|The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Croatia, {{with the}} project "Military Geoinformation System - VoGIS" started to build a unique {{geoinformation}} system for the Ministry and Armed Forces. This system will be in accordance with Croatian and international geoinformation standards and will fully conform to the NATO standards. According to the Preliminary Design, {{the goal of the}} VoGIS is the implementation of a geoinformation system that will be the basis for development of all further activities in domain of military spatial data, with special emphasis on creation of military cartographic database and  military maps, along with the fulfilment of the Partnership Goals. VoGIS is based on the Croatian Topographic Information System made by the CROTIS  data model. In {{the first phase of the}} project, the object data model of the basic military topographic database is developed. In the second phase, the original conceptual design of the system is developed and the whole cartographic production workflow based on spatial databases is developed and implemented. The concept encompasses standardization of collection of special "military" content with upload into a basic topographic database, design of cartographic database model, map generalization, <b>sheet</b> <b>line</b> <b>system,</b> map design, production and printing. </p...|$|E

All digital <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> operating on the same medium at a given bit rate shall comply with the characteristics of the digital line section at the same bit rate. 2 General requirements for digital <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> The following general requirements apply to all digital <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> on metallic pair cables and where applicable with appropriate interpretation, also to those on optical fibre cables. 2. 1 Environmental conditions 2. 1. 1 Climati...|$|R

This paper describes a method for analyzing wind-induced vibrations of ice coating transmission towers coupled with power lines. An ice coating model of transmission <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> is introduced. Wind loads on ice coating transmission <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> are also presented. The time histories of wind speed acting on transmission <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> are simulated with the harmony superposition method. Finally, the responses of ice coating transmission <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> under different thickness of ice and different wind velocity are discussed. The {{results show that the}} displacement and unbalanced tension increase rapidly with the thickness of ice and wind velocity increasing. The value of the unbalanced tension increases significantly when the ice coating on conductors is nonuniform...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes to}} analyze two flow <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> {{in which we}} include {{possibilistic}} data-the priority-discipline is possibilistic instead of probabilistic- and measure the performances of the systems with the effectiveness measure “waiting time in queue”. In a previous work we have analyzed and developed a queuing model with uncertain priority-discipline, using Zadeh’s extension principle. Because of it in this paper {{the analysis of the}} model takes the work realized by Prade as a starting point to incorporate an uncertain priority-discipline in a flow <b>line</b> <b>system</b> by means of a possibilistic distribution. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we calculate the possibility distribution of the priority-discipline and the possibility distribution of the performance measure “waiting time in queue”, in two flow <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> with different waiting lines: the determinist flow <b>line</b> <b>system</b> D / D/ 1 and the classic flow <b>line</b> <b>system</b> M / M / 1 / N with finite capacity. Since the performance measure is expressed by membership function rather than by crisp value, the fuzziness of input information is conserved completely, and more information is provided for capacity planning in flow <b>line</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
