5|$|Bent {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the opening match, a 2–2 draw with Birmingham City on 14 August and opened the scoring with a penalty in the 24th minute. He scored the winning goal with <b>stoppage</b> time penalty as Sunderland beat Manchester City 1–0 on 29 August. Bent scored the equaliser during <b>stoppage</b> time to earn Sunderland a 1–1 draw against Arsenal on 18 September. He then scored twice in Sunderland's 2–2 draw at Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|A second {{match with}} Wrexham in eight days {{finished}} in a 0–0 draw at home, with Ingham making {{a number of}} fine saves to preserve the clean sheet. Henderson was signed by fellow Conference Premier club Forest Green Rovers on a one-month loan. York drew 0–0 draw away to Barrow, with Walker and Boucaud being sent off during <b>stoppage</b> time. Striker Moses Ashikodi was signed on loan from league rivals Kettering until January 2012. Reed gave York the lead away to Forest Green after scoring a penalty in the 83rd minute, before the home team scored an equaliser in the fourth minute of <b>stoppage</b> time. York defeated Lincoln 2–0 at home with Pilkington and McLaughlin scoring in each half.|$|E

50|$|There {{were three}} extreme dust tests {{performed}} in 2007. The 2nd Summer 2007 results showed a large {{difference from the}} later fall test with the M4 having 148 class 1 <b>stoppages</b> due to rifle malfunctions and 148 class 1 <b>stoppages</b> due to magazine <b>stoppages.</b> The full-size M16 rifle had a total of 61 <b>stoppages</b> during the same extreme dust test.|$|R
50|$|During the test, the SCAR {{suffered}} 226 <b>stoppages.</b> Since {{a percentage}} of each weapons' <b>stoppages</b> were caused by magazine failures, the FN SCAR, XM8 and HK416 performed statistically similarly. The FN SCAR ranked second to the XM8 with 127 <b>stoppages,</b> but with fewer <b>stoppages</b> compared to the M4 with 882 <b>stoppages</b> and the HK416 with 233. This test was based on two previous systems assessments that were conducted using the M4 carbine and M16 rifle at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 2006 and the summer of 2007 before the third limited competition {{in the fall of}} 2007. The 2006 test focused only on the M4 and M16. The Summer 2007 test had only the M4, but increased lubrication. Results from the second test resulted in a total of 307 <b>stoppages</b> for the M4 after lubrication was increased, but did not explain why the M4 suffered 882 <b>stoppages</b> with that same level of lubrication in the third test.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} 2007, the Army tested the M4 against three other {{carbines}} in [...] "sandstorm conditions" [...] at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland: the Heckler & Koch XM8, Fabrique Nationale de Herstal SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) and the Heckler & Koch HK416. Ten {{of each type}} of rifle were used to fire 6,000 rounds each, {{for a total of}} 60,000 rounds per rifle type. The M4 suffered far more <b>stoppages</b> than its competitors: 882 <b>stoppages,</b> 19 requiring an armorer to fix. The XM8 had the fewest <b>stoppages,</b> 116 minor <b>stoppages</b> and 11 major ones, followed by the FN SCAR with 226 <b>stoppages</b> and the HK416 with 233.|$|R

5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} <b>stoppage</b> time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of <b>stoppage</b> time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of <b>stoppage</b> time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled <b>stoppage</b> time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup {{hosted by}} Canada, Sinclair scored the team's only {{goal of the}} first group stage match against China, a 1–0 win, during a penalty kick awarded in the second minute of second-half <b>stoppage</b> time. Sinclair scored in the 42nd minute in a losing effort against England in the quarterfinal. Canada lost the match 2–1.|$|E

5|$|After {{the work}} <b>stoppage</b> at pit number six, more white miners {{assembled}} near the town. They marched to Rock Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E
50|$|Booth {{government}} regulators and police share in bribe money, {{to the tune}} of 43% and 45% each respectively. The en route <b>stoppages</b> at checkpoints and entry-points can take up to 11 hours per day. About 60% of these (forced) <b>stoppages</b> on roads by concerned authorities such as {{government regulators}}, police, forest, sales and excise, octroi, and weighing and measuring departments are for extorting money. The loss in productivity due to these <b>stoppages</b> is an important national concern; the number of truck trips could increase by 40%, if forced delays are avoided. According to a 2007 World Bank published report, the travel time for a Delhi-Mumbai trip could be reduced by about 2 days per trip if the corruption and associated regulatory <b>stoppages</b> to extract bribes were eliminated.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2007, the U.S. Army {{announced}} a limited {{competition between the}} M4 carbine, FN SCAR, HK416, XCR, and the previously-shelved HK XM8. Ten examples {{of each of the}} four competitors were involved. Each weapon fired 6,000 rounds in an extreme dust environment. The shoot-off was for assessing future needs, not to select a replacement for the M4. The XM8 scored the best, with only 127 <b>stoppages</b> in 60,000 total rounds, the FN SCAR Light had 226 <b>stoppages,</b> while the HK416 had 233 <b>stoppages.</b> The M4 carbine scored [...] "significantly worse" [...] {{than the rest of the}} field with 882 <b>stoppages.</b> However, magazine failures caused 239 of the M4's 882 failures. Army officials said, in December 2007, that the new magazines could be combat-ready by spring if testing went well.|$|R
5|$|After {{training}} with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed {{for the club}} on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, who were unavailable due to {{their participation in the}} 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against Leeds United in the FA Cup third round and scored the only goal. In his last league game on loan, he scored the winning goal in <b>stoppage</b> time in a 2–1 win against Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match more {{effectively}} {{of the two}} and scored what {{proved to be the}} winning goal in the latter minutes of the first half – Freddie Ljungberg's rebounded goal effort was converted by Robert Pirès. Midway through the second half, Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi was substituted, as he strained his calf muscle; he was replaced by Paul Jones. In <b>stoppage</b> time, striker James Beattie had his header cleared off the line by Ashley Cole, in what was the final chance for Southampton.|$|E

Chelsea then travelled to face local rivals Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in the Fourth Round, where a controversial Mata penalty was enough to see them through.|$|E
