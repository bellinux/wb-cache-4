50|$|Silent Text: Discontinued September 28, 2015. A <b>stand-alone</b> {{application}} for <b>encrypted</b> text messaging and secure cloud content transfer with “burn notice” feature for permanently deleting messages from devices. Its features were merged into Silent Phone.|$|R
25|$|TextSecure: A <b>stand-alone</b> {{application}} for <b>encrypted</b> messaging on Android. TextSecure {{could be used}} to send and receive SMS, MMS, and instant messages. It used end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and deniable authentication to secure all instant messages to other TextSecure users. TextSecure was merged with RedPhone to become Signal for Android. The source code is available under the GPLv3 license.|$|R
25|$|RedPhone: A <b>stand-alone</b> {{application}} for <b>encrypted</b> voice calling on Android. RedPhone {{integrated with the}} system dialer to make calls, but used ZRTP {{to set up an}} end-to-end encrypted VoIP channel for the actual call. RedPhone was designed specifically for mobile devices, using audio codecs and buffer algorithms tuned to the characteristics of mobile networks, and used push notifications to preserve the user's device's battery life while still remaining responsive. RedPhone was merged into TextSecure on November 2, 2015. TextSecure was then renamed as Signal for Android. RedPhone's source code was available under the GPLv3 license.|$|R
40|$|Naor and Shamir {{proposed}} the visual cryptography in 1995, they encrypted secret image into two meaningless random images, called shares, {{and it can}} be decrypted by human vision without any calculations. However, there would be problems in alignment when these two shares are staked by hand in practical. Therefore, this paper presents the fault-tolerant schemes of stacking two shares which are acquired from secret image encryption without pixel expansion. The main idea of these schemes is combining several pixels to be a <b>unit,</b> then <b>encrypting</b> every <b>unit</b> into a specific combination of pixels. It makes visual secret sharing scheme more practical...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{alternatives}} to ISMACryp, SRTP and IPsec, {{that can also}} be used to provide service and content protection. The difference between the three is at what level encryption is done. Whereas ISMACryp <b>encrypts</b> MPEG-4 access <b>units</b> (that are in the RTP payload), SRTP encrypts the whole RTP payload, and IPsec encrypts packets at [...]|$|R

5000|$|On January 27, 2010, NIST {{released}} Special Publication (SP) 800-38E {{in final}} form. SP 800-38E is a recommendation for the XTS-AES mode of operation, as standardized by IEEE Std 1619-2007, for cryptographic modules. The publication approves the XTS-AES mode of the AES algorithm {{by reference to}} the IEEE Std 1619-2007, subject to one additional requirement, which limits the maximum size of each <b>encrypted</b> data <b>unit</b> (typically a sector or disk block) to [...] AES blocks. According to SP 800-38E, [...] "In the absence of authentication or access control, XTS-AES provides more protection than the other approved confidentiality-only modes against unauthorized manipulation of the encrypted data." ...|$|R
40|$|Part 7 : Security Attacks and Measures (Short Papers) International audienceA {{feature that}} has become {{desirable}} for low-power mobile devices with limited computing and energy resources {{is the ability to}} select a security configuration {{in order to create a}} trade-off between security and other important parameters such as performance and energy consumption. Selective encryption can be used to create this trade-off by only <b>encrypting</b> chosen <b>units</b> of the information. In this paper, we continue the investigation of the confidentiality implications of selective encryption by applying entropy on a generic selective encryption scheme. By using the concept of run-length vector from run-length encoding theory, an expression is derived for entropy of selectively encrypted strings when the number of encrypted substrings, containing one symbol, and the order of the language change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Shadow {{detection}} {{is still}} considered {{as one of the}} potential challenges for intelligent automated video surveillance systems. A pre requisite for reliable and accurate detection and tracking is the correct shadow detection and classification. In such a landscape of conditions, privacy issues add more and more complexity and require reliable shadow detection. In this work the intertwining between security, accuracy, reliability and privacy is analyzed and, accordingly, a novel architecture for Privacy Enhancing Video Surveillance (PEVS) is introduced. Shadow detection and masking are dealt with through the combination of two different approaches simultaneously. This results in a unique privacy enhancement, without affecting security. Subsequently, the methodology was employed successfully in a large-scale wireless video surveillance system; privacy relevant information was stored and <b>encrypted</b> on the <b>unit,</b> without transferring it over an un-trusted network...|$|R
50|$|A CCMP Medium Access Control Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) {{comprises}} five sections. The {{first is}} the MAC header which contains the destination and source address of the data packet. The second is the CCMP header which is composed of 8 octets and consists of the packet number (PN), the Ext IV, and the key ID. The packet number is a 48-bit number stored across 6 octets. The PN codes are the first two and last four octets of the CCMP header and are incremented for each subsequent packet. Between the PN codes are a reserved octet and a Key ID octet. The Key ID octet contains the Ext IV (bit 5), Key ID (bits 6-7), and a reserved subfields (bits 0-4). CCMP uses these values to <b>encrypt</b> the data <b>unit</b> and the MIC. The third section is the data unit which is the data being sent in the packet. Lastly are the Message Integrity Code (MIC) which protects the integrity and authenticity of the packet and the frame check sequence (FCS) which is used for error detection and correction. Of these sections only the data unit and MIC are encrypted.|$|R
