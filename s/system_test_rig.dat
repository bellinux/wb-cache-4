The analysis of the hydraulic plant, carried out in part I of this two-part study, is here utilized to develop the control algorithm. The control strategy is based on a feed-forward and a proportional integral controller through pulse width modulation with a constant frequency and variable duty cycle. The feed-forward contribution requires modeling of the nonlinear openloop system behavior which has been experimentally identified and described through two-dimensional maps: the inputs are the duty cycle applied to the electrovalves and the pressure drop across their orifice, while the output is the pressure gradient in the brake caliper. These maps, obtained for inlet and outlet valves, are used to set the feed-forward term.

One {{of the best ways}} to increase the fuel efficiency is by improving the performance of the automotive air conditioning (AAC) system. The AAC is currently a thing of necessity instead of just an accesory, and cooling is needed to give thermal comfort in the passenger’s cabin especially for countries like Malaysia, that experience hot weather throughout a year. With the hot weather climate and also because of the El-Nino impacts that occur frequently, the use of AAC in auto vehicles will increase drastically.

The work at IHLB resulted in the manufacture of a 50 l reference store for the temperature level 80 C with encapsulated barium hydroxide octahydrate as storage material and of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) -store for the temperature level 110 C to 130 C. The work at KE comprised testing of the 50 l reference store and a study of the application of the developed latent heat storage method in a public district heating system. The test were carried out on the institute's storage <b>system</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> Discharge power densities of the 50 l reference store of 60 to 140 kW/m" 3 were measured and a usable storage capacity of 85 kWh/m" 3 was achieved. The test provided additional information on the heat transfer with boiling and condensing heat carrier (ethanol). The possibility of using the latent heat storage method in district heating was investigated in cooperation with Technische Werke der Stadt Stuttgart (TWS). For the implementation of an HDPE-store for the temperature level 110 C to 130 C no application could be found. The implementation of a latent heat store for the temperature level 80 C was considered at the district heat transfer station inside the power station.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on a {{complete}} hybrid <b>system</b> emulator <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> developed at the University of Genoa (Savona laboratory) by the Thermochemical Power Group (TPG). The plant is mainly composed of a 100 kW recuperated micro gas turbine coupled with both anodic and cathodic vessels for high temperature fuel cell emulation. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was recently equipped with a real-time model for emulating components not physically present in the laboratory (SOFC block, reformer, anodic circuit, off-gas burner, cathodic blower). This model is used to fully evaluate thermodynamic and electrochemical performance related to solid oxide fuel cell systems. Using a UDP based connection with the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> control and acquisition software, it generates a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) facility for hybrid system emulation. Temperature, pressure and air mass flow rate at the recuperator outlet (downstream of the compressor) and rotational speed of the machine are inputs from the plant to the model. The turbine outlet temperature (TOT) calculated by the model is fed into the machine control system and the turbine electric load is moved to match the model TOT values. In this study various tests were carried out to characterize the interaction between the experimental plant and the real-time model; double step and double ramp tests of current and fuel provided the dynamic response of the system. The control system proved to be fast, compared to the slow thermal response of the SOFC stack, and also reliable. The hybrid systems operated at 90...|$|R
40|$|In {{aircraft}} engine the blade resonant vibration amplitude {{is reduced by}} increasing the structural damping by using, for example, tip shrouds. These devices dissipate the energy generated at the contact surfaces between the relative motion and the friction force. Contact parameters as friction coefficient and contact stiffness are required to characterize {{the dynamics of the}} shrouded blade <b>systems.</b> A <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for contact parameters measurement of flat-on-flat contact surfaces has been developed. One of the specimens is attached to the rig frame, basically an inertial mass and four springs, excited by an electromagnetic shaker. The second specimen is allowed to approach the first specimen and to rotate in such a way the geometric contact between the two surfaces occurs on three points. In this way a real "flat-to-flat" contact has been obtained. The tangential contact force and the relative displacements between specimens are measured and the friction coefficient and contact stiffness are determine...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of an automotive {{air conditioning system}} (AAC) needs to be enhanced {{in order to minimize}} its environment impact and reduce global fuel consumption. Implementing nanofluid technology using nanolubricants inside compressors can improve its performance. Therefore, this paper presents the development of an AAC <b>system</b> performance <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> The SiO 2 /PAG nanolubricant was prepared in a prior performance experiment and the stability of the colloidal was also attained. The experiment was conducted with initial refrigerant charge ranging from 95 to 125 gram and compressor speeds of 900 to 2100 RPM. The {{performance of}} the AAC system was evaluated by determining the heat absorb, compressor work and coefficient of performance (COP). The results found that the maximum increase and the average COP enhancement for SiO 2 /PAG nanolubricants are 24 % and 10. 5 %, respectively. It can be concluded that the COP was highest at 0. 05 % volume concentration for all compressor speeds...|$|R
