5|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the title}} ("commander") suggests that voivodes had significant military duties. They were the <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> of the troops recruited in the counties under their jurisdiction. Although law obliged noblemen {{to fight in the}} king's army, Transylvanian nobles fought under the command of the voivode. Furthermore, the voivodes had their own private retinue, formed primarily by armed noblemen. Their right to raise an army under their own flag was confirmed by legislation in 1498.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1979 Islamic {{revolution}} in Iran, in 1981 Bahraini Shī'a fundamentalists orchestrated a failed coup attempt {{under the auspices}} of a front organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have installed a Shī'a cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjatu l-Islām Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> heading a theocratic government. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners during an international marathon for running bare-legged. The resulting clash with police soon grew into civil unrest.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Hezbollah {{decided to}} {{participate}} in elections, and Ali Khamenei, <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> of Iran, endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, Subhi al-Tufayli, contested this decision, {{which led to a}} schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.|$|E

5|$|The Székelys were a {{community}} of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, {{for which they were}} exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their <b>supreme</b> <b>leader,</b> but the Székely seats were administered by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates of their seats. They enjoyed personal freedom and paid a lump sum tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, Sibiu and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations to coordinate their actions.|$|E
5|$|The second {{large-scale}} {{campaign is}} dated to 943, when Igor was the <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> of the Rus', {{according to the}} Primary Chronicle. During the 943 expedition, the Rus' rowed up the Kura River, deep into the Caucasus, defeated the forces of Marzuban bin Muhammad, and captured Bardha'a, the capital of Arran. The Rus' allowed the local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship; {{it is possible that}} the Rus' intended to settle permanently there. According to ibn Miskawaih, the local people broke the peace by stone-throwing and other abuse directed against the Rus', who then demanded that the inhabitants evacuate the city. This ultimatum was rejected, and the Rus' began killing people and holding many for ransom. The slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations, which soon broke down. The Rus' stayed in Bardha'a for several months, using it as a base for plundering the adjacent areas, and amassed substantial spoils.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} Yellow Turban Rebellion {{also occurred}} in 184 CE, its leaders {{claiming that they}} were destined {{to bring about a}} utopian era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness was a sign of wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a ramification for sickness; if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first (and very auspicious) year of a new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> Zhang Jue (d. 184 CE) chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel; when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By {{the end of the year}} their leadership—including Zhang Jue—had been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.|$|E

25|$|The President is {{responsible}} for the implementation of the constitution, and for the exercise of executive powers in implementing the decrees and general policies as outlined by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader,</b> except for matters directly related to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader,</b> who has the final say in all matters. Unlike the executive in other countries, the President of Iran does not have full control over anything, as these are ultimately {{under the control of the}} <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader.</b> Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates. The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader.</b> The President functions as the executive of affairs such as signing treaties and other international agreements, and administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs, all as approved by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader.</b> The President appoints the ministers, subject to the approval of the Parliament, as well as the approval of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader,</b> who can dismiss or reinstate any of the ministers at any time, regardless of the decisions made by the President or the Parliament. The President supervises the Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature. The current <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader,</b> Ali Khamenei, has fired as well as reinstated Council of Ministers members. Eight Vice Presidents serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of twenty-two ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature.|$|E

25|$|The Leader of the Revolution ("Supreme Leader") is {{responsible}} for delineation and supervision of {{the policies of the}} Islamic Republic of Iran. The current longtime <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader,</b> Ali Khamenei, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy, education, national plannings, and everything else in the country. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections, and has fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments. The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader</b> Ali Khamenei directly chooses the ministries of Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs, as well as certain other ministries, such as the Science Ministry. Iran’s regional policy is directly controlled by the office of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader</b> with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ task limited to protocol and ceremonial occasions. All of Iran’s ambassadors to Arab countries, for example, are chosen by the Quds Corps, which directly reports to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Assembly of Experts elects and dismisses (to date, never did) the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader</b> on {{the basis}} of {{qualifications}} and popular esteem. To date, the Assembly of Experts has not challenged any of the Supreme Leader's decisions. The current head of the judicial system, Sadeq Larijani, appointed by the longtime <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader,</b> said that it is illegal for the Assembly of Experts to supervise the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader.</b> Due to Khamenei's very longtime unchallenged rule, many believe the Assembly of Experts has become a ceremonial body without any real power. There have been instances when the current <b>Supreme</b> <b>Leader</b> publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. Another instance is when Khamenei indirectly called Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a traitor for a statement he made, resulting Rafsanjani to retract it.|$|E
