40|$|Abstract Background Sheep {{carcasses}} with <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> are sporadically {{observed at}} Norwegian slaughter houses. This phenomenon {{is known to}} be inherited as a recessive trait, and is caused by accumulation of carotenoids in adipose tissue. Two enzymes are known to be important in carotenoid degradation in mammals, and are therefore potential candidate genes for this trait. These are beta-carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO 1) and the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2). Results In the present study the coding region of the BCMO 1 and the BCO 2 gene were sequenced in <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> individuals and compared to the corresponding sequences from control animals with white <b>fat.</b> In the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> individuals a nonsense mutation was found in BCO 2 nucleotide position 196 (c. 196 C>T), introducing a stop codon in amino acid position 66. The full length protein consists of 575 amino acids. In spite of a very low frequency of this mutation in the Norwegian AI-ram population, 16 out of 18 <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> lambs were found to be homozygous for this mutation. Conclusion In the present study a nonsense mutation (c. 196 C>T) in the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2) gene is found to strongly associate with the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> phenotype in sheep. The existence of individuals lacking this mutation, but still demonstrating <b>yellow</b> <b>fat,</b> suggests that additional mutations may cause a similar phenotype in this population. The results demonstrate a quantitatively important role for BCO 2 in carotenoid degradation, which might indicate a broad enzyme specificity for carotenoids. Animals homozygous for the mutation are not reported to suffer from any negative health or development traits, pointing towards a minor role of BCO 2 in vitamin A formation. Genotyping AI rams for c. 196 C>T can now be actively used in selection against the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> trait. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstracr. Adipose {{tissue of}} piglets with <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> disease had {{increased}} activity of nonspecific esterase, 5 -nucleotidase, and acid phosphatase. Since these enzymes are as-sociated with different cell structures and damage to these structures {{can result in}} increased enzyme activity, they are criteria for pathogenetic study of <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> disease. <b>Yellow</b> <b>fat</b> disease is a generalised disorder of fat depots, characterised by extensive adipose-cell degeneration (steatosis) and inflammation of adipose tissue (steatitis). During these processes a progressive peroxidation of unsa-turated fatty acids may occur. Lipofuscin pigment, {{which is responsible for}} the typical yellow discoloration of the adipose tissue, is the final product of this peroxidation process [25, 39]. Steatitis was observed in natural cases in horses [24], pigs [22, 341, minks [26] and other animals [3, 5, 9]. The regular occurrence of this disorder in young animals, in particular, is remarkable [42, 431. An experimentally induced disease was described in pigs [14, 29], minks [151 and rats [25].

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} investigating the affect of self-image on brand preference. While previous research has found that self-image does affect brand preference, much of this research has focused on high value and high involvement products. There is a significant gap in the literature, identified by Jamal and Goode who state that: More work is needed to establish the significance of self-congruence on brand preferences… in the case of high frequency and low value brands. (2001, p. 490) The purpose of this study is to gain an insight into how consumers make choices when shopping for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) and to identify whether self-image affects brand preference in this context. This study focuses specifically on <b>yellow</b> <b>fats,</b> a term used to refer to butter, margarine and spreads. A multi-method research design was used in the form of twenty-five qualitative individual depth interviews and twenty-one hours of in-store observations. Quantitative Likert scales were used to measure levels of self-image congruence based on Sirgy’s (1997) approach. The findings of this research have clearly identified that there is a link between self-image and brand preference in the context of <b>yellow</b> <b>fats.</b> This is significant as no research has previously identified a link between self-image and brand preference in this category. In addition to this, this research has two major contributions to literature: 1. It is the first to visually depict self-image congruence. 2. It has also identified two factors moderating self-image congruence that have not been referenced in any previous study in this area; recency of purchase and the notion of wanting to be the perfect female role model...|$|R

Consumer panel data containing information about more than 1, 500 British consumers purchasing four grocery product categories (baked beans, biscuits, fruit juice, and <b>yellow</b> <b>fats)</b> during 52 weeks were analyzed. All the brands purchased were classified according to the level of informational and utilitarian reinforcement they were programmed to offer.

Price, an obvious source of explanation in behavioural economics has not been systematically related to brand choice other than {{in the context of}} promotional campaigns which are short-lived tactical exceptions to marketing strategies (Ehrenberg et al., 1994).

40|$|Subcutaneous fat is {{important}} {{not only in the}} live animal but also in the carcass, as it prevents the rapid chilling of the underlying muscle tissues, thereby reducing weight loss during chilling. However, beef with <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> is considered undesirable by consumers in most European and Asian markets. Beta-carotene is the major carotenoid deposited in adipose tissue, which results in the yellowness. Genes involved in the metabolism of β-carotene in the cattle are likely to regulate beef fat colour. Therefore, DNA variants in candidate genes related to β-carotene metabolism were examined for association with beef fat colour. Based on their location in fat colour quantitative trait loci (QTL) and function in the metabolism of β-carotene, ALDH 8 A 1, APOM, BCMO 1, BCO 2, RARA, RDHE 2, PPARGC 1 A and SCARB 1 were chosen as candidate genes. One hundred eleven (111) DNA variants were identified from the direct sequencing of 3 F 1 sires for these eight genes, of which, 27 DNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for association studies (3 - 5 SNPs per gene). Most of these genotyped SNPs and their interactions were associated with fat colour related traits (biopsy fat colour (Fc-bio), carcass fat colour (Fc-car), beta-carotene concentration (Bc-bio)), although the size of the effects was relatively low for many of the variants. However, among the DNA variants, a nonsense mutation in the BCO 2 gene (BCO 2 W 80 X) accounted for a large proportion (12 - 16 %) of the total SNP variation in fat colour related traits in Jersey-Limousin backcross progeny. Validation of this SNP in other independent herds (Group 2 - 7) confirmed the BCO 2 W 80 X genotype has a large effect on beef fat colour and milk colour. The individual genotypic effects of RDHE 2 SNP 2 and SNP 3 were also large. However, these effects were greater in the New Zealand abattoir samples than from pedigreed Jersey-Limousin backcross progeny, amounting to 8 - 17 % of the variance in one population. There was a significant interaction between the BCO 2 W 80 X and the RDHE 2 SNP 2, which accounted for 1. 8 % of the total SNP variance in milk fat colour in a New Zealand Holstein cow population, and 4. 0 % of the total SNP variance in carcass fat colour in New Zealand Jersey-Limousin backcross progeny. In addition to the individual SNP effects, the effects of the haplotypes formed for each gene were also investigated. Only haplotypes of BCMO 1, PPARGC 1 A, RDHE 2 and SCARB 1 genes had effects on beef fat colour. The most likely pathways involved in the beef fat colour were clarified. The association studies showed that the BCMO 1, BCO 2, RARA, RDHE 2, PPARGC 1 A and ALDH 8 A 1 genes and their interactions account for {{a large proportion of the}} variation in beef fat colour. These genes have roles involving retinol or retinoic acid synthesis. Therefore, the retinol/retinoic acid synthesis pathway appears to be the most important in terms of the contribution to the β-carotene concentration in adipose tissue. The effects of APOM and SCARB 1 indicate that transportation of β-carotene is also important in the regulation of the β-carotene concentration in fat. Differences in the expression of BCMO 1, BCO 2 and RDHE 2 genes were investigated. The RDHE 2 gene mRNA transcript level was significantly different between <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> and white fat samples. The gene expression of BCO 2 was highly correlated with β-carotene concentration. The results further support the role of BCO 2 in cleaving β-carotene eccentrically and the association of RDHE 2 with β-carotene concentration. The results also indicate that the control of the retinol/retinoic acid pathway at the gene expression level {{is important}} for the β-carotene concentration in subcutaneous adipose tissue and consequently, for beef fat colour. The study conducted herein contributes to the understanding of the metabolism of carotenoids and their numerous derivatives. BCO 2 -mediated conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A is confirmed in cattle. Epistatic effects accounted for much of the beef fat colour and β-carotene concentration variation. DNA variants that have a large influence on fat colour, such as the BCO 2 W 80 X, can be used in marker selection systems to rapidly reduce the incidence of <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> colour in beef.

However, a negative correlation exists between the Al and Fe concentrations measured in the filamentous algae in comparison to the corresponding concentrations of these elements in the water column of the riverine zone. The Al concentrations in the macroinvertebrate families collected ranged from 140. 6 to 385. 7 mg kg- 1 dry weight, with the highest values measured for Al and Fe in the family Gomphidae (385. 7 mg kg- 1 dry weight and 1, 710. 0 mg kg- 1 dry weight, respectively) in comparison to other macroinvertebrate families sampled. Al and Fe concentrations (2, 580 mg kg- 1 dry weight and 10, 697 mg kg- 1 dry weight) in the stomach contents of adult Oreochromis mossambicus fishes were much higher in comparison with adult Micropterus salmoides fishes (98. 5 mg kg- 1 dry weight and 439. 6 mg kg- 1 dry weight), respectively. In all cases of dissected fish species either white or <b>yellow</b> body <b>fat</b> was observed, thus in none of the samples both type of body fat occurred simultaneously The concentrations of total Al and Fe in the different organs of Oreochromis mossambicus was along a mean sequence of intestine > <b>yellow</b> body <b>fat</b> > brain > gills > liver > heart > white body fat, while the mean sequence of total Al and Fe in Micropterus salmoides was: intestine > gills > liver > heart > brain > white body fat.

Furthermore, the intake of certain species of phytobenthos by Oreochromis mossambicus could have played a role in the bioaccumulation of Al in the food chain and the possible development of pansteatitis in predators at higher trophic levels.
