He selected two of his sons to oversee the labor. The two princes challenged one another to see who could complete their dike fastest. The king proceeded to traditionally divide the territory into northern and southern halves along the Ikopa River and assigned Andrianjakanavalondambo to construct a southern dike at Ambivy, while his eldest son and heir apparent, Razakatsitakatrandriana, was tasked with building a northern dike from Ankadimbahovaka to Anosizato. The king positioned himself at Ankadimbahovaka where he could observe {{the work of the}} entire population and both his sons' qualities of governance as they oversaw the construction of the dikes. The younger of the two boys, Andrianjakanavalondambo, was the first to complete the construction of his dike. The young prince visited his father en route to brag to his elder brother, whereupon the king warned him, [...] "Younger as you are, learn to wait until the end. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> belong and don't bring troubles upon yourself without reason, as you are a man, my friend." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Say so," [...] replied Radbourn, {{his eyes}} kindling. [...] "Say so, {{and get out}} of it. There's nothing worse than <b>staying</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. What have you saved from the general land-slide?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would sooner <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] he said. Then he {{answered}} Wisbech. [...] "In the first place, {{if we are}} reasonably fortunate, it should lead to the acquisition of {{about a couple of}} hundred dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have,' {{said the}} stranger. 'And if I {{did not hold}} you in a {{particular}} esteem, I should make no words about the matter. It appears you pride yourself on <b>staying</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. You mean to stick by your inn. Now I mean you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche; and before this bottle's empty, so you shall.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] {{she said}} imperiously; [...] "we’ll throw them overboard—when we’ve done with them. What did you say, captain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do?" [...] said Martin; [...] "why, {{what should}} you do--but just wish Mr Daly good morning, and <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, snug and comfortable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much! You <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are!" [...] cried Tom, {{and gave}} the fellow a shove which sent him {{sprawling}} backward over a berth.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} place {{small amounts of}} water at precise {{locations}} {{is one of the}} major advantages of Centre Pivot and Lateral Move (CP&LM) machines. But given the wide array of soil types, sprinkler packages and crop requirements, what are the most appropriate methods of ensuring this water <b>stays</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want it? This case study looks at the methods employed by four different growers in different situations. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the master, sir Mr. Putney, and his daughter. Just <b>stay</b> here <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, sir, {{and make}} {{yourself}} comfortable. I'll go {{and speak to}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Happy Jack laughed. [...] "You're {{welcome to}} {{stay as long as}} you like, Unc' Billy," [...] he said. [...] "You better <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, and I'll go tell old Mrs. Possum <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shouldn't be surprised. Anyhow, you <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. Go {{to sleep}} and dream that you're playing for the school against Ripton. So long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. You are charmingly grouped, {{and appear}} to {{uncommon}} advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Mr. Van Reinberg assented, [...] "but the fact's {{there all}} the same. I guess you can <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, Mr. Courage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you come}} any closer," [...] one warned him, flourishing his club with the {{advertisement}} of braining him. [...] "You <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are {{until you get}} your orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then said Bai-Jove-Judson, {{who was a}} linguist: [...] "You <b>stay</b> o <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are o, or I'll leave a hole-o in {{your bottom}} o {{that will make you}} much os perforatados." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can you be}} {{thinking}} of? You do keep my hands full! You have to be watched all the time, like a little child, {{to keep you from}} walking into the fire. You'll <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but it's a {{very dark}} daylight. Don't leave your warm bed for the {{dampness}} and cold out here; <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are; I'll get breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Joe, <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] {{said his}} brother. [...] "If that rascal {{gets to his}} friends there will be work enough here, never fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] said Lady Pentreath. [...] "They {{were all}} {{getting tired of}} me; let us hear {{what you have to}} say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{need for}} you to rush," [...] drawled the man, much as if he enjoyed keeping the boys in suspense, [...] "for if <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, you will see them. They've got to come back this way, sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, Henry, {{and make}} {{yourself}} comfortable," [...] said Gif. [...] "As long as you're {{willing to do}} your share of the work around here, you shall have your share of whatever there is to eat." ...|$|R
60|$|Lalun's husband {{stood on}} the plain outside the City walls, and Lalun's house was upon the east wall facing the river. If you fell from the broad window-seat you dropped thirty feet sheer into the City Ditch. But if <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> should and looked forth, you saw all the cattle of the City being driven down to water, the {{students}} of the Government College playing cricket, the high grass and trees that fringed the river-bank, the great sand bars that ribbed the river, the red tombs of dead Emperors beyond the river, and very far away through the blue heat-haze, a glint of the snows of the Himalayas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{much better}} to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are,' her mother said. 'You will come and spend the {{holidays}} with us, of course, as you do now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You very, very foolish Englishwoman," [...] she said. [...] "A hand {{leaned down}} from Heaven, and you liked better to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were, but I am glad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was some}} one passing," [...] she said. [...] "I don't {{understand}} why. They {{all came to}} bed some time ago. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are and don't move." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> may <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, {{and take}} care of my daughter. If she wants to climb {{mountains}} or shoot rapids, it's to be done; but you'll fix things so it can be done safely. You're in charge of this outfit, and not that major man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "you {{all come}} up {{asking the same}} {{question}} and wasting my time answering you all severally. You {{want to know what}} this place means. Well, if you'll <b>stay</b> just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are for a minute, I'll tell you all together, and save time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet I will <b>stay</b> it Otterbourne, <b>Where</b> <b>you</b> shall welcome be; And, if ye {{come not}} at three dayis end, A fause lord I'll ca' thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit, Doctor. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. I am lost {{without my}} Boswell. And this {{promises}} to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad conscience," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I've been {{where you}} have been--Miss Grimes. I looked over the edge and I jumped. I'd <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, if I were you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be still, and <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] snapped The Sheik, {{and then}} to Baynes. [...] "So you are the dog of a Christian who stole my {{daughter}} from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, youse," [...] he shouted, [...] "get further back, you're in the picture. Or, say, no, <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. You," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to me, [...] "stay right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are and I'll {{give you a}} dollar to just hold that horror; you understand, just keep on registering it. Don't do another thing, just register that face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything you do {{seems to}} {{interest}} him," [...] continued the farmer, disregarding Mrs. Driver’s manifest distress; [...] "he was asking Lizzie about your calling on Monday; how long <b>you</b> <b>stayed,</b> and <b>where</b> <b>you</b> sat; and after she’d told him, I’m blest if he didn’t go {{and sit in}} the same chair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, don't, then; <b>stay</b> {{right there}} <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. Oh-um!" [...] gaped Hartley, {{stretching}} himself; [...] "it's about time f'r breakfast, I guess. Want y'r hands washed and y'r hair combed?" ...|$|R
