40|$|Fluidized bed {{gasification}} {{can be used}} {{to convert}} the solar energy stored as carboneous compounds in bio-mass into a carbon neutral fuel with reduced emissions. Canada produces 20. 57 million tonnes of wheat straw annually which could be used for green energy production. Wheat straw residue gasification has the capability of replacing 7. 5 % (0. 62 EJ) of Canadaâs annual fossil fuel consumption. To achieve efficient gasification in a fluidized bed proper fuel mixing and residence time must be achieved. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of sand particle <b>size,</b> <b>distributor</b> plate shape and angle, bed height and fluidizing velocity on particle mixing and residence time in the fluidized bed reactor. Greater values of the residence time were obtained with course sand whereas lower values were obtained with fine sand. An in-crease in the angle of convex or a decrease in the angle of a concave of the distributor plate resulted in an increase in the residence time. Both the concave and convex distributor plates achieved vertical upward and downward movements of the bed material resulting in continuous bed material turnover and, thus, good mixing. However, the concave plate achieved longer residence time which will result in better conversion efficiency. To improve the mixing properties of the binary mixture, which has great tendency for segregation due to density differences, an angled distributor plate (concave or convex) should be used. Considerable increases in the residence time were recorded with increases in the bed height. Increasing the fluidizing velocity decreased the residence time due to the increase in the bubble velocity. However, since the conversion efficiency is affected by the degree of mixing, it will also be improved by increasing the fluidization velocity. A velocity above 1. 50 U mf is recommended for better fluidization and improved mixing...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{were carried out}} to investigate the performance of a batch, fluidized/expanded bed ion-exchange system. Exchange of scL-phenylalanine on cation exchange resin was studied in columns of 1 - 4 cm diameter and in the linear velocity range 5 - 40 cm/min. The breakthrough curves were obtained at various design and operating conditions with changing column <b>size,</b> <b>distributor,</b> feed pH, bed height, flow rate, and number of stages. ^ The breakthrough data were analyzed by two theoretical models. A CSTR-type model which is called a lumped model fitted the data well when bed aspect ratio (bed height/bed diameter) was less than 1. 5 and column diameter was 4 cm or less. The fluidized bed was considered a bed that can be well simulated by the lumped model which assumes uniform mixing for the bulk phase, and the expanded bed was considered a bed where the lumped model fails because of reduced backmixing. A packed bed model (VERSE) with axial dispersion, film diffusion, and intraparticle diffusion, fitted the data for both fluidized beds and expanded beds successfully. Experimental {{and theoretical}} results showed the bed-type changes from a fluidized bed to an expanded bed as the bed aspect ratio increases. The breakthrough curves for the expanded bed and a packed bed were almost identical except at very short times. When sieve plates were used as liquid distributors, the plate with more holes of a smaller size resulted in better sorption efficiency. Mass transfer at different flow rates and the effects of bed-type and multiple stages are discussed. ^ Intraparticle diffusion models were studied with VERSE simulations and experimental breakthrough data from packed beds. The surface diffusion model was more appropriate for this ion-exchange resin than the pore diffusion model. The parallel diffusion model was successfully used to predict column breakthrough at different conditions (feed concentration, flow rate, column diameter, and bed height) with reasonably consistent diffusivities. Mass transfer parameters in the bulk phase of fluidized/expanded beds were studied with VERSE simulations and experimental breakthrough data. Very large axial dispersion coefficients were needed for small bed aspect ratios, but packed bed correlations were successfully used for large bed aspect ratios. The study showed there is more dispersion in columns with larger diameters or shorter bed heights. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{discussed}} the topic of benefits of retailers-manufacturers cooperation and coopetition. However, there are only few publications focused {{on the benefits of}} cooperation and coopetition between retailers and their suppliers of durable consumer goods; especially in the context of business model of cooperating partners. This paper aims to provide a clustering approach to segment retailers selling consumer durables according to the benefits they obtain from their cooperation with key manufacturers and differentiate the said retailers’ in term of the business models of cooperating partners. For the purpose of the study, a survey (with a CATI method) collected data on 603 consumer durables retailers present on the Polish market. Retailers are clustered both, with hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods. Five distinctive groups of consumer durables’ retailers are (based on the studied benefits) identified using the two-stage clustering approach. The clusters are then characterized with a set of exogenous variables, key of which are business models employed by the retailer and its partnering key manufacturer. The paper finds that the a combination of a medium sized retailer classified as an Integrator with a chiefly domestic capital and a manufacturer categorized as a Market Player will yield the highest benefits. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum is medium <b>sized</b> <b>Distributor</b> retailer with solely domestic capital – in this case, the business model of the cooperating manufactrer appears to be irreleveant.

The work conducted field interviews with 25 distribution companies, which account for approximately 80 % of domestic sales of gasoline and ethanol. The results suggest that the governance structures differ by asset specificity and that hybrid governances are the most frequent. The conclusions also indicate that the <b>size</b> of <b>distributors</b> is decisive in the choice of coordination mechanisms used and that the delay in enforcing contracts is the main cause of the emergence of complementary mechanisms, their use being primarily directed to the protection of specific assets in transactions...|$|R

40|$|ES 3, {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of C&S Holdings, {{is a third}} party grocery and consumer goods distribution company operating a large distribution facility in York, PA. Under the traditional model for grocery distribution, manufacturers ship products to their manufacturing distribution centers (MDCs), where several products from the same manufacturers are combined in shipments and sent to retail distribution centers (RDCs). The distributors operating the RDCs combine product from several manufacturers to be shipped to individual retail outlets. Currently, in Phase I of its operations, ES 3 improves on this model by replacing MDCs from several manufacturers with a single facility, consolidating orders from several manufacturers and reducing lead time and optimal lot <b>sizes</b> for <b>distributors.</b> Eventually, ES 3 will reach Phase II of its operations, where certain products will bypass RDCs completely and be delivered directly to individual retail outlets. This thesis is concerned with efforts to build a model to quantify the benefit distributors receive from using ES 3 in both Phase I and Phase II of its operations. The model was built using shipping, receiving, operations, and transportation data from C&S {{under the assumption that}} C&S was a good proxy for other distributors which are potential customers for ES 3. The purpose of building the model was two-fold. First, ES 3 would like to recruit distributors as customers and charge them for its services. The model will help demonstrate the savings these distributors can achieve. Second, distributors' savings increase as the number of manufacturers stored at ES 3 increases. ES 3 hopes to demonstrate this effect through the model and momentum for growth. The model quantifies savings in inventory costs,(cont.) transportation costs, and operations costs {{as a function of the}} number and types of products the user chooses to source from ES 3. These savings vary dramatically depending on the <b>size</b> of the <b>distributor</b> using the model, but can be very significant, especially for large distributors. by Michael Martin Amati.

40|$|Most SMEs expand internationally {{by forming}} {{partnerships}} with foreign distributors, {{as they often}} lack the resources and international experience to successfully perform all export functions themselves. However, the management of foreign distributors is often regarded as problematic since it is a highly demanding task. Our research investigates three specific problems that SMEs are faced with when managing foreign distributors, namely the selection, support, and control of foreign distributors. To describe these problems, we have conducted case studies of four exporting SMEs: Propulse AB, Composite Scandinavia AB, Liko AB, and Index Braille. The conclusions drawn in this thesis are as follows: • When selecting foreign distributors, SMEs generally rely on selection criteria such as prior experience, networks and connections, market coverage, and <b>distributor</b> <b>size.</b> The prospective <b>distributors</b> are located by using recommendations and connections, the personal knowledge of the territory, trade fairs, and by distributors contacting SMEs directly. Then the evaluation of candidates and the final choice is made based on visits to the distributor and a marketing, promotion, and/or business plan provided by the distributor. The selection is later finalized in a written contract covering obligations and expectations of both parties. • SMEs support their foreign distributors by nurturing strong relationships, regular communication, field visits, invitations for the distributor to visit, territorial protection, promotional support, technical support, training, business advice, psychological rewards, and finally by providing distributors with adequate margins. • For control of foreign distributors, SMEs start by evaluating their performance by implementing standards such as sales volume, the cost of having the distributor, and the distributors’ sales and marketing input. The performance is monitored employing the SMEs’ own statistics and performance appraisals, and is then compared to mutually set objectives. In addition, SMEs utilize strong relationships, motivation, resources needed by the distributor, favourable terms of trade, and coercive threats and actions {{in order to increase}} the control over distributors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} a novel {{rotating}} distributor for fluidized beds on the bubble size is studied. The distributor is a perforated plate that rotates around the vertical axis of the column. The formation of the bubbles from the rotating distributor is theoretically analyzed. The pierced length of the bubbles ascending in the bed were measured using optical probes. The probability distribution of bubble diameter was inferred from these experimental measurements using the maximum entropy method. The radial profile of the bubble diameter is presented for the static and rotating configurations at different gas velocities. The frequency of bubble passage and the distribution of bubbles in the cross section of the bed bed are also reported. Results were finally shown for different heights above the distributor. A radial decrease in the bubble <b>size</b> when the <b>distributor</b> rotates is found. The bubble growth with the bed height is also lower in the rotating case. Publicad...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of the Report on the restructuring of the electricity distribution industry in South Africa, indicating that some of the, to be formed, Regional Electricity Distributors may find it difficult to be viable, it was suggested that the promotion of entrepreneurship within the distributors will enhance performance. Stemming from this general suggestion, the following questions {{for the purpose of this}} thesis evolved: [...] Can corporate electricity utilities be seen as “normal” corporate business or should it be seen as ‘monopolistic organizations’? [...] Will corporate entrepreneurs jeopardize or enhance the availability and affordability of the organizational products, in this instance electricity supply? [...] What will the implications be on the success of the utility/corporation? [...] How should management promote entrepreneurship? In the review of the related literature it was found that very little information is available on electricity utilities. However, the literature on corporate entrepreneurship was used to inform the study, as the electricity utility can be seen as one type of corporate enterprise. The literature converged on several constructs namely: [...] The organizational culture and strategy [...] Organizational structure [...] Organizational reward systems [...] Risk taking The literature is clear on the finding that when management promoted and supported corporate entrepreneurship in these constructs, the prospect of organizational success improved dramatically. A test instrument was designed and used to evaluate the present South African Electricity Distribution Industry, consisting of 283 Municipal Distributors and Eskom, the national distributor. From the results gained in this study it was found that the present industry differs widely in the following aspects namely: [...] <b>Distributor</b> <b>Size</b> [...] Performance both on service levels and finances [...] Entrepreneurial orientation [...] Growth [...] Management It became clear that the South African Electricity Utility environment could, in general, not be seen as being entrepreneurial in nature. This led to the conclusion that the South African Electricity utility should, in the light of international research findings on corporate entrepreneurship, develop an entrepreneurial culture as a major component of their development strategy.

One of the problems faced by the company is the determination lotting method is less precise. Lot sizing method used by distributors and outlets only on half of the average {{for the past six}} months and the determination of safety stock and a half from the previous demand. As a result, distributors and outlets set the number of reservations lot more volatile than demand. Lotting method applied early distributors and outlets can lead to the phenomenon of the bullwhip effect and storage of goods in warehouses or too much stock out. The main objective of this study is to propose improvements to methods of lot <b>size</b> on the <b>distributor</b> and the outlet, so as to reduce the value of the bullwhip effect and the total cost of inventory. By using the concept of lot sizing method, it will get the value of the bullwhip effect and the total cost of inventory is lower than the initial lotting method that has been used distributors and outlets. The stages of this research is to study early to know the real situation in the company and to identify problems, then performed the data collection. After that stage bullwhip effect measurements and total cost of inventory at the beginning of lotting method. To determine the appropriate method of lot size, then the plan calculation method of booking through lot size EOQ, POQ, LUC, and SM. Then do the calculation of the total cost of inventory and the value bullwip on alternative methods of lot size.

It is expected that the method of determining lot size would be able to reduce the value of the bullwhip effect and the total cost of inventory at distributors and outlets...|$|R
40|$|As China’s {{economy has}} grown and {{personal}} income has risen {{over the past}} decade, spending on landscaping and public works projects has increased dramatically, and with it China’s demand for treated softwood lumber. New luxury residential developments commonly include traditional Chinese landscape design, which includes man-made lakes and waterways traversed by footbridges and flanked by wooden fences, gazebos, and pavilions with decks. Government projects to revitalize shopping areas and tourist destinations has boosted demand for high-quality US treated southern yellow pine (SYP) lumber used to build walkways, bridges, stages, and landscaping elements. Treated softwood lumber {{is a relatively new}} product in China, yet imports have increased steadily over the past several years. However, as demand for treated softwood lumber has increased, the number of domestic wood treaters has also increased. These new Chinese lumber treaters pose a competitive threat because many produce poor quality treated lumber which threatens to undermine the good reputation that US treated SYP has established. This research is intended to provide US suppliers with a description of the Chinese treated softwood lumber market and strategic marketing recommendations. This report is based on information collected through interviews with treating plant managers, softwood lumber distributors, and other industry experts. Additional information was collected from surveys completed by Chinese architects, distributors, and other construction professionals. The report consists of four parts: 1) an overview of the China’s wood preserving industry, 2) a description of the Chinese treated softwood lumber market, 3) results of surveys about user perceptions and attitudes about various treated softwood lumber species used in China, and 4) strategic implications for US manufacturers, exporters and industry associations. Key findings include the following: 1) China’s treated softwood lumber market is extremely competitive and price dependent. The majority of the treated lumber used in China is supplied by local treaters offering low prices. Russian pine treated with Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) {{is by far the most}} widely used treated softwood lumber species in China, due to its low price. However, imported and Chinese treated US SYP is quickly establishing a niche in high-quality market segments and many Chinese treaters report that they would buy as much untreated US SYP as they have access to. The majority of treated SYP from the US is used in government-funded projects where interest in quality and durability is more important than low price. 2) Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) is the most widely used treating chemical used by Chinese treaters. A growing number of Chinese treaters have started to use Alkaline Copper Quatenary (ACQ) and several are developing their own environmentally responsible treating chemicals. Since China has no regulations governing the preservative treated lumber industry, most Chinese treaters develop their own chemicals or dilute purchased preservatives to reduce costs, and the quality and durability of lumber treated with these chemicals is reportedly poor. As China’s government enacts more environmental standards and as more Chinese manufacturers follow international environmental standards as a means of accessing international markets, interest in environmentally-friendly treating chemicals should increase. Survey responses indicate that Chinese construction professionals rate the importance of environmentally-friendly treating chemicals fourth highest in a list of ten quality and service attributes associated with preservative treated softwood lumber. With no regulatory body however, the majority of Chinese treaters will likely use substandard preservative treating chemicals and treating procedures to keep product costs low. 3) According to survey results, US treated SYP has established a reputation as a high-quality, durable and environmentally-friendly building material. As stated above, since China has no standards governing proper treating methods and chemicals, and no testing body to ensure the quality and durability of domestic treated lumber, US industry representatives are concerned that domestically treated softwood lumber may erode the reputation of US treated SYP. 4) While survey respondents rated softwood species from the western US highly, Chinese treaters have negative perceptions about the species. Primary concerns were that Douglas-fir lumber does not absorb preservative treating chemicals completely and the ends require re-treating if the lumber is sawn after initial treating. Conversely, treaters were resistant to using Hem-fir because it absorbs preservative treating chemicals too readily, which increases the price of treating. 5) According to interviews with Chinese lumber treaters and softwood lumber distributors, US exporters face several barriers to expanding their market share in China. The most significant of these obstacles is that most consumers do not understand the differences in performance and durability between imported US treated softwood lumber and less expensive domestically treated lumber. Second, US suppliers continue to face obstacles associated with not providing lumber in metric <b>sizes.</b> Finally, Chinese <b>distributors</b> report that not having ready access to US lumber prices hampers their ability to quote prices as readily as suppliers of domestic treated lumber. 6) Environmental regulations in China are few and enforcement is inconsistent. However, the Chinese government is reportedly investigating the feasibility of reducing environmental pollution by imposing legislative and economic measures on “dirty” industries. Industry experts anticipate that new environmental regulations applied to the Chinese wood treating industry may improve the competitiveness of US preservative treated lumber compared to locally treated lumber. 7) China’s distribution system for softwood lumber is regionally fragmented with hundreds of thousands of distributors, trading markets, and sales outlets across the country. This regional fragmentation makes it important for US suppliers to work with distributors in several regions of China or with a distributor who has a network of regional representatives. Chinese distributors who have become recognized as experts with a basic understanding of wood frame design and softwood lumber performance characteristics have gained a competitive edge over their less knowledgeable competitors. 8) As manufacturers and distributors work to differentiate themselves from their competition, survey respondents report an interest in naturally decay resistant and lesser used species such as Alaska yellow cedar, Sitka spruce and western red cedar from the western US and Canada. The US softwood lumber industry has been successful in developing the Chinese market for preservative treated softwood lumber. To a large degree, this success has been based on educational programs that have raised construction professional’s awareness of the superior performance and durability of softwood lumber that has been properly treated to international wood treating standards. The results of this research clearly demonstrate that there is a brand awareness of US preservative treated southern yellow pine as the “gold standard” of treated softwood lumber products in the Chinese market. Like any successful branding effort, the rapid development of the preservative treated softwood lumber market has spawned low-cost domestically treated products with inferior performance and poor durability. Often, domestically treated SYP is marketed as US-treated SYP. In other cases, pine from South America is marketed as US SYP. In a price sensitive market like China, where markets tend to move towards a commodity focus, it is hardly surprising that these domestically treated, low-priced products have gained a surprising degree of market success. The success of these inferior treated lumber products threatens to undermine the entire market for treated softwood lumber if consumers associate the poor performance and low durability of this domestically produced inferior treated lumber with all treated softwood lumber. To the extent that US preservative lumber manufacturers and exporters allow the commoditization of treated softwood lumber, they stand the risk of having US treated lumber be subject to consumer perceptions based on the poor quality of domestic Chinese treated lumber. From a marketing perspective, it becomes important that the US industry adopt a branding strategy that allows consumers and end-users to differentiate high quality US treated lumber from low quality domestically treated lumber. Thus, it is imperative that the US treated lumber industry work with industry associations and their Chinese distributors to implement a promotion and education strategy to differentiate US preservative treated lumber from competing products. Fundamentally, this marketing strategy would help prevent the commoditization of US treated lumber in the Chinese market and ensure that the poor performance of domestically treated lumber in China does not adversely affect the reputation or demand for US treated lumber. Failure to do this would seriously jeopardize the market for US treated lumber in China...|$|R
