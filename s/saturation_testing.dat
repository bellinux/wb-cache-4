30|$|Tests to {{determine}} base substitution saturation were conducted for all markers separately, for combined ITS array data set, {{and for the}} stem and loop regions of ITS 1 and ITS 2 regions separately (Table  4). Results indicated that for each data set, ISS values were consistently lower than the ISSc values which indicated little saturation in base substitution. The test also revealed little difference between paired (stem) and unpaired positions (loops). In the stem and loop regions of all relevant ITS data sets, the ISS value was always lower significantly (P < 0.0001) than the observed ISSc. The complete results of the <b>saturation</b> <b>tests</b> are summarised in Table  3. The findings of the <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> suggested {{that there was no}} need to partition the stem and loop regions of the ITS 1 and ITS 2 data sets for phylogenetic analyses as these regions had little saturation.|$|R

40|$|Haemochromatosis {{associated}} with mutations in the HFE gene {{is the most}} common inherited disorder in Caucasian populations. Early diagnosis and treatment allows for normal life expectancy whereas there is considerable morbidity and early mortality in those patients diagnosed late or untreated. Unfortunately, the development of symptoms and signs in haemochromatosis is usually {{associated with}} significant iron overload. For this reason, many clinicians and geneticists have advocated population screening. The recent identification of the HFE gene and the availability of a simple DNA-based diagnostic test have led to international debate as to the most cost-effective means of population screening for HFE-associated haemochromatosis.

The hyperoxic response appeared at a mean postnatal age of 14 weeks (range 9 - 33 weeks). This response, which was independent of the infant's lung mechanics, appeared much later in infants with the severe form of CLD.

40|$|AbstractSaturation {{discrimination}} {{has been}} reported to be affected early {{in the course of a}} disease. Our empirical data show a compressive curvi-linear relationship between opponent/nonopponent channel activity and saturation thresholds in normal trichromatic observers. This relationship can be explained by a model based on the Hurvich and Jameson saturation coefficient (1957), Psychology Reviews, 64, 384 – 404. The model considers effects of both selective and nonselective channel losses on saturation processing based on the assumption that disease produces elevated thresholds while maintaining normal psychometric response functions. Both the model and data support clinical observations of saturation losses occurring early in disease. However, the results also indicate that saturation may not be the best modality for monitoring long-term progression of such conditions. We suggest that the different processing characteristics for blue-yellow thresholds may yield added information for <b>saturation</b> <b>testing</b> under some circumstances and that saturation processing occurs at a higher cortical level.

40|$|Phosphotriesterases (PTEs) {{have been}} {{isolated}} {{from a range}} of bacterial species, including Agrobcaterium radiobacter (PTEAr), and are efficient enzymes with broad substrate ranges. The turnover rate of PTEAr for the common organophosphorous insecticide malathion is lower than expected based on its physical properties; principally the pka of its leaving group. In this study, we rationalise the turnover rate of PTEAr for malathion using computational docking of the substrate into a high resolution crystal structure of the enzyme, suggesting that malathion is too large for the PTEAr binding pocket. Protein engineering through combinatorial active site <b>saturation</b> <b>testing</b> (CASTing) was then used to increase the rate of malathion turnover. Variants from a CASTing library in which Ser 308 and Tyr 309 were mutated yielded variants with increased activity towards malathion. The most active PTEAr variant carried Ser 308 Leu and Tyr 309 Ala substitutions, which resulted in a ca. 5000 -fold increase in kcat/KM for malathion. X-ray crystal structures for the PTEAr Ser 308 Leu 309 Ala variant demonstrate that the access to the binding pocket was enhanced by the replacement of the bulky Tyr 309 residue with the smalle...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to examine the fate of uranium during the formation of sodium aluminosilicate (NAS) when wastes containing high aluminate concentrations are mixed with wastes of high silicate concentration. Testing was conducted at varying degrees of uranium <b>saturation.</b> <b>Testing</b> examined typical tank conditions, e. g., stagnant, slightly elevated temperature (50 C). The results showed that under sub-saturated conditions uranium is not removed from solution to any large extent in both simulant testing and actual tank waste testing. There are data supporting a small removal due to sorption of uranium on sites in the NAS. Above the solubility limit the data are clear that a reduction in uranium concentration occurs {{with the formation of}} aluminosilicate. This uranium precipitation is fairly rapid and ceases when uranium reaches its solubility limit. At the solubility limit, it appears that uranium is not affected, but further testing might be warranted. Lastly, analysis of the uranium speciation in a Tank 49 H set of samples showed the uranium to be soluble. Analysis of the solution composition and subsequent use of the Hobb's uranium solubility model indicated a uranium solubility limit of 32 mg/L.

40|$|Hereditary {{hemochromatosis}} {{is transmitted}} as an autosomal recessive trait. Analyses of pedigrees {{suggest that the}} frequency of disease (proportion of homozygous individuals) {{in the general population}} is approximately 0. 3 % and that approximately 11 % of the population are heterozygous. The genotype of 194 persons in 38 pedigrees was determined by HLA-A and HLA-B haplotyping. Likelihood analysis was then used to appraise the transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> when used alone and in combination with the serum ferritin test to detect homozygosity and heterozygosity in these pedigrees. A single cut-off point of 55 % for transferrin saturation and a cut-off point at the 90 th percentile for the serum ferritin level were adequate for the detection of hemochromatosis if homozygosity was considered to be present when the results of one or both tests were positive. To further assess the value of the transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> the percentages were stratified into five intervals. A percentage transferrin saturation of 75 or greater and a serum ferritin level above the 90 th percentile ruled in homozygosity, whereas a percentage transferrin saturation of less than 55 and a serum ferritin level at or below the 90 th percentile ruled it out with confidence. The probability of heterozygosity rose to 90 % when the percentage transferrin saturation was between 35 and 55 and the serum ferritin level was at or below the 90 th percentile. The use of five cut-off points allowed the probability of homozygosity and heterozygosity in a pedigree to be estimated for all values of transferrin saturation. Although these screening tests are not recommended for use in the general population, they may be worth while in selected groups of patients...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMineralogical and {{chemical}} variations were {{studied in the}} upper half of a 1 m thick discontinuous bentonite bed interlaminated in the Lower Cenomanian sedimentary formations of the northern Aquitaine basin (France). X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from the < 2 μm fraction in the Ca and K-saturated states were decomposed and compared to those calculated from decomposition parameters. They revealed the presence of two highly expandable illiteexpandable (I-Exp) mixed-layer minerals (MLMs). Relative proportions of the two MLMs steadily evolve with depth leading to the decrease of the cation exchange capacity and of the (Na + Ca) content towards the center of the bentonite bed. However, the system is essentially isochemical and Mg, Al, Si, K and Fe are roughly constant in the bulk samples. It is thought that the mineralogical zonation results from the initial stages of the smectite formation in an ash layer. In the Ca-saturated state, the expandable component of these MLMs was for the most part homogeneous with the presence of 2 sheets of ethylene glycol molecules in the interlayer. However, the heterogeneous hydration behaviour of these expandable layers was enhanced by the potassium <b>saturation</b> <b>test.</b> From this test, the presence of three layer types with contrasting layer charge was evidenced from their contrasting swelling abilities. The C 12 -alkylammonium <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> applied to samples in which the octahedral charge had previously been neutralized (Hofmann-Klemen treatment) showed that the tetrahedral charge is located on specific layers. These layers are responsible for the heterogeneous hydration behaviour. Low-charge smectite layers are mostly octahedrally substituted, whereas for intermediate- and high charge layers this montmorillonitic charge is complemented by additional tetrahedral substitutions (0. 30 and 0. 35 - 0. 40 charge per O 10 (OH) 2, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{testing of}} {{assemblies}} {{for use in}} cryogenic systems commonly includes evaluation at or near operating (therefore cryogenic) temperature. Typical assemblies include valves and pumps for use in liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen rocket engines. One frequently specified method of cryogenic external leakage testing requires the assembly, pressurized with gaseous helium (GHe), be immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen (LN 2) and allowed to thermally stabilize. Component interfaces are then visually inspected for leakage (bubbles). Unfortunately the liquid nitrogen will be boiling under normal, bench-top, test conditions. This boiling tends to mask even significant leakage. One little known and perhaps under-utilized property of helium is the seemingly counter-intuitive thermodynamic property that when ambient temperature helium is bubbled through boiling LN 2 at a temperature of − 195. 8 °C, {{the temperature of the}} liquid nitrogen will reduce. This paper reports on the design and testing of a novel proof-of-concept helium injection control system confirming {{that it is possible to}} reduce the temperature of an LN 2 bath below boiling point through the controlled injection of ambient temperature gaseous helium and then to efficiently maintain a reduced helium flow rate to maintain a stabilized liquid temperature, enabling clear visual observation of components immersed within the LN 2.

40|$|Amino acid oxidases (AAOs) are {{enantioselective}} flavoenzymes that catalyse the oxidation of {{amino acids}} into imino acids, which spontaneously hydrolyse in water to form keto acids. AAOs have several potential applications, most notably as biocatalysts {{in the production}} of enantiomerically pure amino acids and keto acids, or in enzymatic biosensors. Therefore, there is a demand for a range of AAOs with specific activity against various substrates, encouraging the characterisation of less well understood oxidases. Seven putative oxidases were cloned into the pET-YSBLIC- 3 C expression vector, expressed in E. coli-DE 3 expression strains and assayed for activity against all proteinogenic amino acids. Of these seven targets, the L-amino acid oxidase from Pseudomonas putida (PpLAAO) was found to be highly soluble, had detectable activity against L-aspartate and L-asparagine and had not been investigated in depth previously. The purified PpLAAO protein showed high substrate specificity against L-aspartate and lower activity with substrate inhibition against L-asparagine. Very low activity was also detected against L-glutamate. The purified protein had optimal activity around pH 7. 5 and at temperatures between 4 °C and 30 °C. To investigate the role of residues in the active site area of the PpLAAO protein thirteen active site residues, determined by comparison with the structure of the L-aspartate oxidase from E. coli (L-AspO), were mutated to alanine. Eleven of these mutants were purified and assayed against L-aspartate, L-asparagine and L-glutamate. Results were largely consistent with knowledge of L-AspO. Ingenza Ltd. has an interest in potential applications of L-tyrosine and L-alanine oxidases. Because of this iterative combinatorial active site <b>saturation</b> <b>testing,</b> using the active structure of L-AspO was performed alongside a small scale epPCR mutagenesis in an attempt to introduce activity against L-alanine and L-tyrosine.

On the basis of the results, the authors developed a model avoiding local irreversible demagnetisation. A maximum load test was performed after a thermal <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> to confirm whether irreversible demagnetisation of the manufactured models occurred.

Existing seismic compression analysis procedures are based on laboratory test results for clean uniform sands, and their applicability to compacted soils with fines is unclear. We evaluate seismic compression from cyclic simple shear laboratory testing of four compacted soils having fines contents that are sufficiently large that fines control the soil behavior, but possessing varying levels of fines plasticity. Each soil material is compacted to a range of formation dry densities and degrees-of-saturation. The test results show that seismic compression susceptibility decreases with increasing density and decreasing shear strain amplitude. Saturation is also found to be important for soils with moderately plastic fines (plasticity index, PI » 15), but relatively unimportant for soils with low plasticity fines (PI » 2) across the range of <b>saturations</b> <b>tested</b> (³ 54 %). The saturation effect appears to be linked to the presence or lack of presence of a clod structure in the soil, the clod structure being most pronounced in plastic soils compacted dry of the line-of-optimums or at low densities.
