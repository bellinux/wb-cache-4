5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 21 June a force of about 50 Japanese troops <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of the Pocket and {{attempted}} to attack Australian positions on Labuan. Different groups of Japanese troops attacked a prisoner of war enclosure, dock facilities and No. 1 Strip, but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers. A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria, and another 11 were killed at the airfield. Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements.|$|E

The couple, wed at the White House, traveled in one of George Washingtons imperial suites. The following January, English playwright W. Somerset Maugham quietly <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of New York on George Washington. Maugham had arrived in New York in mid November to see Billie Burke in the New York premiere of his play, The Land of Promise.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that had <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of Imperial control in the 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|E
5|$|Ralphie V {{took the}} field with the {{football}} team {{for the first time}} at the spring game on April 19, 2008. In her pre-game run Ralphie ran perfectly, but <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of her harness at the very start of the halftime run, bumping, but not trampling, one handler and shedding all but one of her other handlers. Zeb Kopasz was the only handler to hold on to her. They were able to get her under control on the far 25-yard line and return her to her trailer.|$|E

5|$|After another bright start, Oxford led {{the table}} {{several times in}} the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering though still in the {{play-off}} places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of the play-off places in the final few weeks of the season, finishing a disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers broke their two-game {{losing streak}} as Ricky Bell set a club record with 167 rushing yards, while Doug Williams threw for two touchdowns and rushed for a third. The total of 228 rushing yards was 7 yards {{shy of the}} team record set in the {{previous}} game against the Packers, and left the Buccaneers as the only team with two rushers on pace to break the 1,000-yard mark. Packers quarterback David Whitehurst threw for a career-best 261 yards, although the Packers never entered the end zone. Jeris White intercepted a potential touchdown pass that <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of James Lofton's hands. The win left the Buccaneers at midseason having already achieved their highest win total ever.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Tang <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of the city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly {{disintegrating}} with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact {{had already been}} lost with many units who thus never received Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did receive it had little luck at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. After that they were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated {{in a bid to}} break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on convoy SLS 64, Admiral Hippers fuel stocks were running low. She {{therefore}} returned to Brest on 15 February. British bombers were regularly attacking the port, however, and the Kriegsmarine therefore decided Admiral Hipper should return to Germany, where she could be better protected. Before the ship could leave, damage caused to the ship's hull by wrecks in the harbor had to be repaired. On 15 March, the ship <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of Brest, unobserved, and passed through the Denmark Strait eight days later. While en route, Admiral Hipper stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British. Upon arrival, the ship went into the Deutsche Werke shipyard for an extensive overhaul, which lasted for seven months. After completion of the refit, Admiral Hipper conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor refitting. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyard; a degaussing coil was fitted to the ship's hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational.|$|E
5|$|For {{nearly two}} weeks the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} Elisa remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E

5|$|Graham's {{replacement}} was Glaswegian John Docherty. In {{his second}} season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football {{for the first time}} in the club's history. Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of the top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons playing together. Millwall's first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club all season. The following season, they briefly led the league for one night in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games all season and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, President Grant's Indian peace policy, {{enforced}} {{and coordinated}} by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona, required the Apache {{to be put}} on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education. The Apache <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant. 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache. When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women and children, in {{what became known as the}} Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise; during the chase they killed 13 Apache. Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the French attempts to reach the Caribbean ended in failure. Several ships were intercepted in the Bay of Biscay, while others reached the Caribbean, only to be defeated by ships from Cochrane's squadron, which was focused on preparations for the invasion of Martinique, planned for February. Only two ships reached the islands safely, the 40–gun frigates Junon at Guadeloupe and Amphitrite at Martinique. By February 1809, Martinique was under attack, distracting most of the available British ships from the blockade of Guadeloupe. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of enemy shipping, Junon <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> of the Îles des Saintes {{to the south of}} Guadeloupe on 4 February and sailed north. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Augustin Rousseau, had dropped off his military and food supplies and taken on board large quantities of trade goods for sale in France in an effort to revive the Guadeloupe economy.|$|E
