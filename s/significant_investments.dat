25|$|During {{the period}} of Austro-Hungarian rule (1878–1918), Mostar’s city council cooperated with the Austro-Hungarians to {{implement}} sweeping reforms in city planning: broad avenues and an urban grid were imposed on the western bank of the Neretva, and <b>significant</b> <b>investments</b> were made in infrastructure, communications and housing.

25|$|As a result, in 1957 the Swedish Government {{started to}} study the {{opportunity}} {{to set up and}} operate one or possibly two purely military reactors for plutonium production located in caverns underground. In July 1958, upon the study the AB Atomenergi and FOA concluded that a military reactor, using aluminum fuel elements and heavy water as moderator, would lead to lower costs of production than if they used civil reactors. However, that kind of reactor would require <b>significant</b> <b>investments,</b> and because of its proposed underground location, it would take 4.5 years to build the reactor. The decreased civilian interest in domestic supply of raw materials resulted in revision of plans to build nuclear weapons facilities in Sweden in 1959 and 1960. However, now they required a uranium facility, heavy water reactor, and reprocessing plant to be able to supply plutonium. This led to a sharp increase in time and cost estimates. These facilities were included in none of the 1958 drafts, – neither in the S- nor L- programs. Thus their funding {{was not included in the}} program for extended defense research approved by the Government. The Ministry of Defense and FOA's assessment of the situation in 1961 concluded that it was solely plutonium supply that was the limiting factor for the nuclear weapons program. From 1961 onwards, the Ministry of Defense announced that the program's schedule was postponed for this reason.|$|E
