5|$|The Rev. Edward Barlow {{invented the}} rack and snail <b>{{striking}}</b> <b>mechanism</b> for striking clocks, {{which was a}} great improvement over the previous mechanism. The repeating clock, that chimes {{the number of hours}} (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer <b>striking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
500|$|Salisbury cathedral clock, {{dating from}} about 1386, {{is one of}} the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest. [...] It still has most of its {{original}} parts, although its original verge and foliot timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a pendulum, which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956. [...] It has no dial, as its purpose was to strike a bell at precise times. The wheels and gears are mounted in an open, box-like iron frame, measuring about [...] square. The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs. [...] Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels. One barrel drives the main wheel, which is regulated by the escapement, and the other drives the <b>striking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the air brake.|$|E

2500|$|A banjo {{clock is}} a wall clock with an {{inverted}} banjo-shaped case. The banjo clock normally lacks a <b>striking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and indicates time only by its hands and dial, for which reason some horologists may insist upon {{calling it a}} timepiece rather than a true clock. The clock is usually adorned with a finial on the top. Known as his [...] "patent timepiece", the banjo clock was invented by renowned American clockmaker Simon Willard of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and patented on February 8, 1802.|$|E

50|$|The tone of {{the sound}} {{generated}} depends on the shape {{and size of the}} bell or gong resonator. Where several bells are installed together, they may be given distinctive rings by using different size or shapes of gong, even though the <b>strike</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are identical.|$|R
50|$|Simon Willard's shelf clocks were weight-driven {{and some}} models had an {{extended}} {{base for the}} weight so they achieved a one-week running period. Also, they had a pinwheel escapement. Their <b>strike</b> <b>mechanism</b> was the rack and snail. The pendulum length could be adjusted {{through a hole in}} the clock face at the 12 o'clock position, so it was not necessary to open the case.|$|R
30|$|In summary, the {{presence}} of relocated aftershocks suggests changes in dip and strike angles for the three segments of the rupture zone, and the focal mechanism in the northern segment shows a mixture of thrust and <b>strike</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In the future, when {{the depth of the}} smaller aftershocks can be better constrained from depth phases (Langston, 1987), a cross section of the aftershock pattern should provide clues to variable dip angle versus depth for the rupturing fault plane. Therefore, much more work has to be done on aftershocks to better understand the rupture process and seismotectonic setting of the Wenchuan Earthquake.|$|R

50|$|All watches {{provide the}} time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and usually the second. Most also provide the current date, and often {{the day of the}} week as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of {{information}} beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include alarms. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate <b>striking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> or repeater functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary timepieces. This feature is available on most digital watches.|$|R

5000|$|The repeating {{clock was}} invented by the English cleric and inventor, the Reverend Edward Barlow in 1676. [...] His {{innovation}} was the rack and snail <b>striking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which {{could be made to}} repeat easily and became the standard mechanism used in both clock and watch repeaters ever since. The best kind of repeating clocks were expensive to make; a separate train of wheels had {{to be added to the}} <b>striking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> to activate it one pulled a cord whereupon it would strike the hours and quarters, or even the hours and five-minute divisions (five minutes repeating). During the nineteenth century such clocks gradually went out of use. Due to cheap imports from France, Germany and America English clockmaking went into decline and with the advent of gas lighting repeating clocks became an unnecessary luxury.|$|E

25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of <b>striking</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of γδ T cells has identified a rapid lymphoid stress-surveillance response to microbial and nonmicrobial tissue perturbation. In {{addition to providing}} local protection, this response provides an immediate source of cytokines, chemokines, and other functions that can substantially affect downstream, adaptive immunity. Recent studies have identified <b>striking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by which γδ cells {{meet the requirements of}} stress surveillance. For example, high response frequencies can reflect a unique nature of antigen engagement by the T cell receptor (TCR), developmental focusing of the repertoire by selection events, or the use of nonclonotypic receptors to initiate responses. Likewise, rapid functional deployment can be facilitated by the preprogramming of γδ cells during development. Additionally, γδ cells can directly influence adaptive immunity by functioning as antigen-presenting cells. With lymphoid stress surveillance likely to underpin numerous aspects of inflammation, tumor immunology, infectious disease, and autoimmunity, this perspective considers its properties and its emerging potential for clinical manipulation...|$|R
