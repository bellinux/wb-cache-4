40|$|Nowadays, {{from home}} {{monitoring}} to large airport <b>security,</b> a <b>lot</b> of digital video surveillance {{systems have been}} used. Digital surveillance system usually requires streaming video processing abilities. As an advanced video coding method, H. 264 is introduced to reduce the large video data dramatically (usually by 70 X or more). However, computational overhead occurs when coding and decoding H. 264 video. In this paper, a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) based hardware acceleration solution for video codec is proposed, which {{can also be used}} for other software applications. The characteristics of the video codec are analyzed by using the profiling tool. The Hadamard function, which is the bottleneck of H. 264, is identified not only by execution time but also another two attributes, such as cycle per loop and loop round. The Co-processor approach is applied to accelerate the Hadamard function by transforming it to hardware. Performance improvement, resource costs and energy consumption are compared and analyzed. Experimental results indicate that 76. 5 % energy deduction and 8. 09 X speedup can be reached after balancing these three key factors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Information {{security}} has increasingly {{become an important}} topic for small and big organizations alike. Although awareness and efforts towards security have increased, unfortunately, this increase {{does not appear to}} be mitigating the number or cost of incidents from either internal or external sources. One reason for the problem is that the technology is changing faster than what financially-strapped businesses and information technology (IT) departments can handle. Most organizations are not only increasing the size of their networks but also adding new types of connectivity and complexity. For example, acquisition and implementation of different types of systems because of back-end business process integration with suppliers and other partners and front-end process integration with clients and customers. In some cases, this kind of integration is forced due to mergers and acquisitions. In several instances, market’s competitive pressures on hardware and software vendors forces them to implement security features and test products prior to product release in a shortened time span and compromise <b>security.</b> A <b>lot</b> of times <b>security</b> is an after thought and it turns out to be an add-in into existin...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} most pressing problems of our time — migration. Depopulation, population ageing, falling birth rate among the indigenous population creates conditions when migration becomes one of the most important sources of population growth in developed countries. Despite the fact that the problems depopulation can’t be solved only through migration, it is impossible to manage the situation without migrants, otherwise population will decline even more rapidly. The article analyzes particularities of migration in Russia, especially focusing on migration in Moscow. The main emphasis is made on the problems of interaction between migrants and the host community, or more precisely on the attitudes towards migrants among Muscovites. There is a high level of anti-immigrant and xenophobic attitudes among Moscow’s residents, which points to the necessity to overcome migrantophobia, promote tolerance, establish cultural dialogue between migrants and the indigenous population of the region. Negative consequences of xenophobia are analyzed, which pose a threat to Russian stability and <b>security.</b> A <b>lot</b> of attention is paid to such feature of contemporary migration as the increasing proportion of women among migrants — the feminization of migration, problems and prospects that follow it.
