50|$|Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems was a {{consortium}} of 29 companies {{under the auspices of}} the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency relief systems to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure relief systems for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, <b>sulphonations,</b> epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations and many others. Pressure relief systems can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapour, liquid, or a mixture of the two - just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened.

40|$|Synthesis and {{characterisation}} of PEM using aryl backbone commercial polystyrene-butadiene rubber (locally sourced) {{were carried}} out by <b>sulphonation</b> with chlorosulphonic acid, and assessed for its potential to serve as possible PEMFC application. The effect of weight of the polystyrene-butadiene rubber (PSBR), <b>sulphonation</b> time, stirring speed, concentration of <b>sulphonation</b> agent and <b>sulphonation</b> temperature {{on the degree of}} <b>sulphonation</b> (DS), ion exchange capacity (IEC) and viscosity of the resulting sulphonated material were investigated. Synthesized membranes were thus characterized by Fourier Transform Infra-red (FT-IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 HNMR) to confirm <b>sulphonation.</b> Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimentry (DSC) were used to verify the thermal stability of the membrane, while impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the proton conductivity of the membrane. The results obtained revealed that the weight of the rubber, <b>sulphonation</b> time, stirring speed, concentration of sulphonating agent and the <b>sulphonation</b> temperature affect the DS, IEC, viscosity, thermal stability and proton conductivity of the membrane, such that, <b>sulphonation</b> time of 24 hrs and acid concentration of 1. 6 M/ml gave the best DS, with IEC ranging from 0. 23 to 2. 36 mmol/g. Conductivities were in the range of 10 - 3 – 10 - 2 S/cm. However, over 2 folds increase in ion exchange capacity and degree of <b>sulphonation</b> was achieved on the effect of temperature. The <b>sulphonation</b> kinetic of PSBR was studied in 0. 0016 mol L- 1 of chlorosulphonic acid where first-order kinetic model; without the effect of HCl and the effect of HCl were investigated. The reaction rate was found to obey the first-order model with the HCl produced having a desulphonation effect on the reaction. A predictive model Page iv developed is able to predict degree of <b>sulphonation</b> at different initial concentration of acid. The thermodynamic study showed that the reaction is non-spontaneous, and as temperature increases the reaction system experienced phase change from liquid to solid at temperature above 328 K. The DSC and TGA analysis showed that polystyrene-butadiene rubber is a thermo stable polymer for PEM fuel cell application with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 198 oC. Porosity of the membrane and uptake of solvent per sulphonic groups at different thickness of membrane were also calculated. The porosity of the membrane to methanol increased with a decrease in membrane thickness and increased with an increase in methanol concentration. Based on the results obtained from the porosity of the membrane to methanol and methanol up take, it can be inferred that the membrane is less permeable to methanol than water. In comparism, the porosity of the synthesised membrane to methanol was less than that of Nafion® which was in the range of 0. 40 - 0. 51. The results also showed that water uptake increases as the thickness of the membrane decreases. However, the membrane was found to exhibit a moderately water absorption and desorption capacity. But considering the effect of temperature, the membrane will require proper humidification especially if the fuel cell where the membrane will be used will be operated above room temperature.

The evaluated sulphonated lignins are all used as dispersants in agrochemical formulations, where some give rise to physical instabilities of formulations. It is of interest to identify the properties of the sulphonated lignins that determine the formulation characteristics. Tetrapentylammonium bromide has been used as an ion-pair reagent in a gradient-elution reversed-phase liquid-chromatographic (IP-RPLC) method, as well as in aqueous size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Clear differences in the size distribution were observed between different batches of sulphonated lignins. The RPLC and SEC methods were combined in a comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography system. The retention times in the two dimensions were highly correlated. Therefore, the full potential of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography was not yet realized.

40|$|Sulphate is an obligate {{nutrient}} {{for healthy}} growth and development. Sulphate conjugation (<b>sulphonation)</b> of proteoglycans maintains {{the structure and}} function of tissues. <b>Sulphonation</b> also regulates the bioactivity of steroids, thyroid hormone, bile acids, catecholamines and cholecystokinin, and detoxifies certain xenobiotics and pharmacological drugs. In adults and children, sulphate is obtained from the diet and from the intracellular metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids. Dietary sulphate intake can vary greatly and {{is dependent on the}} type of food consumed and source of drinking water. Once ingested, sulphate is absorbed into circulation where its level is maintained at approximately 300  μmol/L, making sulphate the fourth most abundant anion in plasma. In pregnant women, circulating sulphate concentrations increase by twofold with levels peaking in late gestation. This increased sulphataemia, which is mediated by up-regulation of sulphate reabsorption in the maternal kidneys, provides a reservoir of sulphate to meet the gestational needs of the developing foetus. The foetus has negligible capacity to generate sulphate and thereby, is completely reliant on sulphate supply from the maternal circulation.

In this study, four kinds of sulphonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) with different degrees of <b>sulphonation</b> (DS) referred to hereafter as SPEEK 1 (DS = 20. 8 %), SPEEK 2 (DS = 41 %), SPEEK 3 (DS = 63. 6 %), and SPEEK 4 (DS = 76 %), were fabricated, characterized and applied in an MFC. The membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The degree of <b>sulphonation</b> was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Then the membranes were applied to the MFC system. The results indicated that the power produced by MFC with SPEEK 3 (68. 64 mW/m) was higher than with the other SPEEK membranes while it was lower than with Nafion 117 (74. 8 mW/m). SPEEK 3 also had the highest chemical oxygen demand removal (91 %) and coulombic efficiency (26 %) compared to other SPEEK membranes. The cost evaluation suggests that application of SPEEK 3 is more cost effective than applications of the other types of SPEEK and Nafion 117, due to its high power density generation per cost...|$|E

Alternative {{energy sources}} are needed {{if the current}} use of energy is to be {{sustained}} while reducing global warming. A possible alternative energy source that has significant potential is hydrogen. For hydrogen to become a serious contender for replacing fossil fuels, the production thereof has to be further investigated. One such process, the membrane–based Hybrid Sulphur (HyS) process, where hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of SO 2, has received considerable interest recently. Since H 2 SO 4 is formed during SO 2 electrolysis, H 2 SO 4 stability {{is a prerequisite for}} any membrane to be used in this process. In this study, pure as well as high and low temperature blended polybenzimidazole (PBI), partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether) (sFS) and nonfluorinated poly(arylene ethersulphone) (sPSU) membranes were investigated in terms of their acid stability as a function of acid concentration by treating them in H 2 SO 4 (30, 60 and 90 wt%) for 120 h at 1 bar pressure. The high temperature blend membranes contain the basic polymer in excess (70 wt% basic PBI and 30 wt% acid sPSU/sFS polymer) and require acid doping in order to conduct protons. In the doped state they are able to conduct protons up to 200 °C. The low temperature blend membranes are also composed of the same PBI polymer used in the high temperature membranes, as well as the same acidic polymers with one of the membranes containing a fluorinated polymer and the other a nonfluorinated polymer (sFS or sPSU) in excess. These membranes do not require any acid doping to conduct protons but they are only stable at temperatures below 80 °C. High temperature blend membranes were characterised using through–plane conductivity, GPC and IEC, whilst low temperature membranes were characterised using in–plane and through–plane proton conductivity, weight change, TGA, GPC, SEM, EDX and IEC techniques. The conductivity determination techniques (especially the in–plane technique) proved to be cumbersome, whilst all the other analysis techniques were deemed appropriate. H 2 SO 4 exposure had a destabilising effect on the PBI membrane which presented as weight gain at the 30 and 60 wt% H 2 SO 4 concentrations due to salt formation and dissolution at the 90 wt% acid treatment due to <b>sulphonation.</b> In the sFS membrane dissolution was observed at 30 and 60 wt% as a result of oligomer loss that occurred during the post treatment washing process and partial dissolution, as a result of <b>sulphonation,</b> at the 90 wt% treated membrane. The sPSU membrane showed great stability at 30 and 60 wt%, though dissolution was observed at 90 wt% because of membrane <b>sulphonation</b> {{due to a lack of}} fluorination. The sFS–PBI membrane blend proved to be stable with only slight degradation taking place at 90 wt% treatment due to <b>sulphonation.</b> Similarly the sPSU–PBI blend membrane showed great stability at the 30 and 60 wt% H 2 SO 4 treatment concentrations however total dissolution occurred at 90 wt% treatment again due to a lack of fluorination. Although both the low temperature blended membranes showed superb stability to H 2 SO 4 concentrations expected in the SO 2 electrolyser (30 – 40 wt%), the low temperature blended sFS–PBI membrane seemed slightly more stable over the H 2 SO 4 treatment concentration range (30 – 90 wt%), due to the protective role of the fluorinated polymer. The superior acid stability of this membrane could prove vital for proper SO 2 electrolysis, especially for prolonged periods of operationMaster...|$|E
