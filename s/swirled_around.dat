So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|The match itself <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> {{controversy}} between Abiodun Okulaja's (the center referee) {{calls and}} officiating. The most questionable calls were associated {{the severity of}} cards distributed to players and a late-match decision to award a penalty kick to the United, in which many claimed was a fake trip in the box. One controversial call came from a reckless challenge by Galaxy midfielder, Beckham, to United forward, Josh Wolff in the 40th minute. Following the referee stopping play to call the foul, a verbal exchange between Beckham and United's Santino Quaranta resulted in a swarm of United and Galaxy players coming in to push the two apart. While Quaranta was not carded for his exchange with Beckham, Beckham was carded for his foul against Wolff in the 37th minute and Davies' penalty kick in the 91st. The goal received much national attention from the controversy surrounding the decision to award a penalty, and Davies' celebration for successfully converting the kick. Subsequent to the match, center referee Abiodun Okulaja ejected Galaxy midfielder Jovan Kirovski for cursing at him while sniping his decision.|$|E

500|$|During this controversy, Sebree {{remained}} {{silent on the}} issue, and it is unknown whether {{he was a member}} of the majority or not. Evans commented in his critique that he was unsure who the other supporters of the majority decision were. As criticism <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> the trial itself, the editors of the magazine United Service defended Sebree and stated that he had [...] "universal esteem throughout the Navy service" [...] and that he had a [...] "large experience, sound judgment, even temper and most excellent record". Following this announcement, Sebree was transferred to the Naval War College in Rhode Island to work as an instructor and as Secretary of the Lighthouse Board.|$|E

Fourteen miles distant from Dhu Heartach across open sea, the little island provided a granite quarry and a shore station once the work on the lighthouse was completed.

Summer gales brought high seas, which resulted in breaking water falling on the roof [...] above sea level. It held firm, although fourteen men including Brebner were trapped there for five days, and at one point seawater poured in through the trapdoor, <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> them and exited with their remaining food supplies.

500|$|The 1928 Gators {{played their}} final game against coach Robert Neyland's Tennessee Volunteers on the Vols' home field in Knoxville, Tennessee. Neyland was sick with the flu. The {{game was played}} on a soft, wet field, {{following}} a hard rain, and both teams scored two touchdowns on the muddy field. The Volunteers missed one of their two extra-point conversion attempts after touchdowns, but the Gators missed two conversion attempts and lost the game by a single point, 12–13. In what would become a trend in the series, controversy <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> the contest. By all accounts, the playing surface had been a muddy mess. Some Gators claimed that the home team had watered down the field {{in an effort to}} slow down the speedy Gator backs. The Vols protested that the sloppy conditions were simply the result of heavy rain the night before the game. One contemporary sportswriter called the game [...] "the biggest upset of the year down South." [...] Tennessee's usual quarterback, Roy Witt, was out with an injury, and was replaced by Bobby Dodd.|$|E

[...] Rumors of mental illness and alcohol abuse <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> him, concocted largely by the Federalist press. [...] His words and actions in response to the Jay Treaty were used as evidence of his continued mental decline. The Senate rejected his appointment on December 15, 1795 by a vote of 14–10. This {{was the first time that}} the Senate had rejected a presidential recess appointment. [...] Of the 15 recess appointments to the Supreme Court, it remains the only one to be rejected, and to date Rutledge remains the only person ever removed involuntarily from the Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1954, Godfrey buzzed {{the control}} tower of Teterboro Airport in his DC-3. His {{certificate}} {{was suspended for}} six months. Godfrey claimed the windy conditions that day required him to turn immediately after takeoff, but in fact he was peeved with the tower because they would not give him the runway he requested. He later recorded a satirical song about the incident, [...] "Teterboro Tower," [...] roughly {{to the tune of}} [...] "Wabash Cannonball". A similar event occurred while he flew near Chicago in 1956, though no sanctions were imposed.

2500|$|The {{charges that}} Professor Gotwald was not {{teaching}} correct Lutheran theology <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> {{quite some time}} before formal charges {{were brought to the}} Wittenberg Board of Trustees. It undoubtedly owed much of its genesis to Rev. Gotwald's ministry in Dayton in which he became embroiled in many stormy debates about church doctrine with some other church leaders. It reached the point that his health gave out and he had to resign his ministry and spend a period of time away from the ministry to recover. It was no coincidence that his most vocal critics and accusers came from Dayton. Perhaps most damaging in the leadup to the trial were articles in the Lutheran Evangelist that named [...] "Luther Gotwald as a teacher not fit to teach in a General Synod Seminary".|$|E
2500|$|The Glacial St. Croix River {{carved a}} series of {{terraces}} along its banks. [...] Sand and gravel were occasionally caught in eddies or whirlpools and were <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> {{with such force that}} they drilled holes straight down into the rock. [...] Larger rocks caught in the spin would polish the shafts smooth. [...] The Glacial Gardens area on the Minnesota shore contains more than 80 of these glacial potholes, the greatest concentration in the world. [...] The volume of the St. Croix River eventually lessened, exposing many of the potholes to the air. [...] Dirt, vegetation, and rainwater have collected in them, disguising their true depths. [...] Some have been excavated; one, the Bottomless Pit, is [...] wide and [...] deep, the deepest explored pothole in the world. [...] Other unexcavated potholes in the park are even wider, suggesting that they may be deeper as well.|$|E
2500|$|The LaRosa {{incident}} {{opened an}} era of controversy that <b>swirled</b> <b>around</b> Godfrey and gradually destroyed his folksy image. [...] It was not, however, the only firing. [...] In 1952; Archie Bleyer had formed his own label, Cadence Records, which recorded LaRosa. The bandleader also married Janet Ertel of The Chordettes. The focus of Godfrey's anger was the fact Bleyer, while vacationing from the show, had produced a spoken-word record by Godfrey's Chicago counterpart Don McNeill to be released on Cadence. McNeill hosted The Breakfast Club, which had been Godfrey's direct competition on the NBC Blue Network (later ABC) since Godfrey's days at WJSV. Despite the McNeill show's far more modest following, Godfrey was unduly offended, even paranoid, at what he felt was disloyalty on Bleyer's part. Bleyer simply shrugged off the dismissal and focused on developing Cadence, which later released hits by the Everly Brothers and Andy Williams. [...] He never commented publicly on the rift with Godfrey.|$|E

Harrison marched north to Prophetstown on the Tippecanoe in November 1811, Shabbona was there with Waubansee and Winamac to lead the Potawatomi warriors against the Americans. [...] The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages. [...] Then in 1812, Shabbona joined with Main Poc in a move to Canada to join the British during the War of 1812. [...] In September 1813, when Captain Perry defeated the British fleet on Lake Erie, the British began their evacuation of Detroit. [...] Shabbona, Mad Sturgeon, and Billy Caldwell accompanied Tecumseh and the British into Canada.
