5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal {{back into the}} water. Shark finning {{involves}} removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of <b>shark</b> <b>fins.</b> From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting <b>shark</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|E
5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced {{a middle class}} that increased demand for traditional luxury items like <b>shark</b> <b>fins.</b> Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing crews to both take them from sharks in their bycatch and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of <b>shark</b> <b>fins.</b> They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|Tai Loong {{believed}} {{that the government had}} exceeded its statutory authority by confiscating the fins. It argued that before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, a federal district judge for the Southern District of California, who granted an injunction against NOAA prohibiting it from selling the fins itself. The company and the agency then agreed that, in return for the former putting up a $775,000 bond, that it would take possession of the <b>shark</b> <b>fins,</b> although they remained in cold storage pending the outcome of the case. Tai Loong presold the fins for an amount almost equal to the fine against it. NOAA then initiated a civil forfeiture action with the bond substituting for the fins.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from <b>shark</b> <b>fins</b> obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple <b>shark</b> <b>fins</b> in the snow and escape.

5|$|During the 7th century CE, a settled {{community}} {{known as}} Vijayapura, a tributary to the Srivijaya empire, {{was thought to}} have existed in northwest Borneo. The earliest kingdom, supposed to have existed from the 9th century, was Po Ni, as recorded in the Chinese geographical treatise Taiping Huanyu Ji. It was believed that Po Ni existed {{at the mouth of}} Brunei River and was the predecessor to the Bruneian Empire. As China had been under the conquest of Mongol Empire, all Chinese vassal state subsequently controlled by the Mongol emperors of China. Early in 1292, Kublai Khan is said to have sending an expedition to northern Borneo, before departing for the invasion of Java in 1293. As a result of this campaign, it is believed that many of his followers in addition to other Chinese traders eventually settled and established their own colony at Kinabatangan River. In the 14th century, Brunei became the vassal state of Majapahit but in 1370 transferred its allegiance to Ming dynasty of China. The Maharaja Karna of Borneo then paid a visit to Nanjing with his family until his death. He was succeeded by his son Hsia-wang who agreed to send tribute to China once every three years. Since then, Chinese junks came to northern Borneo with cargoes of spices, bird nests, <b>shark</b> <b>fins,</b> camphor, rattan and pearls. More Chinese traders eventually settled in Kinabatangan, as stated in both Brunei and Sulu records. A younger sister of Huang Senping (Ong Sum Ping), the Governor of the Chinese settlement then married Sultan Ahmad of Brunei. Perhaps due to this relationship, a burial place with 2,000 wooden coffins, some estimated to be 1,000 years old, were discovered in Agop Batu Tulug Caves and around the Kinabatangan Valley area. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to northern Borneo as similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. In addition with the discovery of Chinese ceramics from a shipwreck in Tanjung Simpang Mengayau which estimated to be from 960–1127 A.D. of Song dynasty and Vietnamese Đông Sơn drum in Bukit Timbang Dayang on Banggi Island that had existed between 2,000–2,500 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Shark finning is a {{worldwide}} issue that involves {{cutting off the}} fins of sharks. This is done while the shark is still alive followed {{by the rest of}} the body being thrown back into the ocean, leaving it to die days after. Used in countries like China and Japan, <b>shark</b> <b>fins</b> are a key ingredient in the world-renowned meal, shark fin soup. The high demand for this particular type of soup has skyrocketed in the last few decades and sells for around $100 on average and is often catered at special occasions such as weddings and banquets. Due to the increased want for these <b>shark</b> <b>fins,</b> traders seek out the fins in order to make a profit. However, the fins are the only part of the shark that fishermen seek out to retrieve due to the low economical value of the actual shark meet. This recently exposed issue along with other overfishing issues has brought upon roughly 80 percent of the shark population decline. It has become prominent concern in marine conservation activism for millions of sharks are killed yearly at an often-unregulated expense.|$|E

25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves.

The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The <b>shark</b> <b>fins</b> {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries.
