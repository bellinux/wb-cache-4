2500|$|The {{project was}} {{inspired}} by correspondence between Public.Resource.Org's founder Carl Malamud and a Nagoya University academic, who was threatened by lawyers representing the HLRA over plans to incorporate the Bluebook system into the open source citation management program Zotero. Sprigman {{has argued that the}} system of citation expressed in the Bluebook was effectively public domain because its mandated usage in courts made it an [...] "edict of government", and because, barring trivial changes, the then-current 19th edition was nearly identical to the public domain 10th edition. Sprigman stated that the project's main goal was to allow the Bluebook's system of citation to be widely available at no cost, and allow others to collaborate on it under an open <b>source</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Unlike multiple-dipole modeling, {{distributed}} source models {{divide the}} source space into a grid containing {{a large number}} of dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for the grid nodes. As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of MEG sensors, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined, so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution. The primary advantage of this approach is that no prior specification of the <b>source</b> <b>model</b> is necessary. However, the resulting distributions may be difficult to interpret, because they only reflect a [...] "blurred" [...] (or even distorted) image of the true neuronal source distribution. The matter is {{complicated by the fact that}} spatial resolution depends strongly on several parameters such as brain area, depth, orientation, number of sensors etc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most of {{existing}} approaches for test cases generation to transformation mechanisms use a main criterion {{which is the}} coverage of source and target metamodel elements. However, this criterion is not sufficient in a real-world scenario. In fact, test-cases generated to cover meta-model elements cannot detect some transformation errors due to model-scalability reasons. These generated test cases are simple and different, in general, from <b>source</b> <b>models</b> {{that are used in}} an industrial setting. To make the situation worse, <b>source</b> <b>models</b> cannot be provided by industrial companies due to security/confidentiality reasons. Instead of real data (<b>source</b> <b>models),</b> corporations can provide structural information about their <b>source</b> <b>models</b> (e. g. number of classes, number of relationships, etc.). We propose a search-based approach for generating test cases based on the coverage of structural information in addition to meta-models coverage. The validation results on a transformation mechanism used by an industrial partner confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

40|$|Food and {{agribusiness}} multinational enterprises are redesigning their sourcing {{strategies to}} tap into the underused food production potential of small-scale farms in a way that improve farmers' livelihood. The problem is that current widely applied <b>sourcing</b> <b>models</b> do not include improvement of livelihood of the producers/farmers. The present article explores the applicability of a sustainable smallholder <b>sourcing</b> <b>model</b> with a list of critical success factors, in which business objectives and corporate social responsibility perspectives are combined. To this end, the black soybean supply chain in Java/Indonesia is studied. It was found that the black soybean case can be conceptualized by the <b>sourcing</b> <b>model.</b> Most of the critical success factors were present, but also some differences were identified. The differences enable to fine-tune some critical success factors. The sustainable <b>sourcing</b> <b>model</b> can help in (re-) designing sourcing strategies to secure sustainable and more equitable supply from small-scale farmers from a business perspective. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis covers different aspects of EEG and ERP <b>source</b> <b>modeling.</b> Both basic research in volume conduction and <b>source</b> <b>modeling,</b> as well as application of inverse <b>source</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques to experimental data are described. This thesis demonstrates how prior information can be applied in physical models that are used for source analysis of the EEG. It shows that realistic volume conduction models can be used that incorporate holes in the skull. The accurate placement of electrodes for high-density EEG measurements is described. It discusses how information on symmetry of sources in the brain can be used, and what the influence of incorrectly assumed symmetry in the sources is. The application of prior information on source locations is demonstrated in a forward modeling approach. A high-resolution EEG experiment is described to which source analysis was applied, making use of the prior information available in this experiment. In general, this thesis demonstrates that the application of <b>source</b> <b>modeling</b> can provide valuable information in EEG analysi...|$|R

40|$|Model transformations are an {{integral}} part of model-driven development. Incremental updates are a key execution scenario for transformations in model-based systems, and are especially important for the evolution of such systems. This paper presents a strategy for the incremental maintenance of declarative, rule-based transformation executions. The strategy involves recording dependencies of the transformation execution on information from <b>source</b> <b>models</b> and from the transformation definition. Changes to the <b>source</b> <b>models</b> or the transformation itself can then be directly mapped to their effects on transformation execution, allowing changes to target models to be computed efficiently. This particular approach has many benefits. It supports changes to both <b>source</b> <b>models</b> and transformation definitions, it can be applied to incomplete transformation executions, and a priori knowledge of volatility can be used to further increase the efficiency of change propagation...|$|R
