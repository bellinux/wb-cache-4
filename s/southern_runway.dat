25|$|On 2 May 2015, {{aircraft}} {{departing from}} Schönefeld {{became the first}} commercial flights to use the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport, which temporarily became Schönefeld's only runway while its own, which will become the northern runway of the new airport, was renovated.|$|E
2500|$|Construction for Stage One {{started in}} November 2007. However, Stage Two will likely see the runway {{lengthened}} to [...] which will enable domestic jet flights to use it. Stage Three (final stage) will lengthen the runway to , allowing medium-sized international jet flights to land there, from destinations {{such as the}} Pacific Islands or Australia. Eventually a new domestic terminal will also be built to the north to better utilize the new runway. The new runway will thus free up the longer <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> to handle more heavy jet operations. The 10-year project would cost NZ$120 million, not including substantial extensions planned for the airport arrivals/departure buildings and associated structures.|$|E
2500|$|Opened in 1986, Terminal 4 is {{situated}} {{to the south}} of the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> next to the cargo terminal and is connected to Terminals 1, 2 and 3 by the Heathrow Cargo Tunnel. The terminal has an area of [...] and is now home to the SkyTeam alliance, with the exception of Garuda Indonesia, Middle East Airlines, and Delta Air Lines which use Terminal 3, and to some unaffiliated carriers. It has undergone a £200m upgrade to enable it to accommodate 45 airlines with an upgraded forecourt to reduce traffic congestion and improve security. Most flights that go to Terminal 4 are flights coming from Asia and North Africa, as well as a few flights to Europe. An extended check-in area with renovated piers and departure lounges and a new baggage system were installed, and two new stands were built to accommodate the Airbus A380; Etihad Airways, Malaysia Airlines and Qatar Airways operate regular A380 flights.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport is}} the former site of CFB Chatham, a {{military}} air base, which closed in 1996, after military units were moved to other bases. There is one abandoned runway within the airport which is still used for local glider operations. The two <b>southern</b> <b>runways</b> (04/22 and 15/33) were truncated by the southern boundary fence parallel to the main runway and one (15/33) {{was used as a}} drag strip and the other (04/22) is an industrial area but the current status is unknown. The top of 04/22 is now taxiway 'B' which was where the ready hangars for the McDonnell CF-101 Voodoos were, leading to the threshold of runway 27.|$|R
50|$|The Terminal 5 {{building}} is on a 260 ha {{site on the}} western side of the airport, between the western ends of the northern and <b>southern</b> <b>runways.</b> The site was previously occupied by the Perry Oaks sewage works and an area of smallholdings called Burrows Hill Close Estate, and is east of the M25 motorway; see also Heathrow (hamlet). Two artificial watercourses, the Longford River and the Duke of Northumberland's River, originally ran through the middle of the site. Most of the terminal is in the ecclesiastical parish of Harmondsworth. The southern section, including the train station, is in the ecclesiastical parish of Stanwell. The whole area is in the London Borough of Hillingdon.|$|R
25|$|Terminal 5 {{lies between}} the {{northern}} and <b>southern</b> <b>runways</b> at {{the western end of}} the Heathrow site and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 March 2008, some 19 years after its inception. It opened to the public on 27 March 2008, and British Airways and its partner company Iberia have exclusive use of this terminal. The first passenger to enter Terminal 5 was a UK ex-pat from Kenya who passed through security at 04:30 on the day. He was presented with a boarding pass by the British Airways CEO Willie Walsh for the first departing flight, BA302 to Paris. During the two weeks after its opening, operations were disrupted by problems with the terminal's IT systems, coupled with insufficient testing and staff training, which caused over 500 flights to be cancelled. Until March 2012, Terminal 5 was exclusively used by British Airways as its global hub; however, because of the merger, on 25 March Iberia's operations at Heathrow were moved to the terminal, making it the home of International Airlines Group.|$|R
50|$|The newly-built <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> has {{a length}} of 4000 m and was officially {{commissioned}} 31 May 2012. Rampant blackouts of the runway beacon of the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> led to investigations concerning air traffic security.|$|E
5000|$|Late 1960s: The cargo {{terminal}} {{was built to}} the south of the <b>southern</b> <b>runway,</b> connected to Terminals 1, 2 and 3 by the Heathrow Cargo Tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Since 2015, {{those two}} runways {{have been used}} to access the Schönefeld airport. The {{northern}} position of the terminal makes for increased taxiing times when using the <b>southern</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|E
50|$|The airport resides at an {{elevation}} of 33 ft above mean sea level. It has a 2000 x 40 m asphalt paved runway (15/33) with a parallel taxiway. Currently, only 700 m is used, because of a road over the <b>runways</b> <b>southern</b> end where former Air Force revetments can be seen.|$|R
50|$|On June 5, 2007 Broward County commissioners voted six {{to three}} {{in favor of}} {{extending}} the <b>southern</b> 10R/28L <b>runway.</b> The proposal looks to extend the runway to 8,000 ft {{in order to accommodate}} larger aircraft and to allow airplanes to land side by side at the same time. The proposal was approved by the FAA and expansion of the south runway is now complete, {{with the opening of the}} runway in September 2014. The crosswind runway (13/31) was decommissioned on May 6, 2013. All four terminals, now having 57 gates, will have 97 with the completion of a new long-haul international Terminal Four and Concourse A at Terminal One. By 2020, Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood is projected to handle 36 million passengers annually.|$|R
50|$|An {{industrial}} estate now occupies {{much of the}} former residential area for the base. In the late 1990s, Richmond River Shire Council sought approval from the Department of Transport to subdivide land for residential development at the <b>southern</b> end of <b>runway</b> 14/32. Whilst this {{was approved by the}} department, there is substantial evidence and opinion that it was not in accordance with the original intention of the Airport Local Ownership Agreement. The residential estates encroached upon existing noise contours and led to council shortening the available distance of the runway and restricting the size and type of aircraft operations. The actions of council have also been criticised by veteran's groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} runway of BER is the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> {{of the old}} Schönefeld Airport, and {{has been}} in use since the 1960s. To adapt to the new airport, it has been renovated and lengthened from 3000 to 3600 m.|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} {{airport in}} Schönefeld will be greatly expanded {{to the south}} from its current state to allow this. In fact, the new airport will only have the current <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> (the new designated northern runway) {{in common with the}} existing airport.|$|E
50|$|On 2 May 2015, {{aircraft}} {{departing from}} Schönefeld {{became the first}} commercial flights to use the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport, which temporarily became Schönefeld's only runway while its own, which will become the northern runway of the new airport, was renovated.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 Dubai Airports {{announced}} an 80-day runway refurbishment program which started on 1 May 2014 and was completed on 21 July 2014. The northern runway was resurfaced while lighting upgrades and additional taxiways were {{built on the}} <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> to help boost its capacity. The <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> was closed from 1 May to 31 May 2014, while the northern runway was closed from 31 May to 20 July 2014. Due to extra congestion on one runway, all freighter, charter and general aviation flights were diverted to Al Maktoum International Airport. Flights at DXB were reduced by 26 percent and 14 airlines moved to Al Maktoum International Airport whilst the runways works were being done. Emirates cut 5000 flights and grounded over 20 aircraft during the period.|$|E
50|$|Under normal {{operations}} {{the agreement}} prohibited take-off {{on the northern}} runway towards the east (over London) because of the proximity of Cranford to {{the east end of}} this runway; however this runway could be used in exceptional cases, for example when the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> was not available for departures or when departure delays are excessive.|$|E
50|$|In 1962 it {{was decided}} to build an even larger {{terminal}} with a capacity of 30 million passengers per year. Work on this terminal began in 1965. The <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> was extended to 3750 m in 1964. In 1970 a new hangar was inaugurated; this accommodated six jet aircraft and was the world's largest hangar at the time.|$|E
50|$|Heathrow Terminal 4 is {{an airport}} {{terminal}} at Heathrow Airport, the main airport serving London, United Kingdom, situated {{to the south}} of the <b>southern</b> <b>runway,</b> next to the cargo terminal. It is connected to Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3 by the vehicular Heathrow Cargo Tunnel, and by rail with the Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station and Heathrow Terminal 4 railway station.|$|E
5000|$|The airport's two runways form a [...] "V" [...] (with {{the tip of}} the [...] "V" [...] {{pointing}} west). A plan {{exists to}} build two more runways, each paralleling one existing runway. The one alongside the existing <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> will be built first. No date has been set (the expectation is that construction of the third runway would begin around 2015).|$|E
5000|$|Mareeba Airfield [...] is an {{airfield}} located [...] {{south of}} Mareeba, Queensland, Australia. Built in 1942 as a US Army Air Force base during World War II, the airfield had two runways, with a complement of taxiways, hardstands and a containment area. After the war, {{much of the}} airfield reverted to agricultural use, while the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> remains as an active airfield.|$|E
50|$|The Truckee Meadows of Washoe County {{starts at}} the furthest <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>runway</b> of Reno Tahoe International Airport, GPS Coordinates 39.468836,-119.770912 and runs south east. Rattle Snake Mountain at Huffaker Park, follows the span of Steamboat Creek to the southern east end of Washoe County. This {{is the last of}} the range/prairie and wild grass water shed from the eastern range of the Reno Tahoe basin.|$|E
50|$|The airside {{construction}} works are progressing {{well with the}} City’s construction contractor, Ertech, well advanced with earthworks on the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> extension, new Code 4E apron and associated taxiways. New security fencing has also been installed to enclose the expanded airport boundary. An asphalt batching plant {{has been set up}} on site with pavement construction on the runway, apron and taxiways commencing in April and continuing until the cooler weather and winter rains arrive.|$|E
50|$|Early 1980s: By now, annual {{passenger}} numbers {{had increased}} to 30 million, and required more terminal space. As a result, Terminal 4 was constructed {{to the south}} of the <b>southern</b> <b>runway,</b> on the site of farm or farms called Mayfields and Mayfield Farm, next to the existing cargo terminal and away from the three older terminals with connections to Terminals 1, 2 and 3 provided by the existing Heathrow Cargo Tunnel.(Google Earth ground view) Some open land between Staines Road and Stanwell Road is still called Mayfield Farm.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{occupied}} by the Japanese in April 1942, and by 10 October 1943, the Japanese had built a large complex with two runways: a western runway of 4,500 ft and a second <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> was 6,200 ft x 340 ft. There were 24 larger bomber revetments {{to the west of}} the strip, and an additional 27 to the east of the field, connected by taxiways to the two runways. Anti-aircraft defenses included 4 light guns that were later upgraded. The airfields were badly cratered by American bomber raids.|$|E
50|$|On May 17, 2012 an Air Dolomiti ATR 72-500 {{operating}} on flight EN-1912/LH-1912 from Munich to Venice returned to Munich after the right engine {{shut down and}} smoke was discovered in both cockpit and cabin. Shortly after touchdown the plane deviated from the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> {{and came to a}} standstill about 80 metres (262 feet) into the grass covered side strip. The nose gear is reported to have collapsed in the process. Of the 58 passengers and four crew members aboard, five passengers are reported to have received minor injuries.|$|E

50|$|It {{rises in}} Macclesfield Forest {{at the western}} end of the Peak District, and can be seen in spring form, from the Buxton to Macclesfield road. The stream then descends the 10 mi through Macclesfield and Wilmslow where it has a {{confluence}} with the River Dean, near to Styal Prison. For the following 10 mi it defines the southwestern portion of the border between Greater Manchester and Cheshire before merging with the River Mersey north of Lymm. It flows through the Styal country park and was used in the cotton calico factory there, Quarry Bank Mill, as a source of power. Near to the Quarry Bank Mill site there is a natural weir. The Bollin is culverted underneath the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> of Manchester Airport.|$|E
5000|$|The Truckee Meadows area is {{the second}} largest {{population}} center in Nevada. Based on Topographical mapping data from the USGS, Truckee Meadows is located in Washoe County and starts at the furthest <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> of Reno Tahoe International Airport (GPS Coordinates 39.468836,-119.770912), The Truckee Meadows encompasses Rattle Snake Mountain at Huffaker Park, following the span of Steamboat Creek to the southern east end of Washoe and Storey County ending {{at the base of}} the Virginia Highlands.

5000|$|The {{new airport}} is {{designed}} for around 13 million passengers per year and will receive 12 fingerdocks. The construction company is China International Fund, {{which was founded in}} Hong Kong in 2003. The Chinese have also built a large new construction village named Vila Chinesa, meaning [...] "Chinese village", with accommodation for workers and materials depots, east of Luanda in Viana.Since {{the end of the civil}} war in 2002, the pace of economic growth in Angola has accelerated. To link the increasing international business with the rest of the world and to secure the drastic increase in logistics networks in Angola, the construction of a new, large international airport was necessary.The modern passenger terminal occupies 160 000 square metres of land and the cargo terminal is 6 200 square metres in size and would have a capacity of 35 000 tonnes of cargo per year. Two runways will be built. The northern runway is 4 200 meters long, while the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> will be 3 800 meters long, both measuring 60 meters in width. The date of commissioning was scheduled for 2010, but will be delayed considerably. Construction work was suspended at the end of 2007, due to financial revaluation by the Angolan government. The construction costs, which are pre-financed entirely by China, will be around US$ 3,8 billion (2015).|$|E
40|$|Pinang Kampai Airport Dumai City serves {{domestic}} flights, {{and home}} base for BNP-B (National Board for Disaster Management) helicopters. The noise level {{is influenced by}} the flight activity when monitoring the area of Dumai City Fire Area around it. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the noise intensity at the airport and surrounding residential areas, the duration of noise exposure, and the mapping of the noise dispersal pattern. Noise measurement method based on KepMenLH No 48 / 1996, and the device in use is Sound Level Meter (SLM). Measurement of sound pressure level (Leq) lasts for two days on weekdays and holidays. Based on the results of data processing of 8 measurement points conducted on weekdays and holidays, the results show the highest noise level is on the <b>southern</b> <b>runway</b> area on the working day of 100. 8 dB and on the holiday of 101. 0 dB (exceeding the standard quality of 85 dB, Kepmenaker No. 51 / 1999) and the highest noise level in the residential area around the airport on weekdays are in the eastern settlement of 82. 41 dB and on holidays of 86. 59 dB which overall exceeds the 55 dB determined standard, KepMenLH No. 48 / 1996). Noise control can be done by making noise barrier and using noise-absorbing materials on building construction...|$|E
40|$|Megalopolises in the Pearl River Delta, {{including}} Guangzhou and Hong Kong, {{have experienced}} various degree of ground subsidence. The causes {{can be divided}} into two categories: natural subsidence and the human-induced subsidence. Monitoring the ground subsidence can not only help people to find out the distributions in both spatial and temporal fields, but also guide people to minimize the hazard ahead. Thus, it is significant to monitor the ground subsidence accurately, timely and frequently. This dissertation research uses the Environmental Satellite Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ENVISAT ASAR) data received at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Satellite Remote Sensing Receiving Station and SAR Interferometry (InSAR) technology as a powerful tool for large-scale ground deformation monitoring in Guangzhou and Hong Kong areas. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) method is used to detect ground deformation in the urban area of Guangzhou city. A ground deformation rate map with scattered distribution of point targets shows the maximum subsidence (rise) rate as high as - 26 to - 20 mma- 1 (16 - 21 mma- 1), implying that the study area is an active zone for ground deformation. Based on the point target map, a contour ground deformation rate map is generated. All the six ground collapse accidents that occurred in 2007 - 2008 fall within the subsidence zones, qualitatively validating the IPTA results. Ground subsidence and geological conditions on Datansha Island are examined. The results indicate that the local geological conditions and underground engineering projects are responsible for ground subsidence and ground collapse accidents occurred there. To interpret the distribution of active ground subsidence zones, a local geological map is used as a reference for generating a series of thematic maps. The results show that geological faults, rock distribution, over-development, and underground engineering projects may be four factors leading to the distribution of the active ground subsidence zones. The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) was built on a site of 12. 5 km 2, of which 75 % is reclaimed foundation. Thus, the stability of ground foundation of HKIA is of public concern. I use the PSI method and ENVISAT ASAR data to detect the residual settlement rate from 19 April 2006 to 9 January 2008. I use ground truth data to develop empirical correction models for correcting systematic biases in the ASAR PSI-detected settlement rate. The corrected data follow the Lorentz distribution well, implying that the residual settlement process is dominated by two modes or categories of settlement rates. I find unreasonable positive values of the ASAR PSI-detected annual ground settlement rate, which follow a normal distribution. I draw a scatter plot with ground deformation rate value and coherence value of each point targets. Point targets with lower coherence values and greater positive values are extracted and drawn on a geographical map. Most of these point targets are located at the airport Midfield, which is under construction. A ground settlement rate map of HKIA shows that an area of the Passenger Terminal Building, and an area of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Runway</b> are two relatively stable areas, and one major continuous settlement area covers the airport Midfield. General spatial distribution patterns of ASAR PSI-detected ground settlement rate agree well with model-predicted residual settlement rates. Zhao, Qing. Adviser: Lin Hui.
