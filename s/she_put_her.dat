25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Franck, who was {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} feminist, was uncomfortable being {{in the shadow of}} her famous husband and wanted to be recognized for her own work. In 1970, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London planned to stage Franck's first solo exhibition: when she saw that the invitations included her husband's name and said he would be present at the launch, she cancelled the show. Franck once said that <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> husband's career ahead of her own. In 2003 Franck and her daughter launched the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation to promote Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, and in 2004 Franck became its president.|$|E

25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E
25|$|Carolyne Larrington {{takes an}} {{interesting}} {{look into the}} comparative amount of power Gunnhild held, {{as well as her}} overall role as queen within the Norwegian court. Queenship as a concept emerged relatively late in Norway, and as Larrington points out, the most powerful women in Norwegian history were usually king's mothers rather than kings' wives. Gunnhild acts {{as one of the most}} important partial exceptions to this rule, as she was influential during both Eirík's and her sons' rules. Gunnhild became increasingly politically active in her own right after her husband, Eirík, died in battle, after which she later returned to Norway where <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> sons in power, and her son Harald on the throne. Gunnhild also arranged her daughter's marriage to the strategically important Earl of Orkney, displaying her awareness for political advantage. Gunnhild remained resilient to maintain power for the rest of her life, acting as Queen Regent to her son Harald, and continuing to be a major deciding factor and source for political advice.|$|E

500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he [...] "under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> handbag onto {{the back seat and}} brushed against [...] He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased." [...] Hodgson's confessions were {{a significant part of the}} case against him. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00a.m. on 5February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15p.m.) the same day.|$|E
500|$|In the {{afterword}} of {{the first}} Maria-sama ga Miteru light novel volume, Konno admitted that Maria-sama ga Miteru {{was very different from}} her usual genre of story-telling in Yume no Miya, which she described as an [...] "imperial story" [...] set in a fictionalized classical Japan. For the basis of Lillian Girls' Academy, Konno drew from her own experiences attending an all-girl high school, and some of the scenery of Lillian was also taken from this, such as a ginkgo pathway which stretched out from the main gate. The laid-back atmosphere of the school was also incorporated into Lillian, although Konno's school did not have a sœur system and it was not a Catholic school. Konno had been exposed to Christianity from a young age: she attended a completely Christian kindergarten which had a sanctuary and cloister {{in the middle of the}} school. Konno notes that <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> own questions about the Virgin Mary's heart into the story via Yumi. Konno ultimately mixed together various sources and ended up with Lillian Girls' Academy.|$|E
500|$|During 1843 and 1844, Seacole {{suffered}} {{a series of}} personal disasters. She and her family lost much of the boarding house in a fire in Kingston on 29 August 1843. Blundell Hall burned down, {{and was replaced by}} New Blundell Hall, which was described as [...] "better than before". Then her husband died in October 1844, followed by her mother. After a period of grief, in which Seacole says she did not stir for days, she composed herself, [...] "turned a bold front to fortune", and assumed the management of her mother's hotel. <b>She</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> rapid recovery down to her hot Creole blood, blunting the [...] "sharp edge of [...] grief" [...] sooner than Europeans who she thought [...] "nurse their woe secretly in their hearts". She absorbed herself in work, declining many offers of marriage. She later became widely known and respected, particularly among the European military visitors to Jamaica who often stayed at Blundell Hall. She treated patients in the cholera epidemic of 1850, which killed some 32,000Jamaicans. Seacole attributed the outbreak to infection brought on a steamer from New Orleans, Louisiana, demonstrating knowledge of contagion theory. This first-hand experience would benefit her during the next five years.|$|E

500|$|Laura Fissinger from South Florida Sun-Sentinel {{felt that}} [...] "'Virgin Tour' {{establishes}} Madonna {{more as a}} bimbo, rather than the strong, independent woman people think her to be."

[...] Richard Defendorf of Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review, saying [...] "Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' was very enjoyable and <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> music video charms in her live performances." [...] Maya Hathoray from The Miami Herald said that [...] "We know [...] sexy, exotically beautiful and her funk/pop songs make us want to dance, but on stage, she is extremely tame compared to her raw persona in her music videos. She is like daddy's little girl." [...] Mary Edgar Smith from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed that [...] "It was obvious from the apparel of the young girls at last week's Virgin Tour concerts in Tampa and Orlando, Fla., that the 26-year-old singer [...] had more {{to give to the}} music world than what others suggest. She will be {{a force to be reckoned}} with." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of dress-up and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song." [...] Paul Grein from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's show was stylish, well-paced and consistently entertaining." ...|$|E

Adelle Platon of Vibe magazine praised Beyoncé's look in a [...] "stunning" [...] white gown [...] "belting {{against a backdrop of}} worldly images". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard wrote that the images of global volunteer efforts during the video were [...] "striking". Peter Kirn from Create Digital Motion commented that the powerful projection used in the video [...] "can make imagery big enough that it invites big thinking — and debate". Kirn concluded that [...] "In the end, you see a performance in which neither Beyoncé nor the imagery upstages the other – it’s two powerful performances, not just one."|publisher=Create Digital Motion|first=Peter|last=Kirn|date=August 28, 2012|accessdate=August 23, 2013}} The Huffington Posts Sarah Dean described the video as inspiring while [...] "shining a spotlight on humanitarian work".
