40|$|Recycling {{processes}} {{that take place}} {{after the end of}} the useful lifetime of a product generate secondary raw materials to substitute primary ones. This is a step towards sustainable development. Recycling processes proceed during a short period compared to the lifetime of a product of up to several decades. Recycling involves costs, specific to processing and materials. The comparison of recycling and utilization of a product leads to an investigation of the influence of the intended use on the cost of recycling. To analyse this relationship and to identify cost relevant aspects, different kinds of recycling are explained and characterized by their mass relevance. The connection of recycling and product use is based on dispersion. Dispersion means the distribution of materials within the environment and can be analysed according to the three categories material, time and place which can also interact. The mass stream of copper has been selected to analyse the quantitative aspects of dispersion. The total of all copper considered for four different product applications is made available for the recycling process as the so-called copper deposit. For a more detailed analysis of the product specific and dispersion related costs of recycling, attention is focussed on the waste sector of electric and electronic equipment and here, in special, on white goods. Washing machines have been experimentally prepared for recycling purposes. The common recycling method for washing machines is the use of car shredders. The shredding technique combined with an airflow separation is explained and experimentally applied on the laboratory scale of a technical school. The shredding process combined with a magnetic separation creates three output fractions: iron products, the non-ferrous metal fraction and the <b>shredder</b> <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> (<b>SLF).</b> The cost structure of recycling is described by the determination of the SLF fraction as a function of the age of the washing machines and by the composition of the product masses. A special SLF indicator is defined. The total mixture of raw materials in the shredder - old cars, electrical goods and further scrap - is of importance for environmental and economic reasons. Different legislative directives become relevant for the shredding process; laws for end-of-life-vehicles concern also electrical products. The definition of processing and recycling quotas by law influences the choice of recycling techniques and input materials and proves to be cost effective. Calculations and analyses of recycling situations are presented and point out the relevance of the SLF indicator...|$|E
5000|$|The {{shredding}} {{of automobiles}} and major household appliances {{is a process}} where a hammermill acts as a giant tree chipper by grinding the materials fed into it to fist-size pieces. The shredding of automobiles results {{in a mixture of}} ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal (e.g. alloys of copper and aluminium) and shredder waste, called automotive shredder residue or automobile shredder residue (ASR). ASR consists of glass, fiber, rubber, automobile liquids, plastics and dirt. ASR is sometimes differentiated into <b>shredder</b> <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> and dust.

40|$|Pre-processing is {{a crucial}} step to ensure the {{efficiency}} of subsequent processes {{and the quality of}} recyclates. The efficiency of pre-processing can be affected by high losses to undesignated output fractions. Standard batch tests usually provide mass balances and are a good proxy for bulk materials balances (iron/steel, aluminum, plastics). This article aims at harmonizing methodologies and recommends a strategy for further study in pre-processing on a plant scale. We have developed an “extended batch test” method, which should help to • describe the fates of materials and elements, • assess the quality of output fractions, • identify access points for critical metals and other valuable elements to enable their recovery. A methodical approach was compiled with common material flow analysis methods and an extended set of methods, which improve the reliability via the assessment of uncertainties. This applies to systematic effects and random effects. This extended batch test was performed with a 40 Mg Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE) batch to trace the flows of industrial base metals, precious metals and critical metals in a WEEE pre-processing plant. Results show that one-third of the input was separated and sorted manually, while the remaining material was subsequently crushed and automatically sorted. Copper and precious metals are distributed to various output fractions but are most concentrated in the sorting residues. Critical metals like cobalt and rare earth elements are mainly concentrated in the manually sorted materials but also appear in the ferrous metals scrap and the <b>shredder</b> <b>light</b> <b>fraction...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lasting economizing is {{the only}} {{peaceful}} possibility for ensuring human life on Earth. Recycling of materials only contributes to lasting economizing if less resources and energy are required than for primary materials. Materials which have been collected and sorted after products have been disassemled result in secondary, tertiary etc. products with virtually the same properties as the primary materials. Non-specific material cycles connected with large scale processes e. g. shredders, hydrogenation, mixed waste recycling result in recycled goods of interior quality and costs which are greater {{than those of the}} primary materials. In contrast to metals, paper and glass, synthetic materials from products (e. g. televisions, surfboards, cars, washing machines etc.) especially require and permit differentiated recycling paths. Production waste: For decades now the sorted production waste generated during production, has been reintroduced to the production process of new products at the pr oduction location itself if financially interesting. At the same time {{this is one of the}} great advantages of synthetic materials when compared with other materials. Production waste made of steel, aluminium, glass and paper must be returned to the blast furnace, melting house or slurry. Specific synthetic material cycles: e. g. SMC, PVC window frames and floors, PET bottles, polystyrene, PE and PP disposable syringes, HDPE fuel tanks, PA 66 car suction pipes etc. Specific recycling processes: e. g. supercritical hydrooxidation for electronics waste and <b>shredder</b> <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> alcoholysis for polyurethane. Non-specific recycling processes for organic raw materials: e. g. hydrogenation, high temperature gas generation, thermoselect process etc. Non-specific disposal procedures: e. g. shredders for synthetic materials (<b>light</b> <b>fraction)</b> lead to incineration or to the disposal site, because the costs for separating and sorting the mass synthetic materials are greater than the kilogram prices of the new materials. The selection of the optimum recycling of materials in the framework of lasting economizing takes place via integral accounting and evaluations...|$|R

The fractions differed from {{one another in the}} following ways. (a) The isopycnic density of the heavy fraction was between 1. 15 and 1. 18 gm/ml and that of the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was 1. 14 gm/ml. (b) The heavy fraction was able to bind ribosomes; the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was not. (c) The <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and had a sedimentation constant, extrapolated to infinite dilution, of 153 s 20,w. The heavy fraction was grossly heterogeneous. (d) Both the amount of bacteriochlorophyll relative to protein and the ratio of bacteriochlorophyll to carotenoids were greater in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction.</b> (e) The spectra of the two fractions in the near infra-red were different. Comparisons of the chromatophore fractions from cells with different amounts of bacteriochlorophyll showed that the specific bacteriochlorophyll contents of the two fractions did not change to the same extent as did that of the whole cells. The amount of heavy fraction from pigmented cells was roughly independent of the cellular pigment content and was about equal to that from pigment-free cells. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> depended on the pigment content of the cells; no <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was obtained from cells devoid of bacteriochlorophyll. The cytochrome complements of both fractions underwent quantitative as well as qualitative changes with varying growth conditions.

30|$|Removal of {{the heavier}} THC {{fractions}} (C 12 –C 16 and C 16 –C 35) {{and the total}} THC followed the same trend (Fig.  1 a) and is likely due to more than 95  % total THC being found in these fractions. Even though large fluctuations were observed in the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions,</b> this {{did not affect the}} total THC removal as the initial concentrations were low. In general, higher removal efficiencies of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> (C 8 –C 10 and C 10 –C 12) were observed, in line with results of an EK study of diesel polluted soil, in which the highest degradation of the C 10 –C 16 fraction was reported (Kim et al. 2010). In the present study, degradation of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> appears to be related to stirring rate; the highest removal efficiencies observed at medium–high stirring rates (experiments 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12). In experiments 6, 7 and 10 removal efficiencies of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> were lower compared to the total removal. In experiments 6 and 7 the low stirring rates and low L/S ratios were applied indicating that not enough aeration was provided to remove the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions.</b> The difference in removal efficiencies between experiment 10 and the other 3 experiments conducted in the centre point of the continuous variables may indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of the oil pollution in the soil.|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesised}} that, during occlusion inside granular aggregates of oxide-rich soils, the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> {{organic matter}} would undergo a strong process of decomposition, either {{due to the}} slow process of aggregate formation and stabilisation or due to digestion in the macro- and meso-fauna guts. This process would favour the accumulation of recalcitrant materials inside aggregates. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the dynamics and the chemical composition of free and occluded <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic matter in a natural cerrado vegetation (woodland savannah) and a nearby pasture (Brachiaria spp.) to elucidate the transformations during occlusion of <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> in aggregates of a clayey Oxisol. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance of the 13 C, with Cross Polarisation and Magic Angle Spinning (13 C-CPMAS-NMR), and 13 C/ 12 C isotopic ratio were combined to study organic matter composition and changes in carbon dynamics, respectively. The occluded <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> had a slower turnover than the free <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> and the heavy fraction. Organic matter in the occluded fraction also showed a higher degree of decomposition. The results confirm that processes of soil organic matter occlusion in the typical "very fine strong granular" structure of the studied oxide-rich soil led to an intense transformation, selectively preserving stable organic matter. The small amount of organic material stored as occluded light faction, as well as its stability, suggests that this is not an important or manageable sink for sequestration of atmospheric CO 2...|$|R

By using the flotation method, generally two fractions are obtained from municipal post-consumer wastes: a <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> floating on water, {{and a heavy}} fraction.

In this work, the recycling of a <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> from municipal post-consumer plastics has been studied, considering also the effect of filler type - glass fibres, calcium carbonate and wood fibres - and processing apparatus - discountinous mixer, single and twin screw extruder - on the properties. Although the similar chemical nature of the two main components, polyethylene and polypropylene of the <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> the mechanical properties of the recycled mixture are quite scarce, {{mainly because of the}} incompatibility and the possible presence of some heterogeneous particles.

Due to the light gradient inside the reactor and depending on the mixing properties, algae are subjected to certain light/dark cycles where the light period is characterized by a light gradient. These light/dark cycles will determine productivity and biomass yield on light energy. Air-lift reactors can be used for microalgae cultivation and medium-frequency light/dark cycles will be found in these systems. Light/dark cycles are associated with two basic parameters: first, the <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> i. e., the ratio between the light period and the cycle time and second, the frequency of the light/dark cycle.

Since soil organic matter bound to soil mineral particles has its density lower than soil minerals, we partitioned soil organic matter into debris ( 2. 0 g cm- 3), based on high density ZnCl 2 - sucrose solutions. Generally, partitioned organic bands were clearly separated, demonstrating that the ZnCl 2 - sucrose solutions are useful for such a density gradient centrifugation. The available gradient ranges from 1. 2 to 2. 0 g cm- 3.

We conducted a field manipulative experiment which used a Latin square design with six N addition levels of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) since 2003 in a semiarid grassland in northern China.

In contrast, different N enrichment levels changed soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N, ranging from 4. 3 to 27. 7 % and 3. 3 - 30. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, both <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N had a nonlinear relationship with N addition rates, and the threshold for N-induced change in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N was near 16 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) in this semiarid grassland.

Soil microbial biomass exponentially declined with increasing N, but extractable organic C showed a positive linear response to N enrichment rates. Changes in microbial biomass C and extractable organic C were primarily due to the reduced soil pH under N addition.

40|$|Sheared {{chromatin}} prepared from chicken embryo fibroblasts and fibroblasts {{transformed by}} exogenous Rous sarcoma virus (Schmidt [...] Ruppin strain D) was separated by rate sedimentation on glycerol gradients into two components: fast-migrating (heavy chromatin <b>fraction)</b> and slow-migrating (<b>light</b> chromatin <b>fraction).</b> DNAs extracted from these fractions were assayed for proviral sequences by molecular hybridization using DNA complementary to the viral sequences. In uninfected cells, the endogenous complementary sequences {{were found to}} be equally distributed between heavy and <b>light</b> <b>fractions.</b> However, the newly integrated exogenous proviral sequences were found mostly in the <b>light</b> chromatin <b>fraction</b> in the transformed cells. Additionally, the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> was more sensitive to DNase I digestion and contains more material melting at low temperatures when compared with the heavy fraction. The results show that (i) distribution of endogenous proviral sequences is independent of chromatin conformation, and (ii) most of the newly acquired exogenous sequences are integrated within the host's chromatin fraction that exhibits properties of euchromatin. Because chromatin fragmentation and fractionation is accomplished without digestion with degrading enzymes, the chromatin fractions enriched in exogenous sequences remain intact and thus are suitable for further studies...|$|R

40|$|Wetland {{ecosystems}} are {{represented as a}} significant reservoir of organic carbon and {{play an important role}} in mitigating the greenhouse effect. In order to compare the compositions and distribution of organic carbon in constructed and natural river wetlands, sediments from the Xinxue River Constructed Wetland and the Xinxue River, China, were sampled at two depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 25 cm) in both upstream and downstream locations. Three types of organic carbon were determined: <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon, heavy fraction organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon. The results show that variations in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon are significantly larger between upstream and downstream locations than they are between the two wetland types; however, the opposite trend is observed for the dissolved organic carbon. There are no significant differences in the distribution of heavy fraction organic carbon between the discrete variables (e. g., between the two depths, the two locations, or the two wetland types). However, there are significant cross-variable differences; for example, the distribution patterns of heavy fraction organic carbon between wetland types and depths, and between wetland types and locations. Correlation analysis reveals that <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon is positively associated with <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> nitrogen in both wetlands, while heavy fraction organic carbon is associated with both heavy fraction nitrogen and the moisture content in the constructed wetland. The results of this study demonstrate that the constructed wetland, which has a relatively low background value of heavy fraction organic carbon, is gradually accumulating organic carbon of different types, with the level of accumulation dependent on the balance between carbon accumulation and carbon decomposition. In contrast, the river wetland has relatively stable levels of organic carbon...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount and}} type of carbon (C) in a forest soil {{reflects}} the past balance between C accumulation and loss. In an old-growth forest soil, C {{is thought to be}} in dynamic equilibrium between accumulations and losses. Disturbance upsets this equilibrium by altering the microclimate, the amount {{and type of}} vegetation growing on a site, and properties that affect organic matter decomposition. We measured total C and forms of soil C in the L, F, and H layers and in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> of soil organic matter in the 0 - 10 cm of mineral soil in old-, second-, and young-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) soils in the Oregon Coast Range. Total C in L, F, and H layers and in organic material in the top 10 cm of mineral soil in old-growth forests was higher than in young- or second-growth forests. Old-growth forests had a higher lignin concentration and lower concentrations of sugar, hemicellulose, and cellulose in the L, F, and H layers and in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> of organic material than second- or young-growth forests. Old-growth forests had greater amounts of fats, waxes, and oils, sugar, cellulose, and lignin, in the L, F, and H layers per square hectare and greater amounts of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> of organic matter in the 0 - 10 cm of mineral soil per square hectare than young- and second-growth forests.

40|$|Forest {{management}} and associated litter inputs and decomposition rates {{are thought to}} affect the carbon storage in mineral soils. Here, we studied the effects of forest management on soil organic carbon (OC) stocks in density fractions of Ah-horizons in soils that developed on loess. We used 82 beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominated forest plots in Thuringia, Germany that differed in their management (unmanaged forest, forests under age-class {{management and}} forests under selection cutting forest). After density fractionation of the mineral soil with a 1. 6 g cm 3 polytungstate solution we determined OC concentrations and stocks as well as CN-ratios in the free (f-LF) <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> the occluded (o-LF) <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> and in the mineral associated organic matter (MOM) fraction. In our study, Ah-horizons of beech forests stored on average 2. 6 ± 0. 2 kg m 2 (38. 7 ± 1. 3 kg m 3) OC. The results showed that 37 % of the bulk soil OC was stored in the <b>light</b> <b>fractions.</b> We could show that OC stocks in the <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> were significantly affected {{by the amount of}} C stored in organic layers (p = 0. 011). The OC stocks in the organic layers, in turn, were higher in unmanaged forests and in forests under selection cutting. This suggests a sensitivity of unprotected OC in the f-LF of beech forests against forest management. In contrast to the f-LF, the OC stocks in the MOM fraction are mainly controlled by pedogenic properties such as clay and iron oxide content. Even after several decades of forest management and with large sample size, an effect of forest management on the stable MOM fraction could not be detecte...|$|R

Examining these differential soil C fractions in response to N enrichment is helpful for better understanding soil C changes under the predominantly increasing N deposition. In this study, we used a field N addition experiment in a grassland to explore the effects of various N enrichment levels on soil C fractions. 	 	We conducted a field manipulative experiment which used a Latin square design with six N addition levels of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) since 2003 in a semiarid grassland in northern China. Soil samples were collected in August (when plants have the greatest biomass), 2011. We measured C and N concentrations in soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> microbial biomass, extractable organic matter, heavy fraction, and total soil C and N. 	 	The results showed that total soil C and N, and heavy fraction C and N were not significantly affected by N addition after 9 years of treatments. In contrast, different N enrichment levels changed soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N, ranging from 4. 3 to 27. 7 % and 3. 3 - 30. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, both <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N had a nonlinear relationship with N addition rates, and the threshold for N-induced change in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N was near 16 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) in this semiarid grassland. Increases of soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N primarily resulted from changes in biotic (N-stimulated aboveground biomass) and abiotic (soil temperature, moisture and pH) factors under N enrichment. Soil microbial biomass exponentially declined with increasing N, but extractable organic C showed a positive linear response to N enrichment rates. Changes in microbial biomass C and extractable organic C were primarily due to the reduced soil pH under N addition. 	 	Our findings suggest that various soil C fractions differentially respond to elevated N, because different sets of biotic and abiotic factors regulate those fractions under N enrichment. </p...|$|R
