5|$|Modern Life Is Rubbish is {{the second}} studio album by the English {{alternative}} rock band Blur, released in May 1993. Although their debut album Leisure (1991) had been commercially successful, Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release, and fell out of public favour. After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States, poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band <b>Suede</b> further diminished Blur's status in the UK.|$|E

Alexis Petridis wrote in 2005, [...] "These days, rock historians tend to depict <b>Suede's</b> success {{as a kind of}} amuse bouche before the earth-shattering arrival of Britpop's main course". In an article about the British music press' [...] "ferocious one-upmanship campaign" [...] of the mid-1990s, Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian in February 1996, noted <b>Suede's</b> appearance as an unsigned band on the cover of Melody Maker as a pivotal moment in the history of Britpop: ...|$|R

Van Dijk dedicated her stage and overall win to teammate Carla Swart, who died whilst training after {{being hit by}} a truck a few weeks earlier. The price money she earned in Qatar was sent to her family. After riding stage races in the Netherlands, China and Spain she finished second at the Dutch time trial championships in Veendam and qualified for the World Championships later the year. A month later, in Sweden, she rode two World Cup races, winning the Open de <b>Suède</b> Vårgårda TTT and finishing second in the Open de <b>Suède</b> Vårgårda. As preparation for the World Championships she won the time trial at the Holland Ladies Tour. At the World Championships in Copenhagen she finished 6th in the time trial and was the best Dutch rider.

5|$|After {{years of}} {{supporting}} roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise. He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis {{has been cited}} as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol. After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny <b>Suede,</b> a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World, although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.|$|E

5|$|Oasis {{signed to}} {{independent}} record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White, {{in the midst}} of a chart rivalry with Britpop peers Blur. Along with <b>Suede,</b> Pulp, Blur and others, Oasis came to be regarded as one of the major bands of the Britpop movement and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997 Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now (1997), and although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly, but not before selling 8 million copies. McGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). After their departures, they were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist/frontman Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist/frontman Andy Bell. Their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry was released in 2002. In 2004 drummer Alan White left the band leaving them as a four-piece with addition of the Who drummer Zak Starkey as recording and touring unofficial fifth member and found renewed success and popularity with Don't Believe the Truth (2005).|$|E
