40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} an open network of processor-sharing nodes with state-dependent <b>service</b> <b>capacities,</b> i. e., {{the speed of}} each node may depend {{on the number of}} customers at any node. We demonstrate that the stationary distribution of the network state is insensitive to the distribution of service times if and only if the <b>service</b> <b>capacities</b> are balanced, i. e., the considered network is a Whittle network. The stationary distribution then has a closed-form expression and the expected sojourn time of a customer at any node is proportional to its required quantity of service. These results are extended to the cases of closed networks and state-dependent arrival rates and routing. Two simple examples illustrate the practical interest of these results in the context of communication networks...|$|R

25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, the Howard-Englewood/Jackson Park route {{was equally}} {{compatible}} in terms of passenger service until the late 1960s through the 1970s. However, passenger traffic volumes began to shift {{on the south side}} lines, with more riders using the newer Dan Ryan line (which runs four miles (6km) further south) and fewer riders on the older 'L' lines. This level of ridership allowed the CTA to develop a more efficient system by combining the more heavily used rail lines together and combining the other lines together, providing increased <b>service</b> <b>capacity</b> for the routes that need it. The Red Line was created in 1993, when the CTA adopted color-coded system for all of its 'L' routes. On February 21, 1993, a new connection opened from south of Roosevelt to Cermak-Chinatown and the Howard branch was paired with the Dan Ryan branch creating the current Red Line and the Lake Street branch was paired with the Englewood and Jackson Park branches to form the Green Line. A further operational benefit of this switch was that this freed up capacity in the Loop needed for the addition of Orange Line trains from Midway Airport.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the (non-cooperative) competition of a duopoly of make-toorder firms, each modeled by an M/M/ 1 queue. The firms post the prices they charge for service. Knowing the expected reward and the expected waiting time at each firm, potential customers choose either to receive service {{at one of the}} firms or to seek an alternative opportunity by maximizing their expected net rewards. We consider both the short-run competition and the long-run competition. In the short run, the <b>service</b> <b>capacities</b> of both firms are given, and the firms maximize their expected revenues by choosing prices only. In the long run, the rms maximize their expected profits by choosing both prices and <b>service</b> <b>capacities.</b> In the short run, a Nash equilibrium may not exist, and when it exits, it may not be unique. Given all else being the same, a firm with a larger capacity, or a higher value of service or a lower cost of waiting can charge a price premium and take a larger market share.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a non-classical discrete-time {{queueing}} model with variable service demands and variable <b>service</b> <b>capacities.</b> Specifically, {{we consider the}} case where the <b>service</b> <b>capacities</b> of the system, i. e., the numbers of work units that the system can perform during each slot, are independent from slot to slot and have an identical general distribution with finite support. New customers enter the system according to a general independent arrival process. The service demands of the customers, i. e., the numbers of work units of service that each customer requires from the system, are general independent. We present an analytical technique to analyze the behavior of this queueing system. The analysis leads to expressions for the probability generating functions and the moments of the unfinished work in the system, the queueing delay of an arbitrary customer {{and the number of}} customers in the system in steady state. We also derive approximations for the tail probabilities of the system content and the customer delay. Numerical results are included to illustrate the impact of the various model parameters on the system performance...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{scenario in which}} a large equipment manufacturer wishes to outsource the work involved in repairing purchased goods while under warranty. Several external service vendors are available for this work. We develop models and analyses to support decisions concerning how responsibility for the warranty population should be divided between them. These also allow the manufacturer to resolve related questions concerning, for example, whether the <b>service</b> <b>capacities</b> of the contracted vendors are sufficient to deliver an effective post-sales service. Static allocation models yield information concerning the proportions of the warranty population for which the vendors should be responsible overall. Dynamic allocation models enable consideration of how such overall workloads might be delivered to the vendors over time {{in a way which}} avoids excessive variability in the repair burden. We apply dynamic programming policy improvement to develop an effective dynamic allocation heuristic. This is evaluated numerically and is also used as a yardstick to assess two simple allocation heuristics suggested by static models. A dynamic greedy allocation heuristic is found to perform well. Dividing the workload equally among vendors with different <b>service</b> <b>capacities</b> can lead to serious losses. approximate dynamic programming, greedy heuristics, index policies, outsourcing, warranty repairs...|$|R
