The {{performance on the}} show featured mimed instrumental backing, with Harley performing a live vocal. On the show, Harley was <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> <b>jet-lag,</b> and subsequently forgot the lyrics {{to the majority of}} the second and third verses. According to the EMI producer of the single, Tony Clark, it was Marc Bolan who made the phone call to Top of the Pops, and had Harley in the BBC studio that same evening of the recording. The band also performed the song on the Russell Harty Show while it was at number one.|$|E

50|$|Cura {{started the}} 2005/2006 season in London {{starring}} as Puccini's outlaw hero Dick Johnson in the much-anticipated ROH production of La fanciulla del west (September). Cura then reprised {{the role of}} Roberto in Puccini's rarely staged first opera, Le Villi in Vienna (October). In January 2006, Cura returned to the stage {{in the title role}} in Andrea Chénier at Teatro Comunale di Bologna. In February, José Cura re-introduced the audience at the Liceu of Barcelona to Verdi's masterpiece, Otello, after an eighteen-year absence.After reprising his Alfredo in La Traviata and Stiffelio in the much-neglected Verdi opera of the same name, Cura became the first tenor to bring Calaf to life in the Zurich Opera's avant garde production of Puccini's Turandot. Cura reprises the role in Zurich in the 2006/2007 season and will again in 2007/2008. From Zurich, Cura traveled to Vienna to star in Le Villi, and conduct Madame Butterfly at the Vienna State Opera. In June, Cura returned to Japan to reprise the lead role in Andrea Chénier with the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. His performance was greeted with enthusiastic applause led by the Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, a noted opera lover.Cura's summer took an unexpected turn when he arrived in Verona for the first of several performances as Canio in Pagliacci: the tenor scheduled for the role of Turiddu in the double-header Cavalleria Rusticana was forced to withdraw at the last minute, leaving the Arena di Verona without a world-class tenor to sing the role. Cura responded immediately. Stepping onto the ancient Roman stones in brutal summer heat, still <b>suffering</b> the effects <b>from</b> <b>jet-lag</b> and trying to recall the role he had not sung in over six years, he repaid a debt of honor to the theater that first opened its arms to him in 1992. It was not an offer made lightly Cura became only the third tenor in 84 years of Arena history to undertake this daunting challenge. In mid-July, Cura traveled to Rijeka, Croatia, for a summer night of music making. Following an early September 2006 engagement in Vienna as Roberto in Le Villi, Cura traveled to Berlin to end the month in the Deutsche Oper's revival of La fanciulla del west. In October, Cura made a return to Turin to star as Calaf in an innovative staging of Turandot.|$|R

40|$|The {{growth rate}} of {{inflammatory}} bowel diseases among children actualizes early detection of this pathology form and its aftera effects, including secondary osteoporosis. The research purpose is to study the characteristics of osseous tissue mineralization, disorder of physical growth and sexual maturity of children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases. The researchers have examined 116 children, including 33 children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases; 26 children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> persistent colitis; 29 children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> gasatroduodenitis; and 28 children with no GI tract pathologies. The study deals with estimate of level of mineral osseous tissue density, biochemical rates of osseous metabolism, {{as well as physical}} growth and sexual maturity. reduction of mineral osseous tissue density was found among 48, 5 % of children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases, 23 % of children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> persistent colitis, 31 % of children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> chronic gastritis and 18 % of almost healthy children, at the same time, it was more apparent among children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases. The lowest rates of mineral osseous tissue density were among girls. Calcium phosphoric metabolism did not change apart from calcium creatinine coefficient, if osteopenia was observed. Thus, reduction of mineral osseous tissue density is often observed among children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases, especially among adolescent girls. Therefore, it conditions the necessity to include densimetry into the conventional examination plan for children, <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> inflammatory bowel diseases. Authors also find it advisable to monitor physical growth and sexual maturity of children. Key words: children, inflammatory bowel diseases, osteoporosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the issues related to {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, the nursing needs of patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis, the roles of a nurse while taking care of such patients, the collaboration of the nurse with physiotherapist, ergotherapist, and use of compensation aids by the patients while conducting private or self-service activities. The thesis has 4 defined goals. Goal 1 : To {{find out whether the}} patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are familiar with compensation aids. Goal 2 : To identify the areas of self-care where the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis need to use the compensation aids. Goal 3 : To determine the availability of compensation aids for the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis. Goal 4 : To find out whether the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis do have information about the compensation aids in hygienic care. All goals were met. Based on the goals, 4 hypotheses were defined. H 1 : Patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are familiar with compensation aids. This hypothesis has been confirmed. H 2 : Patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis use compensation aids most often in hygienic care. This hypothesis has not been confirmed. H 3 : Compensation aids for patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are easily available. This hypothesis has been confirmed. H 4 : Patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis have all the necessary information about compensation aids used in hygienic care. This hypothesis has been confirmed too. The survey was carried out at rheumatology clinics and at the League against Rheumatism. The data were collected in a quantitative research using the method of interview and the technique of questionnaire. All in all, 170 questionnaires were distributed among the patients. The research group contained 131 respondents. Analyzing the respondents answers, it was found out that the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis are familiar with the compensation aids in hygienic care, defecating, catering, dressing, walking, and such aids are affordable and available to them. Most patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis do not need or do not use such aids. Following the outcome of the thesis and the issues related, an information leaflet came into existence and is distributed to the patients <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> rheumatoid arthritis in order to provide them with useful information or links. The leaflet distribution through rheumatology clinics seems to be very efficient. The outcome of the thesis is to give more background information to the clients of the League against Rheumatism. Subsequently, the thesis might serve as an additional material for students in nursing training...|$|R
