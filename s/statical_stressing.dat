40|$|A task of {{simulating}} the deformation {{behavior of}} geomaterials under compression with account of over-extreme branch has been addressed. The physical nature of rock properties variability as initially inhomogeneous material {{is explained by}} superposition of deformation and structural transformations of evolutionary type within open nonequilibrium systems. Due to this the description of deformation and failure of rock is related to hierarchy of instabilities within the system being far from thermodynamic equilibrium. It is generally recognized, that the energy function of the current stress-strain state is a superposition of potential component and disturbance, which includes the imperfection parameter accounting for defects not only existing in the initial state, but also appearing under load. The equation of state has been obtained by minimizing the energy function by the order parameter. The imperfection parameter is expressed through the strength deterioration, which is viewed as the internal parameter of state. The evolution of strength deterioration has been studied {{with the help of}} Fokker â€“ Planck equation, which steady form corresponds to rock <b>statical</b> <b>stressing.</b> Here the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be constant, while the function reflecting internal sliding and loosening of the geomaterials is assumed as an antigradient of elementary integration catastrophe. Thus the equation of state is supplemented with a correlation establishing relationship between parameters of imperfection and strength deterioration. While deformation process is identified with the change of dissipative media, coupled with irreversible structural fluctuations. Theoretical studies are proven with experimental data obtained by subjecting certain rock specimens to compression...|$|E
40|$|A {{dislocation}} dynamical {{model for}} plastic deformation including increase and decrease in mobile dislocation density and increase in immobile dislocation density is proposed. The model takes account of dynamical internal stress due to mobile dislocations and <b>statical</b> internal <b>stress</b> (work hardening) due to immobile dislocations. Stress (applied stress and effective stress) -strain curves of silicon single crystals, through {{upper and lower}} yield points up to steady states of deformation, are calculated numerically by the model for various strain rates. The results of calculation agree well with the experiments by Yonenaga and Sumino [Phys. Stat. Solidi (a), 50 (1978), 685] except for upper yield points. Calculated dependence of lower yield stresses and of effective stress-strain curves after lower yield points on the initial density of dislocations also agrees with their experiments...|$|R

Methods: Compressive test of 54 osteoporotic cadaver vertebrae L 1 and L 2, 16 males and 38 females (age range 43 &ndash; 93, mean age 71. 6 &plusmn; 13. 3 years, mean bone mineral density (BMD) 0. 377 &plusmn; 0. 089 g/cm 2, mean T-score &minus; 5. 57 &plusmn; 0. 79, Z-score &minus; 4. 05 &plusmn; 0. 77) was investigated. Based on the load-displacement diagrams and the measured geometrical parameters of vertebral bodies, proportional, ultimate and yield stresses and strains, Young&rsquo;s modulus, ductility and energy absorption capacity were determined. Three vertebral regions were distinguished: superior, central and inferior regions, but certain parameters were calculated for the upper/lower intermediate layers, as well. Cross-sectional areas, and certain bone tissue parameters were determined by image analysis of CT pictures of vertebrae. Sex- and age-related decline functions and trends of strength characteristics were determined. Results: Size-corrected failure load was 15 %&ndash; 25 % smaller in women, proportional and ultimate stresses were about 30 %&ndash; 35 % smaller for women in any region, and 20 %&ndash; 25 % higher in central regions for both sexes. Young&rsquo;s moduli were about 30 % smaller in women in any region, and 20 %&ndash; 25 % smaller in the central region for both sexes. Small strains were higher in males, large strains were higher in females, namely, proportional strains were about 25 % larger in men, yield and ultimate strains were quasi equal for sexes, break strains were 10 % higher in women. Ultimate energy absorption capacity was 10 %&ndash; 20 % higher in men; the final ductile energy absorption capacity was quasi equal for sexes in all levels. Age-dependence was stronger for men, mainly in central regions (ultimate load, male: r = &minus; 0. 66, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 01, female: r = &minus; 0. 52, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 005; ultimate stress, male: r = &minus; 0. 69, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 01, female: r = &minus; 0. 50, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 005; Young&rsquo;s modulus, male: r = &minus; 0. 55, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 05, female: r = &minus; 0. 52, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 005, ultimate stiffness, male: r = &minus; 0. 58, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 05, female: r = &minus; 0. 35, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 03, central ultimate absorbed energy density, male: r = &minus; 0. 59, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 015, female: r = &minus; 0. 29, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 08). Conclusions: For the strongly osteoporotic population (BMD&nbsp;&lt; 0. 4 g/cm 2, T-score &lt;&nbsp;&minus; 4) the <b>statical</b> variables (loads, <b>stresses)</b> showed significant correlation; mixed variables (stiffness, Young&rsquo;s modulus, energy) showed moderate correlation; kinematical variables (displacements, strains) showed no correlation with age. The strong correlation of men between BMD and aging (r = &minus; 0. 82, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 001) and betwen BMD and strength parameters (r = 0. 8 &ndash; 0. 9, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 001) indicated linear trends in age-related strength loss for men; however, the moderate correlation of women between BMD and aging (r = &minus; 0. 47, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 005) and between BMD and strength parameters (r = 0. 4 &ndash; 0. 5, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 005) suggested the need of nonlinear (quadratic) approximation that provided the better fit in age-related strength functions of females modelling postmenopausal disproportionalities.
