It argues that recent modeling based on fMRI studies and behavioral genetics suggests a stipulative, non-seamless reduction of pathological gambling to a specific disorder of the mesolimbic dopamine system.

Therefore, we investigated the association between atrial fibrillation and future risk of VTE in a population-based cohort. Methods: In total, 29 975 subjects were recruited from three surveys of the Tromsø study and followed from enrolment (1994 - 95, 2001 - 02 and 2007 - 08) through 2010. Incident events of atrial fibrillation and VTE during follow-up were recorded. Information on potential confounders was obtained at baseline.

40|$|Does {{inequality}} fuel anti-globalization backlash? This paper answers {{this question}} by analyzing how income inequality affects the embrace or eschew of globalization by political parties. It focuses on party opposition to {{and support for}} trade openness, European-Union integration, and general internationalism in all party platforms of 22 advanced-industrial democracies between 1960 and 2008. The analysis considers how and under what conditions inequality affects such position-taking. The main finding is that inequality tends to increase parties’ anti-globalization backlash, an effect that does not significantly differ across party families or globalization exposure but does get diminished with more generous redistributional policies. These findings clarify the nature and origins of anti-EU {{and other aspects of}} anti-globalization backlash, and suggest how socio-economic conditions may be central to such backlash.

For the infection of murine macrophages by influenza 4 virus, our earlier study indicated involvement of a C-type lectin, the macrophage mannose 5 receptor (MMR), in this process. Here, we have used direct binding techniques to confirm and 6 characterize the interaction of influenza virus with the MMR and to seek additional 7 macrophage surface molecules that may have potential as receptors for viral entry. We 8 identified the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) as a second macrophage membrane C- 9 type lectin that binds influenza virus and {{is known to be}} endocytic.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present our {{approaches}} for tackling the QA 4 MRE 2013 main task. We have built two different methodologies, {{one based on}} information retrieval {{and the other one}} based on graph representations of the text, additionally we have built a third hybrid methodology combining both of the previous one. The first methodo-logy uses the Lucene information retrieval engine for carrying out infor-mation extraction employing additional automated linguistic processing such as stemming, anaphora resolution and part-of-speech tagging. This approach validates the answers based on a textual entailment assessment, lexical and semantic similarity measures. In the second methodology the documents along with its hypotheses are parsed to produce a lexical, morphological and syntactic graph representation. Thereafter, we tra-verse different paths on the document and the hypothesis in order to find features in those graphs by <b>counting</b> <b>text</b> components (word lem-mas, PoS tags, grammatical tags). As a result of this procedure, we obtain two feature vectors for each traversed path. Finally, a cosine based simi-larity is calculated over the feature vectors in order to select the correct hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|For {{over three}} decades, party manifestos have formed the {{largest source of}} textual data for {{estimating}} party policy positions and emphases, resting on the pillars of two key assump-tions: that party policy positions can be measured on known dimensions by <b>counting</b> <b>text</b> units in predefined categories, and that more text in a given category indicates stronger emphasis. Here we revisit the inductive approach to estimating policy positions from party manifesto data, demonstrating {{that there is no}} single definition of left-right policy that fits well in all contexts, even though meaningful comparisons can be made by locating parties on a single dimension in each context. To estimate party positions, we apply a Bayesian, multi-level, Poisson-IRT measurement model to category counts from coded party mani-festos. By treating the categories as “items ” and policy positions as a latent variable, we are able to recover not only left-right estimates but also direct estimates of how each policy category relates to this dimension, without having to decide these relationships in advance based on political theory, exploratory analysis, or guesswork. Finally, the flexibility of our framework permits numerous extensions, designed to incorporate models of manifesto au-thorship, coding effects, and additional explanatory variables (including time and country effects) to improve estimates...|$|R

The multimodal approach Language Acquisition proposes that gestures and vocal productions can not be dissociated and form a single matrix of meaning (KENDON, 1982, 2000, 2004; McNEILL, 1985, 1992, 2000). For this, it presented the Eudico Linguistic Annotator and the Computerized Language Analysis programs. The ELAN, developed by Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, is a transcription software aims to assist data recording on audio or video recordings. This software was developed for linguistic analysis, which may cover beyond data language, notes about gestures. Because of this the software is attractive to multimodal research, since it allows the examination of verbal, nonverbal and contextual. CLAN is a software that allows the realization of simultaneous speech notes, gestures and contextual elements observed in communicative interactions. It enables analysis that cover the frequency count, word searches, co-occurrence analysis, MLU (Mean Length of Utterance) <b>counts,</b> <b>text</b> changes and morphosyntactic analysis (MacWhinney, 2000).

40|$|The {{paper is}} part of the first author’s dissertation. 2 Gneezy, List, and Wu (2006) {{documented}} the “uncertainty effect ” (UE), whereby a risky prospect is valued less than its worst possible outcome. We conjecture that the UE is not caused by risk aversion but rather by the fact that—in studies documenting the UE—the risky prospect is typically called a “lottery ticket ” and the worst possible outcome is called a “gift certificate”. As we demonstrate, framing a prospect as a “lottery ticket ” compared to a “gift certificate” dramatically reduces willingness to pay (WTP) for both, risky and certain prospects. We test and rule out several explanations for the value-suppressing effect of the lottery frame: subjective uncertainty, processing disfluency, negative attitudes towards lotteries, differences in aleatory uncertainty or mental representations of uncertainty, anticipated disappointment, and anchoring. Ultimately, we show that framing a prospect as “lottery”, “raffle”, “coin flip”, or “gamble” compared to “gift certificate ” or “voucher ” reduces WTP but does not affect willingness to accept (WTA). We conclude that framing does not affect subjective valuations of the prospects but evokes different reference prices.
