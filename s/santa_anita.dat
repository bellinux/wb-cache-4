5|$|On February 10, 2017, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> {{announced}} that it was renaming the Vanity Stakes, which she won in 2016, as the Beholder Mile Stakes. Beholder won 14 races at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> during her career.|$|E
5|$|California Chrome was {{the top-ranked}} three-year-old {{in the nation}} by the NTRA in its post-race poll of June 9, 2014, {{in spite of his}} Belmont loss, and was fifth-ranked among American horses of all ages. In the June 12 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, {{published}} by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, he was ranked fifth in the world, one point behind the only American-based horse rated higher, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Handicap winner Game On Dude, who was tied for third.|$|E
5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
5000|$|Hillsdale ((Thoroughbred)), {{one of only}} 5 {{horses in}} history to sweep the prestigious <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> Strub Stakes Series ...|$|R
50|$|As a three-year-old, he {{finished}} second twice before winning a Maiden Special Weight at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> Oak Tree meet on September 29, 2006. He {{went on to}} capture an allowance on October 26, 2006, and then ended the year with a second place on the turf in the Grade III 1-mile Sir Beaufort Stakes on December 26, 2006, on {{the opening day of}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> 2006-07 winter meet.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{transferred}} to <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> dirt track in 1979, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1991, 1992, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006. It was run in two divisions in 1968 and again in 1988.|$|R
5|$|Unlike many {{high-end}} California Thoroughbred trainers, {{who usually}} are headquartered at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Park, the Shermans kept horses at Hollywood Park, {{but when it}} closed in December 2013, Los Alamitos Race Course picked {{up some of the}} Thoroughbred races and trainers who had stabled horses at Hollywood Park, including Sherman. The success of California Chrome, who was conditioned there over the track that had been recently expanded to accommodate longer races, created good publicity for Los Alamitos.|$|E
5|$|Americus raced as {{a three-year-old}} in America, winning {{a number of}} races. In May 1895, he raced at Louisville under the {{ownership}} of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Stable, winning a race on May 14 {{at a distance of}} 5/8 of a mile. On May 20, he finished second in the Schulte Stakes. By June, he was at Coney Island, where he came in second in a sweepstakes race on June 15. On June 18, he lost a sweepstakes to Domino, finishing third. On July 4, he won a sweepstakes at a distance of 3/4 of a mile. As a three-year-old, Americus also won the Culver Stakes.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. It {{turned out that the}} county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E
50|$|In December 2015, Denman {{announced}} that he would be retiring as <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> race caller after 33 years. He plans to continue calling races at Del Mar, while spending {{the rest of the time}} either on his Minnesota farm or traveling.|$|R
50|$|The San Juan Capistrano is {{run around}} four turns, and {{begins at the}} top of <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> {{downhill}} chute, normally used for 6 1/2 furlong sprint races. From the start point, horses begin their descent down the hill. Within the first two furlongs of the race, horses turn right - one of only two locations in North American horse racing that a right turn is used (the other is at Kentucky Downs). After a brief straight run, there is a gentle turn to the left until the horses cross the dirt course and enter the main turf oval. Horses then run one full lap of the turf course to complete the 1 mi distance. In 2016 the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> downhill chute was under repair and the race was run on the flat turf oval, at 1.875 mi.|$|R
50|$|After {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint to Regally Ready after a wide trip, Caracortado made his 2012 debut in the January 8 Grade IIIT Daytona Stakes over <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> downhill turf course. He came from far back in a short field to score by 1 lengths over Victory Pete and Regally Ready.|$|R
5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9–1 {{favorite}} in an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; Firing Line, winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow was sired by the Canadian-bred Awesome Again, {{winner of}} the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic. At stud, Awesome Again has sired many stakes winners, {{including}} Paynter, who placed second in the 2012 Belmont Stakes and won the 2012 Haskell Invitational; Ghostzapper, who was 2004 American Horse of the Year and a 2004 Breeders' Cup winner; and Game On Dude, two-time {{winner of the}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Handicap. Oxbow is almost a full brother to Paynter; the two horses are out of full sisters. Oxbow's older full brother, Awesome Patriot, won the 2011 Alydar Stakes. Oxbow's younger full brother, Expect a Lot, is in race training. Oxbow's dam Tizamazing was bred back to Awesome Again in 2013, and in June 2013 was confirmed to be in foal.|$|E

5000|$|South African native Trevor Denman {{served as}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> {{full-time}} announcer from the 1983 Oak Tree meet {{until his retirement}} from the position in 2015. Denman is noted for his calls beginning with [...] "And awaaay they go..." [...] and his distinctive gravelly voice. Queensland, Australia native Michael Wrona was chosen to succeed Denman in March 2016.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Seabiscuit statue, {{created by}} American {{sculptor}} Jame Hughlette ("Tex") Wheeler [...] was hand tooled by Frank Buchler, a German immigrant {{the owner of}} Washington Ornamental Iron Company Los Angeles.

50|$|Owned by Zayat Stables, {{trained by}} Bob Baffert and ridden by Garrett K. Gomez, the Roan almost Gray Colt swept all three major sprints in Southern California {{in the summer}} of 2009, beating older horses in the Triple Bend Handicap, then in the Bing Crosby Handicap and the Pat O'Brien Handicap. The victory in the Pat O'Brien Handicap earned Zensational a spot in the BC Sprint on Nov. 7 at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> Oak Tree meeting through the Win and You're In.|$|R
25|$|Rogers owned a Thoroughbred racehorse named Triggairo, who won 13 career races, {{including}} the 1975 El Encino Stakes at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Park.|$|E

25|$|Track writer B.K. Beckwith wrote Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion (1940), with a {{foreword}} by Grantland Rice, {{right after}} Seabiscuit's <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> win {{and at the}} moment of the horse's retirement.|$|E
50|$|Blind Luck {{returned}} to the races on Saturday, October 1 in the Lady's Secret Stakes at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> autumn meeting. After breaking slowly as usual, she dropped far behind and lost contact with the field on the second turn. She finished an uncharacteristic last place {{in the field of}} seven fillies and mares, {{the first time in her}} career she had been worse than third. This poor performance rendered her out of the Breeders' Cup. Tests and scans taken on her reportedly revealed that nothing was physically wrong.|$|R
50|$|Game On Dude {{came into}} the Classic as the {{favorite}} after a brilliant campaign that included wins in the Hollywood Gold Cup and Awesome Again Stakes. A win would likely have earned him Horse of the Year honors but he was sluggish and finished seventh. Longshot Fort Larned won in a front running performance, just holding off Mucho Macho Man at the wire. No European horses were entered in the Classic, a change attributed to the growing success of Champion Day at Ascot and <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> switch from the synthetic dirt surface used from 2006 to 2011 back to natural dirt.|$|R
50|$|On July 21, 2007, Awesome Gem {{returned}} to the stakes scene to place second behind Sun Boat in the 1-1/16-mile Grade II San Diego Handicap on Del Mar's new Polytrack. On August 19, 2007, he {{finished second in the}} 1-1/4-mile Pacific Classic Stakes at Del Mar. In the race, Awesome Gem made a furious closing effort down the stretch from almost last to narrowly miss overtaking the leader, Student Council, at the wire. On September 29, Awesome Gem unsuccessfully dueled Tiago down the stretch in the 1-1/8-mile Grade I Goodwood Handicap on <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> new Cushion Track during the 2007 Oak Tree meet, losing by a nose and again placing second.|$|R
25|$|The Story of Seabiscuit (1949), {{starring}} Shirley Temple in {{her second}} to last film, is a fictionalized account featuring Sea Sovereign {{in the title}} role. An otherwise undistinguished film, it did include actual footage of the 1938 match race against War Admiral and the 1940 <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Handicap.|$|E
25|$|Mount Wilson {{had always}} been active with human passage {{starting}} {{from the days of}} the local Indians. It was Benjamin Davis Wilson who established a proper trail to the summit of Mt. Wilson from Sierra Madre through the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Canyon. The Mt. Wilson Toll Road to Henninger Flats is controlled by the Forester and Fire Warden of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.|$|E
25|$|The two {{met again}} in the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Handicap a week later, where Rosemont won by a nose. The defeat was devastating to Smith and Howard, and was widely {{attributed}} in the press to a jockey error. Pollard, who had not seen Rosemont over his shoulder until too late, was blind in one eye due to an accident during a training ride, a fact he had hidden throughout his career.|$|E
50|$|Silver Swallow {{made her}} debut in a Maiden Special Weight {{race as a}} 2-year-old on opening day, December 26, for <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita’s</b> 2006-2007 meet with Alex Solis aboard. She placed third, already {{displaying}} the late-closing style that would become typical of many of her subsequent runs. She won a Maiden Special Weight as the favorite on January 14, 2007, but the then 3-year-old filly was disqualified for interference on the stretch and relegated to third place. A {{little more than a}} month later, on February 18, Silver Swallow trailed the pack and then rallied to win by two lengths in another Maiden Special Weight.|$|R
5000|$|In 1933, California legalized parimutuel wagering {{and several}} {{investor}} groups worked to open racetracks. In the San Francisco area, a group headed by Dr. Charles H [...] "Doc" [...] Strub {{was having trouble}} locating a site. In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer Hal Roach {{was in need of}} further funds. These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club reopened the track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first racetrack in California. Architect Gordon Kaufmann designed its various buildings in a combination of Colonial Revival and a type of art deco known as Streamline Modern, painted primarily in <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> signature colors of Persian Green and Chiffon Yellow.|$|R
5000|$|On August 19, Lava Man was sent-off as the 6-5 {{favorite}} in the Pacific Classic Stakes but did not take well to Del Mar's new Polytrack and finished a well-beaten sixth. [...] He was then pointed to the October 7 Oak Tree Mile Stakes at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita's</b> Oak Tree meet in hopes that the shorter distance and firmer turf might benefit him. The gelding placed sixth and last, and jockey Corey Nakatani said, [...] "There was no energy level there at all. We were sitting in a real good spot right behind the leaders, and then I can normally push the horse outside, but he just had no fight today. I don't know what the deal was." ...|$|R
25|$|One {{race was}} left in the season. A week after the San Antonio, Seabiscuit and Kayak II both took the gate for the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Handicap and its $121,000 prize. 78,000 paying spectators crammed the racetrack, most backing Seabiscuit. Pollard found his horse blocked almost from the start. Picking his way through the field, Seabiscuit briefly led. As they thundered down the back straight, Seabiscuit became trapped in third place, behind leader Whichcee and Wedding Call on the outside.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 Kentucky Derby, Gun Runner was {{the third}} betting choice behind the two-year-old {{champion}} Nyquist, who had also won the Florida Derby, and Exaggerator, who had won the <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> Derby. Gun Runner broke well and raced with Nyquist just behind a fast early pace set by Dazzling Candy. As they rounded into the stretch, Gun Runner made his move and took the lead. Nyquist then responded and started to draw away. From far behind, Exaggerator made a strong run down the stretch to finish second, with Gun Runner holding on for third.|$|E
25|$|The most {{underdeveloped}} mass ceramics area is in tableware, porcelain and stoneware. Mexico {{has only}} two major tableware manufacturers, Anfora and <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita,</b> which produce porcelain and stoneware respectively. Anfora {{is the only one}} that has been successful in exporting its goods to US companies including Panera Bread, Pottery Barn and Starbucks. Most of these ceramics are imported from other countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany despite its ability to produce it itself. However, the lack of certain raw materials may partially explain this. Another problem is the continued production of lead glazed ware, which cannot be exported. While lead free and low lead glazes have been developed for use with low temperature firing, the most traditional, only about half of artisans use it.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, she portrayed Jade on O Clone, and her co-star was Murilo Benício. The {{big success}} of this {{multicultural}} telenovela was enormous, and Giovanna traveled a lot to promote it together with Benício. The role of young Muslim girl Jade in O Clone was very demanding for her, she practiced belly dancing 6 {{hours a day for}} 2 months so that when she danced it would look like she has it in her blood. It is an obstacle for them to marry because her uncle Ali does not allow her to marry a Christian. She is forced to marry Said other Muslim guy. But at the end she gets back with Lucas.In 2002, she acted in the movie Avassaladoras. A year later, Giovanna played the role of Brazilian heroine from <b>Santa</b> Catarina, <b>Anita</b> Ana Garibaldi, in mini-series A Casa das Sete Mulheres. That role was very important for her and once again she worked with director Jayme Monjardim, and many great actors like Thiago Lacerda, Dalton Vigh, Daniela Escobar, Camila Morgado and Werner Schünemann. For four months, while acting Anita Garibaldi, Giovanna patiently read Anita's biographies and practically lived her life. After the shooting ended, Giovanna said that she was glad that she can have a haircut and see herself with a new, modern haircut, the long black hair bored her.|$|R
25|$|The Eaton Canyon Natural Area Park {{is located}} where the {{mountain}} stream debouches into the foothill wash {{at the base}} of the San Gabriel Mountains. The park is administered by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. The county administers the lower two-thirds of the area below the toll road bridge. Most of the 190 acres (0.8km2) that comprises the natural area lie on the northern boundaries of the old Rancho San Pascual and Rancho <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita</b> on land designated for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Once the railroad gave up the land, it was opened for homesteading. The nature center is unique in the area because it houses exhibits that educate on the flora and fauna local to the San Gabriel Valley Southern California. The center was rebuilt in 1998 after the 1993 fire destroyed the previous facility.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the fall}} and winter of 1939, Seabiscuit's fitness seemed to improve by the day. By the end of the year, Smith was ready to return the horse to race training, with a {{collection}} of stable jockeys in the saddle. By the time of his comeback race, Pollard had cajoled Howard into allowing him the ride. After the horse was scratched due to soft going, the pair finally lined up {{at the start of the}} La Jolla Handicap at <b>Santa</b> <b>Anita,</b> on February 9, 1940. Seabiscuit was third, beaten by two lengths. By their third comeback race, Seabiscuit was back to his winning ways, running away from the field in the San Antonio Handicap to beat his erstwhile training partner, Kayak II, by two and a half lengths. Under , Seabiscuit equalled the track record for a mile and 1/16.|$|E
