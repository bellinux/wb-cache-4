5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|Males become {{extremely}} aggressive during musth. Size is {{the determining factor}} in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition.

A male may stop <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{produced}} extensive {{poetry in}} Old English, {{some of which}} was written down {{as early as the}} 9th century, although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century. Beowulf, probably written between 650 and 750, is typical of these poems, portraying a vivid, heroic tale, ending with the protagonist's death {{at the hands of a}} dragon, but still <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the new Christian influences in England. Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including The Pastoral Care.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{were once}} {{uncommon}} in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, but {{have increased their}} presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, not only for wintering but also for feeding. Humpbacks are also <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> re-expanding into former ranges, such as Scotland, Skagerrak and Kattegat, as well as Scandinavian fjords such as Kvænangen, where {{they had not been}} observed for decades.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection roughly 1,100km (700mi) east of Guam. A broad, low-level circulation center {{had formed}} within the system and became increasingly organized, <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> developing convective banding. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low, which was embedded within {{the eastern end of}} the monsoonal trough. It was then declared as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as Tropical Depression 15W The tropical depression was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the international dateline.|$|E

The two met in an unadvertised match for the United States Championship at the Royal Rumble event with Miz retaining his title, but in the Royal Rumble match itself MVP eliminated both himself and The Miz. During the rivalry with MVP, Miz began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> an allegiance with The Big Show and on the February 8 episode of Raw, the two defeated champions D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows) to become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, making Miz the first wrestler in WWE history to hold three championships {{at the same time}} (U.S., World Tag Team, and WWE Tag Team Champion).|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, a monsoon trough {{situated}} {{over the}} Bay of Bengal began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> cyclonic development. By May20, synoptic data indicated {{the presence of}} a weak circulation; however, the system remained disorganized. Following a dramatic increase in convection and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on May23 and subsequently began monitoring the system as a tropical depression hours later. Initially, the depression tracked slowly towards the north-northwest before abruptly turning westward and slowing due to weak mid-level steering currents. During this time, the storm gradually intensified and was limited by northwesterly wind shear. By May26, the storm turned northward and accelerated. Later that day, 01B attained its peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) shortly before making landfall in eastern India. The system quickly weakened once inland and was last noted on May 27 as a dissipating low.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet.

5|$|On September 4, a {{cold front}} exited {{the coast of}} Texas into the Gulf of Mexico. A {{convective}} band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between Veracruz, Mexico and Tampa, Florida. The band began to split into two on September 6; the northeastern portion developed into a frontal wave and tracked northeastward, while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> tropical organization. Located {{in an area of}} generally low pressures, the system developed a spiral band structure, though deep convection was mostly intermittent. Subsequent to the formation of a surface circulation, the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 450miles (725km) northwest of Mérida, Yucatán.|$|E
5|$|The group goes to IBF {{in search}} for a cure, but starts <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Tief Blau. An {{exception}} is Tsugumi, as the Cure virus has made her immune; the group injects themselves with her antibodies. They get contact with the surface, and a rescue pod is sent down, but is only able {{to stay for a}} short period of time. Tsugumi disappears to find Chami, who has gone missing; Takeshi chases after her, and saves Sora's data onto a disk, to save her memories. Returning to IBF, they have missed the rescue vessel. They find a submarine and escape, but its batteries die; Takeshi exits it, giving it enough buoyancy to save Tsugumi, while he dies on the ocean floor. Coco dies in IBF, as she had been looking for Pipi, and the rescue team could not find her.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without <b>showing</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Repetitive counterelectrophoresis (RCE), {{which has}} been {{described}} (Hayano and Tanaka, 1977), was used to assay the contents of antibodies to streptococcal esterases (STE) in sera from patients with scarlet fever. The levels of antibodies to STE were expressed semiquantitatively by reading {{the intensity of the}} colored spot developed by RCE with a densitometer. The present study deals with the determination of anti-STE in sera drawn at intervals from 54 patients diagnosed as suffering from scarlet fever. The STE used in this study were prepared from the streptococcal strains as follows. STE-AI was prepared from SS 379 (group A, type 40), STE-AII from strain 69882 (group A, type 49), STE-B from strain H 36 B (group B, lb), and STE-C from strain Austin (group C). Of the 54 cases studied, 32 (59. 3 %) showed anti-STE-AI, 24 (44. 4 %) showed anti-STE-AII, 5 (9. 3 %) showed anti-STE-B, and 23 (42. 6 %) showed anti-STE-C. Comparison of the titer of anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) with the type of specific reaction of anti-STE-AI and -AII, determined in the same specimen, showed a marked correlation. Of 20 cases giving ASLO titers of 12 or less, 18 <b>showed</b> no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AI and -AII and two <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AI. Of 34 cases giving ASLO titers of more than 12, 33 <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AI and/or -AII, 22 <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AI and -AII, 7 <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AI, and 4 <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AII. Of all the cases, 26 showed coincident rises in titers of ASLO and levels of anti-STE-AI and/or -AII {{during the course of the}} disease. One case showed the presence of only anti-STE-B. All of the 23 cases that showed the presence <b>of</b> anti-STE-C <b>showed</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> anti-STE-AI.
