5000|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>eel</b> {{is roughly}} 40 cm (16 in) long. The eel has large eyes {{compared}} to its body, and a weak {{sense of smell}} because of its tiny nostrils. It is timid around other animals and people, but slightly aggressive towards other males of its species. If it feels threatened, it retreats into its burrow and closes it with a mucus block so the predator cannot dig into its home. It has a gland in its tail that secretes a sticky substance that keeps the burrow from falling in on itself and burying the <b>garden</b> <b>eel</b> in sand. Scientists have yet {{to figure out the}} <b>garden</b> <b>eel's</b> lifespan in the wild.|$|R
