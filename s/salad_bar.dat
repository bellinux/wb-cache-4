25|$|After {{buying the}} East 60th Street {{building}} from her landlords, {{as well as}} an adjacent building, she added a bar and quadrupled seating. In 1946, Clementine Paddleford, a food writer for the New York Herald Tribune, wrote that “pretty girls” served popovers “unendingly,” dispensing one thousand daily at the Manhattan Candlelight. Paddleford described the restaurant’s <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> as a special feature and said dinners were “simple, plain-American – good!” Beef, lamb, and calf’s liver were available “plain roasted as you do at home” or “plain broiled” with “no lathering of strange sauces,” Paddleford said, adding that by this time Murphy was serving a half million diners annually at her two locations.|$|E

500|$|One of the company's first {{forays into}} {{healthier}} products was in 1983 with introduction of its <b>salad</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> met with light to moderate success, but the company's franchise holders complained of high operating costs and a poor return on investment. Part of the product, a pita salad, was quickly {{dropped from the}} <b>salad</b> <b>bar,</b> as were {{plans to use the}} bar unit to boost breakfast sales. In 1987 the company augmented its <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> with a test line of prepackaged salads, including chef and garden salads. The <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads. In 1990, BK introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with Paul Newman's Newman's Own, Inc., whose salad dressings accompanied the products. Burger King revamped its salad line again in 2004, with the introduction of its Fire Grilled Salad products. Burger King sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice of grilled shrimp or broiled chicken—separately from the cold salad; this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness. At one point in the United States, the salads are pre-made off-site. They are sold with two toppings and Ken's Foods Ken's Steakhouse brand salad dressing. Internationally, the salads vary in composition and style from market to market. In all markets, salads are one of the items targeted at female and health-conscious consumers. In parts of Europe, salads are sold under the [...] "King Delight" [...] or [...] "LA Range" [...] banner.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, 751 people {{contracted}} salmonellosis, 45of whom were hospitalized. There were no fatalities. Although an initial investigation by the Oregon Public Health Division and the Centers for Disease Control did not rule out deliberate contamination, the agents and fact of contamination were only discovered a year later. On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave a speech in the United States House of Representatives in which he [...] "accused the Rajneeshees of sprinkling Salmonella culture on <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> ingredients in eight restaurants".|$|E
50|$|In 1981, {{the chain}} {{introduced}} baked potatoes and <b>salad</b> <b>bars</b> to their menu. By June 1984, the 300th location was opened in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1988, the company decided {{to reduce the}} size of their money losing <b>salad</b> and food <b>bars</b> to help reduce expenses and refocus on sandwiches.|$|R

50|$|The {{first and}} largest food {{attack in the}} US is the 1984 Rajneeshee {{bioterror}} attack. 751 individuals were poisoned in The Dalles, Oregon through the contamination of <b>salad</b> <b>bars</b> with Salmonella {{with the intention of}} affecting the 1984 Wasco County elections.|$|R
500|$|The primary {{delivery}} tactic involved {{one member}} concealing {{a plastic bag}} containing a light-brown liquid with the Salmonella bacteria (referred to by the perpetrators as [...] "salsa"), and either spreading it over the food at a <b>salad</b> <b>bar,</b> or pouring its contents into salad dressing. By September 24, 1984, more than 150people were violently ill. By the end of September, 751cases of acute gastroenteritis were documented; lab results showed {{that all of the}} victims were infected with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. Symptoms included diarrhea, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headaches, abdominal pain, and bloody stools. Victims ranged in age from an infant, born two days after his mother's infection and initially given a five percent chance of survival, to an 87-year-old.|$|E
500|$|Oregon Democratic Congressman James H. Weaver {{continued}} to investigate {{because he believed}} that the officials' conclusion did not adequately explain the facts. He contacted physicians at the CDC and other agencies and urged them to investigate Rajneeshpuram. According to Lewis F. Carter's book Charisma and Control in Rajneeshpuram, [...] "many treated his concern" [...] as paranoid or as an example of [...] "Rajneeshee bashing". On February 28, 1985, Weaver gave a speech at the United States House of Representatives in which he accused the Rajneeshees of contaminating <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> ingredients in eight restaurants. As events later showed, Weaver had presented a well-reasoned, if only circumstantial, case; these circumstantial elements were confirmed by evidence found after investigators gained access to Rajneeshpuram several months later.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} {{also revealed}} prior experimentation at Rajneeshpuram with poisons, chemicals and bacteria, in 1984 and 1985. Dr. Skeels described {{the scene at}} the Rajneesh laboratory as [...] "a bacteriological freezer-dryer for large-scale production" [...] of microbes. Investigators found a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook, and literature on the manufacture and usage of explosives and military bio-warfare. Investigators believed that the commune had previously carried out similar attacks in Salem, Portland, and other cities in Oregon. According to court testimony, the plotters boasted that they had attacked a nursing home and a <b>salad</b> <b>bar</b> at the Mid-Columbia Medical Center, but no such attempts were ever proven in court. As a result of the bioterrorism investigation, law enforcement officials discovered that there had been an aborted plot by Rajneeshees to murder Charles Turner, a former United States Attorney for Oregon.|$|E
50|$|Fresh Choice marketed {{itself as}} a {{healthier}} alternative to fast food restaurants with reference to menu options that include choices relatively low in fat, carbohydrates, and/or calories.

In the park's opening season guidebook, the facility is listed as selling [...] "bratwurst, sausages, beef and mushroom pie, smoked sausage, grilled frankfurter, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, soft pretzels, pastries, with beer, wine, coffee, tea, milk, and soft drinks." [...] The self–serve restaurant had table service on request, and seated 528; Ginza Gardens in Grande Exposition of 1890 was the only other restaurant in the park with table service. A review of the restaurant in The Toronto Star describes the facility as the park's flagship eatery, but it received mixed reviews. [...] "The $2.50 beef and mushroom pie has a good crust and as much beef as potato. Tiny mushrooms, but big on flavor." [...] Conversely, 50 cent pretzels [...] "are strictly for teething tots –too cheewy." [...] The Marketplace currently serves an all–you–can–eat buffet, self described as [...] "upscale", offering meats like roast beef and fried chicken, pasta, a <b>salad</b> <b>bar,</b> a desert station, varied international cuisine, and other options.

40|$|The school {{environment}} can positively affect students in areas beyond traditional academic achievement. An innovative program in Davis, the Farm to School Connection, sought {{to promote the}} development of life-long healthy eating habits in children {{and to create a}} {{school environment}} that made connections among the school garden, cafeteria and classroom, and linked them to local agriculture. This comprehensive program included farmers’ market <b>salad</b> <b>bars,</b> classroom education, farm tours and waste management. We evaluated the effectiveness of the program via interviews and surveys of program leaders, teachers and school staff. Participation in the school lunch program increased with the addition of the <b>salad</b> <b>bars,</b> and numerous partnerships developed among those involved.
