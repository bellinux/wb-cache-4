The study assessed the validity of two EpiOcular™ EIT protocols for liquids and solids, two independent SkinEthic™ HCE protocols based on short-time (SE) and long-time (LE) exposures and a test strategy combining SE and LE. The results and conclusions of this study will be presented. Briefly, over 100 chemicals were tested and both methods showed high reproducibility (> 90 %). The EpiOcular™ EIT liquids protocol met all the <b>study</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for predictive capacity [2], but not all of these criteria were met by the solids protocol nor by any of the SkinEthic™ HCE protocols/strategy. This led to optimisation of the EpiOcular™ EIT solids protocol and further validation being conducted. With final sensitivity of 96 %, specificity of 63 % and accuracy of 80 %, the EpiOcular™ EIT met all the <b>study</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> and is considered valid for the proposed study objective.

OBJECTIVES: The studies were designed to determine whether new functional intervertebral cervical disc prosthesis can provide relief from objective neurologic symptoms and signs, improve the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, decrease pain, and maintain stability and segmental motion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The concept of accelerated degeneration of adjacent disc levels as a consequence of increased stress caused by interbody fusion of the cervical spine has been widely postulated. Therefore, reconstruction of a failed intervertebral disc with functional disc prosthesis should offer the same benefits as fusion while simultaneously providing motion and thereby protecting the adjacent level discs from the abnormal stresses associated with fusion. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy underwent implantation with the Bryan prosthesis after a standard anterior cervical discectomy. At scheduled follow-up periods, the effectiveness of the device was characterized by evaluating each patient's pain, neurologic function, and radiographically measured range of motion at the implanted level. RESULTS: Clinical success for both studies exceeded the <b>study</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> of 85 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{concept of}} {{accelerated}} degeneration of adjacent disc levels {{as a consequence}} of increased stress caused by interbody fusion of the cervical spine has been widely postulated. Therefore, reconstruction of a failed intervertebral disc with a functional disc prosthesis should offer the same benefits as fusion while simultaneously providing motion and thereby protecting the adjacent level discs from the abnormal stresses associated with fusion. This study was designed to determine whether a new functional intervertebral cervical disc prosthesis can provide relief from objective neurological symptoms and signs, improve the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, decrease pain, and provide stability and normal range of motion. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, concurrently enrolled, multicenter trial of the Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis (Spinal Dynamics Corp., Mercer Island, WA) for the treatment of patients with single-level degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. Patients with symptomatic cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy underwent implantation with the Bryan prosthesis after a standard anterior cervical discectomy. At scheduled follow-up periods, the effectiveness of the device was characterized by evaluating each patient's pain, neurological function, and range of motion at the implanted level. RESULTS: Analysis included data regarding 60 patients at 6 months with 30 of those patients at 1 year. Clinical success at 6 months and 1 year after implantation was 86 and 90 %, respectively, exceeding the <b>study's</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> of 85 %. These results compare favorably with the short-term clinical outcomes associated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion reported in the literature. At 1 year, there was no measurable subsidence of the devices (based on a measurement detection threshold of 2 mm). Evidence of anterior and/or posterior device migration was detected in one patient and suspected in a second patient. There was no evidence of spondylotic bridging at the implanted disc space. The measured range of motion in flexion-extension, as determined by an independent radiologist, ranged from 1 to 21 degrees (mean range of motion, 9 +/- 5 degrees). No devices have been explanted or surgically revised. CONCLUSION: Discectomy and implantation of the device alleviates neurological symptoms and signs similar to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Radiographic evidence supports normal range of motion. The procedure is safe and the patients recover quickly. Restrictive postoperative management is not necessary. However, only after long-term follow-up of at least 5 years will it become clear whether the device remains functional, thus confirming these early favorable results. In addition, the influence on adjacent motion segments can be assessed after at least 5 years of follow-up...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> {{in the risk}} assessment process for occupational accidents {{is an important issue}} but often overlooked in the literature, particularly when new risk assessment methods are proposed and discussed.

Bearing this in mind, this study analysed the problem of the definition of risk <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for occupational settings, defining the quantitative <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for the specific case study of the Portuguese furniture industrial sector. The key steps to be considered in formulating <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> were analysed in the literature review.

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the injury statistics of the industrial sector was identified as the maximum tolerable risk level. The acceptable threshold was defined by adjusting the CDF to the Occupational, Safety & Health (OSH) practitioners’ risk acceptance judgement. Adjustments of <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> to the companies’ safety cultures were exemplified by adjusting the Burr distribution parameters. An example of a risk matrix was also used to demonstrate the integration of the defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> into a risk metric.
