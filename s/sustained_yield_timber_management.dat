40|$|The {{existing}} forest economic models, {{rooted in}} <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> <b>timber</b> <b>management</b> systems and neo-classical economic framework, {{are subject to}} many limitations. Social, economic, and ecological features of sustainable forest management (SFM) are different than that of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> <b>timber</b> <b>management.</b> Hence, the economics of SFM {{will be based on}} different economic principles. The two main requirements of the economics of SFM are the economics of multiple equilibria, and a consumer choice theory that incorporates heterogeneity of agents, context specific and dynamics of preferences, distinction between needs and wants, and the subordination of needs. These requirements will need the extension of the boundaries of forest economics. Five basic principles—principles of ‘both–and’, ‘existence’, ‘relativity’, ‘uncertainty’, and ‘complementarity ’ will work as a foundation, and the economic principles, developed by evolutionary, institutional, ecological economists and economists from other new streams of economics, will be the useful tools to extend these boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Let me {{return to}} my opening theme, that it is through {{a study of the}} {{smallest}} organisms that we learn most about nature. It is the activities of microorganisms, invisible to the naked eye, that dominate the processes which control the productivity and stability of forest ecosystems. Most of these microbes are found in the soil, and a single handful of soil contains more bacteria and fungi than there are people {{on the surface of the}} planet. Because they are so small, these microbes have very large surface-to-volume ratios which permit rapid exchange of materials between them and the environment. This is one reason why they are such potent agents of geochemical change. The geochemical significance of microorganisms is reflected in their role as mediators of essential ecological processes. Two such processes, inextricably intertwined, are of major concern, namely energy flow and nutrient cycling. As R E Rickleffs and colleagues pointed out in 1984, the conservation of such processes is essential to the preservation of species and their habitats. If these processes are disrupted by logging to the extent that the stability of forest ecosystems is threatened, then <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> <b>timber</b> <b>management</b> would be impossible...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sustained</b> <b>yield</b> <b>timber</b> <b>management</b> systems, the {{cornerstone}} of professional forestry practice {{for the last three}} centuries, have come under increasing criticism in recent decades for three main reasons. First, such systems ignored the vast array of non-timber goods and services provided by forests, which sustain the livelihoods of more than 300 million people dependent on forests. Second, sustained yield systems lacked an understanding of the global importance of the ecological services provided by forests, such as the preservation of biodiversity and the storage of atmospheric carbon (a ‘greenhouse gas ’ that in too high a concentration contributes to global warming). Third, these systems kept forestry experts overly focused on a singular strategy: the commercial management of closed forests. Forestry experts frequently ignored the important role remnant woodlands and agroforestry farming systems play in contributing to the forest product needs of more than 1 billion of the world’s poorest people. This is particularly so regarding fuelwood, maintenance of agricultural productivity, and generation of rural incomes. This paper is concerned with the continuing evolution of approaches to sustainable forest management (SFM). This evolution has brought about radical policy shifts to address earlie...|$|E

These types of management plans predominated until World War II. Multiple use forestry developed after World War II and issues like recreation, wildlife, water quality, and wilderness became more important. In the 1970 ’s harvest scheduling became part of the planning process, allowing for optimization of multiple goals. By 2001 social, environmental, and economic goals were integrated into the timber production process. American forestry experienced distinct historical periods of resource planning, ranging from classic <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> <b>timber</b> production, to multiple use-sustained yield, to sustainable human-forest systems.

We surveyed a longitudinal profile (of the thalweg, water surface, and high water mark) and four cross sections, made fourteen sediment depth readings along the channel, and made several field sketches and took pictures to document the effects of large woody debris on channel form. This baseline data, in conjunction with regional hydrographs, allowed us to estimate the return interval of the measured high flow, which is approximately 1. 5 years.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1950 s, {{numerous}} silvicultural {{systems have been}} experimented in the tropics, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. However, most of the tropical countries adopted a polycyclic silvicultural system, also called selective logging. Over the past 2 decades, sets of timber harvesting practices known as reduced-impact logging (RIL), designed to mitigate the deleterious environmental impacts of logging operations, have been implemented mainly at the experimental scale in tropical forests. However, RIL techniques have also shown strong limitations in <b>sustaining</b> <b>timber</b> <b>yield</b> within a 30 - 40 year rotation as usually recommended in forest legislation in the tropics.

40|$|The {{basis of}} {{scientific}} forest management in India {{has been the}} principle of maximum physical <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> of <b>timber</b> and other highvalued products {{in the interest of}} posterity. This leads to long rotations, slow turnover of the crop, and slow conversion of existing forest into more productive crops. The needs of the local population have generally been given a lower priority. The community is thus often not in sympathy with the forest departments. This makes the job of protecting and managing the forests as envisaged more difficult. It would therefore be desirable to compare the relative merits of alternative management regimes: maximizing long-term flow of physical product as professed by foresters, maximizing economic efficiency as demanded by neo-classical economists, or maximizing net social value to the current generation, as suggested by modern welfare economists. One framework for such an analysis is afforded by social cost benefit analysis (SCBA). The Little-Mirrlees methodology of SCBA has been used for a study of the teak-bearing forests of North Kanara in Karnataka State, India. Generally, applying economic criteria hastens the liquidation of existing crops, and shortens the optimal rotations of future plantations. Teak plantation as an investment activity is seen to be highly sensitive to the discount rate chosen. This is ultimately a subjective parameter. Hence there is no objective case against long rotations. The social value of maintaining basic needs supplies may, under some conditions, compensate for the loss due to postponement of exploitation of the existing crop. This would support a slow pace of conversion. On the other hand, fuelwood plantations may be more valuable socially than commercial timber crops, thus favouring faster turnover of short rotation smallwood crops in place of timber crops on long rotations. There is thus no inherent social advantage to maximizing physical yield. In conclusion, it is suggested that forestry can serve the interests of posterity better by being more responsive to social needs. On the other hand, economists might make a better contribution to forest management by clearly pointing out the subjective elements in their 'objective' prescriptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{principles of}} <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> {{have long been}} relied upon in the planning of forestry management. Along with the more recently introduced concept of multiple-use, <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> remains the catchcry of forest managers. The principles of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> concentrate on planning the extent and timing of harvesting for wood production objectives. However, in the transition from forestry management to forest management, these principles, with their heavy emphasis on wood production objectives, have been at variance with the multiple use concept {{in a number of}} ways. This study attempts to document these areas of conflict for forest management in Tasmania. <b>Sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management in Tasmania is carried out on a regional basis. One of these regions, the Southern Forests, is used as a case study for examining the compatibility between the application of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> and multiple use concepts. The techniques of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management used in the Southern Forests are documented with particular attention being paid to the assumptions made in the planning of management operations. These assumptions are then analysed in terms of their potential effect on management's ability to incorporate non-wood objectives in its planning.

This consideration is usually given where there is only minimal interference with wood production objectives. A change in the present use of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> estimates and a shift in the emphasis of data collection are suggested as preliminary steps in ensuring that non-wood values are given adequate consideration in forest management planning...|$|R
40|$|The urbanizing forested {{landscape}} in the United States is creating challenges for resource managers and land-use planners. Logistic regression models developed to assess urbanization's effect on forestland for the mid-Atlantic and southern states found that population density {{was the best}} predictor of reduced commercial harvest opportunity. We applied similar methodologies in central New York to assess urbanization's impact on <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management. We surveyed professional foresters in a five-county area and asked them to rate the potential for <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management by township. We utilized those expert opinions to develop a logistic regression model that predicted the probability of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management in central New York while exploring the factors that influence <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management. We found that road density was the primary variable influencing the likelihood of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management in central New York. Population density, which is highly correlated with road density, also proved to be a strong determinant of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management. The results suggest that the potential for <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management approaches 10 % at a road density of 3 Â mi/mi 2, 50 % at 2. 5 Â mi/mi 2, and 90 % at 2 Â mi/mi 2. The corresponding figures for population density were 150 people per square mile (ppsm), 75 Â ppsm and 25 Â ppsm, respectively. In addition, we determined that the probability of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> management approaches 100 % for a property that is approximately 30 Â acres and drops to 50 % for a parcel that is between 15 and 20 Â acres. This study provides resource managers and land-use planners a guide in which to effectively gauge the cumulative effect of urbanization on the forest resource in central New York. Unlike other regions of the United States, central New York's growth pattern is characterized by stagnant population growth (declining in some places) combined with continued urbanization and low-density sprawl. Because growth patterns vary regionally, different indicators may be needed to accurately assess the urbanizing forested landscape across the United States.

Statewide harvest levels have averaged approximately 3. 69 mil cd yr - 1 {{over the past ten}} years, thus achieving the task force recommendation might require a significant change in land management practices. One objective of this analysis is to determine if a <b>sustained</b> <b>timber</b> <b>yield</b> of 5. 5 mil cd yr - 1 is achievable and to quantify changes in management practices that could potentially increase utilization toward this level. This study starts from the existing state of forest management as well as biologically maximum growth and then explores potential forest management scenarios between these two endpoints using model and data-based approaches. This analysis was done in order to provide information to policymakers, forest managers, and proposers of new industrial facilities to help assess future <b>timber</b> <b>yields</b> and forest age classes under a range of potential management and policy options that might help increase statewide harvest levels.

For Amazonian tidal floodplain forests, national management guidelines provide neither the highest yields nor the highest sustained population growth for species under management. Our research shows that management guidelines specific to a region's ecological settings can be further refined to consider differences in species demographic responses to repeated harvests.
