They had also <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> {{in the event of}} a fire, their escape path was limited to a single staircase.|$|E
25|$|Novak has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} told, {{and that}} he did not know, that Plame was – or had ever been – a NOC, an agent with Non-Official Cover. He has emphatically said that had he {{understood}} that she was any sort of secret agent, he would never have named her.|$|E
25|$|A further {{concern is}} whether, {{as a result}} of this {{security}} argument, Israel will in fact allow the Palestinian community to emerge as a viable and sovereign political unit, a viable and contiguous state. There are also various economic and political restrictions placed on Palestinian people, activities, and institutions which have had a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy and quality of life. Israel has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> these restrictions are necessary due to security concerns, and in order to counteract ongoing efforts which promote terrorism which incite opposition to Israel's existence and rights as a country. The key obstacle therefore remains the Israeli demand for security versus Palestinian claims for rights and statehood.|$|E
5000|$|He {{wanted to}} play tenor {{saxophone}} from his youth after hearing John Coltrane on Davis's Kind of Blue on the radio at age 19, but his asthma prevented this.

500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, I am sorry {{to inform you that}} you are the victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> he does not share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] {{liked the idea of}} the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after observing Dr. Adams' 12-hour autopsy, Dr. Baden said, [...] "Preliminary {{findings}} indicate {{the boy did}} not die from sickle cell trait, nor did he die from natural causes." [...] Dr. Baden has <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> sickle trait by itself does not cause death. [...] He explained a [...] "sickle cell crisis" [...] is a sickle cell disease—not the same as sickle cell trait. [...] By itself, the sickle cell trait is not harmful. People with sickle cell trait can lead perfectly healthy lives. But beyond that, he said, hospital records indicate Anderson's blood was not sickled until the moment at which he started to die.|$|E

2500|$|Abernethy <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> AMC's [...] "main {{problem was}} its image lag — {{the fact that}} too many people still thought of American Motors as the builder of plain jane compacts." [...] He also started to move the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers' {{full-size}} cars. Moreover, larger models typically return bigger profits. Offering larger, and often more prestigious or [...] "halo cars", can also help make the firm's smaller models look more attractive to consumers. Thus, {{as part of this}} vision, Abernethy put into a motion a total remake of AMC's corporate identity and its marketing mix that would divorce its larger car lines from its Rambler brand and his perceived [...] "negative" [...] compact car image.|$|E
2500|$|The Princess had <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> {{she wanted}} to finish her master's degree, if {{circumstances}} permitted. She completed her post-graduate studies in psychology between her official duties and received her master's degree in psychology in 1995. She is known for her continuing interest in deaf culture and the Deaf in Japan. [...] She learned Japanese sign language {{and she is a}} skilled sign language interpreter. [...] She attends the [...] "Sign Language Speech Contest for High School Students" [...] held every August, and [...] "Praising Mothers Raising Children with Hearing Impairments" [...] every December. In October 2008, she participated in the [...] "38th National Deaf Women's Conference." [...] She also signs in informal Deaf gatherings.|$|E
6000|$|The maiden did {{not show}} any great haste to open the letter, being aware that the true gist of {{it could only be}} {{discovered}} in private, and her father was studying his own likewise in silence. It was from Sir Ralf Sadler to request that Mistress Cicely might be permitted to become a regular member of the household. There was now a vacancy since, though Mrs. Curll was nearly as much about the Queen as ever, it was as the secretary's wife, not as one of the maiden attendants; and Sir Ralf wrote that he wished the more to profit by the opportunity, as he might soon be displaced by some one not of a temper greatly to consider the prisoner's wishes. Moreover, he said the poor lady was ill at ease, and much dejected at the tenor of her late letters from Scotland, and that she had <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> nothing would do her good but the presence of her pretty playfellow. Sir Ralf added assurances that he would watch over the maiden like his own daughter, and would take the utmost care of the faith and good order of all within his household. Curll also wrote by order of his mistress a formal application for the young lady, to which Mary had added in her own hand, [...] "I thank the good Master Richard and Mrs. Susan beforehand, for I know they will not deny me." ...|$|E

25|$|Konrad Adenauer {{has been}} cited {{predicting}} the reunification of Germany {{as early as the}} 1950s, but according to Hans-Peter Schwarz, {{in the last few years}} of Adenauer's life he <b>repeatedly</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Soviet power would last a long time.|$|R

6000|$|The {{friends of}} Melmotte had {{moreover}} {{a basis of}} hope, and were enabled to sound premonitory notes of triumph, arising from causes quite external to their party. The 'Breakfast Table' supported Melmotte, but the 'Breakfast Table' was not a Conservative organ. This support was given, not to the great man's political opinions, as to which a well-known writer in that paper suggested that the great man had probably not as yet given very {{much attention to the}} party questions which divided the country,--but to his commercial position. It was generally acknowledged that few men living,--perhaps no man alive,-- had so acute an insight into the great commercial questions of the age as Mr Augustus Melmotte. In whatever part of the world he might have acquired his commercial experience,--for it had been <b>said</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> Melmotte was not an Englishman,--he now made London his home and Great Britain his country, and it would be for the welfare of the country that such a man should sit in the British Parliament. Such were the arguments used by the 'Breakfast Table' in supporting Mr Melmotte. This was, of course, an assistance;--and not the less so because it was asserted in other papers that the country would be absolutely disgraced by his presence in Parliament. The hotter the opposition the keener will be the support. Honest good men, men who really loved their country, fine gentlemen, who had received unsullied names from great ancestors, shed their money right and left, and grew hot in personally energetic struggles to have this man returned to Parliament {{as the head of the}} great Conservative mercantile interests of Great Britain! ...|$|E
