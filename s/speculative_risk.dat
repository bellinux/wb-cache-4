In this paper, the authors present estimates of the proportion of renal cell cancer cases attributable (or population attributable risk (PAR)) to 1) well-established risk factors, namely smoking, excess weight, and hypertension, and 2) more <b>speculative</b> <b>risk</b> factors, namely elevated protein intake, history of renal disease (i. e., stone, injury, or infection) and high parity among women. These estimates were based on information obtained from directly interviewed subjects (65 % of cases and 100 % of controls).

A number of alternative indexes have been proposed that would measure people’s well-being and the environmental sustainability of the planet. Even though the gross domestic product (GDP) measure has its problems, a look at the alternatives reveals that they are constructed with a specific political agenda in mind and are easily manipulated by governments. In fact, a strong argument for sticking with GDP is that it is narrow in scope and value free. It tells us what we can do, but not what we should do, and does not even try to define well-being. It fits a liberal, pluralistic society where people have different interests, preferences and attitudes to well-being. Our present environmental and financial problems can and should be solved within the intellectual framework of economic growth.

40|$|Background: While {{financial}} {{decision making}} has been barely explored, no study has previously investigated the neural correlates of individual {{decisions made by}} professional traders involved in real stock market negotiations, using their own financial resources. Aim: We sought to detect how different brain areas are modulated by factors like age, expertise, psychological profile (<b>speculative</b> <b>risk</b> seeking or aversion) and, eventually, size and type (Buy/Sell) of stock negotiations, made through Direct Access Trading (DAT) platforms. Subjects and methods: Twenty male traders underwent fMRI while negotiating in the Italian stock market using their own preferred trading platform. Results: At least 20 decision events were collected during each fMRI session. Risk averse traders performed a lower number of financial transactions with respect to risk seekers, with a lower average economic value, but with {{a higher rate of}} filled proposals. Activations were observed in cortical and subcortical areas traditionally involved in decision processes, including the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC, dlPFC), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and dorsal striatum. Regression analysis indicated an important role of age in modulating activation of left NAcc, while traders' expertise was negatively related to activation of vlPFC. High value transactions were associated with a stronger activation of the right PPC when subjects' buy rather than sell. The success of the trading activity, based on a large number of filled transactions, was related with higher activation of vlPFC and dlPFC. Independent of chronological and professional age, traders differed in their attitude to DAT, with distinct brain activity profiles being detectable during fMRI sessions. Those subjects who described themselves as very self-confident, showed a lower or absent activation of both the caudate nucleus and the dlPFC, while more reflexive traders showed greater activation of areas involved in strategic decision making. Discussion: The neural correlates in DAT are similar to those observed in other decision making contexts. Trading is handled as a well-learned automatic behavior by expert traders; for those who mostly rely on heuristics, cognitive effort decreases, and transaction speed increases, but decision efficiency lowers following a poor involvement of the dlPFC...|$|E

Water {{is a life}} source without {{alternative}} for creatures living on earth. Creatures have developed projects for the optimal use of water due to several purposes {{in order to make}} use of water. One of these projects is dams. While aspects such as detailed project designing, error-free production and optimal operating conditions have utmost importance in construction of dams, determination of risks that may arise during production or operation of the structure and taking required measures against such risks are not less significant. Within this context, anticipating the risk groups, requiring improvement to prevent dam accidents experienced in the past and aiming to protect the life in the surrounding in addition to the structure, dam safety issue has gained importance in the recent years. In addition to available dams, dam safety concerns subjects such as project design, production, operation and maintenance of dams to be constructed. Today, attaining a legal and technical infrastructure in many developed countries, the issue of dam safety is being advancing gradually every other day in our country through universities, associations, congresses and administrative mechanisms. Addressing dam safety, within scope of this study, In the Chapter 1, dam safety and the required importance for the risks affecting the dams are explained. Mankind's need for water throughout the history is emphasized and the need for building dams for this requirement is stated. Dams in the world and in Turkey are addressed. It is also stated that the current conditions require economic use of water.   It is explained that safety of the dams is a very important issue both in the national and international level. Despite this, while the current situation clearly shows the hazards, it is reminded that only a few countries have a fully equipped dam safety program. In {{the last part of the}} chapter, the roadmap of the study is stated. In the Chapter 2, the concepts of hazard and safety are explained. It is stated that despite the technological advancement, natural disaster still pose a threat for humanity. It was explained that the big constructions like dams may pose not only known hazards, but also unusual hazards. Land solution procedures in relation to the concept of hazard are listed.   The importance of the concept of safety in engineering, which is defined as the case not posing hazard, is emphasized. Hazard and safety are discussed along with the risk factor, and displayed in a chart. Additionally, topics regarding the risks posed in the dams are mentioned. These topics are discussed in the framework of safety. The other professions effective in addition to construction engineering are stated in terms of dam safety. 3 ways, through which the dam safety is monitored in different disciplines, are given. These 3 ways are respectively prevention, control and decreasing. Stability of the dams providing the society with such advantages as energy, irrigation water, flood control and recreation, is examined. It is highlighted that while trial and error method has been common in the first years of dam construction, now research and development is important.   It is underlined that the dams, which are built more and more making use of the technology, are now constructed on less suitable spots. It is stated that because the dams directly affect security of life and property both during their construction and operation, risk calculations have to be made more carefully and meticulously and should be frequently checked. The last part of the chapter is spared for the reasons and factors of the insufficiencies in the dams. It is stated that the most effective issue in dam destruction is insufficiency. Structural destruction and performance destruction are discussed and it is stated that the dams are designed according to the concept of structural destruction. Factors creating the insufficiency are listed and explained with examples. In this context, examples of the dam accidents that arose due to the insufficiencies and lead to loss of life and property are given. In the Chapter 3, the subject of examining current dams and measurement tools in the fill dams are analyzed. Examination issues are stated and the importance of particularly the dam body is highlighted. Importance of anticipations in examination is stated. Concept of examination is divided into types and separate principles are explained.   The second part of the chapter is on measurement and measurement equipment. It is stated that through dam measurement devices, equipment are placed on the dam body or its several spots and it is possible to monitor dam's actions in time. In this context, dam measurement devices are listed and explained. Forms of the relevant equipment used in the worksite in fill dam construction are explained in figures. After that, the assessment and analysis procedures required as a result of the examinations and measurements are emphasized.   In the Chapter 4, the concept of risk is addressed and importance of risk in engineering is discussed. After explaining the concept of risk, possible risks to be encountered in the construction industry are stated. Risks in the construction industry are listed and measures to be taken against these risks are explained. Controllable and uncontrollable risks are explained and their dependence on the design, workmanship standard and quality of the used material is analyzed.   Complete and partial dependence of the risks in the construction sector are emphasized. The terms of static risk and <b>speculative</b> <b>risk</b> are explained. It is stated that the construction projects host several uncertainties arising from various factors. It is discussed that at this point, risk analysis is an essential fact. It is also stated that risk analysis has become compulsory for some projects and this type of projects are listed. The basic issue in risk analysis is that risk estimates have to be conducted realistically and the results have to be correctly interpreted and expressed concretely with a realistic approach. The last part of the chapter is spared for determining the risk groups for the dams. In this part, a risk potential classification table for the dams is given. Within the framework of the regarding table, dams have to be assigned risk points depending on their qualities and the area they affect. It is explained that as a result of the related points, risk class of the dams is revealed. In the Chapter 5, Atatürk Dam, which is the largest dam in Turkey, is introduced with its importance. The geodesic deformation measurement procedures for Atatürk Dam are explained. It is stated that the horizontal and vertical measurements are made with the classical or satellite based measurements conducted periodically on the deformation networks created for this purpose. Geodesic and non-geodesic measurements, as well as the tools used in these measurements are explained. It is stated that several deformation points are placed on the dam body and the regions to create movement with these points are selected. It is explained that the deformation network is created as a result of the relevant regions. Perpendicular movements arising as a result of the deformation network are given in table. Kriging method for calculating the perpendicular movements arising as a result of the deformation networks is explained in detail. Explanation of Kriging method is supported with an example. Via Surfer_ 10 software, perpendicular movements on Atatürk Dam are modeled with Kriging method. Coordinates and perpendicular movements in the deformation network are taken as basis in modeling. With the interpolation-based Kringing method, data on the dam body are obtained. Variation diagram of the created model is drawn. Efficiency of the model is calculated under a separate title. Values of the created model are compared with the data obtained from 15 th Regional Directorate of State Hydraulic Works. The difference arisen as a result of the assessment is explained and the required calculations are conducted. While making the calculations, a part is taken from the section of the dam posing risk on the dam crest. Then, 174 -month sitting graph is obtained for this section. 5 -year data from this graph is selected according to the model's period and analyzed. As a result, it is determined that the calculation provides 90. 71 % of reliability. In the Chapter 6, it is emphasized that as the dams are huge constructions, their designs have to be made very carefully and meticulously. It is stated that many people lose their lives due to dam destructions and serious damages occur. It was highlighted that for safe operation of the dams, they have to be monitored periodically throughout their lives.   In the last part of the section, the model created as a result of this study is analyzed. Sinking on Atatürk Dam's body that arose between May 2006 and December 2011 are assessed. Model's efficiency is emphasized. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} {{examines the}} presence of basis <b>risk,</b> <b>speculative</b> component, and expected maturity basis component in basis relationships for nonstorable commodities. The results indicate that all three above components exist in both cattle and hog markets. The basis <b>risk</b> and <b>speculative</b> components vary across contracts. Hog markets showed seasonality, which helps explain the hog basis more accurately. Flexibility in making the marketing decision strengthens the explanation of intertemporal price relationships for both cattle and hogs beyond that previously attributed to only feed prices.

Due to the intrinsic vagueness of speculative lan-guage, <b>speculative</b> requirements <b>risk</b> being misunderstood, and related uncertainty overlooked, and may benefit from careful treatment in the requirements engineering process. In this paper, we present a linguistically-oriented approach to automatic detec-tion of uncertainty in natural language (NL) requirements. Our approach comprises two stages. First we identify speculative sen-tences by applying a machine learning algorithm called Condi-tional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify uncertainty cues. The algorithm exploits a rich set of lexical and syntactic features extracted from requirements sentences. Second, we try to deter-mine the scope of uncertainty. We use a rule-based approach that draws on a set of hand-crafted linguistic heuristics to determine the uncertainty scope with the help of dependency structures present in the sentence parse tree. We report on a series of ex-periments we conducted to evaluate the performance and useful-ness of our system...|$|R
50|$|AIGA {{holds the}} belief that {{professional}} designers should be compensated fairly for their work. Also {{there should be an}} engagement with clients in which the ownership and use rights of the designer's intellectual and creative property are negotiated. To achieve that end, AIGA suggest that designers should enter into the projects of their clients with full engagement to show the true value of their creative endeavor. They should pay more attention when it comes to potential risks of entering into <b>speculative</b> work. The <b>risks</b> of <b>speculative</b> work make some designers feel the repulsion of Crowdsourcing Creative Work.|$|R

40|$|Derivatives are {{designed}} as complex financial instruments and their main {{aim is to}} manage the risk associated with the underlying asset, {{in order to ensure}} against fluctuations in value, or to profit from periods of inactivity, instability or decline. In recent years financial derivatives have experienced a fulminant development and also they have been perceived as an effective lever of the modern economy. The subprime crisis was triggered by a quite significant financial infrastructure glitch, which coalesced around certain factors influence, such as : highly permissive regulation of financial markets, <b>speculative</b> bubbles, underperforming <b>risk</b> management, liquidity injections and structural imbalances. Despite the fact that is a innovative segment and quite difficult affordable as understanding level of the operation mechanisms, financial derivatives were only the tool triggering this global dimension crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} contemporaneous, leading and lagging {{indicator}} properties of financial market variables relative to movements in six major developed country currency pairs. As indicator variables changes in various relative asset prices, short-term portfolio flows and currency options data are used. We find {{that changes in}} equity index differentials, short-term <b>speculative</b> flows and <b>risk</b> reversals on currency options prices exhibit consistent contemporaneous indicator properties and leading indicator properties for several currency pairs. Since 1999, changes in short-term interest rate differentials have gained importance as indicators. The best indicator variables explain over 50 % of monthly returns of the USD/EUR and GBP/USD exchange rates and over 60 % of the appreciation and depreciation episodes of the USD/EUR and JPY/EUR currency pairs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the dynamic hedging problem using three {{different}} utility specifications: stochastic differential utility, terminal wealth utility, and we propose a particular utility transformation connecting both previous approaches. In all cases, we assume Markovian prices. Stochastic differential utility, SDU, impacts the pure hedging demand ambiguously, but decreases the pure <b>speculative</b> demand, because <b>risk</b> aversion increases. We {{also show that}} consumption decision is, in some sense, independent of hedging decision. With terminal wealth utility, we derive a general and compact hedging formula, which nests as special all cases studied in Duffie and Jackson (1990). We then show how to obtain their formulas. With the third approach we find a compact formula for hedging, which makes the second-type utility framework a particular case, and show that the pure hedging demand is not impacted by this specification. In addition, with CRRA- and CARA-type utilities, the risk aversion increases and, consequently the pure speculative demand decreases. If futures price are martingales, then the transformation plays no {{role in determining the}} hedging allocation. We also derive the relevant Bellman equation for each case, using semigroup techniques...|$|R
