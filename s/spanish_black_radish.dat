The experiment was designed as completely randomized design in factoriaJ mode with 2 factors (levels of <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> tuber meal and methionine) and 4 replications. The result showed that the <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> tuber meal might be applied up to 24 " in grQwth period quail ration and the addition of 0. 2 % methionine to the ration resulted the better growth...|$|R
40|$|It was {{established}} that inclusion of <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> homogenate into model minced meat from different meat types (beef, pork, chicken) facilitates {{an increase in}} a degree of system hydrophilicity. In the experimental samples, the water binding capacity increased {{with an increase in}} the radish homogenate content at a level of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 % of meat weight. For example, in minced beef, it increased from 68 % (control) to 80 % (50 % of <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> homogenate), in minced pork from 55 to 73 %, in minced chicken from 72 to 82 %, respectively. An increase in water binding capacity in model minced meat was due to a pH shift from 5. 9 – 6. 05 to 6. 25 – 6. 43 (depending on a meat type) and the content of neutral salts in the dispersion system of the radish homogenate. An increase in moisture holding capacity was also established in model minced meat. The values varied from 10 % (models with minced chicken) to 25 % (minced pork) compared to control. In model minced meat, fibers and pectin substances of the <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> strongly bind water and act as a system stabilizer after thermal treatment. It was found that addition of the <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> homogenate in minced meat systems from different meat types increased the functional and technological indicators. </p...|$|R
40|$|In Mexico, Raphanus sativus L. var. niger (<b>black</b> <b>radish)</b> has {{uses for}} the {{treatment}} of gallstones and for decreasing lipids serum levels. We evaluate the effect of juice squeezed from <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> root in cholesterol gallstones and serum lipids of mice. The toxicity of juice was analyzed according to the OECD guidelines. We used female C 57 BL/ 6 mice fed with a lithogenic diet. We performed histopathological studies of gallbladder and liver, and measured concentrations of cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The juice can be considered bioactive and non-toxic; the lithogenic diet significantly induced cholesterol gallstones; increased cholesterol and triglycerides levels, and decreased HDL levels; gallbladder wall thickness increased markedly, showing epithelial hyperplasia and increased liver weight. After treatment with juice for 6 days, cholesterol gallstones were eradicated significantly in the gallbladder of mice; cholesterol and triglycerides levels decreased too, and there was also an increase in levels of HDL (P< 0. 05). Gallbladder tissue continued to show epithelial hyperplasia and granulocyte infiltration; liver tissue showed vacuolar degeneration. The juice of <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> root has properties for treatment of cholesterol gallstones and for decreasing serum lipids levels; therefore, we confirm in a preclinical study the utility that people give it in traditional medicine...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{antibacterial}} activity of chitosan coatings prepared with acetic or lactic acid, {{as well as}} of composite chitosan–gelatin films prepared with essential oils, was evaluated in fresh shredded <b>black</b> <b>radish</b> samples inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 and L. monocytogenes ATCC 19112 during seven days of storage at 4 °C.

All tested formulations of chitosan films exhibited strong antimicrobial activity on the growth of L. monocytogenes on <b>black</b> <b>radish,</b> although a higher inhibition of pathogens was achieved at higher concentrations of chitosan. The antimicrobial effect of chitosan films was even more pronounced with the addition of essential oils. Chitosan–gelatin films with thyme essential oils showed the most effective antimicrobial activity. A reduction of 2. 4 log 10 CFU/g for L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 and 2. 1 log 10 CFU/g for L. monocytogenes ATCC 19112 was achieved in the presence of 1 % chitosan film containing 0. 2 % of thyme essential oil after 24 h of storage...|$|R
