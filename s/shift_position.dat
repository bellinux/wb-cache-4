5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths <b>shift</b> <b>position.</b> This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply <b>shift</b> <b>position,</b> opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E
500|$|Biden's May 2012 {{statement}} that he was [...] "absolutely comfortable" [...] with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to President Obama's position, which had been described as [...] "evolving". Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to <b>shift</b> <b>position</b> several months later, in the build-up to the party convention, and since Biden had previously counseled the president to avoid the issue lest key Catholic voters be offended. Gay rights advocates seized upon the Biden stance, and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's unexpected remarks. Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out, while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart. The incident showed that Biden still struggled at times with message discipline; as Time wrote, [...] "everyone knows [...] Biden's greatest strength is also his greatest weakness." [...] Relations were also strained between the campaigns when Biden appeared to use his to bolster fundraising contacts for a possible run on his own in the 2016 presidential election, {{and the vice president}} ended up being excluded from Obama campaign strategy meetings.|$|E

2500|$|By late February, Vengeance was {{in need of}} boiler maintenance, so de Robeck {{transferred}} his flag to Irresistible while Vengeance went to Mudros for repairs. She {{had returned}} by 6 March, in time for another bombardment of the Ottoman defences; de Robeck again transferred his flag back to the ship for the operation. This time, the plan involved using Albion to spot for the powerful dreadnought battleship , which was to fire indirectly in the hopes of being able to neutralise the Ottoman guns at a range at which they could not respond. Vengeance and three other battleships covered Albion inside the straits. The ships quickly silenced the Ottoman guns at Dardanus, but mobile artillery batteries continually forced both Albion and Queen Elizabeth to <b>shift</b> <b>position,</b> largely preventing the latter from firing and the former from relaying corrections for the few shots Queen Elizabeth had been able to make. Nightfall and the lack of progress led to the operation being called off. Two days later, ...|$|E
60|$|He tried lying down, {{confined}} as {{the space}} was, and made out better, although {{his lips were}} cut and bleeding by having been forced so sharply against his teeth. But the worst was to come. One of his forepaws slipped out through the slats or bars and rested {{on the bottom of}} the wagon where the trunks were squeaking, screeching, and jigging. A rut in the roadway made the nearest trunk tilt one edge in the air and <b>shift</b> <b>position,</b> so that when it tilted back again it rested on Michael's paw. The unexpectedness of the crushing hurt of it caused him to yelp and at the same time instinctively and spasmodically to pull back with all his strength. This wrenched his shoulder and added to the agony of the imprisoned foot.|$|E
6000|$|Before Miller had {{recovered}} from the surprise of this, the table seemed to be grasped and shaken as if by a man of giant strength--and yet the cone and the books did not <b>shift</b> <b>position.</b> Hands patted the pillows on a sofa at Miller's right, and one of these cushions was flung against his chair. The room seemed to swarm with tricksy Pucks. At last the cone took flight again, and moved about freely among the heap of books and over Miller's head, while a variety of voices came successively from it, some of them speaking to Mrs. Miller and some to me. Several of the names given were known to Mrs. Miller, and a few were recognizable by me. They all claimed to be spirits of the dead with messages of good cheer for friends on [...] "the earth-plane," [...] {{but they were all}} rather vague and stereotyped. Once I thought I could see the cone passing between me and the window, high above the table. It seemed to float horizontally as if in water. Some of the spirits were too weak to raise the cone--so [...] "Wilbur" [...] said; too weak, even, to whisper.|$|E

50|$|Pitching an {{intentional}} ball, like point after touchdown in football {{and a free}} throw in basketball, is designed not to be automatic.
