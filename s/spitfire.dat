5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the <b>Spitfire</b> at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production <b>Spitfire,</b> K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important <b>Spitfire</b> components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the <b>Spitfire</b> being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the <b>Spitfire</b> into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the <b>Spitfire</b> be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and <b>Spitfire,</b> was a naval {{version of the}} <b>Spitfire</b> {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the <b>Spitfire</b> was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic <b>Spitfire</b> design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the <b>Spitfire,</b> the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard <b>Spitfire</b> airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E

5|$|Müncheberg {{was killed}} in action in his Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 16 381) on 23 March 1943 over Tunisia when his 135th victim, a USAAF 52nd Fighter Group <b>Spitfire</b> {{exploded}} {{in front of him}} after a close burst of cannon fire. The <b>Spitfire</b> was piloted by Captain Theodore Sweetman. Müncheberg managed to bail out and landed severely wounded. Although the search team quickly recovered him, Müncheberg died {{on the way to a}} field hospital. Captain Hugh L. Williamson, who was also shot down in the engagement, later stated that Sweetmann had deliberately rammed Müncheberg with his burning <b>Spitfire.</b> Müncheberg was buried originally at El Aouina; his remains were moved to the Heroes Cemetery at Tunis and later reinterred in the 1950s at the German Military Cemetery at Bordj-Cedria.
