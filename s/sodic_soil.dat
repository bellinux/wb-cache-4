50|$|At {{the lowest}} scale, the soil {{chemistry}} affects the aggregation or dispersal of soil particles. The clay particles contain polyvalent cations which give {{the faces of}} clay layers localized negative charges. At the same time, {{the edges of the}} clay plates have a slight positive charge, thereby allowing the edges to adhere to the negative charges on the faces of other clay particles or to flocculate (form clumps). On the other hand, when monovalent ions, such as sodium, invade and displace the polyvalent cations, they weaken the positive charges on the edges, while the negative surface charges are relatively strengthened. This leaves negative charge on the clay faces that repel other clay, causing the particles to push apart, and by doing, the flocculation of clay particles into larger, open assemblages. As a result, the clay disperses and settles into voids between peds, causing those to close. In this way the open structure of the soil is destroyed and the soil is made impenetrable to air and water. Such <b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> tends to form columnar structures near the surface.|$|E

Cottage cheese whey has an electrical conductivity (EC) of 6 - 10 dS m- 1, pH values of 4. 2 or less, low sodium adsorption ratios (SAR), and contains 40 - 50 g kg- 1 of readily decomposable organic matter.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effects of cottage cheese whey on the chemical and physical properties of a <b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> (SAR = 16. 3, EC = 3. 8, and pH 8. 3). Cottage cheese whey was applied to 300 -mm-deep <b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> columns at 0 -, 20 -, 40 -, and 80 -mm rates followed by 80, 60, 40, and 0 mm of distilled water, respectively.

All whey applications lowered the soil pH, SAR, and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) in both the upper and lower 150 -mm-depth increments. Aggregate stability in the surface 150 -mm-depth incre-ment increased from 11 % in the water-leached soil to 22 % in the 80 -mm whey-treated soil.

40|$|The {{byproducts}} of {{flue gas}} desulfurization (BFGD) are a useful external source of Ca 2 + for the reclamation of sodic soils {{because they are}} comparatively cheap, generally available and have high gypsum content. The ion solution composition of sodic soils also {{plays an important role}} in the reclamation process. The effect of BFGD on the soluble salts composition and chemical properties of sodic soils were studied in a soil column experiment. The experiment consisted of four treatments using two different sodic soils (<b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> I and <b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> II) and two BFGD rates. After the application of BFGD and leaching, the soil soluble salts were transformed from sodic salts containing Na 2 CO 3 and NaHCO 3 to neutral salts containing NaCl and Na 2 SO 4. The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), pH and electrical conductivity (EC) decreased at all soil depths, and more significantly in the top soil depth. At a depth of 0 – 40 cm in both <b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> I and <b>sodic</b> <b>soil</b> II, the SAR, EC and pH were less than 13, 4 dS m 21 and 8. 5, respectively. The changes in the chemical properties of the sodic soils reflected the changes in the ion composition of soluble salts. Leaching played a key role in the reclamation process and the reclamation effect was positively associated with the amount of leaching.

40|$|Soil {{salinity}} (high {{levels of}} water-soluble salt) and sodicity (high levels of exchangeable sodium), called collectively salt-affected soils, affect approximately 932 million ha of land globally. Saline and sodic landscapes {{are subjected to}} modified hydrologic processes which can impact upon soil chemistry, carbon and nutrient cycling, and organic matter decomposition. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, {{with the level of}} SOC an important measure of a soil’s health. Because the SOC pool is dependent on inputs from vegetation, the effects of salinity and sodicity on plant health adversely impacts upon SOC stocks in salt-affected areas, generally leading to less SOC. Saline and <b>sodic</b> <b>soils</b> are subjected to a number of opposing processes which affect the soil microbial biomass and microbial activity, changing CO 2 fluxes and the nature and delivery of nutrients to vegetation. <b>Sodic</b> <b>soils</b> compound SOC loss by increasing dispersion of aggregates, which increases SOC mineralisation, and increasing bulk density which restricts access to substrate for mineralisation. Saline conditions can increase the decomposability of soil organic matter but also restrict access to substrates due to flocculation of aggregates as a result of high concentrations of soluble salts. Saline and <b>sodic</b> <b>soils</b> usually contain carbonates, which complicates the carbon (C) dynamics.

On the other hand, gypsum application alone (25 - 100 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by only 3 %. These findings suggest that sodic soils could be ameliorated with the application of a low quantity of gypsum (25 - 100 kg/ha) combined with polyacrylamides (10 kg/ha).
