Thomson in 1881 that a charged sphere moving in a space filled with a medium of a <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> (the electromagnetic aether of James Clerk Maxwell), is harder {{to set in motion}} than an uncharged body. (Similar considerations were already made by George Gabriel Stokes (1843) with respect to hydrodynamics, who showed that the inertia of a body moving in an incompressible perfect fluid is increased.) So due to this self-induction effect, electrostatic energy behaves as having some sort of momentum and [...] "apparent" [...] electromagnetic mass, which can increase the ordinary mechanical mass of the bodies, or in more modern terms, the increase should arise from their electromagnetic self-energy. This idea was worked out in more detail by Oliver Heaviside (1889), Thomson (1893), George Frederick Charles Searle (1897), Max Abraham (1902), Hendrik Lorentz (1892, 1904), and was directly applied to the electron by using the Abraham–Lorentz force.

An analogous difference exists in the <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacities</b> already pointed out in a few substances (1278.) in the last paper.

Laws of Transmission through various lengths of one cable, by Fleeming Jenkin, Esq., communicated by C.

Part II. alas never appeared, but something that it would have included we can see from the following ominous statement which I find near the end of Part I.: 'From this value, the electrostatical capacity per unit of length and the <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the dielectric, could be determined. These points will, however, be more fully treated of {{in the second part of}} this paper.' Jenkin had in fact made a determination at Birkenhead of the <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of gutta-percha, or of the gutta-percha and Chatterton's compound constituting the insulation of the cable, on which he experimented. This was the very first true measurement of the <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of a dielectric which had been made after the discovery by Faraday of the existence of the property, and his primitive measurement of it for the three substances, glass, shellac, and sulphur; and at the time when Jenkin made his measurements the existence of <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> was either unknown, or ignored, or denied, by almost all the scientific authorities of the day.|$|E

It {{would seem}} {{in the cases}} of those bodies which suffer no change themselves, as sulphuric acid (and perhaps in all), that they affect water in its {{conducting}} power only as an electrolyte; for whether little or much improved, the decomposition is proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing (727. 730.), and the transfer is therefore due to electrolytic discharge. This is in accordance with the fact already stated as regards water (984.), that the conducting power is not improved for electricity of force below the electrolytic intensity of the substance acting as the dielectric; but both facts (and some others) are against the opinion which I formerly gave, that the power of salts, &c. might depend upon their assumption of the liquid state by solution in the water employed (410.).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} technique for the in vitro expansion of cord blood (CB) hematopoietic stem cells (SCs) seems to be their co-culture with stromal feeder-layers. Hence, we developed and immortalized by retroviral transduction with the temperature-sensitive SV 40 large T antigen three new human cell lines, two derived from bone marrow (HMI-SV 40 and HM 2 -SV 40) and one from umbilical cord (HCB 1 -SV 40), and investigated the <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of their conditioned culture media on clonal growth of CB hematopoietic SCs. Immunocytochemistry showed that cell lines were positive to either cytokeratins or stromal markers, as well as to epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and adrenomedullin. Moreover, cell lines expressed interleukin (IL) -Ibeta, IL- 6, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF and stem cell factor (SCF), and secreted variable amount of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6 and GM-CSF. Collectively, these findings indicate that cell lines possess the stromal-cell phenotype. The conditioned supernatants of the three cell lines induced similar increases in the clonal growth of both fresh and cryopreserved-thawed CB hematopoietic SCs cultured on semisolid media deprived of growth factors and cytokines. However, the <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> was significantly higher in the case of cryopreserved cells, where the rise in clonal growth reached that induced by the addition to the culture media of IL- 3, GM-CSF and SCF.

Competent larvae of serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans can {{be induced}} to settle and {{metamorphose}} by single or multiple-species of bacterial biofilms. Previous experiment showed that Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea (HI 1) {{is one of}} very good inductive strains. Total 4 open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of P. luteoviolacea (HI 1) were identified to be essential for the <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of P. luteroviolacea (HI 1) by transposon mutagenesis or allelic replacement. These 4 ORFs were clustered {{in a very long}} operon containing at least 7 ORFs and a length of 16, 622 bp. Quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR (q-RT-PCR) was applied to compare the expression of the identified ORFs between planktonic and biofilm phases of P. luteoviolacea (HI 1). None of the inductive ORFs exhibited differential expression between biofilm and planktonic phases. To understand the function of genes that confer larval settlement-inducing capacity to biofilms of P. luteoviolacea (HI 1), major biofilm characteristics, such as biofilm bacterial density, biofilm thickness, biofilm biomass and EPS biomass, were investigated in biofilms composed of P. luteoviolacea (HI 1) and seven deletion mutants made from this species. The results showed that there are not significantly different between biofilm of wild type P. luteroviolacea (HI 1) and its 7 deletion mutants in the characteristics invested above, suggesting that physical characteristics of biofilms are not critical to the <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of P. luteoviolacea (HI 1), and that essential inductive molecular components are missing in the non-inductive deletion mutant strains...|$|R

The substance when fused was perfectly clear, pellucid, and free from particles of dirt (1267.), so that no interference of small conducting bodies confused the result. The substance when solid is an excellent insulator, and by experiment was found to take up, with great slowness, that state (1244. 1242.) which alone seemed likely to disturb the conclusion. The experiments themselves, also, were free from any need of correction. Yet notwithstanding these circumstances, so favourable to the exclusion of error, the result is a higher <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> for sulphur than for any other body as yet tried; and though this may in part be clue to the sulphur being in a better shape, i.e. filling up more completely the space o, o, (fig. 104.) than the cups of shell-lac and glass, still I feel satisfied that the experiments altogether fully prove the existence of a difference between dielectrics as to their power of favouring an inductive action through them; which difference may, for the present, be expressed by the term <b>specific</b> <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

If any such difference should exist, it appeared to me not only of high importance in the further comprehension of the laws and results of induction, but an additional and very powerful argument for the theory I have ventured to put forth, that the whole depends upon a molecular action, in contradistinction to one at sensible distances.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe apical {{ectodermal}} ridge (AER) is {{a specialized}} thickening of the distal limb mesenchyme {{that has been}} demonstrated to support limb outgrowth and proper limb development. The homeobox gene, Max- 1, {{is associated with the}} distal limb mesenchyme (progress zone) and its expression depends upon the presence of the AER in chick limbs. We demonstrate here that the expression of Max- 1 is dependent upon the limb ectoderm in the mouse, but that the <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of murine limb ectoderm is not restricted to the AER. Msx- 1 can also he maintained in limb mesenchyme by the substitution of FGF 4 for the ectoderm; however, we see that local cell-cell interactions are required for high levels of expression. Disruption of cell-call interactions in the limb mesenchyme results in a dramatic decrease in Msx- 1 levels and a precocious expression of MyoD 1, suggesting that the limb environment represses differentiation and promotes cell proliferation during early development. BMP 4 and FGF 2 can also maintain Msx- 1 expression in limb mesenchyme as well as retinoic acid which is usually associated with polarizing activity in the early limb. Max- 2 expression {{does not appear to be}} dependent upon cell-cell interactions as measured in these experiments. Taken together, our data suggest that the expression of Max- 1, but not Max- 2, not only requires factors from the limb ectoderm, but also relies upon cues from local cell interactions and that the spatial distribution of <b>inductive</b> <b>capacities</b> in limb ectoderm differs between the avian and murine systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{the eggs}} of the newt, Triturus pyrrhogaster, 2 {{separate}} factors are recognized which {{take part in}} cleavage furrow formation. (1) The <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> for the furrow formation by the cytoplasm lying under the cortex along the cleavage furrow (FIC); and (2) the reactivity of the overlying cortex to form a furrow in response to FIC. (1) FIC. The <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> is shown {{by the fact that}} FIC induces a furrow on which-ever part of the surface under which FIC is transplanted. FIC is distributed along the cleavage furrow and even extends along the future furrow plane ahead of the furrow tip. The distance FIC precedes the furrow tip is about 10 mm in the animal hemisphere and is less in the vegetal hemisphere. In the direction at right angles to the furrow plane, FIC does not spread more than 01 mm. FIC is also present in the eggs of Xenopus laevis. Species specificity of FIC for induction is not found between Triturus and Xenopus. (2) Surface layer. At the onset of the first cleavage, the reactivity of the cortex to form the furrow in answer to FIC induction is localized on the animal pole region. The reactivity of the cortex propagates medially as a belt along the surface towards the vegetal pole with the advanc-ing tip of the cleavage furrow. After the furrow is completed, the reactivity begins to be lost from the animal pole region, and eventually over the entire surface. The reactivity, however, reappears on the animal pole region simultaneously with the second cleavage...|$|R

In such solid {{bodies as}} glass, lac, sulphur, &c., the {{particles}} {{appear to be}} able to become polarized in all directions, for a mass when experimented upon so as to ascertain its <b>inductive</b> <b>capacity</b> in three or more directions (1690.), gives no indication of a difference. Now as the particles are fixed in the mass, and as the direction of the induction through them must change with its change relative to the mass, the constant effect indicates that they can be polarized electrically in any direction. This accords with the view already taken of each particle as a whole being a conductor (1669.), and, as an experimental fact, helps to confirm that view.|$|R

On removing the shell-lac the gold leaves attracted each other; on introducing the shell-lac between A and C this attraction was increased, (as had been anticipated from theory,) and the leaves came together, though not more than four inches long, and hanging three inches apart.|$|E
