40|$|Many {{applications}} require {{exploration of}} alternative scenarios; most support it poorly. Subjunctive interfaces provide mechanisms for the parallel setup, viewing {{and control of}} scenarios, aiming to support users ’ thinking about and interaction with their choices. We illustrate how applications for information access, real-time simulation, and document design may be extended with these mechanisms. To investigate the usability of this form of extension, we compare a <b>simple</b> <b>census</b> browser against a version with a subjunctive interface. In {{the first of three}} studies, subjects reported higher satisfaction with the subjunctive interface, and relied less on interim marks on paper. No reduction in task completion time was found, however, mainly because some subjects encountered problems in setting up and controlling scenarios. At the end of a second, fivesession study, users of a redesigned interface completed tasks 27 % more quickly than with the simple interface. In the third study we examined how subjects reasoned about multiple-scenario setups in pursuing complex, open-ended data explorations. Our main observation was that subjects treated scenarios as information holders, using them creatively in various ways to facilitate task completion...|$|E
40|$|Background Malnutrition and {{infections are}} {{widespread}} {{in almost all}} developing countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigating prevalence and some of the determinants of malnutrition and intestinal parasitic infections among preschool children in Shahroud, Iran. Materials and Methods At across-sectional study, the all preschool children (1, 850 cases), in Shahroud city as <b>simple</b> <b>census,</b> were selected. General information was collected using questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with the children’s parent. Stool specimens, collected fresh in paper cups, were examined by formalin-ether concentration.   Also, the adhesive cellophane tape method was used to diagnose oxyuriasis. The nutritional status of the children’s was determined based on anthropometrics. Data were analyzed using the SPSS. Results The prevalence of malnutrition, based on weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height was 6. 7, 5. 8 and 7. 7 %, respectively. A third of children (35. 1 %) had parasites infections, including 22. 8 % pathogenic parasites and 26. 4 % non-pathogenic and 35. 5 % of children were infected to oxyuris. The prevalence of parasite infection in the boys (51. 1 %) was significantly higher than the girls (42. 3 %)). Also, a significant relationship was found between malnutrition (height-for-age) and parasitic infections (...|$|E

However, in certain countries {{the value of the}} census - the instrument normally used for this purpose - has been questioned, either because it is regarded as an intrusion on privacy, or because of its complexity and cost. Population registers have increasingly come {{to be used as a}} substitute for, or complement to, a <b>simpler</b> <b>census,</b> or large-scale sample surveys to limit the number of questions which needed to be answered by respondents, to supplement the information available in population registers, or even to replace the census when it could not be taken on the stipulated date. These different methods of data collection have led to many difficulties (e. g. in definitions of residence, marital status, or household type) and the quality of the results obtained has differed in different countries. It is more than ever necessary to strive for international standardization in this area...|$|R
40|$|Populations of the Heike firefly, Luciola lateralis, a {{representative}} species of Japan's traditional agricultural landscape (known as satoyama), have recently experienced rapid declines {{in many areas}} of Japan. Owing to the popularity of this firefly, many local communities have increased conservation efforts through the restoration of aquatic habitat complexes in satoyama. To provide fundamental parameters to predict population dynamics of the firefly, we conducted a mark-recapture study in restored paddy fields, and we estimated adult population parameters such as population size, survival, recruitment, sex ratio, and body size. We found that capture probability generally decreased as the season advanced, probably because of seasonal changes in detectability and/or firefly behavior. The daily survival rate of adults decreased over the season and may be related to a seasonal decline in adult body size. Adult population exhibited a highly male-biased sex ratio. Firefly abundance in the restored paddy fields doubled during the 4 -year study period. Our analysis showed that adult detectability, recruitment, and survival rate are seasonally variable and could affect population size estimates obtained by a <b>simple</b> flash <b>census.</b> The mark-recapture technique can provide precise estimates of adult L. lateralis population characteristics and, thus, is a valuable method for predicting firefly populations and assessing the success of the restoration program. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Every country {{keeps track}} of the {{literacy}} percentage which is expressed for all {{the men and women}} of the country and the region they belong. This statistic gives a broad view of the educational accessibility to the people, indicating how much of the population is lacking education and how much of them are advanced in terms of education. Literacy is a reasonably good indicator of development in any society. For the purpose of census, a person aged seven and above, who can both read and write with any understanding in any language, is treated as literate. It can play a vital role in the overall development of a country or a region and the effect of literacy is reflected in quality of people. The literate population grew nearly three fold during the 1961 – 2011 period, by nearly 45 per cent both India and Karnataka. The literacy rate is not uniform allover Karnataka there is huge disparities in terms of regions and gender and performance in northern Karnataka region is worst. Hence, the present study attempts to examine the disparities of literacy rate in Karnataka using 2001 and 2011 <b>census,</b> <b>simple</b> statistical techniques are used to examine the data and GIS techniques was used for the spatial analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|Office {{buildings}} must {{be improved}} to make major gains in reducing U. S. building energy use. Energy benchmarking offers initial building energy performance assessment without rigorous evaluation. ‘‘Seeing’’ that building energy use is excessive, {{is the first}} step to change. Energy benchmarks based on the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) are investigated in support of the U. S. Department of Energy’s Energy Partnerships program. The 1992 CBECS database is used to develop distributions of electric energy use intensities (EUIs) in office buildings for the nine U. S. census divisions. Individual building EUIs can be compared to these distributions as an indication of building energy performance. Median EUIs are less sensitive to individual building EUIs when groups of buildings are benchmarked to one another or to census division statistics. Excessive individual EUIs (exceeding 100 kWh/sqft) strongly influence averages in the CBECS database and in local sampling. Based on limited comparisons, however, both census division average and median EUIs are not reliable indicators for more localized EUIs. Stepwise linear regression modeling was used to identify the strongest determinants of office building energy use intensities. Statistically significant relations were found between building EUIs and several CBECS variables. Beyond floor area, the most dominant variables were the number of workers, number of personal computers, owner-occupancy, operating hours, and the presence of an economizer or chiller. The resulting performance models can be used to predict EUIs that are much better benchmarks than <b>simple</b> <b>census</b> division statistics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how much influence the SES of parents has on students’ achievements in the Awutu-Senya and Effutu Educational Directorates of the Central Region of Ghana. The {{study focused on}} parents’ financial status, educational qualifications, jobs, enabling learning environment provided by parents {{and the type of}} school attended and how these affected students’ achievements. The study adopted a cross sectional and a multi-site case study designs. The population consisted of school officials, teachers, students of SHS and parents in the Awutu Senya and Effutu Educational Districts in the Central Region of Ghana. A sample size of 531 respondents was chosen for the study. The instruments used in the data collection were questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, direct observation and secondary data. A range of sampling techniques from <b>simple</b> random, purposive, <b>census,</b> to cluster sampling techniques was adopted in selecting the participants. The researcher used descriptive and inferential statistics in presenting the data. Respondents agreed that parents’ financial circumstances affected students’ academic achievements in the study area. Respondents were of the opinion that learning environment provided by parents at home determined the academic achievements of students. The study found that students from high socio-economic homes were provided with most of the materials they needed to succeed in their education than their counterparts. Respondents agreed to some extent with the assumption that educational qualifications of parents influenced students’ academic success. They argued that parents’ educational attainments enhanced home environment for students’ learning. The study made original contributions by highlighting parents’ financial difficulties they faced in promoting their children’s education, isolating some of the influences of SES of parents on students’ learning and providing policy implications. The study recommends that Government of Ghana should expand its youth training programme on skills acquisition to cover all categories of people who desire skills...|$|R
40|$|Stereo {{matching}} is {{a passive}} method for estimating depth {{of a scene}} from two views from different perspectives. Parallax creates a disparity between the relative positions of scene points on the imaging planes depending on {{the distance of the}} points. The principle of stereo matching is to extract those disparities by finding the corresponding points between the images. Although stereo matching has been extensively studied, the existing solutions are still compromises between computational load and achieved quality. In this thesis, advances are made on both fronts. At the core of the matching algorithm is the similarity measure, which directly determines how well correspondences are found and how reliable they are. Traditionally, matching has been done in spatial domain using pixel differences such as sum of absolute differences (SAD). In this thesis, a similarity measure is proposed for use in stereo matching that is based on analysis of coefficient signs of transform domain representations. While originally formulated as an extension of Fourier domain phase-only correlation to the discrete cosine transform (DCT), here the method is developed further by applying it to a number of real-valued abstract harmonic transforms, including type II DCT, integer DCT, Walsh-Hadamard and a modified version of Haar. Results are presented showing that the method in general provides better quality than the reference algorithm SAD, while Haar is shown to be the best performing transform, both in terms of quality and speed. Furthermore, the approach is adapted to a mobile platform by replacing the transform with an even <b>simpler</b> one, the <b>census</b> transform. An efficient implementation is developed, which utilizes the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) enabled NEON core included in many ARM processors currently dominating the mobile market. Special attention is paid to the alternate methods of performing a population count on a variable, which is a key component in computing the similarities. Subjective testing along with numerical measurements set the census-based matching slightly under the reference point SAD in terms of quality, but speed-wise SAD is clearly out-performed by the census approach, thus establishing it as a competitive candidate for stereo matching in mobile applications...|$|R
