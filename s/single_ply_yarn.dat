5000|$|Yarn is {{composed}} of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These strands of yarn are twisted together (plied) {{in the opposite direction}} to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either s&#8209;twist (the threads appear to go [...] "up" [...] to the left) or z&#8209;twist (to the right). For a <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.|$|E
50|$|A typical bottom whorl spindle has the spun <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> {{above the}} whorl instead of below it like top whorl drop {{spindles}}. Bottom whorl spindles are the preferred spindle for plying yarn. Turkish drop spindles {{have a low}} whorl spindle that have two arms that intersect to make a cross. Like other drop spindles it is spun and then it hangs while the wool is being drafted and the twist travels up the wool. When winding the spun yarn on to the arms it usually is put over and under the arms on the spindle. Even though it turns much more slowly than winding onto a regular spindle it creates a center pull ball of yarn.|$|E

Innovation has occurred through the introduction of compact spinning, which offers superior quality and better fiber utilization.

This study focused on the investigation of the effect of changing the fiber properties through controlling noil percentage on the structure parameters of compact <b>single</b> and <b>plies</b> <b>yarns.</b> From the analysis of the results, the optimum combing noil percentage for the production of Quality fine compact yarns at 5 % Uster level for <b>single</b> or <b>ply</b> <b>yarns</b> can be achieved...|$|R

The single roller as well as the shorter bed on the spinning machine result in less twist to the <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> than other <b>yarns,</b> giving a variance in thickness along its length.|$|R
50|$|In 1872, a {{group of}} men in Colbert County, {{including}} N. F. Cherry, organized the Mountain Mill Company. The company was organized with the intent of building a cotton mill to produce thread and cloth. The Globe Factory in Florence, Alabama was burned by troops from the 10th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry in 1863 and rebuilt as the Cypress Mill. After the Cypress Mill closed in 1886, some of its machinery and employees became part of the Mountain Mills operations. The steam-powered mill commenced operations in 1886 under the ownership of W. H. Cherry & Co. The mill contained 6,000 spindles, 41 cards, and produced <b>single</b> and <b>ply</b> <b>yarn.</b> The yarn was sold in Philadelphia, New York City, and Providence, Rhode Island. The community was home to over 300 people, and contained a church and school. In 1893, the mill at Mountain Mills closed. The machinery was moved to Florence and became part of the Cherry Cotton Mill.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} twists per inch can, in <b>plied</b> <b>yarns,</b> be {{determined}} by {{counting the number of}} bumps in one inch, and divide by the number of <b>singles</b> (the strands <b>plied</b> together to make the yarn).

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> depend {{on both the}} {{mechanical properties}} of the single yarns making up the <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> {{and the structure of}} the <b>ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> that is, how the single yarns are assembled to create the <b>ply</b> <b>yarn.</b> Similarly, the mechanical properties of the single yarns depend on the mechanical properties of the fibers that constitute the single yarns and the structure of the single yarns.

30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double <b>plied</b> <b>yarn</b> had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to <b>single</b> <b>plied</b> <b>yarn</b> fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R

50|$|While {{this method}} {{works very well}} with <b>plied</b> <b>yarns,</b> <b>singles</b> don't have bumps to count. One way to {{determine}} the tpi for a single is to add a contrasting color fibre when spinning it, and then {{count the number of}} times the contrasting fibre has wrapped around the yarn. Another method is to measure an inch of yarn and untwist it, counting how many full revolutions it takes until there is no twist left. This can be done by inserting two paper-clips into the yarn, at an inch apart, thus making it easier to count a full revolution. A less precise method is to allow the <b>single</b> to <b>ply</b> against itself: the resulting two <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> is about half the number of twists per inch of the single. Thus one can roughly find the number of twists per inch for the single, or one can use the doubled back yarn as a measure.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{examination}} of weft-faced compound non-silk fabrics found in Egypt (ca. 3 rd - 7 th century A. D.), in the Royal Ontario Museum collections, revealed many structural differences and similarities. <b>Single,</b> double and <b>ply</b> <b>yarns</b> with apparent variation {{in size and}} set density were observed. Some have their twist in 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 direction, others in 2 ̆ 2 Z 2 ̆ 2 direction, with diverse amount of twist. Wool yarns make {{up the majority of}} the constructions, but in many cases wool yarns alternate with cotton and sometimes linen yarns. Tabby and 1 / 2 twill weaves are employed as binding weaves, while the compound weave structures comprise 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ratios of inner-warp to binding-warp ends. These variations provide a very interesting spectrum of textures executed in varying degrees of design complexity. The existence of many variables creates a necessity to seek: a quantitative and systematic methodology, through which identification, classification and interpretation of technical data would be possible. Reconstruction of weaving technologies has been selected as the principal criterion for the research. It requires analysis which must be detailed enough to determine the technological range of variations, and to indicate how and why weavers of different groups of civilization manipulated their weaving techniques. This paper mainly discusses the aspects considered in developing a protocol which records and confirms objectively the structural and technical parameters of the textiles under study. 1. 0. 0. The Objective: Concept and Rational A protocol for reconstructing early weaving technologies should consist of indispensable attributes to impart an integral system, thus elucidating the weaving details and mode of fabrication. It should not be devised for the mere gathering of technical data, but it should enclose a system organizing and employing these data to deal with basic and imperative questions. The data would provide information on what types of material were used; indicate how these materials were assembled in a textile form; and be utilized to explain why materials and processes changed at certain times of history in a certain way, in addition to what can be learned from textiles as to the resources, skills and knowledge of those who made it. Thus, further distinctions of early textiles can be drawn, not only on the basis of elements related to their outer appearance, but also by the indispensable attributes of their inner structures...|$|R
