40|$|Network based intruders seldom attack {{directly}} {{from their own}} hosts but rather stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones ” to conceal their identity and origin. To track down and apprehend those perpetrators behind <b>stepping</b> <b>stones,</b> it is critically important {{to be able to}} correlate connections through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Tracing intruders behind <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> and correlating intrusion connections through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> are challenging due to various readily available evasive countermeasures by intruders: • Installing and using backdoor relays (i. e. netcat) at intermediate <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to evade logging of normal logins. • Using different types of connections (i. e.

40|$|Acoustic metronomes {{and visual}} targets {{have been used}} in {{rehabilitation}} practice to improve pathological gait. In addition, they may be instrumental in evaluating and training instantaneous gait adjustments. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of two cue types in inducing gait adjustments, viz. acoustic temporal cues in the form of metronome beeps and visual spatial cues in the form of projected <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Twenty healthy elderly (aged 63. 2  ±  3. 6  years) were recruited to walk on an instrumented treadmill at preferred speed and cadence, paced by either metronome beeps or projected <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Gait adaptations were induced using two manipulations: by perturbing the sequence of cues and by imposing switches from one cueing type to the other. Responses to these manipulations were quantified in terms of step-length and step-time adjustments, the percentage correction achieved over subsequent steps, and the number of steps required to restore the relation between gait and the beeps or <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> The results showed that perturbations in a sequence of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> were overcome faster than those in a sequence of metronome beeps. In switching trials, switching from metronome beeps to <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> was achieved faster than vice versa, indicating that gait was influenced more strongly by the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> than the metronome beeps. Together these results revealed that, in healthy elderly, the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> induced gait adjustments more effectively than did the metronome beeps. Potential implications for the use of metronome beeps and <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> in gait rehabilitation practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Locating {{the real}} {{source of the}} Internet attacks {{has long been an}} {{important}} but difficult problem to be addressed. In the real world, attackers can easily hide their identities and evade punishment by relaying their attacks through a series of compromised systems or devices called <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Currently, researchers mainly use similar features from the network traffic, such as packet timestamps and frequencies, to detect <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> However, these features can be easily destroyed by attackers using evasive techniques. In addition, it is also difficult to implement an appropriate threshold of similarity that can help justify the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> In order to counter these problems, in this paper, we introduce the consistent causality probability to detect the <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> We formulate the ranges of abnormal causality probabilities according to the different network conditions, and on the basis of it, we further implement to self-adaptive methods to capture <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> To evaluate our proposed detection methods, we adopt theoretic analysis and empirical studies, which demonstrate accuracy of the abnormal causality probability. Moreover, we compare our proposed methods with previous works. The result shows that our methods in this paper significantly outperform previous works in the accuracy of detection malicious <b>stepping</b> <b>stones,</b> even when evasive techniques are adopted by attackers...|$|R

In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.|$|E

5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> to higher office.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant governor, admitting {{that he considered}} the office a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> to some day becoming governor. He was elected, but experienced a poor relationship with Governor Wallace Wilkinson throughout their four-year terms. Jones was elected governor in 1991, turning back a challenge from Governor Wilkinson's wife Martha in the Democratic primary. (Wilkinson was ineligible to succeed himself in office.) Although Jones maintained a strained relationship with the Kentucky General Assembly following comments he made {{in the wake of}} the federal Operation Boptrot investigation, he was still able to pass much of his agenda, including an amendment that would allow state officials to succeed themselves in office once. (Jones was able to secure passage of the amendment by exempting the state's sitting officials, including himself.) However, he achieved only a partial victory on his top priority– health care reform. While the legislature acceded to many of Jones' proposals, such as eliminating the practice of denying insurance coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, they did not approve his mandate for universal health care for all Kentuckians. Following his term in office, Jones founded the Kentucky Equine Education Project. He considered running for governor again in 2003, but never formally became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about the biogeography of the spinosaurids. Since Suchomimus was {{more closely related to}} Baryonyx (from Europe) than to Spinosaurus—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting. Sereno et al. proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the supercontinent Pangea, but split {{with the opening of the}} Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwanaland) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with Suchomimus the result of a single north-to-south dispersal event. It has also been suggested that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to have replaced the former in Africa. In 2006, it was demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous; some researchers have argued that the Iberian region was a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and Australia indicate that it may have been complex.|$|E
