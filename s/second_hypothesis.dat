In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the <b>second</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E

The <b>second</b> <b>hypothesis</b> suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved convergently on the two separate islands. The third suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue plumage.|$|E
5|$|Clement criticizes Greek paganism in the Protrepticus on {{the basis}} that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery {{religions}} for their obscurantism and trivial rituals. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's toys. He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this <b>second</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, {{on the grounds that they}} at least saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A <b>second</b> <b>hypothesis</b> suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that the virus is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E

25|$|Understanding {{how these}} troughs {{formed in the}} young Raditladi basin could provide an {{important}} indicator of processes that acted relatively recently in Mercury’s geologic history. There are two main theories of graben formation. The first is that they represent a surface manifestation of ring dikes or cone sheets. Both types of structures form when magma from a deep reservoir intrudes into the overlying rocks along conical or cylindrical fractures. The <b>second</b> <b>hypothesis</b> holds that the graben formed {{as a result of}} the floor uplift caused by the weight of the smooths plains outside the crater. Such plains are indeed present to the north and east of Raditladi, although their thickness and age are not known.|$|E

40|$|The <b>second</b> touch <b>hypothesis</b> {{states that}} T cell activation, proliferation, {{induction}} of homing receptors and polarization are distinguishable and, {{at least in}} part, sequential. The <b>second</b> touch <b>hypothesis</b> maintains that full T cell polarization requires T cell interaction with antigen-presenting cells (DCs, macrophages, B cells and certain activated stromal cells) in the non-lymphoid tissue where the antigen resides. Upon initial antigen encounter in peripheral lymph nodes (PLN), T cells become activated, proliferate and express homing receptors {{that enable them to}} recirculate to the (inflamed) tissue that contains the antigen. Differentiation into the T helper lineages Th 1, Th 2, Th 17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) requires additional antigen presentation by tissue macrophages and other antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the inflamed tissue.

2500|$|Detective Ron Phillips {{testified that}} when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, Simpson sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Detective Tom Lange testified that Brown was {{probably}} killed first because the soles of her bare feet were clean, implying that she was struck {{down to the ground}} before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Detective Lange, Cochran proposed two hypotheses for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one, or more, drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted cocaine abuser.

40|$|Intra-abdominal {{infections are}} a common entity faced by general surgeons, which, when {{complicated}} by pneumonia lead to increased mortality. The susceptibility to a second infection is correlated with impaired polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) migration to the remote site, perhaps due to inadequate PMN number. We tested the <b>second</b> front <b>hypothesis</b> that the elevated mortality arising from a second infection is due to insufficient circulating PMN, the majority being sequestered at the first site of infection. Further, augmentation of systemic PMN number by {{granulocyte colony stimulating factor}} (G-CSF) will decrease mortality. We established a murine model for peritonitis and pneumonia. PMN counts in the blood, lung tissue, peritoneal cavity and bronchoalveolar system were measured.

40|$|Abstract Using {{data from}} the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study, this paper compares the {{partners}} of economically successful women with those {{of women who have}} fared less well on the labor market. Economic success is measured as belonging to the top ten percent income bracket of the female sample. First, socioeconomic and cultural homogamy/asymmetry are investigated. With respect to education, homogamy is the dominant pattern. Income asymmetry, where husbands contribute most to the household income, characterizes the majority of couples, particularly in the older age groups. Gender asymmetry in cultural resources is predominant, with women having more modern gender role attitudes than men. <b>Second,</b> <b>hypotheses</b> derived from social capital theory and companionate theory are tested to examine how socioeconomic and cultural characteristics of male partners are related to women’s economic success.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to test two {{hypotheses}} on the relationship between religiosity and war-related distress in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The article is based on a representative survey (n 3, 313) in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 2003 – 2004. The questionnaire included 15 items on war-related distress and 13 items on war experiences. From these items we developed a war-related distress scale, a war experiences scale, and several measures of religiosity. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the war-related distress symptoms on the one hand, and religiosity and war experience on the other hand, controlling for a range of other variables. Religious beliefs and religious stability seem to protect against war-related distress, but religious activity works in the opposite direction to increase war-related distress. In conclusion, we found weak support for the first hypothesis, although the effects of religiosity on war-related distress seem more complex than expected. Our <b>second</b> <b>hypotheses,</b> that religiosity may work as a buffer to dampen the effects of war experiences on war-related distress, found no support...|$|R
