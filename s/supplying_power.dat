5|$|By about 19:30, Marlboroughs pumps had {{contained}} the flooding in the boiler rooms {{but she took}} {{on a list of}} around 7–8degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently shored up. Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, {{one of two}} {{feeder lines}} <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to the New Haven Line failed, while the other feeder was {{disabled}} for service. The lack of electrical power disrupted trains on Amtrak and Metro-North Railroad, which share the segment in New York State.|$|E
25|$|An {{uninterrupted}} {{power supply}} (UPS) provides emergency power and, depending on the topology, provide line regulation as well to connected equipment by <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> from a separate source when utility power is not available. Unlike a standby generator, it can provide instant protection from a momentary power interruption.|$|E
50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R

Some common connection mechanisms were side-lever, steeple, walking beam and direct-acting (see following sections).|$|E

25|$|On the anode side, {{hydrogen}} diffuses to the anode catalyst {{where it}} later dissociates into protons and electrons. These protons often react with oxidants {{causing them to}} become what are {{commonly referred to as}} multi-facilitated proton membranes. The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit (<b>supplying</b> <b>power)</b> because the membrane is electrically insulating. On the cathode catalyst, oxygen molecules react with the electrons (which have traveled through the external circuit) and protons to form water.|$|E
25|$|The A class rebuild {{contract}} was let in January 1983 to Clyde Engineering in Rosewater, South Australia. The first entered service in May 1984, but {{the project was}} abandoned in mid 1985 after rising costs due to structural fatigue. The 11th rebuild was delivered in August 1985. The N class were a new-build locomotive, mechanically similar to the A class. The major difference was the addition of head end power units, as it was believed this was a more efficient way of <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> for air-conditioning and lighting than power vans or axle driven generator sets under carriages.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{was a very}} keen angler, {{and while}} fishing on the River Dee at Dentdale in the Pennines, he saw a {{waterwheel}} in action, <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to a marble quarry. It struck Armstrong {{that much of the}} available power was being wasted. When he returned to Newcastle, he designed a rotary engine powered by water, and this was built in the High Bridge works of his friend Henry Watson. Unfortunately, little interest was shown in the engine. Armstrong subsequently developed a piston engine instead of a rotary one and decided that it might be suitable for driving a hydraulic crane. In 1846 his work as an amateur scientist was recognized when he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E
25|$|Laser power beaming was {{envisioned by}} some at NASA as a {{stepping}} stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily {{on the development of}} a solar-powered laser. In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991 the SELENE project (SpacE Laser ENErgy) had begun, which included the study of laser power beaming for <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{pollution}} {{is expected to}} occur in some areas with the adoption of PHEVs, but most areas will experience a decrease. A study by the ACEEE predicts that widespread PHEV use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result {{in an increase in}} local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, given emissions levels from most coal plants currently <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to the grid. Although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants, the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity. The net effect on {{pollution is}} dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid (fossil or renewable, for example) and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves. Identifying, regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plant—or replacing a plant altogether—may also be more practical. From a human health perspective, shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage.|$|E

These have become more commonplace but are usually minor; warning signage to alert motorists that trams are operating has been erected at the start of each season in recent times, but incidents still occur. There are many occupation crossings, some with restricted visibility for motorists. The most recent incident took place on Monday, 27 July 2009, when a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with the overhead wires <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to both the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway at a busy road crossing in Laxey; there were no injuries. Police and the line's electrical engineering crews attended the scene, the report also said. It did not indicate what damage had occurred.

An investigation into the incident was scheduled to take place later.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the quake}} was located several miles offshore, {{moderate}} to very strong shaking was reported as far inland as Tokyo, about 333km (207mi) from its epicentre. Upon {{the detection of}} the earthquake, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning for Miyagi Prefecture, as well as tsunami alerts for Iwate Prefecture, Fukushima Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, Ibaraki Prefecture and the Pacific Rim. Waves of between 0.5 and 1m were anticipated, and residents along coastal areas were urged to evacuate. All warnings and alerts were canceled within 90minutes, however. The tremor caused widespread power outages, with power still not restored to some 3.6million households across several prefectures by 8April. Nuclear power plants within the region also suffered from the outages; two of three power lines <b>supplying</b> <b>power</b> to fuel coolers were cut off at the Onagawa power plant. Radioactive water consequently leaked out of spent fuel pools at three of its reactors, though {{no change in the}} radiation levels outside the plant was reported. Five coal-powered power plants also shut down, adding to concerns over energy shortages. Fukushima I power plant, which had earlier been struck by the 11 March quake, evacuated its workers as a safety precaution, but the plant sustained no damage.|$|E
