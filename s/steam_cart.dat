5000|$|Mann's Patent <b>Steam</b> <b>Cart</b> and Wagon Company {{manufactured}} steam powered {{road vehicles}} in Leeds, England.|$|E
50|$|Other local steam vehicle {{manufacturers}} were John Fowler & Co., J&H McLaren & Co., and the Mann's Patent <b>Steam</b> <b>Cart</b> and Wagon Company, {{along with several}} steam railway engine builders.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, the {{invention}} of special <b>steam</b> <b>carts</b> and stainless steel moulds for making kueh tutu helped popularize this essentially-Singaporean delicacy, with outlets in major supermarkets in Singapore.|$|R
25|$|Cantonese seafood {{restaurants}} (海鮮酒家, Pinyin: Hǎixiān Jiǔjiā, {{pronounced in}} Cantonese as hoy seen jau ga) typically use a large dining room layout, have ornate designs, and specialize in seafood such as expensive Chinese-style lobsters, crabs, prawns, clams, and oysters, all kept live in fish tanks until preparation. Some seafood restaurants may also offer dim sum {{in the morning}} through the early afternoon hours, as waiters announce the names of dishes while pushing <b>steaming</b> <b>carts</b> of food and pastries around the restaurant. These restaurants are also a popular place for weddings, banquets, and other special events.|$|R
50|$|Late 19th {{century in}} Britain more {{companies}} such as Richard Garrett & Sons and Mann’s Patent <b>Steam</b> <b>Cart</b> and Wagon Company developed steam tractors for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.|$|E
5000|$|Charlesworth {{left the}} {{partnership}} in 1898 and by September 1899 the organisation called Mann's Patent <b>Steam</b> <b>Cart</b> and Wagon Company was registered. The {{success of the}} patent cart was such that Mann decided to construct a new works on Pepper Road, Hunslet, Leeds and the move was complete by December 1901. The large, modern, well-equipped works was an ambitious move and was initially very successful. The period {{up to and including}} the First World War was the heyday of the company.|$|E
5000|$|This {{compact device}} allowed the {{sequence}} of valve opening of a steam engine to be changed, {{both in terms of}} [...] "cut-off and [...] "direction" [...] without the need for link motion and all the associated levers. In 1898 Mann and Charlesworth produced, on behalf of Philip Parmiter of Tisbury, an agricultural <b>steam</b> <b>cart</b> using the front end of a conventional traction engine and a roller at the rear. This {{was one of the first}} practical self-powered load-carrying road vehicles. Mann realised the potential for this machine and went on to develop it into his [...] "Patent Steam Cart" [...] - to which the company title referred.|$|E
60|$|On {{the street}} all was commotion. Wagons were {{scattering}} {{right and left}} {{to make way for}} the <b>steam</b> engines, hose <b>carts</b> and hook and ladder trucks which came dashing up to the spot.|$|R
5000|$|Wilkes {{also saw}} the early {{potential}} in another means of transportation which was eventually to supersede the canals, namely, railways. Before {{the advent of the}} <b>steam</b> locomotive, horse-drawn <b>carts</b> on iron rails were the most efficient means of moving heavy loads overland. Wilkes promoted the use of these tramways in his article [...] "On the Utility of Iron Rail-Ways"(1800), and in conjunction with Benjamin Outram was to construct iron tramways connecting his collieries to canals.|$|R
5000|$|In 1896, Adolph Sutro {{built a new}} Cliff House, a seven story Victorian Chateau, {{called by}} some [...] "the Gingerbread Palace", below his estate on the bluffs of Sutro Heights. This was the same year work began on the famous Sutro Baths in a small cove {{immediately}} north of the Restaurant. The baths included six of the largest indoor swimming pools, a museum, a skating rink and other pleasure grounds. Great throngs of San Franciscans arrived on <b>steam</b> trains, bicycles, <b>carts</b> and horse wagons on Sunday excursions. Sutro purchased some of the collection of stuffed animals, artwork, and historic items from Woodward's Gardens to display at both the Cliff House and Sutro Baths.|$|R
50|$|The company's main {{products}} were their 3-ton and 5-ton wagons, {{and these were}} produced in {{a whole range of}} variations, including Articulated 6-wheeler, Gully cleaning wagon, Brewers wagon, Bus bodied wagon, Municipal dustcart, Street watering wagon, Tar spraying wagon, Tipping wagon and many more. In addition the company produced a range of tractors for both road and agricultural use. Another popular product for municipal use was their lightweight patching roller, used for road repair. In 1924 the company introduced their superb Mann Express wagon, with shaft drive, high-speed engine and fully enclosed cab. Unfortunately this wagon was not a commercial success and by 1926 Mann's Patent <b>Steam</b> <b>Cart</b> and Wagon Company was in trouble. Despite attempts to provide additional finance {{it was not possible to}} save the company, and in 1929 the works closed completely.|$|E
50|$|The Ibicaba Farm (in Portuguese: Fazenda Ibicaba) {{is one of}} {{the most}} known farms of Brazil. Established in 1817 by senator Nicolau Vergueiro, it was widely known as one of the most macabre symbols of the slavery in the state of São Paulo. Afterwards, it has become the pioneer in the {{replacement}} of the African enslaved by the European immigrants' labour and in the use of the <b>steam</b> engine, <b>cart</b> and plough. The Ibicaba has also served as a military headquarters during the War of the Triple Alliance, receiving the Emperor Dom Pedro II, the princess Isabel and the count Gaston of Eu. In the 19th century, it was the stage to the revolt of the European immigrants, led by Thomaz Davatz, who achieved to show the European authorities the conditions in which their former citizens lived in Brazil. By 1882, the Italian immigration to Brazil grew significantly, encouraging the aftermost massive immigrations of Italians to the whole state of São Paulo, including its capital. In 1890, the farm was bought by the Levy family, and then reduced thanks to the allotment and inheritance conditions. Since the 1990s, it's being used as a museum and turistical site.|$|R
5000|$|The Davenport Hotel {{was neither}} Louis Davenport's idea {{nor was it}} built with his money, as it was leading {{businessmen}} who desired a large public house in which to board and entertain their guests. Their searches for the best men of architecture and hospitality ended with their first choices, Cutter and Davenport. Leveraging Davenport's already strong name, the Davenport Hotel Company was formed in 1912 and preparation of the site began that year. The hotel tower went up in eight months of 1913 using horse <b>carts,</b> <b>steam</b> jacks and hand tools. Not a single worker was seriously injured or killed—a rarity for the time. Cutter and Davenport shopped the world for ideas and furnishings for their new hotel. Cutter designed spaces inspired by the great architects of France, England and Spain. Davenport filled them with fine art and songbirds and prepared to seat his guests at tables dressed in the finest Irish linens from Liddell (whose linens sailed on the Titanic) and set with 15,000 pieces of silver (the largest private commission ever created by Reed and Barton). Ever since opening day, the hotel has promoted itself as [...] "one of America's exceptional hotels." ...|$|R
5000|$|His wealth was {{increased}} by large {{real estate investments}} in San Francisco, where he became an entrepreneur and public figure after returning from the Comstock in 1879. These land investments included Mount Sutro, Land's End (the area where Lincoln Park and the Cliff House are today), and Mount Davidson, which was called [...] "Blue Mountain" [...] at the time.Sutro opened his own estate {{to the public and}} was heralded as a populist for various astute acts of public munificence, such as opening an aquarium and an elaborate and beautiful, glass-enclosed entertainment complex called Sutro Baths. Though the Baths were not opened until 1896, Sutro had been developing and marketing the project for years, attempting four separate times to insulate the site from waves using sea walls, the first three of which collapsed into the Pacific. In 1896, Adolph Sutro built a new Cliff House, a seven story Victorian Chateau, called by some [...] "the Gingerbread Palace," [...] below his estate on the bluffs of Sutro Heights. This was the same year work began on the famous Sutro Baths, which included six of the largest indoor swimming pools north of the Restaurant that included a museum, skating rink and other pleasure grounds. Great throngs of San Franciscans arrived on <b>steam</b> trains, bicycles, <b>carts</b> and horse wagons on Sunday excursions. In 1894, Sutro, in preparation for the opening of the Cliff House, bought {{a large part of the}} collection of Woodward's Gardens, a combination zoo, amusement park, aquarium, and art gallery which had closed in 1891.The Baths were saltwater and springwater pools, heated to varying degrees, and surrounded by a concert hall and museums stocked with treasures that Sutro had collected in his travels and from Woodward's Gardens. The baths became very popular despite their remote location, across the open dunes to the west of the populated areas of the city. This popularity was partly due to the low entry fee for visiting the Baths and riding the excursion railroad he built to reach them. The railroad grade still exists as a walking trail along the Land's End cliffs, maintained by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.|$|R
