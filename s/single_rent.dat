60|$|At noon, precisely, away went our fore-top-sail {{out of the}} gaskets. One {{fastening}} snapped after another, {{until the}} whole sail was adrift. The tugs that this large sheet of canvass gave upon the spars, as it shook in the wind, threatened to jerk the foremast out of the ship. They lasted about three minutes, when, after a report almost as loud {{as that of a}} small piece of ordnance, the sail split in ribands. Ten minutes later, our main-top-sail went. This sail left us as it might be bodily, and I actually thought that a gun of distress was fired near us, by some vessel that was unseen, The bolt-rope was left set; the sheets, earings, and reef points all holding on, the cloth tearing at a <b>single</b> <b>rent</b> around the four sides of the sail. The scene that followed I scarcely know how to describe. The torn part of the main-top-sail flew forward, and caught in the after-part of the fore-top, where it stood spread, as one might say, held by the top, cat-harpins, rigging, and other obstacles. This was the feather to break the camel's back. Bolt after bolt of the fore-rigging drew or broke, each parting with a loud report, and away went everything belonging to the foremast over the bows, from the deck up. The main-top-mast was dragged down by this fearful pull, and that brought the mizen-top-gallant-mast after it. The pitching of so much hamper under the bows of the ship, while her after-masts stood, threw the stern round, in spite of the manner in which Marble steered; and the ship broached-to. In doing this, the sea made a fair breach over her, sweeping the deck of even the launch and camboose, and carrying all the lee-bulwarks, in the waist, with them. Neb was in the launch at the time, hunting for some article kept there; and the last I saw of the poor fellow, he was standing erect in the bows of the boat, as the latter drove over the vessel's side, on the summit of a wave, like a bubble floating in a furious current. Diogenes, it seems, had that moment gone to his camboose, to look after the plain dinner he was trying to boil, when probably seizing the iron as the most solid object near him, he was carried overboard with it, and never reappeared. Marble was in a tolerably safe part of the vessel, at the wheel, and he kept his feet, though the water rose above his waist; as high, indeed, as his arms. As for myself, I was saved only by the main-rigging, into which I was driven, and where I lodged.|$|E

50|$|Coign and livery or coyne and livery (coinmheadh is buannacht) in Gaelic Ireland was {{the free}} {{entertainment}} which a chief exacted from his subjects for his servants and followers. Originally in Brehon law {{it took the}} form of a feast held when the chief passed through a subject's lands. By the late medieval period it was often an oppressive charge to billet and supply the chief's professional soldiers (kern and gallowglasses), enforced by those same soldiers. It was the most important of the exactions which lesser chiefs resented of their superiors. The surrender and regrant and composition imposed by the English during the Tudor conquest of Ireland sought to abolish Gaelic customs of chiefship and replace all exactions with a <b>single</b> <b>rent</b> charged on land holdings. This was accordingly supported by the lesser chiefs, but opposed by the over chiefs such as Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare.|$|E

40|$|JEL {{classification}} numbers: B 12 and H 22) The {{development of}} political economy in Britain {{in the second}} half of the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries was characterized by an attempt to escape from Locke's theorem that all taxes would finally fall on the rent of land and his proposal of a <b>single</b> tax on <b>rent.</b> Although Hume and Steuart rejected Locke's theorem and proposal, they failed to create a system of political economy which adequately accounted for capitalistic reproduction. Smith did produce such a system, but his conclusion respecting tax incidence did not differ much from Locke's theorem. Malthus, in turn, was caught in the contradiction between the Smithian theory of tax incidence and the Ricardian theory of differential rent. Ricardo, however, established a system of political economy which produced a consistent theory of tax incidence which escaped Locke's theorem: he succeeded in showing that most taxes would ultimately fall on profits, not rent.

40|$|This article {{examines}} farm operating risks and cash-rent determination {{through the use}} of the efficient set mathematics. The efficient set mathematics proves to be a pragmatic approach to characterizing operating risks, and the relationships between operating risks and cash-rent determination. Various separation theorems are used to postulate the relationship between operating risk and cash rents. Preliminary evidence appears to support the theoretical conclusion that operating risk and cash-rent determination are related. Key words: cash rent, efficient set mathematics, EV analysis, risk, separation theorem. Under the assumption of homogeneous risk preferences, classical economic theory suggests that exogenous market forces and land productivity characteristics will set a single cash-rental value of land. There are numerous studies which have examined how land rentals vary within a region according to these exogenous factors (Ketchabaw and van Vuuren). However, if risk preferences are heterogeneous, then it is unlikely that market forces will determine a <b>single</b> cash <b>rent.</b> Although the theory of cash rent for agricultural land generally has not been cast in a stochastic framework, Johnson, and Collins and Barry have done so {{in the context of a}} generalized two-paramete...|$|R

Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative.

The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by {{at least as much as}} its outlay cost.
