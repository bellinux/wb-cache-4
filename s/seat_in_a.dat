5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E

5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E

5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special election.|$|E
5|$|Burke succeeded {{his father}} in local politics, first as Democratic Committeeman and then as {{alderman}} from the 14th Ward. After the elder Burke died in office of cancer on May 11, 1968, Edward Burke took leave {{from his job as}} a policeman to replace his father as Democratic committeeman for the 14th Ward. Though not a precinct captain, Burke won election to his father's committeeman <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> secret vote of 65 precinct captains, defeating a veteran precinct captain by just 3½ votes. At 24, Burke was the youngest person in Chicago's history to become a ward committeeman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E
5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> recess. A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling.

5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car and using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the {{practice}} of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.|$|E
5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive {{and member of the}} U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district <b>seat.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million in support of his campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.|$|E
