40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} latent {{structure of the}} Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Methods: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted across Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, PsycINfo and EmBase databases spanning articles published between May 2000 and May 2010. Studies conducting latent variable analysis of the HADS were included. Results: Twenty-five of the 50 reviewed <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> a two-factor structure, the most commonly found HADS structure. Additionally, five <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> unidimensional, 17 <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> three-factor, and two <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> fourfactor structures. One study provided equal support for two- and three-factor structures. Different latent variable analysis methods revealed correspondingly different structures: exploratory factor analysis <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> primarily twofactor structures, confirmatory factor analysis <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> primarily threefactor structures, and item response theory <b>studies</b> <b>revealed</b> primarily unidimensional structures. Conclusion: The heterogeneous results of the current review suggest that the latent structure of the HADS is unclear, and dependent on statistical methods invoked. While the HADS {{has been shown to be}} an effective measure of emotional distress, its inability to consistently differentiate between the constructs of anxiety and depression means that its use needs to be targeted to more general measurement of distres...|$|R

25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients {{to determine whether they}} were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this <b>study</b> <b>reveals</b> that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{modification}} of eukaryotic mRNA. m6A is applied by a m6A methyltransferase complex [...] post-transcriptionally [...] It was only until {{recent years that}} scientists {{have been able to}} examine and try to identify the purpose of the mRNA modifications. It has been shown that three members of the human YTH domain family proteins show higher binding affinities to methylated mRNA. The YTH protein, YTHDF2, affects mRNA by directing methylated mRNA from the translational pool to mRNA decay sites. It was also found that the mRNA that was methylated has a shorter half-life and that it is filled with regulatory sequences. This suggests that the methylation has a big control on the effect of gene expression. Some m6A demethylases, such as FTO and AlkBH5, were discovered. Their function and knockout <b>study</b> <b>reveals</b> the affects they have on the body. FTO has correlations with body weight and disease, while Alkbh5 knockout mice have impaired fertility. These demethylations serve as proof that the m6A methylation that occurs on mRNA is very important for bodily function.|$|E
