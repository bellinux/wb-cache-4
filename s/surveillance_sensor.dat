40|$|<b>Surveillance</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are being}} applied in factory {{automation}} systems, traffic control, entrapment protection, automotive safety systems {{and in other}} applications where information about the occupancy of a scene is required. In order to detect object motion several methods exploiting distinct physical phenomena, e. g. passive infrared sensors or active microwave sensors, have been realized. When comparing all of the applicable methods, the electro-optical approach outperforms {{with respect to the}} spatial resolution of the monitored area. Therefore, electro-optical sensors are able to provide additional information, e. g. to predict the direction of motion, or to localize and identify objects. However, convenient image processing systems using CCD sensors for image acquisition and DSP or µP boards for signal processing and classification are not well suited for dedicated, powerful and cost-effective optical sensor solutions. In contrast to this mainstream approach CMOS based imaging techn ologies offer novel solutions in both the design and applications of electro-optical <b>surveillance</b> <b>sensors.</b> This contribution discusses CMOS imagers operating principles and describes certain architectures and applications for passive and active <b>surveillance</b> <b>sensors.</b> The capabilities to realize on-chip motion detection and range sensing using fast shutter devices are illustrated.

Its ferry range is projected to be , longer than even the Global Hawk, which enables a time-on-station capability ranging from 113 hours at [...] to 47 hours at [...] With a mission range possible to over , the Orion can be positioned much further from the patrol area, reducing costs that would otherwise be needed to transport an aircraft to a closer main operating base; unit price is expected to be less than the Reaper. The aircraft has an empty weight of 5,170 lb and carries 5,000 lb of fuel. It has the capacity to carry 2,500 lb of sensors and weapons spread through the airframe, able to support 950 lb in the nose, 850 lb in the aft fuselage, and 1,200 lb under the wings. The base sensor is the Raytheon MTS-B electro-optical/infrared turret, but options can include a ground moving target indication (GMTI) radar under the nose, a multi-camera wide-area <b>surveillance</b> <b>sensor</b> in the aft bay, and external fuel tanks and Hellfire missiles under the wings. Its wingspan is only slightly longer than the Global Hawk's, made of a long-span, one-piece, low-drag, light weight composite wing from tip-to-tip, which reduces weight and cost but prevents it from being disassembled and airlifted to another location. Top speed is slow at [...] by design to balance fuel efficiency and power consumption with weather tolerance. Propulsion comes from a pair of Austro Engine AE300 diesel engines rather than more expensive and less fuel efficient gas turbines.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} four prototype unmanned aircraft detect-and-avoid (DAA) display configurations, each with different informational elements driven by alerting and guidance algorithms. Sixteen unmanned aircraft pilots flew each combination of the display configurations, with half being given zero DAA <b>surveillance</b> <b>sensor</b> uncertainty {{and the other half}} experiencing errors that were comparable, and in some cases slightly better than, errors that were measured in DAA system flight tests. The displays that showed intruder alert information in altitude and heading bands had significantly fewer losses of well clear compared with alternative displays that lacked that information.

A modest level of DAA <b>surveillance</b> <b>sensor</b> uncertainty did not affect the proportion of losses of well clear or their severity.

40|$|Surveillance {{systems have}} become {{increasingly}} powerful. Conventional camera-based systems are extended with all kind of sensors, the number of data sources increases, hardware and algorithms improve, and data can potentially be shared between interlinked networks. Smart surveillance systems {{take advantage of these}} developments and do not threaten solely the protection of privacy; they also provide an opportunity to achieve data and privacy protection on a new level. The current legal situation for “obsolete” surveillance deployments has not been explored and is quite heterogeneous. Hence the Fair Information Principles (FIP) are still the minimum privacy requirements for surveillance systems. This contribution identifies the key challenges for security and privacy in smart surveillance that must be mastered in any future-proof system.
