40|$|A {{group of}} mobile robots can {{localize}} cooperatively, using relative position and absolute orientation measurements, fused through an extended Kalman filter (ekf). The topology of {{the graph of}} relative measurements is known to affect the steady state value of the position error covariance matrix. Classes of sensor graphs are identified, for which tight bounds for the trace of the covariance matrix can be obtained based on the algebraic properties of the underlying relative measurement graph. The string and the <b>star</b> graph <b>topologies</b> are considered, and the explicit form of the eigenvalues of error covariance matrix is given. More general sensor graph topologies are considered as combinations of the string and <b>star</b> <b>topologies,</b> when additional edges are added.

40|$|Optical {{fiber sensor}} {{networks}} (OFSNs) {{are facing the}} problem {{of a lack of}} systematic evaluation criteria to assess network performance. In this paper, a universal quantitative robustness evaluation model for OFSNs is proposed. The model defines robustness as the mathematical expectation of the monitoring coverage ratio, which has taken into account the performance under all possible network states and the probability of each state. This model is applied to four basic network topologies including line, ring, <b>star</b> and bus <b>topologies,</b> and their mathematical expressions of robustness are derived by analyzing all possible states in detail. Further simulation gives a quantitative comparison among these topologies, proving that the ring and <b>star</b> <b>topologies</b> are optimal for the monitoring of strip-shaped and square regions, respectively. Finally, two influencing factors, the attenuation coefficient and the threshold, are investigated for their impact on the robustness of the network...|$|R

50|$|In {{local area}} {{networks}} with a <b>star</b> <b>topology,</b> each network host {{is connected to}} a central hub with a point-to-point connection. So {{it can be said}} that every computer is indirectly connected to every other node with the help of the hub. In <b>Star</b> <b>topology,</b> every node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to a central node called hub, router or switch. The switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients. The network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified as a star network, but all of the nodes on the network must be connected to one central device. All traffic that traverses the network passes through the central hub. The hub acts as a signal repeater. The <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> is considered the easiest topology to design and implement. An advantage of the <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> is the simplicity of adding additional nodes. The primary disadvantage of the <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> is that the hub represents a single point of failure. Since all peripheral communication must flow through the central hub, the aggregate central bandwidth forms a network bottleneck for large clusters.|$|E
