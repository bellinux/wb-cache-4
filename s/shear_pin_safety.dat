50|$|In {{the role}} of a {{mechanical}} safeguard, a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> is a <b>safety</b> device designed to shear {{in the case of a}} mechanical overload, preventing other, more expensive parts from being damaged. As a mechanical sacrificial part, it is analogous to an electric fuse.|$|R
50|$|The {{throttle}} handle {{is on the}} right lever. In the closed position it completely shuts the fuel regulator valve, stopping fuel from reaching the engine. Turning the handle counterclockwise, the pilot increases the engine thrust. During servicing of the pack with compressed nitrogen the handle is held in the closed position with a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> for <b>safety.</b> The pilot's timer is on the same handle. Since the pack has fuel for only for 21 seconds of flight, it is critical to know when the pack will run out of fuel, so that the pilot can safely land before his tanks are empty.|$|R
40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>pins</b> {{are used}} to attach C-SCOUT's fins to their {{actuating}} motors, so if something impacts the fins, the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> will break and the fins will fall off, thereby protecting the motors from damage. An analysis {{of the strength of}} the existing Garolite <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> showed that they will fail during normal operation. It is possible for the fins to break off when the vehicle speed exceeds 2 m/s. Exact failure speeds depend on the angle of attack of the fins. To fix the problem, re-design of the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> was attempted, basing the new <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> strength on the load required to damage an actuator. It was found that the bearings in the actuator's gearbox will be damaged during normal operation, at speeds exceeding 1. 3 m/s. Therefore, the motor will be damaged before the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> break, so creating stronger <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> is not a solution that will protect the motors. Stronger fin actuators should be purchased. The potential for damage to the motors due to operational and impact loads should be considered when selecting a motor. Once new motors are selected, the method described in this report can be used to design appropriate <b>shear</b> <b>pins.</b> Until new actuators and <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, C-SCOUT testing can proceed under a 2 m/s speed limit.

50|$|The {{material}} of a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> is selected and treated {{so that it}} is relatively resistant to fatigue (material). That is, when subjected to small forces, each one insufficient to break the pin, the pin does not retain damage. If material fatigue were to weaken a <b>shear</b> <b>pin,</b> the pin could potentially be broken by a force smaller than the original threshold force causing the mechanism to operate unintentionally, or a <b>safety</b> <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> to break during normal operation of the machinery it protects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study effects of {{geometric}} parameters in fracture test, this paper used 3 D modeling software Solidworks and {{finite element analysis}} software Deform to simulate the fracture process of rocket <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> and study the effects on shear test while various geometric parameters change in the assembly of fixtures and <b>shear</b> <b>pins.</b> According the results we improved the fixtures of shear test.

40|$|A {{design for}} the {{fail-safe}} mechanism of a guide vane in a Francis-type hydro turbine is proposed and analyzed. The mechanism {{that is based on}} a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> as a sacrificial component was designed to remain simple. Unlike the requirements of conventional designs, a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> must be able to withstand static and dynamic loads but must fail under a certain overload that could damage a guide vane. An accurate load determination and selection of the <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> material were demonstrated. The static load for various opening angles of the guide vane were calculated using the computational fluid dynamics Fluent and finite element method Ansys programs. Furthermore, simulations for overload and dynamic load due to the waterhammer phenomenon were also conducted. The results of load calculations were used to select an appropriate <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> material. Quasi-static <b>shear</b> tests were performed for two <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> of aluminum alloy Al 2024 subjected to different aging treatments (i. e. artificial and natural aging). The test results indicated that the Al 2024 treated by natural aging is an appropriate material for a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> designed to function as a fail-safe mechanism for the guide vanes of a Francis-type hydro turbine...|$|R
50|$|In {{the role}} as a {{conditional}} operator, a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> {{will be used to}} prevent a mechanical device from operating before the criteria for operation are met. A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> gives a distinct threshold for the force required for operation. It is very cheap and easy to produce delivering a very high reliability and predictable tolerance. They are almost maintenance-free and can remain ready for operation for years with little to no decrease in reliability. <b>Shear</b> <b>pins</b> are only useful for a single operating cycle, after each operation they have to be replaced.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{mathematical}} modelling {{work has been}} carried out to investigate the potential of the use of <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> within London Underground Switch and Crossing electric point machine drives to protect against run-through derailments. The review is based on a need to minimise the risks of derailment and to better understand the risks associated with run-through. The study has been accomplished in two stages: analytical modelling to establish the stiffness of the switch blade followed by vehicle dynamics modelling to analyse the wheel climb-out events and the resultant loadings on the <b>shear</b> <b>pins.</b> A range of <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> strengths and vehicle-track parameters has been considered. A post-processing routine has been developed to enable a thorough study on the relationship between vehicle-track parameters, strength of <b>shear</b> <b>pins,</b> failure rates and the risk of vehicle derailment. A good agreement between the modelling results and the current shear pinâ€™s ability to protect against derailments has been found. Ultimately, the potential to increase the strength of <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> has been analysed {{in order to protect the}} vehicles against fatigue failure...|$|R
5000|$|Another use is in {{pushback}} bars {{used for}} large aircraft. In this device, <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> are frequently used {{to connect the}} [...] "head" [...] of the towbar - the portion that attaches to the aircraft - to the main shaft of the towbar. In this way, {{the failure of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> will physically separate the aircraft and the tractor. The design may be such that the <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> will have several different causes of failure - towbar rotation about its long axis, sudden braking or acceleration, excessive steering force, etc. - all of which could otherwise be extremely damaging to the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> type sacrifices a {{mechanical}} component, the pin, to disconnect the shafts.|$|R
50|$|Many designs take {{advantage}} of the maintenance-free state of constant readiness. For example, a hydraulic dampener protecting a structure from earthquake damage could be secured with a <b>shear</b> <b>pin.</b> During normal conditions the system would be completely rigid, but when acted upon by the force of an earthquake the <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> would break and the hydraulic dampening system would operate.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> could {{potentially}} be made from any material although metal is the most common.|$|R
50|$|A {{split pin}} (cotter pin in American usage) {{can also be}} used as a <b>shear</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Operating pressure: 50 to 100 kg (estimated), {{possibly}} {{as low as}} 1 kg without the <b>shear</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{in smaller}} (less than [...] ) and older engines, a narrow <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> through the drive shaft and {{propeller}} hub transmits {{the power of}} the engine at normal loads. The pin is designed to shear when the propeller is put under a load that could damage the engine. After the <b>pin</b> is <b>sheared</b> the engine is unable to provide propulsive power to the boat until a new <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> is fitted.|$|R
50|$|Their high {{reliability}} and low cost make them very popular {{for use in}} weapons. A typical example is using <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> in an explosive device. A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> can here hold a striker pin in place, preventing the striker pin from striking an initiator (primer) unless the correct force is applied. That force can be the acceleration of a rifle grenade being launched. The force would snap the <b>shear</b> <b>pin,</b> allowing the striker pin to move backwards onto a primer, which in turn ignites a pyrotechnic delay composition for auto destruction. In this use <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> prevent the striker pin from hitting the primer during handling or if the grenade was dropped by accident. Additionally, shear-pins are frequently used in anti-tank mine fuzes, {{to prevent them from}} being triggered by much lighter, non-target vehicles such as motorcycles. Typically, the shear-pin in an anti-tank mine is designed to snap (and release the spring-loaded firing pin) when a weight in excess of 150 kilograms is applied to the pressure plate.|$|R

25|$|Early torpedoes used contact {{exploder}}s. A typical exploder had {{a firing}} pin that stuck {{out from the}} warhead and was restrained by a transverse <b>shear</b> <b>pin.</b> The torpedo would hit the target with enough energy to break the <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> and allow the firing pin to strike a percussion cap that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: the firing pin could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|R

40|$|A piloted {{simulator}} experiment, {{designed to}} evaluate and optimize certain backup control system (BUCS) engagement parameters and to provide pilot familiarization with aircraft response prior to flight test of the BUCS in the YAH- 64 Advanced Attack Helicopter, is described. Key elements of the simulation were the representation of a control system jam, the pilot's breaking of a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> in the jammed control, and the resultant BUCS engagement. To minimize the excursions in aircraft motion which could result from the pilot's control inputs after <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> breakage, the BUCS control function is blended in gradually. The experiment's results indicate that optimum time to full control authority after <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> breakage is three seconds in all axes for certain critical tasks. Special pilot training in the recovery from a control system jam {{may be necessary to}} minimize unacceptably large aircraft transients in the off-axis...|$|R
50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the {{conveyor}} system to drive the chain. Conveyor sprockets typically have an odd number of teeth although sprockets with an even number have become more prevalent over the last thirty years. Most sprockets are made from fabricated steel and are parallel or taper keyed to a through shaft. Conveyor sprockets are also available in double pitch and <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> varieties. Double pitch sprockets wear evenly and offer a longer service life than standard sprockets. <b>Shear</b> <b>pin</b> sprockets break when overloaded, stopping the conveyor and saving considerable expense and downtime.|$|R
