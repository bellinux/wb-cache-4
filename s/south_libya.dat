The pozzolanic reactivity of the treated NP was evaluated by conducting strength development tests according to ASTM C 311.

Five different types of NP were obtained from different places of <b>South</b> <b>Libya</b> and tested. This study will measure the strength activity index; the starting ratio for this is 20 % NP. The result showed that after 28 days, the strength activity index of the treated NP with ordinary Portland cement exhibited very good performance and was higher than 100 %. At 28 days, the strength activity index of the Sebha sample increased to 109.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Libyan Natural Pozzolan Kaolin (clay) on the {{mechanical}} properties of Portland cement mortar {{was investigated in}} this report. The principal aim {{of this research is}} to constitute a blended cement mortar with high mechanical properties. The Libyan clay used in this study was natural Pozzolan (kaolin) from <b>south</b> <b>Libya,</b> Sebha place. The Metakaolin (MK) was prepared by thermally activating the kaolin clay for 2 hours at 800 C. The blended cement used in this investigation consists of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), from a company in England, and Libyan Metakaolin. The OPC was partially substituted by LMK, different percentages of the total weight of cement was added to each sample. The percentage replacement of LMK was 0, 10, 15 and 20 %. The blended cement mortar was prepared using cement- natural sand ratio of 1 : 3 by weight and a water-binder ratio (w/b ratio) of 0. 50. The fresh mortar pastes were first cured at 90 % relative humidity for 24 hours and then cured in water for 28 days. It has been reported that by substituting 5 - 20 % MK into the mortar mix it significantly increases the compressive strength of high performance concretes and mortars in early ages and up to 28 days [1 - 2]. Therefore, the present research investigates the effect of thermally treated (Natural Pozzolan) Libyan kaolin) on the mechanical properties of Portland cement mortar. The mechanical properties investigated were; the compressive strength, tensile strength and phase composition of mortar. The results showed that after 28 days of curing with the same w/b ratio, the compressive strength and the tensile strength of the cement mortars with MK were higher than the control cement mortar...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The thesis {{investigate}} the seroprevalence of four transboundary viral diseases of emerging interest in Libya, namely Pest des Petits Ruminants (PPR), Bluetongue (BT), Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHDV) and Rift Valley Fever (RVF). The {{purpose was to}} update the epidemiological situation of the aforementioned diseases in Libya and to study the risk factors associated with each disease. The study was carried out through a field investigation with sampling collection in Libya and a laboratory investigation in Italy at the National Reference Centre for foreign diseases of animals (CESME) in the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’ Abruzzo e del Molise in Teramo. During 2015 - 2016 a total of 857 serum samples were collected from domestic ruminants (166 cattle, 556 sheep and 135 goats) distributed in 96 farms belonging to eleven provinces in five branches: Green Mountain and Benghazi in East Libya; Tripoli in North Libya; West Mountain in West Libya; Sabha in <b>South</b> <b>Libya.</b> Two branches {{were not included in}} this study: Zawiyha branch in West Libya and Middle Area branch in North Libya. The samples were analyzed by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbentassay (c-ELISA) to detect antibody against PPRV, BTV, EHDV and RVFV. Serum neutralization test (SNT) was also performed to detect specific antibody against recognized serotypes of BTV and EHDV. The results showed 41 % (95 % CL = 37 % to 45 %) of PPRV seroprevalence for small ruminants, and an overall seroprevalence of 4 % (95 % CL = 2, 8 % to 5, 4 %) and 48. 43 % (95 % CL = 45. 02 % to 51. 83 %) for EHDV and BTV respectively. None of the serum samples collected resulted positive to RVF, however, Statistical analysis was carried out to assess the maximum expected number of infected animals and the maximum expected prevalence of RFV among ruminant population by province and the expected seroprevalence in the different provinces was calculated and mapped. SNT for EHD detected a sheep positive for EHDV- 6 serotype in the Gharyan province. SNT for BT detected antibody against six different serotypes, namely BTV- 1, BTV- 2, BTV- 3, BTV- 4, BTV- 9 and BTV 26. Two out of 6 (BTV- 3 and BTV- 26) resulted novel serotypes for the Mediterranean region. Some risk factors (animal age, species and sex) were statistically analyzed to explore their association with the seroprevalence. The results showed that the seroprevalence of PPR was significantly higher in adult animals 41 % (95 % CL = 37 % to 46 %) than in the young 24 % (95 % CL = 17 % to 32 %). The results of EHDV seroprevalence showed that only the independent variables of age group and farm species were statistically significant. BTV seroprevalence was higher in goats 58. 33 % (95 % CI= 49. 92 % to 66. 74 %). The highest seroprevalence for BTV was reported in Sabha province, Southern region (75. 61 %). The results showed that the seroprevalence of BTV was significantly higher in adult animals 55. 2 % (95 % CL = 50. 6 % to 59. 6 %). In mixed flocks seroprevalence was 79. 3 % (95 % CL = 64. 57 to 94. 05 %) and 53. 73 % (95 % CL = 48. 48 % to 58. 87 %) for cattle/goats (CG) and sheep/goats (SG) respectively. Co-infection was reported with various serotypes, in particular with BTV- 3 and BTV- 26 increasing the risk of emergence of reassortant viruses...|$|E
