He emphasizes that these individuals {{are for the most}} part logical and <b>smart</b> <b>people</b> with extremist religious viewpoints. While not attempting to explain their acts, Nance notes it is crucial to comprehend terrorists' thought processes so that law enforcement officials may attempt to anticipate them. The book goes over common tactics used by clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents. Nance notes such organizations are a key component to terror operations, and require additional study. He gives forth an analysis of different types of clandestine cell systems, explaining common methodologies, covert communication methods, and from where they recruit their agents.|$|E
500|$|The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better is a {{pamphlet}} by Tyler Cowen published in 2011. It {{argues that the}} American economy has reached a historical technological plateau and the factors which drove economic growth for most of America's history are mostly spent. These figurative [...] "low-hanging fruit" [...] from the title include the cultivation of much free, previously unused land; the application and spread of technological breakthroughs, particularly during the period 1880–1940, including transport, refrigeration, electricity, mass communications, and sanitation; and the education {{of large numbers of}} <b>smart</b> <b>people</b> who previously received none.|$|E

He also called the show [...] "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows". Even before it aired the pilot had received some criticism from the Parents Television Council, a watchdog; the creator of this website L.

500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{thought the}} episode {{was similar to}} Flowers for Algernon, but was skeptical of the premise that Milo could predict every event before they happened. She criticized the decision to make Milo [...] "coldly calculating", writing [...] "This is but another version of the tired cliché of the stoic intellectual, the intelligent person who has no heart or emotions. Why are we so afraid of <b>smart</b> <b>people?...</b> It always annoys me when science fiction writers, of all people, diss their own audience {{with the idea that}} intellectuals are dangerous." [...] Stegall was pleased to have the first [...] "standalone" [...] episode of the season, explaining that it was the first where she could [...] "relax and enjoy... the tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant." [...] Fearnet contributor Alyse Wax enjoyed the episode, but also thought [...] "the idea that [...] could turn someone into a cartoonish evil genius is pretty farfetched." ...|$|E
500|$|Mixed {{assessments}} {{came from}} Robin Pierson of The TV Critic, giving the season an overall mixed score of 59 out of 100. Though he praised the series as [...] "a {{different kind of}} animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do" [...] and found [...] "enough promise to believe the show could become really funny", he criticized the season's [...] "slightly lame collection of flashback jokes." [...] Pierson considered [...] "I Never Met the Dead Man" [...] {{to be the best}} episode of the season, and regarded [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] as the season's poorest. The ending joke of [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] (which consisted of Peter stating that [...] "Canada sucks"), caused controversy with Canadian viewers. Ken Tucker gave the series a D in Entertainment Weekly, calling the animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look [...] state-of-the-art. He also hoped that <b>smart</b> <b>people</b> would use the Family Guy half hour to turn off the television set and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. The premiere of Family Guy was the Super Bowl XXXIII lead out program, achieving a total of 22.01 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun {{described}} the only [...] "perfect aspect" [...] of Jennifer's Body as being its title. [...] "No {{one is going}} to like this movie for its brain", he said. Claudia Puig of USA Today stated of the film, [...] "Jennifer's Body is not as hot as you hope it would be". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by <b>smart</b> <b>people,</b> in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E

500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very <b>smart</b> <b>people.</b> But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
