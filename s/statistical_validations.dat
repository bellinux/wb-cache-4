To clarify {{the relationships between}} cultural and biological evolution of these populations, in particular between Amazon Yungas and Andeans, we used DNA-sequence data, a model-based Bayesian approach and several <b>statistical</b> <b>validations</b> to infer a set of demographic parameters. Results: We found that the genetic diversity of the Shimaa (an Amazon Yunga population) is a subset of that of Quechuas from Central-Andes. Using the Isolation-with-Migration population genetics model, we inferred that the Shimaa ancestors were a small subgroup that split less than 5300 years ago (after the development of complex societies) from an ancestral Andean population. After the split, the most plausible scenario compatible with our results is that the ancestors of Shimaas moved toward the Peruvian Amazon Yunga and incorporated the culture and language {{of some of their}} neighbors, but not a substantial amount of their genes. We validated our results using Approximate Bayesian Computations, posterior predictive tests and the analysis of pseudo-observed datasets. Conclusions: We presented a case study in which model-based Bayesian approaches, combined with necessary <b>statistical</b> <b>validations,</b> shed light into the prehistoric demographic relationship between Andeans and a population from the Amazon Yunga. Our results offer a testable model for the peopling of this large transitional environmental region between the Andes and the Lower Amazonia.

40|$|Chiral {{effective}} field theory (EFT) predictions are necessarily truncated at some order in the EFT expansion, which induces an error that must be quantified for robust statistical comparisons to experiment. In previous work, a Bayesian model for truncation errors of perturbative expansions was adapted to EFTs. The model yields posterior probability distribution functions (pdfs) for these errors based on expectations of naturalness encoded in Bayesian priors and the observed order-by-order convergence pattern of the EFT. A first application was made to chiral EFT for neutron-proton scattering using the semi-local potentials of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei√üner (EKM). Here we extend this application to consider a larger set of regulator parameters, energies, and observables as a general example of a statistical approach to truncation errors. The Bayesian approach allows for <b>statistical</b> <b>validations</b> of the assumptions and enables the calculation of posterior pdfs for the EFT breakdown scale.

40|$|Urbanization is an {{important}} issue concerning diverse scientific and policy communities. Computationalmodels quantifying locations and quantities of urban growth offer numerous environmental and socioeconomic benefits. Traditional urban growthmodels are based on a single-algorithm fitting procedure and thus restricted on their ability to capture spatial heterogeneity. Accordingly, a GIS-based modeling framework titled multi-network urba-nization (MuNU) model is developed that integrates multiple neural networks. The MuNU model enables a filtering approach where input data patterns are automatically reallocated into appropriate neural networks with targeted accuracies. We hypothesize that observa-tions classified by individual neural networks share greater homogeneity, and thus model-ing accuracywill increasewith the integration ofmultiple targeted algorithms. Land use and land cover data sets of two time snapshots (1977 and 1997) covering the Denver Metropolitan Area are used for model training and validation.

However, despite this interest, there seems to be little quantitative evidence of the true power of STEAM learning, especially describing how it compares and performs with respect to more established approaches. To address this, we present a comparative, quantitative study of two distinct approaches to teaching programming, one based on STEAM (with an open-ended inquiry-based approach), the other based on a more traditional, non-STEAM approach (where constrained problems are set and solved). Our key results evidence how students exhibit different styles of programming in different types of lessons and, crucially, that students who tend to exhibit more of the style of programming observed in our STEAM lessons also tend to achieve higher grades.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this work is to develop robust and interpretable {{quantitative}} structure‚Äùactivity relationship (QSAR) models for assessing the aquatic toxicity of phenols using a combined set of descriptors encompassing the logP and recently developed variables (Monconn-Z variables). The used dataset consists of 250 chemicals with toxicity data to the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis. For each compound, a total of 197 physico-chemical descriptors including logP and Molconn-Z descriptors were calculated. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Partial least squares (PLS) were used to obtain QSARs and the predictive performance of the proposed models were verified using external <b>statistical</b> <b>validations.</b> The results of stepwise-MLR analysis reveal that the AlogP, MlogP and ClogP models were not successful for the prediction of aquatic toxicity for all the compounds. And by using the logP (AlogP and MlogP) with Molconn-Z descriptors, the obtained QSARs were not successful enough nutill removal of some outliers. Two optimal QSARs were built with R 2 of 0. 71 and 0. 70 for the training sets and the external validation Q 2 of 0. 69 and 0. 68 respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Tight {{clustering}} arose recently from {{a desire}} to obtain tighter and potentially more informative clusters in gene expression studies. Scattered genes with relatively loose correlations should be excluded from the clusters. However, in the literature there is little work dedicated to this area of research. On the other hand, there has been extensive use of maximum likelihood techniques for model parameter estimation. By contrast, the minimum distance estimator has been largely ignored. Results In this paper we show the inherent robustness of the minimum distance estimator {{that makes it a}} powerful tool for parameter estimation in model-based time-course clustering. To apply minimum distance estimation, a partial mixture model that can naturally incorporate replicate information and allow scattered genes is formulated. We provide experimental results of simulated data fitting, where the minimum distance estimator demonstrates superior performance to the maximum likelihood estimator. Both biological and <b>statistical</b> <b>validations</b> are conducted on a simulated dataset and two real gene expression datasets. Our proposed partial regression clustering algorithm scores top in Gene Ontology driven evaluation, in comparison with four other popular clustering algorithms. Conclusion For the first time partial mixture model is successfully extended to time-course data analysis. The robustness of our partial regression clustering algorithm proves the suitability of the combination of both partial mixture model and minimum distance estimator in this field. We show that tight clustering not only is capable to generate more profound understanding of the dataset under study well in accordance to established biological knowledge, but also presents interesting new hypotheses during interpretation of clustering results. In particular, we provide biological evidences that scattered genes can be relevant and are interesting subjects for study, in contrast to prevailing opinion. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of the {{photocatalytic}} degradation of 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP) under UV‚Äìvisible light (330 nm < k < 800 nm) has been performed via a rigorous chemical engineering approach over a Zn 2 + doped TiO 2 catalyst prepared through an environmentally friendly aqueous sol‚Äìgel process. The experiments have been performed at three temperatures to enable the global activation energy to be estimated. The influence of the illumination intensity has also been considered. The possibility of internal and external diffusion limitations has been studied and the results obtained demonstrated {{that there is no}} diffusional limitation during the photocatalytic degradation of the 4 -NP using the selected catalyst. Therefore, the apparent specific reaction rate measured corresponds to the actual reaction rate of the chemical reaction. Parameter adjustments show that the kinetic model that provides the best fit to the experimental data corresponds to a first order reaction. A sequence of elementary steps has been considered and a pseudo-steady state approach based upon the stationary state hypothesis for reaction intermediates has been applied to obtain a kinetic rate expression in agreement with the experimental data. The mean values of the reaction rate constant found at 283 K, 288 K and 293 K are respectively equal to k 1 = 0. 094 ¬± 0. 003 m 3 h- 1 kgcatalyst- 1; k 2 = 0. 119 ¬± 0. 004 m 3 h- 1 kgcatalyst- 1 and k 3 = 0. 150 ¬± 0. 023 m 3 h- 1 kg catalyst- 1 and the global activation energy of the degradation reaction was evaluated as 40 kJ mol- 1. A phenomenological kinetic mechanism is proposed to describe the reaction at a molecular scale. Finally, <b>statistical</b> <b>validations</b> and residuals analysis have been performed to confirm that the first order model is suitable to represent the 4 -NP photocatalytic degradation over time.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a review of}} the state-of-the-art in vision systems and methodologies and an introduction of important surface attributes and representations. Then three novel methods for the dynamic inspection of specular freeform surfaces are presented. These comprise two novel machine vision systems as well as a novel high-speed, multi-scale line tracing algorithm. Both of the novel systems employ a reciprocal deflectometric arrangement. The reflection of a laser line from a surface is monitored on a translucent screen. Here, a complex curve, known as the 'specular signature', is formed that contains all the information on the surface. Methods for extracting and interpreting this information are presented and incorporated into the two vision systems. Prototype demonstrators were designed and assembled to verify the presented methodologies. Extensive experimental validations of all three contributions are shown and the results are compared to ground truth data. <b>Statistical</b> <b>validations</b> of the systems are also presented. Also, the optical and angular resolutions as well as the limitations and the allowable ranges of surface characteristics for both systems, were calculated and presented. It is shown that they are applicable to a range of surface geometries and roughnesses that is comparable to those of existing techniques. The first of the two novel systems is designed for the robust and qualitative detection, classification and localisation of surface defects. It was validated using various real defects on specular freeform surfaces. It is shown that any discontinuity on a surface will be detected and can be classified as long as one criterion regarding the smallest radius of concave curvature on the surface is fulfilled. It is known that this criterion will be fulfilled for a very wide range of common surfaces. The second proposed vision system serves the purpose of a complete, quantitative reconstruction and digitalisation of moving, specular freeform surfaces. While the first system only requires the information from the specular signature, the second system also uses traditional and highly inaccurate surface height data, gathered through laser triangulation. These two data sets, computed from the diffuse as well as the specular reflection, are fused together to generate highly accurate surface bump (gradient) maps. Through the reverse engineering of several real specular specimens and the comparison to ground truth, it is shown that the standard deviation of the error of the height map reaches micrometer levels while that of the angular accuracy reaches levels below one degree. As a third original contribution to knowledge, a novel, high speed, multi-scale line extraction algorithm was developed. Intended for the rapid extraction of the specular signature from the screen images, it combines the processing speed of crude edge detectors with the versatility and accuracy of complex differential geometrical line extractors. It is also multi- scale, with best match scale space being chosen fully automatically. By combining the formerly separated steps of line point detection and line point linkage, the new algorithm is able to increase the processing speed of existing line extractors by up to 50 times. The time requirement is of the same order of magnitude as for crude edge detection algorithms such as Canny. The novel algorithm can also be implemented without the need for any global thresholds as it defines itself a variable local threshold, thereby increasing the sensitivity drastically.
