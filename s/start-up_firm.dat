40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{literature}} on the growth drivers of <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> from the process perspective. Increasing scholarly attention to the growth of <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> has led to a more sophisticated understanding of their drivers. However, the richness of the results is partly offset by both potential and real contradictions in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, 233 studies on the growth of <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> are reviewed using a process-oriented lens. Findings – The analysis reveals an imbalance in the use of variance-based empirical approaches to study the process-based phenomenon and some misalignments in the use of non-process-based empirical approaches to improve a process-based theory. Originality/value – This paper offers an original perspective from which to reconsider the relevant literature and provides useful recommendations for researchers to forge a path ahead in this field.

40|$|Academic <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> have {{received}} increasing attention {{as being an}} important and effective mechanism to transfer new scientific and technological insights into industry.

From a resource-based perspective, this study aims to identify the effects of parent support functions provided by universities on the performance of academic <b>start-up</b> <b>firms.</b> By using a sample of 119 venture years of academic <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> active within the Dutch life sciences industry from 2002 to 2005, {{the results of this study}} show that parent support by means of financial and technological resources induces a research orientation within academic <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> that impedes a business orientation which is needed in order to become a viable business entity.

40|$|The {{start-up}} of {{new businesses}} has been attracting considerable attention {{due to their}} potential contribution to innovation. However, there are few econometric studies on the determinants of R&D by <b>start-up</b> <b>firms.</b> Using firm-level, industry-level, and regional data, this paper examines the determinants of R&D investment by Japanese <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> in the manufacturing sector. Specifically, this study employs probit analysis on the probability of R&D investment and Tobit analysis on R&D intensity. Empirical results demonstrate that firm size and appropriability have significant positive impacts on both the probability of R&D investment and R&D intensity, while technological opportunity and the regional agglomeration of research institutes and human resources have significant positive effects on R&D intensity. These findings highlight the importance of regional intellectual infrastructure in promoting R&D of <b>start-up</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R

Employing a unique panel dataset covering 9, 715 <b>start-up</b> <b>firms</b> {{over the period}} 2007 - 2009, we find that high-tech startups {{are less likely to}} use bank finance and face more {{difficulties in}} raising bank finance than low-tech start-ups. We find that external credit scores do affect the availability of credit for <b>start-up</b> <b>firms,</b> but that banks rely less on external rating information in their decision making for high-tech start-ups than low-tech start-ups. Start-ups that have their main relation with a small bank use more bank finance and report less difficulties in getting credit.

40|$|The {{center piece}} of this {{analysis}} is to investigate the interdependence between newly founded firms, established firms and innovation networks. On grounds of the reflections on firms' innovation activities and technological opportunities, the influence of network-membership (among other aspects) on the innovation behavior of new firms and incumbent firms is investigated. The empirical analysis, based on the data of the "Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) ", suggests stimulating effects of network-membership on the innovation activities of <b>start-up</b> <b>firms.</b> A secondary target of start-ups is also to gain market share and thus increase their turnovers. In contrast to <b>start-up</b> <b>firms,</b> networks do not {{play a significant role}} with regard to innovation activities when we consider established firms. Network-membership as a determinant of the innovation behavior of established firms loses explanatory power according to the estimation results in this paper.
