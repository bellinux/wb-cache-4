5000|$|Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay (Aphelocoma woodhouseii), [...] is {{a species}} of <b>scrub</b> jay native to western North America. It ranges from southeastern Oregon and {{southern}} Idaho to central Mexico. It comprises two distinct subspecies groups. They are Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay (interior US and northern Mexico), and Sumichrast's <b>scrub</b> jay (interior southern Mexico). Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay was once lumped with the California <b>scrub</b> jay, the island <b>scrub</b> jay and collectively called the western <b>scrub</b> jay. It was also lumped with the Florida <b>scrub</b> jay; the taxon was then called, simply, the <b>scrub</b> jay. Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay is nonmigratory {{and can be found}} in urban areas, where it can become tame and will come to bird feeders. While many refer to <b>scrub</b> jays as [...] "blue jays", the blue jay is a different species of bird entirely.|$|R

5|$|Multiple {{television}} series have aired episodes that either reference or parody {{the game and}} its elements; for example, Danger Mouse, That '70s Show, <b>Scrubs,</b> Chuck, Robot Chicken. and The Amazing World of Gumball.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a <b>Scrubs</b> fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that <b>Scrubs</b> is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways <b>Scrubs</b> and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
5|$|Between May and July 1918, {{military}} stores from White City, Wormwood <b>Scrubs</b> and Baker Street {{were moved}} to the site, with items kept in the completed sheds. A shortage of bricks in October meant the widening of the bridge over the railway was delayed, as was {{the construction of the}} railway line into the site.|$|E
5000|$|The California <b>scrub</b> jay (Aphelocoma californica), [...] is {{a species}} of <b>scrub</b> jay native to western North America. It ranges from {{southern}} British Columbia throughout California west of the Sierra Nevada. The California <b>scrub</b> jay was once lumped with the island <b>scrub</b> jay, and Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay, collectively called the western <b>scrub</b> jay. The group was also lumped with the Florida <b>scrub</b> jay; the taxon was then called, simply, the <b>scrub</b> jay. The California <b>scrub</b> jay is nonmigratory {{and can be found}} in urban areas, where it can become tame and will come to bird feeders. While many refer to <b>scrub</b> jays as [...] "blue jays", the blue jay is a different species of bird entirely.

5|$|In {{the style}} of a {{traditional}} musical, this episode follows a two-act structure – with the acts separated by a commercial break instead of an intermission. However, in {{the style of}} a traditional <b>Scrubs</b> episode, this is preceded by a cold open.|$|E
5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that <b>scrubs</b> carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} have been classified into nine categories: lowland subtropical rainforest, submontane rainforest, cloud-forest and <b>scrub,</b> lowland swamp forest, mangrove <b>scrub</b> and seagrass, coastal <b>scrub</b> and cliff vegetation, inland <b>scrub</b> and herbland, offshore island vegetation, shoreline and beach vegetation, and disturbed vegetation.|$|R
50|$|It {{grows on}} slopes and dry washes in diverse habitats, {{including}} chaparral, coastal sage <b>scrub,</b> grasslands, sagebrush <b>scrub,</b> pinyon-juniper woodland, and creosote bush <b>scrub.</b>|$|R
50|$|The plants {{the refuge}} was {{designed}} to protect are the snakeroot (Eryngium cuneifolium), <b>scrub</b> blazing star (Liatris ohlingerae), Carter's mustard (Warea carteri), papery Whitlow-wort (Paronychia chartacea), Florida bonamia (Bonamia grandiflora), <b>scrub</b> lupine (Lupinus aridorum), highlands <b>scrub</b> hypericum (Hypericum cumulicola), Garett's mint (Dicerandra christmanii), <b>scrub</b> mint (Dicerandra frutescens), pygmy fringetree (Chionanthus pygmaeus), wireweed (Polygonella basiramia), sandlace (Polygonella myriophylla), Florida ziziphus (Ziziphus celata), and <b>scrub</b> plum (Prunus geniculata).|$|R
5|$|In 2004, Fox guest {{starred in}} two episodes of the comedy-drama <b>Scrubs</b> as Dr. Kevin Casey, a surgeon with severe {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder. The series {{was created by}} Spin City creator Bill Lawrence. In 2006, he appeared in four episodes of Boston Legal as a lung cancer patient. The producers brought him back in a recurring role for Season three, beginning with the season premiere. Fox was nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest appearance.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert to sand dunes, <b>scrubs,</b> and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E

The products available include shirts, sweatshirts, kitchen-ware, home-ware, and bags, with the Grey's Anatomy logo on it. Also available are custom unisex <b>scrubs</b> and lab coats {{in a variety of}} colors and sizes, designed by Barco. The merchandise released by the company is available for purchase at the Grey's Anatomy official website, and US$1 from every purchase is donated to Barco's Nightingales Foundation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are usually}} two variants, known as patrol <b>scrubbing</b> and demand <b>scrubbing.</b> While they both {{essentially}} perform memory <b>scrubbing</b> and associated error correction (if it is doable), {{the main difference}} is how these two variants are initiated and executed. Patrol <b>scrubbing</b> runs in an automated manner when the system is idle, while demand <b>scrubbing</b> performs the error correction when the data is actually requested from main memory.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, dish washing {{is done by}} <b>scrubbing</b> the {{utensils}} {{with wet}} fabric dipped in <b>scrub</b> ash (abu gosok) to <b>scrub</b> away the dirt.

5|$|The eastern quoll (D. viverrinus) is now {{considered}} extinct on mainland Australia; the last sighting there was in the 1960s. But it does inhabit much of nearby Tasmania, {{where it can be}} found in rainforests, heathland, alpine areas, and <b>scrubs.</b> It can be found near farms, as it eats pasture food. The eastern quoll can also be seen in the Mount Field National Park.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{follows the}} story of Patti Miller, (Stephanie D'Abruzzo), a patient who mysteriously starts hearing everyone's speech as singing. It was written by Debra Fordham, who also wrote most of the lyrics. The episode's music was {{composed}} by Fordham, <b>Scrubs</b> resident composer Jan Stevens, The Worthless Peons' Paul Perry, Tony Award-winning Broadway orchestrator Doug Besterman, and the Avenue Q writing team of Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez. The episode was directed by Will Mackenzie.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's next planned {{extension}} was westward to Ealing. In 1905, the Great Western Railway (GWR) {{had obtained}} parliamentary approval {{to construct the}} Ealing and Shepherd's Bush Railway (E), connecting its main line route at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway (WLR) north of Shepherd's Bush. From Ealing, the new line was to curve north-east through still mostly rural North Acton, then run east for a short distance parallel with the GWR's High Wycombe line, before curving south-east. The line was then to run on an embankment south of Old Oak Common and Wormwood <b>Scrubs</b> before connecting to the WLR a short distance {{to the north of}} the CLR's depot.|$|E
5000|$|The largest plant {{category}} {{in the national}} monument is collectively known as desert <b>scrub</b> and includes Sonoran Cresosote <b>Scrub</b> and Sonoran Mixed Woody and Succulent <b>Scrub</b> vegetation communities. Desert <b>scrub</b> occupies more than 160000 acre and consists of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), burrobrush (Ambrosia dumosa), cacti, and other stem succulents. Desert <b>scrub</b> is found on the alluvial fans and intermountain bajadas, growing on coarse, well-drained soils. [...] Wildlife of the desert <b>scrub</b> plant community includes the federally protected Peninsular Ranges bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) and the desert tortoise (Xerobates agassizii syn. Gopherus agassizii).|$|R
50|$|Quercus dumosa is {{a species}} of plant in the Fagaceae family. This tree goes by the common names coastal sage <b>scrub</b> oak, Nuttall's <b>scrub</b> oak, and California <b>scrub</b> oak.|$|R
5000|$|The island <b>scrub</b> jay {{was first}} {{described}} by American ornithologist Henry Wetherbee Henshaw in 1886 and an archaeological specimen at site SCRI-192 dating from 1780's-1812 on Santa Cruz Island is the earliest {{evidence of the}} bird in the historic period. [...] This bird {{is a member of}} the crow family, and is one of a group of closely related North American species named as <b>scrub</b> jays. These were formerly often considered as a single species, the <b>scrub</b> jay, Aphelocoma coerulesens, with five subspecies, but full species status is now normally given to the Florida <b>scrub</b> jay, A. coerulesens, the island <b>scrub</b> jay, the California <b>scrub</b> jay, A. californica, and Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay, A. woodhouseii. The relationships within the genus are not fully resolved. and most taxonomists already split it into Californian <b>scrub</b> jay, A. californica, and Woodhouse's <b>scrub</b> jay, A. woodhouseii. The DNA studies also indicate that the island and coastal forms have long been isolated from their relatives inland.|$|R
5|$|The {{isolation}} of metallic zinc in the West {{may have been}} achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass {{paved the way for}} the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection. In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that <b>scrubs</b> carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.|$|E
5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, {{but rather by}} several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), <b>Scrubs</b> composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. Marx and Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if {{it would be possible to}} get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Naja nigricollis is {{currently}} expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria {{to the more}} desert and arid conditions in {{the central part of}} the nation. They also live in coastal <b>scrubs</b> and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or cool off. However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at times. Because they are so common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people.|$|E
40|$|One of {{characteristics}} of the rising cloud storage technology is low-cost and high reliability. A distinct benefit of disk scanning or <b>scrubbing</b> operation is identifying the potential failure sectors as early as possible, thus providing high reliability. Obviously, the higher the <b>scrubbing</b> frequency is, the higher the system reliability is. However, {{it may take a}} few hours for a scanning process to check the whole disk. In other words, the <b>scrubbing</b> process may result in a downtime or a lower system performance. Furthermore, the <b>scrubbing</b> process consumes energy. In order to reduce the impact of disk <b>scrubbing</b> on disk performance and energy consumption, system designers choose to scan the disk in a low frequency, which results in a lower reliability. Thus it is essential to design a good <b>scrubbing</b> scheme in a large scale storage system over long time horizons. In this paper, we present a novel <b>scrubbing</b> scheme to solve the challenge. In this scheme, an optimum <b>scrubbing</b> cycle is decided by keeping a balance between data loss cost, <b>scrubbing</b> cost, and disk failure rate. Our research shows how the data price and the <b>scrubbing</b> cost affect <b>scrubbing</b> frequency, and the <b>scrubbing</b> scheme is applicable for storage with inexpensive data. Our experiment shows that our scheme outperforms routine method 73. 3 % in cost and 40 % in reliability...|$|R
