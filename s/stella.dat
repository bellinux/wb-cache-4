5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} <b>Stella</b> {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with <b>Stella</b> to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which <b>Stella</b> laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as <b>Stella</b> is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see <b>Stella</b> to talk up Ted, and found out <b>Stella</b> had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that <b>Stella</b> is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>Stella's</b> family struggles with {{problems}} of their own. <b>Stella's</b> younger sister, Yip Moon-Lam (Mimi Lo), and her husband, Hung Kwok-Wai (Wong Chi Yin), are selfish and opportunistic, {{taking advantage of}} everyone, including <b>Stella's</b> father, Yip Cheung-Fat (Yuen Wah) and her older brother, Yip Shang-Shing (Makbau Mak)'s family; <b>Stella's</b> sister-in-law, Chu Lai-Ngoh (Kingdom Yuen) is constantly suspicious of <b>Stella's</b> younger sister's motives and they argue all the time. <b>Stella's</b> father, finally tired of trying mediate his unstable family, is befriended by Choi Ka-Sing and moves back to the countryside, where he becomes friends with Choi Ka-Sing's family.

5|$|<b>Stella</b> met Bruce Nickell in 1974. Nickell {{was a heavy}} {{equipment}} operator with a drinking habit, which suited Stella's lifestyle, and the two were married in 1976.

Her bar visits were curtailed by Bruce's sobriety, and <b>Stella</b> cultivated a home aquarium as a new hobby.|$|E
5|$|The British {{demand for}} {{electricity}} increased after the Second World War. In the North East of England {{this led to}} the expansion of existing power stations at Dunston and Billingham in the late 1940s, the two new <b>Stella</b> power stations, and the construction of two more large stations built at Blyth later in the 1960s. This new generating capacity quickly met the demand for power. The British Electricity Authority were granted permission to construct the <b>Stella</b> North and <b>Stella</b> South power stations in 1951. The two stations were originally projected to cost around £15,000,000.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Stella</b> power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: <b>Stella</b> South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and <b>Stella</b> North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby <b>Stella</b> Hall, a manor house close to <b>Stella</b> South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry until two years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} <b>Stella</b> North was the Newburn Haugh, {{which was the}} site of Lemington Hall. Lemington Hall was {{demolished}} in 1953 during the construction of <b>Stella</b> North. <b>Stella</b> South was built on the <b>Stella</b> Haugh, the site of the Battle of Newburn in 1640. A cannonball from the battle was on display in the South station for many years, after having been dredged from the river bed. Between 1887 and 1916, the <b>Stella</b> Haugh had been the site of the annual Blaydon Races, which stopped after a riot broke out following allegations of race fixing. Just before the construction of the South station the haugh had two uses. Blaydon Rugby Club's ground had been there since 1893, but in 1950 it was compulsorily purchased by the British Electricity Authority for £1,000. The club moved to a new ground in Swalwell, which it still uses. Newcastle University Boat Club had owned a boathouse on the site since 1929, but in 1951 the British Electricity Authority requisitioned it, forcing the club to move upstream to its current location in Newburn.|$|E

5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity.

The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time.
