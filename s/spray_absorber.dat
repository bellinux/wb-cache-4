In a laboratory pilot, plant, working lines for the absorbers were determined under adiabatic conditions. The influences of internal solution flow, gas flow, pressure drop and dissipation are discussed. The working lines represent the efficiency for each absorber. The highest performance occurs with the packed-bed absorbers, followed by the fluid-bed absorber and finally the <b>spray</b> <b>absorber.</b> For open absorption systems in air-conditioning applications (small scale), the cross-current absorber is preferable, and for industrial utilization (large scale) the fluid-bed absorber should be chosen. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} utilize clean energy such as solar energy to reduce {{electricity}} consumption in heating, ventilating, {{air conditioning and}} refrigerating (HVAC&R) engineering, the author developed a new style diffusion-absorption refrigerator (DAR) with solution pumps. It can be driven by low-temperature heat sources, in which LiNO 3 -NH 3 -He is used as working fluids and an adiabatic <b>spray</b> <b>absorber</b> with a plate-type solution cooler is designed to enhance the mass and heat transfer, respectively. This paper is mainly concern on the principle and operating performance of the DAR, especially the relationships of evaporator temperature (Te), absorber temperature (Ta) and parameters such as the volume flow rate and inlet temperature of LiNO 3 -NH 3 solution sprayed {{from the top of}} the adiabatic <b>spray</b> <b>absorber.</b> Based on measured data and theoretical analysis, the solution circulation ratio is also presented. Analyses indicate that in this DAR system, Te mainly depends on Ta rather than condenser temperature (Tc) and generator temperature (Tg). Thus Te and the performance of the DAR can be modulated by changing parameters of the sprayed solution. The results show that this DAR system can be driven by solar energy to meet the requirements of air conditioning, freezing or else. A typical operating experiment shows when temperatures of heat source (hot water temperature Tws), Tg, Ta and Tc are 92. 7 °C, 87. 0 °C, 29. 6 °C and 21. 6 °C, respectively, the lowest Te is - 13. 0 °C, the corresponding refrigeration capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) are 1. 9 kW and 0. 156, respectively...|$|E

In this program CONSOL is determining mercury speciation and removal at 10 coal-fired facilities. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effect of SCR on mercury capture in the ESP-FGD and SDA-FF combinations at coal-fired power plants, (2) evaluate the effect of catalyst degradation on mercury capture; (3) evaluate the effect of low load operation on mercury capture in an SCR-FGD system, and (4) collect data that could provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on Hg speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for Hg capture. This document, the second in a series of topical reports, describes the results and analysis of mercury sampling performed on a 330 MW unit burning a bituminous coal containing 1. 0 % sulfur. The unit is equipped with a SCR system for NOx control and a <b>spray</b> dryer <b>absorber</b> for SO{sub 2 } control followed by a baghouse unit for particulate emissions control. Four sampling tests were performed in March 2003. Flue gas mercury speciation and concentrations were determined at the SCR inlet, air heater outlet (ESP inlet), and at the stack (FGD outlet) using the Ontario Hydro method. Process stream samples for a mercury balance were collected to coincide with the flue gas measurements. Due to mechanical problems with the boiler feed water pumps, the actual gross output was between 195 and 221 MW during the tests. The results showed that the SCR/air heater combination oxidized nearly 95 % of the elemental mercury. Mercury removal, on a coal-to-stack basis, was 87 %. The mercury material balance closures for the four tests conducted at the plant ranged from 89 % to 114 %, with an average of 100 %. These results appear to show that the SCR had a positive effect on mercury removal. In earlier programs, CONSOL sampled mercury at six plants with wet FGDs for SO{sub 2 } control without SCR catalysts. At those plants, an average of 61 {+-} 15 % of the mercury was in the oxidized form at the air heater outlet. The principal purpose of this work is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} potential Hg removal ''co-benefits'' achieved by NOx, and SO{sub 2 } control technologies.

The 1996 Trace Elements Removal (TER) test block {{is a continuation of}} the 1995 TER test block and will focus on up to five research areas, depending on experimental results. These areas are: (1) Mercury speciation methods; (2) Effect of FGD system operating variables on mercury removal; (3) Novel methods for elemental mercury control; (4) Catalytic methods for converting elemental mercury to oxidized mercury; and (5) Electrostatic charging of particulate material in the FGD inlet flue gas stream. The work during October continued to focus on catalytic oxidation of elemental mercury. These tests included the evaluation of two different loadings of catalyst CT- 9 (carbon-based material) over extended periods (8 - 10 days) and an evaluation of FAB- 2 B (bulk bituminous fly ash taken from the first hopper of the pilot ESP) for a four-day period. Three baseline tests were conducted for comparison with the catalyst tests...|$|R
40|$|Operations and {{maintenance}} continued {{this month at}} the Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI's) Environmental Control Technology Center (ECTC). Testing for the Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) study was conducted using the Carbon Injection System (the 4. 0 MW <b>Spray</b> Dryer <b>Absorber</b> and the Pulse-Jet Fabric Filter). Testing also continued across the B&W/CHX Heat Exchanger this month as the effects of increased particulate loading are being studied. The 1. 0 MW Cold-Side Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit and the 4. 0 MW Pilot Wet Scrubber remained idle this month in a cold-standby mode and were inspected regularly. On September 13, 1996, the ECTC completed an independent test block for a third-party company, Air Purification Inc. (API). For this testing, the ECTC's staff (O&M and Testing) were contracted to conduct performance and validation testing across a new, integrated emissions control device, the Rotorfilter{trademark}. This testing was conducted for a thirty (30) day period simultaneously with the B&W/CHX test block. The HAP testing resumed as this third-party test block was completed. Testing in September at the Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI's) Environmental Control Technology Center (ECTC) included tests from the Pilot Trace Elements Removal (TER) test block as part of EPRI's overall program to develop control technology options for reduction of trace element emissions.

40|$|This {{project was}} awarded through the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory Program Solicitation DE-PS 26 - 03 NT 41718 - 01. The Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) led a consortium-based effort to resolve mercury (Hg) control {{issues facing the}} lignite industry. The EERC team-the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); the URS Corporation; the Babcock & Wilcox Company; ADA-ES; Apogee; Basin Electric Power Cooperative; Otter Tail Power Company; Great River Energy; Texas Utilities; Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.; Minnkota Power Cooperative, Inc.; BNI Coal Ltd.; Dakota Westmoreland Corporation; the North American Coal Corporation; SaskPower; and the North Dakota Industrial Commission-demonstrated {{technologies}} that substantially enhanced the effectiveness of carbon sorbents to remove Hg from western fuel combustion gases and achieve a high level ({ge} 55 % Hg removal) of cost-effective control. The results of this effort are applicable to virtually all utilities burning lignite and subbituminous coals in the United States and Canada. The enhancement processes were previously proven in pilot-scale and limited full-scale tests. Additional optimization testing continues on these enhancements. These four units included three lignite-fired units: Leland Olds Station Unit 1 (LOS 1) and Stanton Station Unit 10 (SS 10) near Stanton and Antelope Valley Station Unit 1 (AVS 1) near Beulah and a subbituminous Powder River Basin (PRB) -fired unit: Stanton Station Unit 1 (SS 1). This project {{was one of three}} conducted by the consortium under the DOE mercury program to systematically test Hg control technologies available for utilities burning lignite. The overall objective of the three projects was to field-test and verify options that may be applied cost-effectively by the lignite industry to reduce Hg emissions. The EERC, URS, and other team members tested sorbent injection technologies for plants equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and <b>spray</b> dryer <b>absorbers</b> combined with fabric filters (SDAs-FFs). The work focused on technology commercialization by involving industry and emphasizing the communication of results to vendors and utilities throughout the project...|$|R
40|$|Large {{contracts}} are being awarded to remove and find beneficial uses for dredge spoil. An {{example is the}} Delaware Deepening Project which encompasses over 100 miles of the Delaware River. One of the challenges is to find economical and environmentally suitable means to stabilize and solidify (S/S) the solids {{so they can be}} reused for structural fill and/or cover soil. This lab study demonstrates the methodology and results of using three sustainable industrial by-products that can compete with Portland cement. They are lime kiln dust (LKD), Class F coal fly ash, and spray dryer ash (SDA). SDA is the residue from <b>spray</b> dryer <b>absorbers,</b> a more common type of advanced sulfur dioxide gas scrubber that uses lime. There are existing spray dryer installations in the Middle Atlantic States and several new units are coming on-line in Massachusetts and New Jersey. These spray dryers could provide an inexpensive S/S additive and an opportunity for CO 2 credits. These industrial by-products were investigated to determine their potential for stabilizing and solidifying the dredge solids from the Cox Creek confined disposal facility (CDF) for Baltimore, MD with the objective of making a structural fill material. Another lab study utilized harbor dredged material from the USCOE Ft. Mifflin Confined Disposal Facility near Philadelphia, PA. The performance of the spray dryer ash is compared with a blend of LKD and Class F fly ash. Adequate lime alkalinity needs to be added {{to take advantage of the}} pozzolanic and sulfo-pozzolanic, cementitious reaction potential. Raising the pH levels to 9 - 11 for pozzolanic hydration reactivity coincide with pH levels that stabilize leachable heavy metals, including oxyanions. Furthermore, in order to produce structural fill the moisture of the dredge spoil must be reduced as close as possible to the optimum moisture content resulting in compaction at or near maximum dry density. The addition of these by-products will add dry bulk solids and in addition are known to chemically reduce the free moisture through several types of hydration reactions. A “mellowing” period before compaction may help prevent swelling from Ettringite precipitation. Strength measurements with several curing times are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Clean Coal Technology (CCT) Program is {{to provide}} the energy {{marketplace}} with advanced, more efficient, and environmentally responsible coal utilization options by conducting demonstrations of new technologies. These demonstration projects are intended to establish the commercial feasibility of promising advanced coal technologies {{that have been developed}} to a level at which they are ready for demonstration testing under commercial conditions. This document serves as a DOE post-project assessment (PPA) of the Healy Clean Coal Project (HCCP), selected under Round III of the CCT Program, and described in a Report to Congress (U. S. Department of Energy, 1991). The desire to demonstrate an innovative power plant that integrates an advanced slagging combustor, a heat recovery system, and both high- and low-temperature emissions control processes prompted the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) to submit a proposal for this project. In April 1991, AIDEA entered into a cooperative agreement with DOE to conduct this project. Other team members included Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA), host and operator; Usibelli Coal Mine, Inc., coal supplier; TRW, Inc., Space & Technology Division, combustor technology provider; Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. (S&W), engineer; Babcock & Wilcox Company (which acquired the assets of Joy Environmental Technologies, Inc.), supplier of the <b>spray</b> dryer <b>absorber</b> technology; and Steigers Corporation, provider of environmental and permitting support. Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation supplied the boiler. GVEA provided oversight of the design and provided operators during demonstration testing. The project was sited adjacent to GVEA's Healy Unit No. 1 in Healy, Alaska. The objective of this CCT project was to demonstrate the ability of the TRW Clean Coal Combustion System to operate on a blend of run-of-mine (ROM) coal and waste coal, while meeting strict environmental requirements. DOE provided $ 117, 327, 000 of the total project cost of $ 282, 300, 000, or 41. 6 percent. Construction for the demonstration project was started in May 1995, and completed in November 1997. Operations were initiated in January 1998, and completed in December 1999. The evaluation contained herein is based primarily on information from the AIDEA's Final Report (Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, 2001), as well as other references cited...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcentrated (40 wt %) {{piperazine}} (PZ) with two-stage flash regeneration is {{an advanced}} second generation amine-based process for CO 2 capture. Two pilot campaigns with the two-stage flash process were completed in 2011 and successfully demonstrated high temperature stripping at 150 °C with concentrated piperazine. Data reconciliation for the absorber with intercooling return spray was completed using Aspen Plus® Data-Fit. Data reconciliation for the two-stage flash with warm rich bypass was completed using Aspen Plus® Data-Fit and a dynamic model developed in MATLAB®. The results of data reconciliation analysis {{found that the}} CO 2 loading in the lean and rich streams needed to be systematically shifted upward, 4. 6 – 4. 7 % in the stripper analysis and 7. 5 % in the absorber analysis. An analysis of the October 2011 campaign pilot plant data identified the two configurations with the lowest equivalent work as the high temperature two-stage flash with warm rich bypass and low pressure simple stripper. The calculated equivalent work for the two-stage flash with warm rich bypass from raw pilot plant data and reconciled pilot plant data is approximately 35 kJ/mol CO 2 and 36. 6 kJ/mol CO 2, respectively. Intercooling with a <b>spray</b> return improved <b>absorber</b> CO 2 removal performance by 6 – 7 % at the lower gas rates and {{was found to be}} equivalent to a 7 – 20 % increase in packing height based on reconciled data results. Warm rich bypass to the low pressure flash tank reduced piperazine volatility by factor of two in the condensate. In addition, analysis of the pilot plant piperazine inventory {{at the end of the}} campaign identified the following degradation products (mmol/kg) : N-formyl PZ (1. 3), ethylenediamine (13), aminoethylpiperazine (3. 6), Hydroxyethylpiperazine (3. 9), formate (1. 0), and N-nitroso- piperazine (0. 09). The solvent analysis also found that the CO 2 capacity has decreased by 17 %, with a slight decrease in CO 2 absorption rate and heat of vaporization...|$|R
40|$|CONSOL Energy Inc., Research & Development (CONSOL), {{with support}} from the U. S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), is {{evaluating}} the effects of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) on mercury (Hg) capture in coal-fired plants equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) [...] wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) combination or a <b>spray</b> dryer <b>absorber</b> [...] fabric filter (SDA-FF) combination. In this program CONSOL is determining mercury speciation and removal at 10 coal-fired facilities. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effect of SCR on mercury capture in the ESP-FGD and SDA-FF combinations at coal-fired power plants, (2) evaluate the effect of catalyst degradation on mercury capture; (3) evaluate the effect of low load operation on mercury capture in an SCR-FGD system, and (4) collect data that could provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on mercury speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for mercury capture. This document, the seventh in a series of topical reports, describes the results and analysis of mercury sampling performed on a 1, 300 MW unit burning a bituminous coal containing three percent sulfur. The unit was equipped with an ESP and a limestone-based wet FGD to control particulate and SO 2 emissions, respectively. At the time of sampling an SCR was not installed on this unit. Four sampling tests were performed in September 2003. Flue gas mercury speciation and concentrations were determined at the ESP outlet (FGD inlet), and at the stack (FGD outlet) using the Ontario Hydro method. Process stream samples for a mercury balance were collected to coincide with the flue gas measurements. The results show that the FGD inlet flue gas oxidized:elemental mercury ratio was roughly 2 : 1, with 66 % oxidized mercury and 34 % elemental mercury. Mercury removal, on a coal-to-stack basis, was 53 %. The average Hg concentration in the stack flue gas was 4. 09 {micro}g/m{sup 3 }. The average stack mercury emission was 3. 47 Ib/TBtu. The mercury material balance closures ranged from 87 % to 108 %, with an average of 97 %. A sampling program similar to this one was performed on a similar unit (at the same plant) that was equipped with an SCR for NOx control. Comparison of the results from the two units show that the SCR increases the percentage of mercury that is in the oxidized form, which, in turn, lends to more of the total mercury being removed in the wet scrubber. The principal purpose of this work is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} potential mercury removal ''co-benefits'' achieved by NOx, and SO{sub 2 } control technologies. It is expected that this data will provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on mercury speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for mercury capture. Ultimately, this insight could help to design and operate SCR and FGD systems to maximize mercury removal...|$|R
