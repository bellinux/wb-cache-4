5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green in rare cases. Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with a silky luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is 3.13 while its calculated <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, {{about the}} same as a copper coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27g/mole and its <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> can range between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.|$|E
5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
40|$|Latex {{pregnancy}} {{tests were}} performed on 737 urine samples submitted to a hospital laboratory for Friedman tests. Clinical confirmation of the diagnoses was obtained in 666. Nine Friedman and 31 latex tests were falsely positive in 199 samples having <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> over 1. 015. Each test gave four false-positive results in 65 samples with <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> under 1. 015. Between six and 13 weeks of gestation, nine Friedman and 45 latex tests were negative in 176 samples with <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> above 1. 015; below 1. 015, five Friedman and 15 latex tests were false in 42 samples. At other stages of pregnancy, seven Friedman and 18 latex tests were negative in 56 samples with <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> over 1. 015 and, under 1. 015, nine samples had four negative latex tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{compaction}} {{curves of}} soils are generally {{expressed in terms}} of dry density and water content. While this representation serves well to compare the efficiency of compaction of different soils whose <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> lie in a narrow range (2. 6 to 2. 7), it fails for materials of varying <b>specific</b> <b>gravities.</b> It has been shown that for fly ashes {{with a wide range of}} <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> the degree of compaction of different fly ashes cannot be compared from conventional compaction parameters. Compaction curves expressed on a volume basis, viz., volume of solids per unit volume of compacted sample or porosity or void ratio and volume of water per unit volume of solids, can better serve to explain the compaction. Further, it has been shown that for fly ashes of different <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> only compaction parameters expressed on a volume basis can be interrelated...|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} short-term allowable {{lateral resistance}} {{according to the}} current Japanese design standard for timber structures [9] of nailed plywood–timber joints with Todomatsu timber and Karamatsu plywood is 66  % of 667  N, which is two-thirds of the control static maximum load. In this design standard, the allowable lateral resistance is conservatively given for the lower limit <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> of the materials. Because the <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> of the materials {{used in this study}} were higher than the lower limit values, the short-term allowable lateral resistance was adjusted to the actual <b>specific</b> <b>gravities.</b> The resultant short-term allowable resistance was 494  N, 74  % of 667  N [9]. As a result, one-third, two-thirds and three-thirds of the control maximum load corresponded to 0.68, 1.36 and 2.03 times the short-term allowable lateral resistance adjusted to the actual <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> of the materials. In this study, the rounded average maximum load was adopted as the control value with no conservative estimation. This was due to the consideration that an underestimation of the input forces would result in an overestimation of the dynamic resistance.|$|R
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is the allotrope {{of carbon}} {{in which the}} carbon atoms are {{arranged}} in the specific type of cubic lattice called diamond cubic. Diamond is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good. The precise tensile strength of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60GPa has been observed, {{and it could be}} as high as 90–225GPa depending on the crystal orientation. The anisotropy of diamond hardness is carefully considered during diamond cutting. Diamond has a high refractive index (2.417) and moderate dispersion (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's crystal structure, and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide range of colors seen in diamond. Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors. Unlike many other minerals, the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of diamond crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from diamond to diamond.|$|E

5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
25|$|High <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is a {{diagnostic}} property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates {{to a change}} in <b>specific</b> <b>gravity.</b> Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe2O3, has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 5.26 while galena, PbS, has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 7.2–7.6, which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> becomes very pronounced in native metals; kamacite, an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 7.9, and gold has an observed <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> between 15 and 19.3.|$|E
25|$|Although {{ethylene}} glycol hydrometers {{are widely available}} and mass-marketed for antifreeze testing, they give false readings at high temperatures because <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> changes with temperature.

25|$|Often, <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> {{is cited}} {{in place of}} density. <b>Specific</b> <b>gravity</b> {{is defined as the}} density of the solvent divided by the density of water at the same temperature. As such, <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is a unitless value. It readily {{communicates}} whether a water-insoluble solvent will float (SG < 1.0) or sink (SG > 1.0) when mixed with water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>gravity</b> numerically {{describes}} {{the density of}} a mineral. The dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m3 or g/cm3. <b>Specific</b> <b>gravity</b> measures how much water a mineral sample displaces. Defined as the quotient {{of the mass of}} the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water, <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is a unitless ratio. Among most minerals, this property is not diagnostic. Rock forming minerals – typically silicates or occasionally carbonates – have a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 2.5–3.5.|$|E

25|$|The {{single most}} {{revealing}} property of wood {{as an indicator}} of wood quality is <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> (Timell 1986), as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. <b>Specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases.
