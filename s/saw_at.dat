5|$|Chana's first {{teacher was}} D.C. Sears, an Oregon, Illinois resident. The late 19th century <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> least ten {{individuals}} teach at Chana School at different times. By 1888, Pine Rock Township {{was ready to}} address {{the question of whether or}} not to build a high school; Chana students attended high school in Oregon. The question was brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to Oregon schools after eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{when the}} U.S. and Iran were on {{friendly}} terms, the U.S. sold 225 F-4D, F-4E, and RF-4E Phantoms to Iran. The Imperial Iranian Air Force <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> least one engagement, {{resulting in a}} loss, after an RF-4C was rammed by a Soviet MiG-21 during Project Dark Gene, an ELINT operation during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{had built}} up a {{military}} that consumed as much as 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E

5|$|Sarah Wayne Callies as Sara Tancredi (seasons 1–2, 4–5): Sara is {{the prison}} doctor at Fox River and the {{daughter}} of Governor Frank Tancredi, who is linked into the plot that brings Lincoln to Fox River. She takes a liking to Michael and eventually aids his escape. She ultimately joins them on the run. Callies was the first actress the producers <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> the audition {{for the role of}} Sara Tancredi and was also the first to become a principal cast member.|$|E
5|$|The ride is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. The setting is based on {{encounters}} with the ghost of one Jack Darke, who was killed by a buzz <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> a sawmill built after the gold rush ended.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they <b>saw,</b> <b>at</b> Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E
50|$|Charles {{plays his}} musical <b>saws</b> <b>at</b> events {{throughout}} the UK. He is now {{actively involved in}} promoting the instrument through workshops and public concerts. He composes music for the instrument, provides backing tracks for other musicians and gives advice to saw makers and other composers.|$|R
40|$|A {{fluidics}} apparatus for {{manipulation of}} at least one fluid sample is disclosed. A manipulation surface locates the fluid sample. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) generation material layer is provided. This is a polycrystalline material, textured polycrystalline material, biaxially textured polycrystalline material, microcrystalline material, nanocrystalline material, amorphous material or composite material. A transducer electrode structure arranged <b>at</b> the <b>SAW</b> generation material layer provides <b>SAWs</b> <b>at</b> the manipulation surface for interaction with the fluid sample. The manipulation surface has a phononic structure, for affecting the transmission, distribution and/or behaviour of <b>SAWs</b> <b>at</b> the manipulation surface. The apparatus is typically manufactured by reel-to-reel processes, to reduce the unit cost to a level at which the apparatus can be considered to be disposable after a single use...|$|R

5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{believed}} in the abolition of slavery, inspired not only on written works by Victor Schoelcher, John Brown, Lamartine and Tapia, but also on personal experience, {{based on what he}} <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> his father's farm and in daily Puerto Rican life. Based on his beliefs, he founded a civic organization in 1856, one of many others that were later called the Secret Abolitionist Societies by historians. Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature, but Betances and Salvador Brau (a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico) describe them in their writings. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries where slavery had been abolished already; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E

Then I held my breath, and stooping forward, with the penknife in my hand, commenced steadily <b>sawing</b> <b>at</b> the bottom knot which bound the sail to the mast. Directly it parted I cut a great slit in the sail itself.|$|R

5|$|Producer Gianni Nunnari was not {{the only}} person {{planning}} a film about the Battle of Thermopylae; director Michael Mann already planned a film of the battle based on the book Gates of Fire. Nunnari discovered Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights. 300 was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton, and Michael B. Gordon wrote the script. Director Zack Snyder was hired in June 2004 as he had attempted to make a film based on Miller's novel before making his debut with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Snyder then had screenwriter Kurt Johnstad rewrite Gordon's script for production and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer. Frank Miller's original graphic novel 300 was inspired by the film The 300 Spartans, which Frank Miller first <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> age 6.|$|E
5|$|Sir Joseph {{commissioned}} Pistrucci {{to craft}} a cameo of King George III. As the King was ill with porphyria, Pistrucci modelled the likeness from Marchant's three-shilling bank token, and cut it in red jasper for a fee of 50 guineas. Banks showed the cameo to William Wellesley-Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington and the Master of the Mint, who was greatly impressed {{by the quality of}} what he <b>saw.</b> <b>At</b> this time, the Royal Mint was preparing to issue new gold and silver coins as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816, and in June of that year, Pole decided to hire Pistrucci to make models in stone for the new coinage that could be converted into steel dies by the Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions with $2 million, and also approved {{a bonus for}} Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 along with his $54,000 salary. As President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel From Russia with Love among his ten favourite books of all time in Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to Bond's cinematic debut in Dr. No. From Russia with Love was the last film President Kennedy <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> the White House on 20 November 1963 before going to Dallas. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam, who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain; title designer Maurice Binder was replaced by Robert Brownjohn, and stunt coordinator Bob Simmons was unavailable and was replaced by Peter Perkins though Simmons performed stunts in the film. John Barry replaced Monty Norman as composer of the soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain <b>saw</b> <b>at</b> the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E
