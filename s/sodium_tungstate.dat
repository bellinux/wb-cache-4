40|$|Energy {{transfer}} studies {{employing the}} <b>sodium</b> rare earth <b>tungstates</b> (scheelite structure) indicate {{a number of}} modes of, and requirements for, nonradiative interaction. Direct dipole-dipole interactions are prevalent. How-ever, dipole-quadrupole interactions are observed for {{the states of the}} larger rare earth ions that lie high in energy. The relation of lifetime (re) to in-tensity changes with the mode of transfer. Phonon assisted transfer is enhanced by exchange coupling between rare earth ions in nearest or next nearest neighbor positions. Excitation may migrate between Tb ions in such positions when thermally activated and provided a suitable quenching center (e. g., Nd, Eu) is present. Such migration appears to be directional in comparison to transfer by radiation reabsorption. The latter is essentially random. Methods for analyzing lifetime data for transfer interactions are also discussed. Energy transfer between rare earth (RE) ions is a subject of appreciable current interest for practica...|$|R
40|$|Motivation Molybdenum {{containing}} suboxides {{are widely}} used as partial oxidation catalysts e. g. the partial oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid is performed on such a system. These systems usually contain additional elements such as V, W, Nb etc. The role of these elements is quite unclear. Their intrinsic properties could be either important for the catalytic process, or they are structural promoters leading to a certain defect structure which is vital for catalysis [1]. To clarify this a precipitation method was chosen, leading to a controlled variation of solid precursors for catalysts without having to change the chemical composition. In this work the pH dependency of a mixed ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) and ammonium metavanadate (AMV) solution is investigated. Chemical transformations are monitored {{as well as the}} precipitation. This will offer a detailed insight in the processes occurring in solution. The aim is to control as many parameters as possible to ensure a reproducible preparation. Further, a profound understanding of the process should lead to a rational preparation of defects, which are important for catalysis. Experimental Respective amounts of either ammonia, <b>sodium</b> or lithium <b>tungstates</b> or molybdates were dissolved in bi-distilled water. Nitric acid was added at a controlled rate. the pH values were monitored online by a calibrated glass electrode and in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy was performed with a fibre (configuration 8 around one). Results The chemical transformations occurring in solutions can by followed by the changes of the spectra in between 380 nm and 420 nm (Fig. 1). The counter cations present in the solution are involved in the nucleation and the precipitation process. The larger the cation, the easier the precipitation. Starting from AHM and K 2 MoO 4, spontaneous precipitation is observed at about pH 2, with Na 2 MoO 4 precipitation sets in within 2 hours at elevated temperature. Solutions of Li 2 MoO 4 stay stable at pH= 2 without any precipitation over weeks. The spectra reveal: Þ a continuing alteration of the freshly generated precipitate dispersed in the solution with time; Þ a continuing (red) shift for the absorption of the fresh precipitate with increasing V content; Þ the occurrence of a transient intermediate state just before the precipitation sets on; Þ the nature of oligomeric species formed in the acidified solutions depends on the V-concentration...|$|R

40|$|Aims: <b>Sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> is an anti-obesity drug {{targeting}} peripheral tissues. In vivo, <b>sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> reduces body weight gain and food intake through increasing energy expenditure and lipid oxidation, {{but it also}} modulates hypothalamic gene expression when orally administered, raising {{the possibility of a}} direct effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> on the central nervous system. Methods: <b>Sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> was administered intraperitoneally (ip) to Wistar rats, and its levels were measured in cerebrospinal fluid through mass spectrometry. Body weight gain and food intake were monitored for 24 h after its administration in the third ventricle. Hypothalamic protein was obtained and subjected to western blot. In vitro, hypothalamic N 29 / 4 cells were treated with 100 μM <b>sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> or 1 nM leptin, and protein and neural gene expression were analysed. Results: <b>Sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> crossed the blood-brain barrier, reaching a concentration of 1. 31 ± 0. 07 mg/l in cerebrospinal fluid 30 min after ip injection. When centrally administered, <b>sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> decreased body weight gain and food intake and increased the phosphorylation state of the main kinases and proteins involved in leptin signalling. In vitro, <b>sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> increased the phosphorylation of janus kinase- 2 (JAK 2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase- 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2), but the activation of each kinase did not depend on each other. It regulated c-myc gene expression through the JAK 2 /STAT system and c-fos and AgRP (agouti-related peptide) gene expression through the ERK 1 / 2 pathway simultaneously and independently. Conclusions: <b>Sodium</b> <b>tungstate</b> increased the activity of several kinases involved in the leptin signalling system in an independent way, making it a suitable and promising candidate as a leptin-mimetic compound in order to manage obesity. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
