25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{wished to}} bring back the Daleks, as they were popular among {{children}} and had become [...] "one of the regulars". He stated in March 2010 that he and the production team had considered redesigning the Daleks. Mark Gatiss, the writer of the episode, was instructed by Moffat to write an episode about [...] "Churchill versus the Daleks". Gatiss was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the premise at first, but then became excited about doing a war movie, of which he was fond, and his own Dalek story. For research, he visited the real Cabinet War Rooms and read diaries and first-hand accounts of the war. Gatiss's inspiration was the 1966 serial The Power of the Daleks, though he had never seen it due to it being lost, which depicted them as more sly and silent, an aspect he called [...] "very scary, more than when they're just barking orders".|$|E

500|$|Upon AJ's arrival, Ally Ross of The Sun said: [...] "New arrivals have {{included}} [...] Masood's supposedly funny and long-lost brother AJ, {{who made the}} fatal mistake of arriving with the line: 'Do I look like a comedian?' No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E

[...] Later on, suspicious of Liu Shiche, he had Liu Shiche executed. [...] However, under attacks by Li Shimin and Li Shentong, Xu's territory continued to shrink.

Just a {{non-stop}} battle capturing {{the story of}} this feud" [...] and rating it as 4 and a quarter stars out of five. Caldwell rated the tag-team title match at 2 and a quarter stars out of five, describing it as [...] "an up-and-down match with the main issue of no reason to view New Day as heels". He gave the United States Championship match 2 and three-quarters out of 5, calling it as a [...] "solid, unspectacular singles match", and wrote that the Divas Championship match [...] "was more of a bridge to what was next" [...] in reference to the appearance of Sasha Banks. Caldwell gave the Rumble main event 3 and three-quarters out of 5, commenting that there were [...] "overall, too many downpoints for this year's Rumble hurting some up-points".

2500|$|Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton {{were mainly}} {{responsible}} for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. Portal 2 was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from Portal. However, the demand {{for all of these}} to be implemented into Portal 2 was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and Portal 2 to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were [...] "at-odds": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want to wake her up and questioned why players would want to do that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more [...] "computery-sounding" [...] voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley [...] "sounded perfectly human" [...] due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered {{by the fact that the}} new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should [...] "go someplace" [...] and that since GLaDOS is [...] "kind of likeable in the first game" [...] and players [...] "enjoy being with her", they would utilize Wheatley as an [...] "other, external threat". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 809, the warlord Wang Shizhen the {{military}} governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) died. [...] His son Wang Chengzong requested to succeed his father. [...] Emperor Xianzong, encouraged by his prior success against Li Qi and Liu Pi, considered {{taking control of}} the circuit by force. [...] Pei opposed — pointing out that Wang would be a much more difficult target than Li Qi or Liu, particularly since Emperor Xianzong had previously allowed Li Shidao, the son of a much more defiant warlord (Li Na), to inherit Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). [...] Tutu, hoping to seize power from Pei, advocated military action and further requested to command the troops. [...] Not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Emperor Xianzong sent the deputy mayor of Jingzhao, Pei Wu (裴武), to Chengde, to meet with Wang and to observe the situation. [...] Wang was polite to Pei Wu and offered to cede control of two of Chengde's six prefectures — De (德州, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (棣州, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) — to the imperial government. [...] Emperor Xianzong thus agreed to commission Wang as the new military governor. [...] However, after Pei Wu returned from Chengde, Wang reneged on his promise, and further, there were accusations that Pei Wu spent the night at Pei Ji's mansion after returning to Chang'an before meeting the emperor, against regulations. [...] Emperor Xianzong was incensed, and was ready to exile Pei Wu. [...] Li Jiang pointed out that Pei Wu had previously not submitted to the powerful rebel general Li Huaiguang and that Pei Ji was familiar with government regulations and would not have violated them; he believed that these accusations were intended to undermine not only Pei Wu, but also Pei Ji. [...] Emperor Xianzong thus decided not to act against Pei Wu. [...] It was also around this time that, pursuant to the suggestions of Pei and Li Fan that a peace treaty was signed with Tufan.|$|E
