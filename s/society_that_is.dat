5|$|Over {{the course}} of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been {{alternately}} neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing {{its status as a}} congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker George A. Romero {{was brought}} in with {{a vision of a}} zombie-style horror movie similar to Night of the Living Dead, but which also relied heavily upon {{elements}} of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens {{as a result of his}} preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script then progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the book, Bernier dismissed the contents as [...] "soap-opera politics and completely ridiculous" [...] and denied ever criticizing Harper or constituents. The Ottawa Citizen reviewer, Chris Cobb, and The Globe and Mails, Christie Blatchford called Couillard's story self-righteous, contradictory, and conveniently vague. Cobb commented that [...] "viewed through a political lens, it's an entertaining page-turner" [...] as it provides [...] "a rare glimpse inside the closed, controlled <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the Harper government". [...] Additionally, writer, William Johnson, said the book story unfolds like pulp fiction or a soap opera and compares Couillard to the abused heroine in Justine who does not learn from her calamities.|$|E
500|$|The One Thousand and One Nights {{collection}} {{includes several}} tales featuring [...] "sea people", such as [...] "Djullanar the Sea-girl".

They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater. [...] In the tale [...] "Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land. [...] The underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist.

500|$|Besides {{the above}} {{discussion}} about contributions and caveats, the summit was noticed to paint an optimistic {{picture of the}} war in Afghanistan and Afghanistan's future. For instance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that [...] "real progress" [...] had been made in Afghanistan and that this was the main highlight of the summit. He strongly disagreed with visions of [...] "doom and gloom," [...] and added that five years after the defeat of the Taliban regime, Afghanistan had become a democratic <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> [...] "no longer a threat to the world." [...] He also believed that the defeat of the insurgency {{was only a matter of}} time, stating that the war in Afghanistan [...] "is winnable, it is being won, but it is not yet won because, of course, we have many challenges in Afghanistan." [...] In his opinion, these challenges included besides military engagement mainly reconstruction and development work.|$|E

500|$|In October 1772, {{he arrived}} on the {{mainland}} and began learning fundamental subjects missing from his education.

He came {{under the influence of}} William Livingston, a leading intellectual and revolutionary, with whom he lived for a time at his Liberty Hall. Hamilton entered The King's College in New York City (now Columbia University) in the autumn of 1773 [...] "as a private student", and officially matriculated in May 1774. His friend Robert Troup spoke glowingly of Hamilton's ability to clearly and concisely explain the rights and reasons that the patriots had in their case against the British, in what is credited as his first public appearance on July 6, 1774 at the liberty pole at King's College. Hamilton, Troup, and four other undergraduates formed an unnamed literary <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a precursor of the Philolexian Society.|$|E
500|$|Zappa in New York {{featured}} {{a song about}} sex criminal Michael H. Kenyon, [...] "The Illinois Enema Bandit", which featured Don Pardo providing the opening narrative in the song. Like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references, leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content. Zappa dismissed the criticism by noting {{that he was a}} journalist reporting on life as he saw it. Predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: [...] "What do you make of a <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you the moment you hear them?" [...] The remaining albums released by Warner Bros. Records without Zappa's consent were Studio Tan in 1978 and Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites in 1979, which contained complex suites of instrumentally-based tunes recorded between 1973 and 1976, and whose release was overlooked {{in the midst of the}} legal problems.|$|E

When asked if he had a problem with oil companies making a profit, Gilmore stated that he saw no problems with it and that he believed this was [...] "an appropriate thing to do." [...] He later confirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol because it [...] "was going to basically just transfer money directly to Russia for nothing" [...] and that it must include [...] "every nation of the world in this entire project...includ China and India" [...] to meet his approval. But at the end of the debate when asked if he believed a conservative could include conservationist principles, he answered that he believed it could be a part of the platform because [...] "energy independence...is a national security issue" [...] which serves the interests of Conservatives by preserving a [...] "clean <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also safe and secure for the nation." ...|$|E
