5000|$|Android Beam is {{activated}} by placing devices {{back to back}} with the content to be shared displayed on the screen. If the content is able to be sent, the screen will shrink down and display [...] "Tap to Beam" [...] at the top. Tapping the screen sends the content from the one device to the other. A <b>sound</b> will <b>play</b> when <b>devices</b> are near and able to beam. When the data has been sent, a confirmation tone will play or a negative tone will play if failed and the content will shrink off the screen indicating beaming is complete. Sharing is one direction and the device sending content will not get content from the receiving device.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{reviews of}} Helon Habila&rsquo;s Measuring Time {{concentrated}} on literary features, such as theme, plot, characterization and subject {{matter in the}} text. However, such reviews have {{paid little attention to}} the role <b>sound</b> <b>devices</b> <b>play</b> in foregrounding stylistic meaning, which is very crucial for a comprehensive description and interpretation of the text. This study, therefore, applies the insights and techniques of general linguistics to investigate the stylistic value of phonological devices as semantic signifiers or reinforcers in the text. Specifically, the study deploys M. A. K. Halliday&rsquo;s three metafunctions of language viz: ideational, interpersonal and textual, as the analytical model, to examine the use of sound devices such as parallelism, repetition, alliteration, assonance and onomatopoeia, to foreground aspects of meaning in the text. The study posits that, as a level of language study, phonological structure plays a fundamental role in encoding the meaning and aesthetics of Helon Habila&rsquo;s text, and literary discourse in general...|$|R
50|$|In theory, it is {{possible}} to bypass all these measures by constructing a player that creates a copy of every frame and <b>sound</b> it <b>plays.</b> Although this is not within the capability of most people, many bootleggers simply record the video being displayed with a video camera or use recording and <b>playing</b> <b>devices</b> that are not designed to use the protection measures. In fact, the Motion Picture Association of America has recommended use of a camcorder as an alternative to circumventing the Content Scrambling System on DVDs.|$|R
