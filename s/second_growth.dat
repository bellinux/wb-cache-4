5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive <b>second</b> <b>growth</b> appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the <b>second</b> <b>growth</b> forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions {{as a reminder of}} the past, as well as displays of new equipment.
