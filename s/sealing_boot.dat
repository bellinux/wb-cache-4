40|$|This study {{registers}} {{a finite}} element analysis of a <b>seal</b> <b>boot</b> used in constant velocity driveshafts, that was performed in the MSC/NASTRAN software for Windows NT 4. 0 in a Personal Computer. By this analysis the structure’s behavior was studied in its work life before construction of the actual prototype. Analysis was made in existing <b>seal</b> rubber <b>boot,</b> showing good accuracy level when compared with actual part displacement test results. At first, critical joint motions were selected to identify the constrains and symmetric plans. The hyperelastic material was approached to an elastic material in this first step to apply in a plate element model of the part. Then the results of general part behavior, like displacements, and contacts were examined and contrasted with laboratory test reports of the real part. Prototype development time can be saved in the design phase since the part can be improved by this theoretical prediction tool. Failure points can be predicted by the analysis saving resources such as developing production tools, making prototypes and testing them to finally detect the items {{that have to be}} improved. ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{few months}} of summer, the people moved camp to the estuaries, because there {{it was easier to}} catch the favoured Arctic char, e.g. by using {{artificial}} weirs, and the eggs of seabirds. For the inland Inuit, the caribou was the most important resource; it provided meat, a hide for clothing, and sinew for rope. The coastal Inuit hunted mostly seals and walruses and, depending on the region, narwhals and belugas; of course also the occasional caribou. The seals were used for food for men and dogs. Their oil was used for the kudliks, and their skin and sinews for <b>seal</b> <b>boots</b> (kamik), kayak coverings, ropes (also drag ropes for dog sleds) and dog whips.|$|R
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} better thermal {{protection}} than most wetsuits, and isolate the diver {{from the environment}} more effectively than other exposure suits. When diving in contaminated water, a drysuit with integral <b>boots,</b> <b>sealed</b> dry gloves and a helmet sealed directly to the suit provides the best environmental isolation. The suit material must be selected to be compatible with the expected contaminants. Thermal undersuits can be matched to the expected water temperature.|$|R

25|$|Shoes were {{narrow and}} often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a medium height heel. Buttons, patent leather, and laced {{models of the}} shoe were also {{manufactured}} and readily available. Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur {{to stave off the}} winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter. At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. Shoes were commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having <b>boots</b> made of <b>seal</b> skin was most common for people in a higher social class. <b>Seal</b> skin <b>boots</b> were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and other fabrics, and shoes were starting to incorporate a fabric topping.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the Demon in a Bottle storyline, Hammer invented a device called the Hypersonic Scan Transmitter which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control {{affecting}} Iron Man's unibeam, <b>sealing</b> plates, and <b>boot</b> jets. Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, he took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals (consisting of Beetle I, Constrictor, Discus, Leap-Frog, Man-Killer, Porcupine I, Stiletto, and Water Wizard) against Iron Man. Ultimately, Tony Stark not only cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but finally learned that he has had a major enemy behind multiple attacks on his interests for years.|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} of {{dielectric}} grease is in high-voltage connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease {{is applied to}} the rubber boot of the plug wire. This helps the rubber boot slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to <b>seal</b> the rubber <b>boot,</b> {{while at the same time}} preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from galvanic corrosion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a Common Criteria protection profile for high assurance security kernels (HASK-PP) {{based on the}} results and experiences of several (international) projects on design and implementation of trustworthy platforms. Our HASK-PP was motivated by the fact that currently no protection profile is available that appropriately covers trusted computing features such as trusted <b>boot,</b> <b>sealing,</b> and trusted channels (secure channels with inherent attestation). In particular, we show how trusted computing features are modeled in the HASK protection profile without depending on any concrete implementation for these features. Instead, this is left to the definition of the security targets of a an IT product which claims conformance to the HASK-PP. Our HASK protection profile was evaluated and certified at evaluation assurance level five (EAL 5) by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{constantly}} increasing market {{requirements of}} high-quality vehicles compel automotive manufacturers to perform lifetime testing {{to verify the}} reliability levels of new products. A common problem is {{that only a small}} number of samples of a system 2 ̆ 7 s component can be tested. In automotive applications, mechanical components subjected to cyclic loading have to be designed against fatigue. In this paper, the Bayesian estimation of lognormal distribution parameters (usually used to define the fatigue lifetime of rubber components) is studied to improve the accuracy of estimation while incorporating the available knowledge on the product. In particular, the finite element results and experts 2 ̆ 7 opinions are considered prior knowledge. For lifetime prediction by Finite Element Method (FEM), a model based on the Brown-Miller law was developed for the rubberlike <b>boot</b> <b>seal</b> material...|$|R

(Golder) has {{prepared}} this letter presenting {{the results of}} subgrade sampling to characterize the extent of potential soil impacts beneath the liner of the compost area high-flow pond at Recology Hay Road (RHR). The subgrade sampling was carried out {{as described in the}} Subgrade Sampling Plan dated September 16, 2010. 1 In addition, the subgrade below the adjacent low-flow pond was sampled. Background Earlier this year, RHR personnel noted that a gas bubble had formed under the base of the compost area high-flow pond liner. Inspection of the liner revealed holes below the water level along the northeastern side-slope geomembrane liner and several holes that appeared {{to be associated with the}} anchor penetrations for the pond aerators. The <b>boot</b> <b>seals</b> were observed to be torn at locations along the northeastern side slope and along the southern corner side slope. A report on the cause of the gas formation under the compost pond liner was submitted to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) by letter dated June 4, 2010.

5000|$|Sealed {{ball joints}} {{do not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most ball joints had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed ball joints to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all ball joints on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed ball joints to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust <b>boot</b> <b>seal's</b> that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Implicature, Relevance Theory, and MovieImplicature is {{what the}} addresser wants to convey without stating it explicitly. In this study, the writer intends to analyze an implicature in Megamind Movie using Relevance Theory. This study is {{conducted}} to find out (1) the explicature conveyed in the utterances of the main character in Megamind movie. (2) The implicated premises and implicated conclusion conveyed in the utterances of the main character in Megamind movie. The writer uses Sperber and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s theory in analyzing the data. This study is qualitative study since the writer analyzed utterances taken from the dialogue of the main characters in Megamind Movie. Research design is document analysis. From the data obtained, the writer {{tried to find out}} the explicature, implicated premise, and implicated conclusion based on Relevance Theory proposed by Sperber and Wilson (1995). In this study the writer found 14 utterances that convey an implicature. To answer research problem the writer gave an example from the conversation that were taken from datum 2. The context of this conversation is when Megamind crashing Metroman 2 ̆ 7 s Memorial Day by kidnapping Roxanne Ritchi. Metroman is threatening Megamind to put him into jail by saying We all know how this ends, with you behind the bars. The word ‘we 2 ̆ 7 refers to Metroman and all the citizen of Metro city, while ‘this 2 ̆ 7 refers to the battle between Megamind and Metroman. The last, ‘you 2 ̆ 7 refers to Megamind. Then, Megamind responses Metroman 2 ̆ 7 s threat by saying Oh, I am shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boot. The word ‘I 2 ̆ 7 refers to Megamind. From the explicature, Megamind responds may irrelevant. But it conveys an implicature. There are many causes to make people shaking and that creates the implicated premises; Megamind is shaking because it is cold; Megamind is shaking because of terrifying; Megamind is shaking just because he wants to; Megamind is shaking just because he pretends to be. From the implicated premise. It may seem that Megamind terrifies being threatened by Metroman, but in reality Megamind does not fear at all. The intended meaning is he just pretending to be and mocking Metroman by showing his baby <b>seal</b> leather <b>boot.</b> Thus the implicated conclusion is Megamind does not fear of Metroman. The writer draws conclusion that Relevance Theory is concern with ostensive communication that is intentional communication through an addressee that can understand the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s thought. This study hopefully can provide appropriate references for further researcher to conduct the research in implicature. It is recommended for the next researchers to conduct similar studies to be analyzed using Relevance Theory with different object such as novel, magazine or even article...|$|R
