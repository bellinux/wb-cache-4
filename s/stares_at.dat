5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, he <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the thin slot and grins.|$|E
60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. He returned; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the dead {{rhinoceros}} {{and at the}} hole in its throat; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the still smoking rifle.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the man, before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|Peggy tries {{in vain to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, heads upstairs to Lily and becomes trapped. She uses the crowbar to smash a boarded-up window and hands Lily over to Ryan, who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside {{and returns to the}} building with Billy. They find him trapped beneath a wooden beam, and are able to drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{produced}} a sealed packet, which Captain Cuttle <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{as he had}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the keys.|$|R

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of a fence and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually zooming out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms. Throughout {{the majority of the}} visual, the girls are featured performing erratic behaviour, which includes them banging against a fence, yelling for help towards the audience, and occasionally laughing at them. While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to kiss, and the audience slightly <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> their actions. Following this, several members of the public start to talk to each other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E
5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull on the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
60|$|Again Dingaan moaned, for he {{had heard}} these very words spoken. Umbopa turned and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, and he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Umbopa.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stopped}} short, for Peter's eyes were staring more roundly than usual {{and the hand}} that fumbled at his locket trembled visibly. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Aunt Hannah, he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Irene; {{but most of all}} he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Mary Louise, who seemed to sense from his manner some {{impending}} misfortune.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{for a few}} moments, {{there was}} silence, while Dot and Tot <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the hairy old man and he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{version of}} the game ends with Greedy, and two underlings, Iounus and Uranium, {{stranded}} on a deserted planet, {{with a picture of}} Ristar appearing in the space, while Greedy simply <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> it. The ending scene shown in the English shows Ristar being re-united with his father once again.|$|E
25|$|Pilot {{awareness}} and response. Ideally, pilots will {{be aware of}} laser and bright light hazards, and will know how to recover {{in case of an}} incident. Conversely, a pilot can make the situation worse if he or she overreacts, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the light to try to locate its source, or takes immediate unnecessary evasive maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|The camera {{manages to}} capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, {{flickering}} lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches {{and there is}} a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.|$|E
60|$|He {{came to a}} full stop. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the notice-plate, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{the glass}} door, and turning round, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the over-pathetic dead soldier {{on the arm of}} his over-heroic pistol-firing comrade; Mentana--and the date! Aaron {{wondered}} what and where Mentana was. Then at last he summoned his energy, opened the glass door, and mounted the first stairs.|$|R
6000|$|Now all <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Bes who {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling, and I rose to say something, I know not what, when suddenly the doors opened and through them appeared heralds, crying, ...|$|R

25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the sky, {{coming to grips with}} what has happened.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E
25|$|Moments later, Gold asks Fiona {{to reopen}} the {{investigation}} into Belle’s disappearance. As Fiona tries {{to talk him out}} of it, she shows him pictures of Belle enjoying life in other countries, and wants Gold to move on from Belle. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Hook and David began their search for the magic beans and Hook finds one, only to encounter a dragon. The creature chases them down the beanstalk after they take the bean. At the hospital, Henry wakes up and discovers that Fiona is manipulating Emma during their visit. Afterwards, Fiona finally succeeds in convincing Emma to burn the storybook in the furnace as Fiona tells Emma it's the only way to keep Henry safe and to end the delusions. Thanks to Fiona's scheme, most of the realms depicted in the book are consumed by Darkness (at least 17 realms), and the Darkness arrives on the outskirts of the Enchanted Forest, in the form of a massive storm of Dark Magic. However, as the book is burning, the pages flip to a picture of Hook, and Emma <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> his image as the flames consume the page.|$|E
6000|$|Masouda ran {{forward and}} prostrated herself at full length, but Godwin and Wulf <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the heap, and the heap <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> them. Then, at some motion of his chin, Masouda arose and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Johnny Chuck <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Peter Rabbit, and Peter <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Johnny Chuck. Nobody {{was to be}} seen in the Smiling Pool, and {{yet there}} were those voices--oh, so many of them--coming right out of the water.|$|R
