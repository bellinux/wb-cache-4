The two most prominent <b>security</b> <b>features</b> are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the Kinegram (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face value, while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) and the face value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol with the face value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E

5|$|The second dollar (ZWN) was {{replaced}} on 1 August 2008 {{by the third}} dollar (ZWR), which was then phased out by the fourth dollar (ZWL) with short notice on 2 February 2009 because it rapidly lost value. The economic and trade sanctions imposed against the Zimbabwean government and the Reserve Bank {{made it difficult to}} incorporate modern <b>security</b> <b>features</b> on most banknotes issued since September 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional <b>security</b> <b>features</b> as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 is {{available}} in five main editions for personal computer devices, of which the Home and Pro versions are sold at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Home is aimed at home users, while Pro is aimed at small businesses and enthusiasts. Each edition of Windows10 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it, and add additional features oriented towards their market segments; for example, Pro adds additional networking and <b>security</b> <b>features</b> such as BitLocker, Device Guard, Windows Update for Business, {{and the ability to}} join a domain. The remaining editions, Enterprise and Education, contain additional features aimed towards business environments, and are only available through volume licensing.|$|E
40|$|Recently, Baseri et al. {{proposed}} a secure untraceable off-line electronic cash system. They claimed that their scheme could achieve security requirements of an e-cash system such as, untraceability, anonymity, unlinkability, double spending checking, un-forgeability, date-attachability, and prevent forging coins. They further prove the un-forgeability <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> {{by using the}} hardness of discrete logarithm problems. However, after cryptanalysis, {{we found that the}} scheme cannot attain the <b>security</b> <b>feature,</b> untraceability. We, therefore, modify it to comprise this desired requirement, which is very important in an e-cash system...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, the Clydesdale Bank {{became the}} first bank in Great Britain to issue polymer banknotes. The £5 {{commemorative}} notes, issued to commemorate the 125th anniversary {{of the construction of}} the Forth Bridge, are printed by De La Rue and are the first in Europe to use the company's [...] "Safeguard" [...] polymer substrate <b>security</b> <b>feature.</b> The notes also use the [...] "Spark Orbital" [...] <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> which depicts a reflective map of Scotland over a transparent [...] "window" [...] in the banknote.|$|R

5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited <b>security</b> <b>features.</b> In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern <b>security</b> <b>features</b> that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E
5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked <b>security</b> <b>features</b> such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody said later that he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 Danish krone and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ─ The Internet {{networking}} {{is getting}} more popular in Virtual community which must have a strong <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> to protect member’s privacy and message integrity.

40|$|Facial {{recognition}} {{technology has}} been widely used by the military for identity confirmation and surveillance.
