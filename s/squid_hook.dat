50|$|Onykia ingens, {{the greater}} <b>hooked</b> <b>squid,</b> is {{a species of}} squid in the family Onychoteuthidae. It occurs {{worldwide}} in subantarctic oceans.|$|R
50|$|Filippovia knipovitchi, {{the smooth}} <b>hooked</b> <b>squid,</b> is {{a species of}} squid in the family Onychoteuthidae and the sole member of the genus Filippovia. It {{is found in the}} Antarctic and Atlantic Oceans, and reaches a mantle length of 35 cm.|$|R
50|$|Kondakovia longimana, {{also known}} as the giant warty squid or longarm octopus squid, is a large species of <b>hooked</b> <b>squid.</b> It attains a mantle length of at least 85 cm and {{probably}} over 1.15 m. The largest complete specimen of this species, measuring 2.3 m in total length, was found in Antarctica in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Onykia loennbergii, the Japanese <b>hooked</b> <b>squid,</b> is {{a species}} of squid in the family Onychoteuthidae, named for Swedish {{zoologist}} Einar Lönnberg. It occurs in the Western Pacific Ocean, at an estimated depth of 230-1200 m. The mantle length is approximately 300 mm. Each tentacular club contains 25 hooks. The arms are about 60% {{of the size of}} the mantle length.|$|R
50|$|Onykia robsoni, the rugose <b>hooked</b> <b>squid,</b> is {{a species}} of squid in the family Onychoteuthidae. It occurs in the Antarctic Ocean, at an {{estimated}} depth of 250 - 550 meters. The mantle of this species grows to a length of 75 cm. The species has been suggested as a junior synonym of Onykia carriboea, the tropical clubhook squid, due to similarities between the species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hooked</b> <b>squid,</b> family Onychoteuthidae, {{currently}} comprise approximately 20-25 species (several {{known from}} only single life stages and thus unconfirmed), in {{six or seven}} genera. They range in mature mantle length from 7 cm to a suggested length of 2 m for the largest member, Onykia robusta. The family is characterised {{by the presence of}} hooks only on the tentacular clubs, a simple, straight, funnel-mantle locking apparatus, and a 'step' inside the jaw angle of the lower beak. With the exception of the Arctic Ocean, the family is found worldwide.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} of the first Dark Curse, Hook is yelling at his crew on the Jolly Roger when he is soon confronted by an unknown man who snuck aboard the vessel. But just as Hook is about to kill the {{unwanted}} guest, a Submarine appears, and the mysterious man pushes Hook into the ocean, jumping in after him. Hook then wakes up aboard the Nautilus and meets the stowaway, revealed to be Captain Nemo, who wants Hook to help out with a mission and shows him an enchanted spear blade to make a point. Nemo is aware about Hook's vengeance as he also wants revenge. Inside the caverns, Hook and Nemo search the area and makes friends with a crewman who tells Hook that he also wants revenge on the person who killed his family. Out of nowhere a giant <b>squid</b> attacks <b>Hook</b> upon reaching the location and Nemo uses the spear on the squid, allowing the crewman to save Hook.|$|R
25|$|King {{penguins}} eat {{small fish}} and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans. Fish constitute 80–100% of their diet, except in winter months of July and August, {{when they make}} up only 30%. Lanternfish are the main fish taken, principally the species Electrona carlsbergi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, as well as Protomyctophum tenisoni. Slender escolar (Paradiplospinus gracilis) of the Gempylidae, and Champsocephalus gunneri, is also consumed. Cephalopods consumed include those of the genus Moroteuthis, the <b>hooked</b> <b>squid</b> or Kondakovia longimana, the sevenstar flying squid (Martialia hyadesii), young Gonatus antarcticus and Onychoteuthis species.|$|R
5000|$|In {{regard to}} his zoological research, his primary focus dealt with mammals, birds and fish, {{but he also}} made {{significant}} contributions in his studies of reptiles and amphibians. He was the binomial authority of numerous taxa, and has several species named after him, such as Onykia loennbergii (Japanese <b>hooked</b> <b>squid).</b> The Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger named a small, secretive, venomous, endemic New Guinea elapid snake Apisthocalamus loennbergii in his honour, although this species is now synonymised with Toxicocalamus loriae (Loria's forest snake). In his obituary in the ornithological journal, Ibis, it was written: [...] "that {{since the days of}} Linnaeus hardly anyone has known so much about so many branches of zoology as Lönnberg".|$|R
50|$|The {{revival of}} the Hawaii {{longline}} fleet in the late 1980s meant that larger ocean-going longline vessels began operating from Honolulu. The advent of the new fleet was driven primarily by targeting swordfish, which meant using <b>squid</b> bait on <b>hooks</b> deployed in relatively shallow depths (<30 m) and with light sticks attached to the branch lines. Observers began to be employed on vessels in 1994 and it soon became apparent that in the shallow set fishery there were catches of sea turtles and seabirds. The principal seabirds caught were black-footed and Laysan albatross, and for the turtles, loggerheads and leatherbacks. There were turtle and seabird interactions in the deep set fishery also, but these were one to two orders of magnitude lower than in the shallow set fishery.|$|R
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the <b>hooked</b> <b>squid</b> species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|R
40|$|The present {{survey was}} {{conducted}} {{to find out the}} distribution ratio of useable/trash fish caught by long-line fishing. The purpose of the survey was to obtain fundamental data for examining the homeostatic ecosystem in the ocean, as an application of microcosmology. The long-line fishing was repeated 8 times in June 1980 in the East Indian Ocean by the Kagoshima Maru (1038 t) of Kagoshima University. The operations were carried out by 7042 hooks, consisting of 3200 <b>hooks</b> with synthetic <b>squids</b> and 3842 <b>hooks</b> with frozen saury. The total number of fish caught was 166 individuals. Therefore, the fishing rate was calculated to be 2. 4 %. Tuna and horse mackerel were classified into the "useable fish", and shark and similar fish were shorted into the "trash fish". The distributions of useable and trash fish were estimated to be : 66. 1 to 33. 9 % in body weight, and 54. 8 to 45. 2 % in fish number, respectively...|$|R

2500|$|All {{cephalopods}} reproduce by spawning eggs. Most cephalopods use semi-internal fertilization {{where the}} male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity to fertilize the ova in the female's single ovary. The [...] "penis" [...] in most male cephalopods {{is a long}} and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified sperm-carrying arm called a hectocotylus. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the [...] "penis" [...] is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. In many cephalopods, mating occurs head to head and the male may simply transfer sperm to the female. Others may detach the sperm-carrying arm and leave it attached to the female. Deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles. Penis elongation in the greater <b>hooked</b> <b>squid</b> {{may result in a}} penis that is as long as the mantle, head and arms combined.|$|R
50|$|In the Neverland realm, Hook and {{his crew}} hear a mermaid’s song, which distracts them until they almost strike a series of rocks. Around the same time, {{the father of the}} Seas, Poseidon, scolds his daughter, {{revealed}} to be Ursula in her youth, for ending the song {{just in time for the}} Jolly Roger to escape. Later on at a tavern during a port stop, Hook recognizes the same tune being sung by Ursula, and offers her a drink. She explains to Hook that her father kicked her out of his kingdom for disobeying him, so she stole a magical bracelet that allowed her to walk on land. Ursula also reveals that her mother was killed by a pirate, which is why Poseidon demands Ursula use her voice - the only thing that reminds her of her mother - to steer the ships awry. Hook tells Ursula that listening to her voice was the only thing that has ever taken away his lifelong pain. She shares her plan to sing in Glowerhaven, and he offers to take her there on his ship. Poseidon learns of this and instructs Hook to remove Ursula's ability to sing by using a seashell, in order to ensure that she will never leave the ocean, in exchange for giving Hook a vial of <b>squid</b> ink, which <b>Hook</b> can use to paralyze his enemy Rumplestiltskin.|$|R
40|$|The deep-sea <b>hooked</b> <b>squid,</b> Taningia danae Joubin, 1931 (Octopoteuthidae) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} oceanic squids, {{reaching}} dorsal mantle lengths (DML) of 1700 mm (Nesis 1982; 1987), and has been reported to weigh up to at least 161. 4 kg (Roper & Vecchione 1993). This species is characterised by a conical mantle with large triangular fins that occupy almost the entire mantle length and its width exceeds up to 130 % of the DML. This species has eight short robust arms, with two series of hooks on each arm, and arm pair II with two large oval terminal photophores, which are covered by black eyelidlike skin folds that allow for the controlled flashing of each photophore. Another pair of photophores is embedded on each side of the ink sac. Tentacles are robust on paralarvae but are lost at a dorsal mantle length of 40 to 45 mm (Jereb & Roper 2010). This species has a cosmopolitan distribution, being more abundant in tropical and temperate waters, but has also been observed in boreal areas, e. g. 57 º N in the NE Atlantic. Paralarval and juvenile individuals of T. danae have been caught within Scottish waters (Santos et al. 2001), the North Atlantic Ocean (Clarke & Lu 1974; Okutani 1974; Lu & Clarke 1975), and off Bermuda, Cape Verde and the Madeira Islands (Roper & Vecchione 1993). In the Pacific Ocean the species has been reported from the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand (Roper & Vecchione 1993) and in the Mediterranean Sea from Algerian waters (Quetglas et al. 2006). Santos et al. (2001) reported an incomplete adult female caught at 400 m depth by a commercial trawler in Galician waters. Posteriorly, González et al. (2003) recorded three specimens (two females and a mature male), in the Carrandi fishing ground (Cantabrian sea). A further large specimen (1600 mm ML) was captured at Georges Bank (USA) in the NW Atlantic (Roper & Vecchione 1993). Three living specimens have been video-recorded: two in the Ogasawara Islands’ waters (Japan), in the western North Pacific at 240 and 900 m depth (Kubodera et al. 2007) and one in the waters of the Azores (Seine Seamount) at 2717 m depth (Gomes-Pereira & Tojeira 2014). Despite the small number of catches of large individuals of T. danae, several hundred large beaks have been recorded from sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) stomach contents, suggesting that it is not a rare deep-sea squid species in tropical and subtropical oceans (e. g. Clarke et al. 1993; Smith & Witehead 2000; Evans & Hindell 2004; Clarke 2006). In the Canary Islands, previous records of T. danae come from beaks found in the stomach contents of three Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) stranded in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura in 2002 (Santos et al. 2007) and from the stomach contents of a sperm whale stranded in Fuerteventura in 2005 (Fernández et al. 2009). Later, Bordes et al. (2009) reported three juvenile individuals of 30 - 100 mm ML caught in mesopelagic trawling nets around Gran Canaria and on the south-eastern side of Fuerteventura in 2000 and 2002. This study reports the occurrence of the first adult deep-sea <b>hooked</b> <b>squid</b> in the Canarian archipelago. The studied specimen was collected off SW Tenerife, confirming the presence of all life stages of this species in Canary waters. En prens...|$|R
