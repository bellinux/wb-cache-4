Durch den Aufbau einer Rußschicht auf der Oberfläche des Filters nimmt der Abgasgegendruck während des Fahrzeugbetriebs zu, so dass dieser in regelmäßigen Abständen durch Abbrand des eingelagerten Rußes regeneriert werden muss. Während des Rußabbrands kann es im Filter zu Temperaturüberhöhungen kommen, die zu dessen Zerstörung führen. Gegenstand der vorliegenden Dissertation ist ein Diesel-Partikelfilter auf der Basis eines Filtermediums aus Sintermetall, welches durch die Sinterung eines Edelstahlgranulats auf einem Edelstahl-Streckgitter hergestellt wird. Das Sintermetall-Verbundmaterial wird zu keilförmigen Filtertaschen gefaltet, welche ringförmig um eine zentrale Dichtscheibe angeordnet und verschweißt werden. Die Formstabilität der einzelnen Taschen wird durch wellenförmig gefaltete Abstandshalter aus Blech gewährleistet. Das komplexe Strömungsfeld, die Verteilung des Rußes und der Ablauf der thermischen Regeneration in diesem Filter können durch die in der Literatur vorhandenen Modelle für keramische Wabenfilter nicht beschrieben werden. Grundlage der Untersuchungen ist das numerische Strömungsmodell einer Einzeltasche des Filters unter Verwendung der Strömungssimulationssoftware Fluent. Die Gültigkeit des Strömungsmodells wird durch Abgleich von berechneten Ergebnissen mit Druck- und Geschwindigkeitsmessungen in einem messtechnisch zugänglichen Strömungsexperiment an einer Einzeltasche verifiziert. Eine Erweiterung des Strömungsmodells ermöglicht die Simulation des Rußschichtaufbaus auf der Taschenoberfläche. Hierzu wird angenommen, dass zu jedem Zeitpunkt die abgeschiedene Rußmenge zur Filtrationsgeschwindigkeit {{proportional}} ist, der Ruß also homogen im Abgas verteilt ist. Es wird gezeigt, dass wegen der geringen Größe der Rußteilchen diese Annahme eine zulässige Vereinfachung darstellt. 	 		 Die Ruß-Abbrandrate wurde in Abhängigkeit von der Temperatur und des Sauerstoffgehalts des Gases in einem Versuchsreaktor mit reduzierter geometrischer Komplexität in isothermen Abbrandversuchen gemessen. Die isotherme Prozessführung erlaubt die Untersuchung der Änderung der Abbrandrate während des Reaktionsfortschritts. Aus der Kombination der Strömungssimulationssoftware, mit der die Komponenten-Erhaltungsgleichung für Sauerstoff gelöst wird, mit dem entwickelten Kinetikmodell ergibt sich ein Modell, welches die Simulation des Rußabbrands unter realen Bedingungen ermöglicht. Dieses berücksichtigt auch die Hemmung der Reaktion durch die lokale Abnahme der Sauerstoffkonzentration bei hohen Reaktionsraten. 	 Das Rußabbrand-Modell wird auf das Strömungsmodell des Diesel-Partikelfilters zur Simulation der Regeneration übertragen. Es zeigt sich, dass der numerische Aufwand für den technischen Einsatz - etwa zur Bewertung von Konstruktionsalternativen - sehr hoch ist. Darüber hinaus ist die Übereinstimmung von berechneten und während eines Motorprüfstandsversuchs gemessenen Temperaturen noch nicht zufriedenstellend. Als Ursache der Abweichungen wird das unterschiedliche kinetische Verhalten des Laborrußes im Vergleich zum realen Diesel-Ruß vermutet. Eine systematische Anpassung der Kinetikparameter an die Ergebnisse im Versuch ist aufgrund des zu hohen numerischen Aufwands nicht möglich. 		 Die Ergebnisse der Regenerationssimulation erlauben trotz der ungenauen Wiedergabe der lokalen Temperatur im Filter Aussagen qualitativer Gültigkeit über den Ablauf der Regeneration im Sintermetall-Partikelfilter. Temperaturunterschiede zu Beginn der Regeneration, welche aus der ungleichmäßigen Aufheizung der Filtertasche resultieren, bewirken lokal unterschiedliche Abbrandraten. Die Rußschicht brennt bevorzugt im radial innen gelegenen Bereich des Filters ab, während sie in der Nähe des Filtergehäuses deutlich langsamer abnimmt, so dass unvollständige Regeneration zu erwarten ist. Due to increasingly strict vehicle emission legislation, soot particulates must {{be separated}} from the exhaust gas of modern diesel cars by means of filtration. The engine back pressure increases as a soot layer grows {{on the surface of the}} particulate filter. As a consequence, the filter must be regenerated by increase of the exhaust gas temperature above the soot ignition temperature, which causes its oxidation. During the filter regeneration peak temperature events can occur that cause damage to the filter structure. In this work a diesel particulate filter made from sintered metal is investigated. The filter medium is a compound of a stainless steel wire mesh on which a stainless steel granulate is sintered. From this compound wedge-shaped pockets are folded and welded gas-tight. 50 to 70 pockets are arranged around a <b>sealing</b> <b>disc</b> and welded to each other and a supporting ring around them, resulting in a cylindrical filter. The exhaust gas enters and leaves the filter in the direction of the cylinder axis. The <b>sealing</b> <b>disc</b> and the welds between the pockets are at its downstream end. Between the pockets gaps are formed which open at the upstream side of the filter and narrow along its axis. Inside each filter pocket a folded sheet of stainless steel called spacer maintains its form stability. The complex flow pattern, the soot distribution, and the temperature changes during the thermal regeneration in the filter cannot be predicted by the models currently available in the literature, as these treat ceramic wall flow filters exclusively. The foundation of this investigation is the numerical flow model of a single filter pocket using the commercial CFD software Fluent. After an adaption of the turbulence models to allow for a combination with porous zones, the flow field inside the filter can be calculated. The flow model is validated by pressure and PIV velocity measurements in a flow experiment of a single filter pocket in a plexiglass flow channel. An extension of the flow model allows for the simulation of the soot layer build-up on the filter pocket's surface. Proportionality of the locally deposited soot mass to the filtration velocity is the main assumption, which is equivalent to assuming homogeneous distribution of the soot in the exhaust gas. It can be shown that due to the soot particle's small size this assumption holds valid. In an experimental reactor with reduced geometrical complexity the soot reaction rate with its dependency on temperature and oxygen concentration is experimentally investigated. Isothermal temperature control of the experimental runs allows for the investigation of the reaction rate's dependency on the reaction progress or, in other words, the fraction of remaining soot mass. Combination of the kinetic model with the CFD software, which is used to solve the oxygen conservation equation, results in the complete soot layer combustion model. Mass transfer limitation of the reaction due to local depletion of the oxygen concentration at high reaction rates is thus accounted for. An influence of oxygen concentration gradients within the soot layer on the reaction rate can be neglected, as is shown in a theoretical investigation. The soot layer combustion model is transferred to the flow model of the particulate filter to simulate its regeneration. It turns out that the numerical expense of the full-scale model is too high for technical applications, e. g. assessment of design alternatives. Moreover, the agreement between the resulting temperatures inside the filter pocket with measurements during an engine test bench experiment is still unsatisfactory. A cause for this discrepancy is suspected to lie in the slightly different kinetic properties of the artificial soot used in the laboratory experiments compared to those of real life diesel soot. Systematic adaption of the model's kinetic parameters to the measured temperatures is no option, again due to the high numerical expense of the simulation. In spite of the quantitative inaccuracy of the simulation results some conclusions can be drawn from them concerning the regeneration behavior of the sintered metal diesel particulate filter. Temperature differences at the beginning of the regeneration, that result from the non-uniform convective heat up, lead to local differences in the soot combustion rates. Near the filter's central duct soot reacts rapidly, while toward the outside the reaction proceeds significantly slower. Incomplete regeneration of the filter can thus be expected, but could be avoided by design changes targeting at flow uniformity improvement...|$|E

Polyurethane raw materials are; polyols, isocyanates, water, methylene chloride, catalyst, chain extenders, colourants, air and additives. These raw materials are combined on 'systems' rather than a straight-forward formula, and are formulated to achieve predetermined properties in order to suit end applications. The main aim of this thesis is to develop a deeper understanding of keeping pipeline as much as possible to the as-built condition, as efficient and predictable <b>seal</b> <b>discs</b> facilitate safe and efficient pigging. Keeping maximum continuous flow reduces cost and also increase the life span of the pipeline. This is achieved by the understanding precisely shore grade 65, 75 and 85 used for pigging operations. The structure of this thesis is divided into four parts. The first part involves the determination of the material properties of shore grade 65, 75 and 85 at temperatures of 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C. The material properties of shore grade 65, 75 and 85 are achieved from the stress-strain curve of the polyurethane at the different temperature using tensile test machine. Shore grades are heat treated to the required temperature of minimum of 12 hours in an oven or refrigerator before the tensile test. The second part of the thesis is using the stress - strain data as an input into finite element material database, hence finite element model of the <b>seal</b> <b>discs</b> geometry is created to determine resulting deflection, static reacting forces on the wall. This was achieved by the application of step incremental displacement on the pig discs into the 8 ’’ pipeline in order to generate the static behavior of pig of shore grade 65, 75, & 85 at different temperature.

The hill and its royal fortified city were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2001 and represent Madagascar's only cultural site following the destruction by fire in 1995 of its historic sister city, the Rova of Antananarivo, shortly before the latter's intended inscription to the list. Numerous governmental and civil society organizations support the conservation of Ambohimanga by restoring damaged features and preventing further degradation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} methods {{were carried out}} to investigate the disc flexibility effects on the PRV sealing performances. For the PRV subjected to inner pressure, the calculation {{results show that the}} location of maximum contact press on the sealing ring varies from the outer region to the inner region when the inner pressure increases from 1 to 7 MPa. The PRV with a more flexible disc exhibits a higher maximum contact press, thus resulting in a better sealing performance. For the PRV subjected to impact load in the case of re-closing process, the effects of disc flexibility on the PRV sealing performance was also studied. The finite calculation results indicate that the maximum plastic deformation is located in the outer region of the <b>disc</b> <b>sealing</b> ring and the sliding was occurred on the sealing ring, which is validated by experiments. The maximum plastic deformation and the displacement of sliding increase with a rise of disc flexibility. The plastic deformation and sliding has little effect on the sealing performance when the inner pressure close to setting pressure. As a result, the PRV with a higher disc flexibility showed a better sealing performance after re-closing impact process. The calculation results confirmed that reasonable disc flexibility is very important to guarantee a good sealing performance of PRV...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} unified around {{the theme of}} disc height loss. Current {{knowledge}} {{in the area of}} spine research identifies mechanical overload as the culprit for the initiation of injury to the spine. While genetic predispositions may play a factor in the severity of spine degeneration or in the resiliency to applied load, ultimately, injury occurs when a load exceeds a tissue’s tolerance. Disc height loss {{has the potential to be}} a primary factor in the progression of spinal degeneration. For example, disc height has been touted as a major component for the initiation of pathological and degenerative changes to the spine. Pathologic, non-recoverable disc height loss can occur through herniation or endplate fracture and could result in a degenerative cascade of injury that eventually involves the facet joints, narrows nerve root space, and increases stress at adjacent segments. What is not known is the degree to which disc height affects the degenerative cascade; that is, there is no quantitative data outlining the progression of mechanical consequences at adjacent segments or at the injured segment itself during disc height loss. Further, the degree to which restoring disc height, if even possible, will reverse the process of degeneration is not entirely clear. There is data which suggests that nucleus replacement can restore stress distributions within an injured disc, but the extent of repair material survivability is unknown. Finally, clinical categories of measuring spinal degeneration are based on visual cues and features from medical imaging. Understanding the links between joint visual cues and aberrant movement may help to guide clinical practice; researchers will gain greater insight into the mechanical consequences of anatomical features associated with degeneration. This thesis was comprised of three studies. Study 1 examined the effect of disc height loss and subsequent restoration using an injectable hydrogel on the relative kinematics of a segment with height loss and an adjacent segment. It was found that disc height loss produced an immediate effect, where relative angular displacement was reduced in the segment with height loss and increased in the adjacent segment. Restoring disc height with an injectable hydrogel brought the relative angular displacement of both segments back to their initial values. This study is the first of its kind to examine the immediate effects of disc height loss via loss of nucleus pulposus and restoration. Whether these effects are as clear in-vivo remains to be seen. Study 2 evaluated the efficacy of a novel repair strategy to restore the mechanical profile of a spine segment with disc height loss initiated via compressive fracture. The strategy employed the use of PMMA injected into the vertebral body to attempt to seal a fracture from above the disc, and an injectable hydrogel to restore disc height. The use of PMMA was found to restore the compressive stiffness of the injured segment to within approximately 20 % of its initial value, while the use of the injectable hydrogel restored the sagittal plane rotational stiffness to within approximately 50 - 80 % of its initial value. After further repetitive compression had been applied to the spine segment however, the restorative influence of both interventions was lost in terms of rotational and compressive stiffness. It was found that large cracks in the endplate prevented the hydrogel from being contained and quickly returned the segment back to its injured profile. Future efforts at restoring the disc while maintaining its anatomical structures need better methods of creating a sufficient <b>seal</b> inside the <b>disc</b> to allow it to re-pressurize and sustain the stresses encountered on a daily basis. Study 3 employed the use of a novel spine tracking algorithm developed as part of this thesis to evaluate sagittal plane cervical spine motion of a series of patient image sequences who had experienced trauma and had a chief complaint related to their neck, head, or shoulders. Some patients had evidence of disc height loss while others did not. Clinical subgroups were created that classified disc height loss as either moderate/severe (3 cases), mild (8 cases), or non-existent (9 cases). When normalized angular displacement of the C 5 /C 6 segment in a group with moderate to severe height loss was compared to the same level in a group with no height loss, there was a statistically significant difference in angular displacement between the two groups (p = 0. 004). Angular displacement at C 5 /C 6 was 20. 2 % ± 2. 3 % of total measured neck angular displacement in the moderate/severe height loss group compared to 30. 6 % ± 4. 0 % of total measured neck angular displacement in the group without height loss. Based on the limited sample size of this study it would appear that disc height loss creates a loss in range of motion. This work has further revealed the heterogeneous nature of individual segmental movement patterns. However, in the group without height loss, there was a systematic trend seen of an increasing angular displacement with descending segmental level. This was not observed in those with moderate to severe disc height loss. The broad implications of this work are that disc height loss influences spine kinematics, which has implications with respect to further injury propagation through the spinal linkage. Angular displacement of a spine segment appears to be governed by its local stiffness. Restoration of disc height under real injury scenarios is a difficult proposition and any attempts at repair need to sufficiently <b>seal</b> the <b>disc</b> space and prevent extrusion of nucleus pulposus or hydrogel-based implants. We now appreciate the difficulty in this objective. Further, repeating the mechanism of injury will reduce the mechanical effects of the restorative intervention, preventing this is highly important...|$|R
