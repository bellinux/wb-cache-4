5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can <b>slide,</b> <b>it</b> must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E

He took the politically unpopular step of recognizing the sovereignty of Belize, which had long been officially, though fruitlessly, claimed as a province by Guatemala.

25|$|A knot {{in three}} {{dimensions}} can be untied when placed in four-dimensional space. This is done by changing crossings. Suppose one strand is behind another as seen from a chosen point. Lift it into the fourth dimension, {{so there is no}} obstacle (the front strand having no component there); then <b>slide</b> <b>it</b> forward, and drop it back, now in front. Analogies for the plane would be lifting a string up off the surface, or removing a dot from inside a circle.|$|E

25|$|Produced from 1989 to 1998, the Model 5904 has an {{aluminum}} alloy frame and blued steel slide. The Model 5903 was manufactured from 1990 to 1997, and featured {{an aluminum}} alloy frame and {{a stainless steel}} slide. The Model 5905 was a very limited version, with a blued steel frame and <b>slide.</b> <b>It</b> was manufactured only in 1992, and in very low volume. The 5906 is an all stainless steel model, hence it is noticeably heavier than the others. It was produced from 1989 to 1999. The stainless steel double-action only variant of this pistol, the Model 5946, along with the Model 3953, produced from 1990 to 1999, was manufactured without safety levers, and is the primary issue service pistol of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Sheriff Service, and one of three pistols available for selection by New York City Police Department.|$|E

Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just stopped {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you need to make sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) <b>slide</b> <b>it</b> up the racetrack. I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Glock 34 is a {{competition}} {{version of the}} Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a [...] longer barrel and <b>slide.</b> <b>It</b> has an extended magazine release, extended slide stop lever, [...] trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides {{at the front of}} the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.|$|E
