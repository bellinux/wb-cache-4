In the past two million years, the volume of erupted material in the Garibaldi Belt has been less than 10% of that in the U.S. states of California and Oregon and about 20% of that within the U.S. state of Washington. As a result, the risk of eruptions throughout this part of the Cascade Arc is minor.

However, considerable volcanic activity has taken place in the geologically recent past, most notably the explosive eruption that occurred at Mount Meager 2,350years ago.|$|E

The radial distribution system is modelled {{as a series}} of interconnected <b>single</b> <b>feeders.</b> Using Kirchoff’s laws, a set of iterative power flow equations was developed to conduct the power flow studies. Due to the voltage dependency of loads in distribution systems, various static load models are incorporated in the power flow algorithm to obtain better and more accurate results. The computer software implemented in this power flow method was then developed using C++ and successfully applied to several practical radial distribution networks. The convergence patterns of this power flow method for the various load models were also analysed. In addition, the effects of system characteristics on the convergence of the method are highlighted. Power flow analysis is a very important and basic too...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVMs) are occa-sionally {{associated with}} hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), which {{is characterized by}} the presence of multiple mucocutaneous telangiectasia, epistaxis, and familial inheritance. We analyzed the angiographic and clinical characteristics of patients with cerebral AVMs related to HHT. METHODS: Among 638 patients with cerebral AVMs, we identified 14 patients with HHT. The AVMs were classified as those with nidi of 1 cm or less (micro AVMs), those with nidi between 1 and 3 cm (small AVMs), and those of the fistulous type (arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs]). RESULTS: A total of 28 AVMs were found; seven of 14 patients had multiple AVMs. The 28 AVMs were categorized as 12 micro AVMs, eight small AVMs, and eight AVFs. All except one micro AVM were asymptomatic, whereas all small AVMs were symptomatic. Three of eight AVFs were asymptomatic. All 28 AVMs were located on the cortex. All micro AVMs and AVFs had <b>single</b> <b>feeders</b> and <b>single</b> draining veins, whereas the small AVMs had multiple feeders in all lesions and single draining veins in six of eight lesions...|$|R

All pens contained partially slatted, full concrete floors with straw and sawdust as enrichment substrate material. Toys were added to the pens where tail biting was noted or in pens where pigs displayed troublesome behavior. Veterinarians visited the farm 3-4 times a day to monitor for health issues and to treat accordingly. No epidemic diseases occurred during the study. The main health problem was tail biting and secondly was locomotive issues. A ventilation system was put into place and the temperature of the facility was monitored accordingly.|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To characterise the {{vasculature}} of pterygium using indocyanine green (ICG) anterior segment angiography and {{to demonstrate}} the pattern of revascularisation following conjunctival autografting.  METHODS—ICG anterior segment angiography was performed on nine patients with pterygium. Angiography was repeated at 1 - 2 weeks and 2  months following conjunctival autografting in these patients.  RESULTS—Angiography showed a <b>single</b> <b>feeder</b> vessel originating from the anterior conjunctival circulation in six cases (66. 7 %). This vessel branched to form the radial vessels of the pterygium. Following conjunctival autografting, reperfusion of the vessels in the conjunctival autograft was demonstrable as early as 1  week postoperatively from the episcleral bed. At 2  months postoperatively, the graft appeared well perfused with mild leakage demonstrable {{at the edges of}} the graft.  CONCLUSIONS—A <b>single</b> <b>feeder</b> vessel from the anterior conjunctival circulation branches to form the radial vessels in pterygium. Reperfusion of conjunctival autografts occurs as early as 1  week postoperatively from the episcleral bed. ...|$|E

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Mo-Yuen Chow.) Power distribution systems have been significantly affected by {{a wide range of}} fault-causing events; and the current outage restoration procedure may take from tens of minutes to hours. Effective outage cause identification can help to expedite the outage restoration and consequently improve the system reliability. Most current researches are based on system modeling and measurements such as voltage and current; besides, they usually target at a <b>single</b> <b>feeder</b> or a small system due to the difficulty of modeling the large-scale, nonlinear, and time-varying distribution system. In this research, various data mining approaches including statistical methods and artificial intelligence algorithms have been investigated and applied to Duke Energy distribution outage data in order to extract the outage pattern and identify the outage cause; by this means, the additional environmental information recorded in the data can be adopted in the fault diagnosis and the analysis range can be beyond the scope of a <b>single</b> <b>feeder</b> or a small system. Also, the affect of data imperfections such as data noise, data insufficiency, especially the data imbalance issue on the performance of outage cause identification have been investigated. In this work, logistic regression and artificial neural network are firstly compared on their capability in fault diagnosis; then an existing fuzzy classification algorithm is extended to E-algorithm to alleviate the effect of data imbalance; afterwards, the immune system based Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) algorithm is investigated for its capability in fault diagnosis using real-world data; lastly, a hybrid algorithm based on E-algorithm and AIRS is proposed to embed the rule extraction capability while performing satisfactory fault cause identification...|$|E
