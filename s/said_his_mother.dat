5|$|Albert Benjamin Chandler {{was born}} in the farming {{community}} of Corydon, Kentucky in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.|$|E

[...] When he was five, [...] his family moved from Somerville to Arlington, Massachusetts. A Hovhaness family neighbor <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> had insisted on moving from Somerville because of discrimination against Armenians there. After her death (on October 3, 1930), he began to use the surname [...] "Hovaness" [...] in honor of his paternal grandfather, and changed it to [...] "Hovhaness" [...] around 1944. [...] He stated the name change from the original Chakmakjian reflected the desire to simplify his name because [...] "nobody ever pronounced it right". However, Hovhaness' daughter Jean Nandi has written in her book Unconventional Wisdom, [...] "My father's name at the time of my birth was 'Hovaness', pronounced with accent on the first syllable. His original name was 'Chakmakjian', but in the 1930s he {{wanted to get rid of}} the Armenian connection and so changed his name to an Americanized version of his middle name. Some years later, deciding to re-establish his Armenian ties, he changed the spelling to 'Hovhaness', accent on the second syllable; this was the name by which he later became quite famous." ...|$|E
