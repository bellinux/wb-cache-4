40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{presented}} mixed {{evidence on the}} rationality of the Federal Reserve's preliminary money stock estimates. The authors investigate the rationality of M 1 A, M 1, M 2, and M 3 for both seasonally and not <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data. They find preliminary growth rates of these aggregates to be rational for not <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data but irrational when data are <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted.</b> Using Monte Carlo studies, the authors conclude that irrationality in <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data arises from the specific seasonal adjustment procedure used by the Federal Reserve. As a result, researchers conducting similar tests may want to focus exclusively on not <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data. Copyright 1995 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

5000|$|Use of <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> {{time series}} {{data can be}} misleading. This is because the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> series {{contains}} both the trend-cycle component and the error component. As such, the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data will not be [...] "smooth" [...] and {{what appears to be}} [...] "downturns" [...] or [...] "upturns" [...] may actually be randomness in the data. For this reason, if the purpose is finding turning points in a series, it is better to use the trend-cycle component rather than the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{videography}} {{and modeling}} {{were used to}} evaluate the impacts of four hydropower operational scenarios at Flaming Gorge Dam, Utah, on trout and native fishes in the Green River, Utah and Colorado. The four operational scenarios studied were year-round high fluctuations, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuations, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuations, and <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> steady flows. Impacts on trout were evaluated by examining differences among scenarios in the areas of inundated substrates that serve as spawning and feeding habitat. All scenarios would provide at least 23 acres per mile of habitat for spawning and food production; <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> operations would provide additional areas during periods of sustained high release. <b>Seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuations would increase inundated areas by 12 to 26 % for a short period in winter and spring, but food production and reproduction would not be expected to increase. <b>Seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuations and steady flows would produce similar increases in area, but the longer period of inundation could also result in increased food production and provide additional spawning sites for trout. Impacts on native fishes were assessed by examining daily changes in backwater nursery areas. Compared with year-round high fluctuations, the daily changes in backwater area would decrease by about 47, 89, and 100 % under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuation, moderate fluctuation, and steady flow scenarios, respectively. Similarly, daily stage fluctuations during the nursery period would decrease by 72, 89, and 100 % under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuation, moderate fluctuation, and steady flow scenarios, respectively. These reductions in daily fluctuations in backwater area and stage would improve conditions in nursery habitats and could in turn improve recruitment and overwinter survival. Introduced fish species could also benefit from the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> operational scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the development of}} Flaming Gorge Reservoir release patterns and resulting downstream flows and stages for four potential hydropower operational scenarios. The release patterns were developed for three representative hydrologic years: moderate, dry, and wet. Computer models were used to estimate flows and stages in the Green River resulting from these release patterns for the moderate water year. The four hydropower operational scenarios for Flaming Gorge Dam were year-round high fluctuating flows, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuating flows, <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuating flows, and <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> steady flows. The year-round high fluctuating flow scenario assumes that the monthly total reservoir releases {{would be the same}} as historical releases. The remaining <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> flow scenarios would comply with the 1992 Biological Opinion of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which requires high flows in the spring and limited hourly fluctuations, especially in summer and autumn releases, to protect endangered fish. Within one year, the maximum daily river stage fluctuations resulting from hydropower operations under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuating flow scenario would be similar to the maximum daily fluctuations under the year-round high fluctuating flow scenario. However, reduced or no fluctuations would occur in some time periods under the former scenario. The maximum daily river stage fluctuations under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> moderate fluctuating flow scenario would be about half of those under the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> high fluctuating flow scenario...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{evidence}} on consumption-based asset pricing is based on <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> consumption data. The consumption-based models have not worked well for explaining asset returns, but with <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data {{there are reasons to}} expect spurious rejections of the models. This paper examines asset pricing models using not <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> aggregate consumption data. The authors find evidence against models with time-separable preferences, even when the models incorporate seasonality and allow seasonal heteroskedasticity. A model that uses not <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> consumption data and nonseparable preferences with seasonal effects works better according to several criteria. The parameter estimates imply a form of seasonal habit persistence in aggregate consumption expenditures. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Most of the Euro-zone {{economic}} short-term {{indicators are}} computed through aggregation from Member States data. The <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> figures {{can be calculated}} by <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusting</b> the aggregate (direct approach) or aggregating the <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> national data (indirect approach). Statistical and practical considerations to choose the right strategy are given in the paper. An application to the Euro-zone GDP is presented. The same aggregation problem encountered {{in the case of}} seasonal adjustment will persist when extracting the business cycle. Moreover, since raw figures imply problems in terms of excessive noise of the series, analysts generally prefer the use of <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> time series. As a consequence, the problem of choosing between direct and indirect both in seasonal adjustment and in business cycle extraction appears to be closely linked. In fact, the approach chosen to <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjust</b> the data can in theory lead to different results when the cyclical component has to be extracted from sea-sonally adjusted data. After a review of different filters widely used in the literature, we extracted the cycle indicator for the Euro-zone employing the Baxter-King filter to data coming from both direct and indirect seasonally adjustment approach and then compared the relative results. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{demonstrating that}} any nontrivial {{technique}} for <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusting</b> time series inevitably leads to certain distortions of the data, an effort {{is made to}} provide explicit motivation for the process of seasonal adjustment for purposes of appraising current economic conditions. Inherent advantages in terms of certain consistency requirements of a least square procedure for seasonal adjustment are pointed out. Problems encountered by the econometrician when <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> time series are to be employed in regression analysis are also explored. The dummy variable technique for dealing with seasonal fluctuations is generalized to encompass a flexible pattern of seasonal movement. It is argued that when <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data rather than the dummy variable procedure are employed, there is an inherent tendency to overstate the significance of regression coefficients; a correction procedure is suggested. Consideration is given to certain special problems created by autocorrelated residuals when <b>seasonally</b> <b>adjusted</b> data are utilized in regression analysis. ...|$|R
