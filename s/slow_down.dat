40|$|Shafieloo ea al. firstly {{proposed}} {{the possibility that}} the current cosmic acceleration (CA) is <b>slowing</b> <b>down.</b> However, this is rather counterintuitive because a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA cannot be accommodated in most mainstream cosmological models. In this work, by exploring the evolutionary trajectories of dark energy equation of state w(z) and deceleration parameter q(z), we present a comprehensive investigation on the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA from both the theoretical and the observational sides. For the theoretical side, we study the impact of different w(z) by using six parametrization models, and then discuss the effects of spatial curvature. For the observational side, we investigate the effects of different type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), different baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and different cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, respectively. We find that (1) The evolution of CA are insensitive to the specific form of w(z); in contrast, a non-flat Universe more favors a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA than a flat Universe. (2) SNLS 3 SNe Ia datasets favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA at 1 σ confidence level, while JLA SNe Ia samples prefer an eternal CA; in contrast, the effects of different BAO data are negligible. (3) Compared with CMB distance prior data, full CMB data more favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA. (4) Due to the low significance, the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA is still a theoretical possibility that cannot be confirmed by the current observations.

40|$|The {{availability}} of radioactive beams has opened {{new opportunities for}} the investigation of exotic nuclei. The NuSTAR HISPEC <b>slowed</b> <b>down</b> beam project [1] at GSI/FAIR aims to produce rare isotopes with energies of 10 MeV/u and less, {{to be used for}} spectroscopy and reactions studies. This paper reports on the ongoing feasibility study of <b>slowed</b> <b>down</b> beam production at the GSI FRagment Separator(FRS) facility. At FRS the nuclei of interest are produced at high energy, they are identified with the standard tracking detectors [2] and <b>slowed</b> <b>down</b> with a thick degrader. Due to the low energy of the <b>slowed</b> <b>down</b> fragments a beam line was constructed after the thick degrader. A position sensitive transmission Time Of Flight (TOF) detector was used to reconstruct the <b>slowed</b> <b>down</b> ions trajectory and velocity on event-by-event basis. A calculation using EPAX [3] cross sections and ATIMA [4, 5] stopping powers showed that about 80 % of the fragments survive the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> process. The simulation also predicted that the majority of fragments created due to secondary fragmentation reactions in the degrader have different velocity compared to the ions of interest. Figure 1 shows an example calculation of the yield due to reactions in the degrader when 62 Co is <b>slowed</b> <b>down</b> to 10 MeV/u. The square root of the energy per nucleon is proportional to the fragment velocity. Hence, the simulation predicted that 62 Co will dominate by three orders of magnitude the ions created due to reactions in the degrader when a TOF gate corresponding to an energy of 10 MeV/u is applied.
