40|$|Future {{power systems}} control will require {{large-scale}} activation of reserves at distribution level. Despite their high potential, {{distributed energy resources}} (DER) used for frequency control pose challenges due to unpredictability, grid bottlenecks, etc. To deal with these issues, this study presents a novel strategy of power frequency characteristic dynamic adjustment based on the imbalance state. This way, the concerned operators {{become aware of the}} imbalance location but also a more accurate redistribution of responsibilities in terms of reserves activations is achieved. The proposed control is based on the concept of “cells” which are power systems with operating capabilities and responsibilities similar to control areas (CAs), but fostering the use of resources at all voltage levels, particularly distribution grids. Control autonomy of cells allows increased RES hosting. In this study, the power frequency characteristic of a cell is adjusted in real time by means of a fuzzy controller, which curtails part of the reserves, in order to avoid unnecessary deployment throughout a <b>synchronous</b> <b>area,</b> leading to a more localised activation and reducing losses, congestions and reserves exhaustion.

30|$|Wind power fluctuates {{with wind}} speed, while the {{electrical}} grid must maintain {{a balance between}} the supply and the demand. The effects of fluctuating wind power on system regulation and stability are important issues. Large offshore wind farms may inject significant power fluctuations into power systems [9], and such power fluctuations may affect neighbouring power systems, if it is not appropriately dealt with. For example, the offshore wind farm Horns Rev A in Western Denmark produces more intense active power fluctuations than the aggregated wind power produced by land based wind farms in the western Danish power system and shows frequent active power fluctuations within periods of tens of minutes, the power gradients reach 15  MW per minute, thus the 160  MW wind farm have the output power change between zero and the rated power in 10 – 15  min [10]. The system power balance could also be worsen by the deviations from the planned power exchanges between Norway and Sweden. The total power fluctuations and deviations would be seen in deviations of the power exchange between Western Denmark and the northern Germany, the UCTE <b>synchronous</b> <b>area.</b> This situation would become more significant with the development and connection of the planned offshore wind farms in Danish Western power systems.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} two novel metrics {{to judge}} the capability and influence of wind power to provide virtual inertia response (i. e. frequency support). The first metric considers the generation unit (i. e. wind turbine generator (WTG) /wind farm (WF) vs. synchronous generator).

40|$|As European Union {{published}} the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline, {{the goal was}} to publish a guideline which would, among others, optimise the use of the power grid as well as the calculation and allocation of the cross border capacities. The guideline requires a coordinated manner to calculate the cross borders within transmission system operators as well as increase the frequency of the capacity calculation. Based on these objectives the currently in use capacity calculation methodology has to be developed to be in line with capacity allocation and congestion management guideline. The calculation methodology developed in this thesis utilises the NTC-method, which is currently in use, as a theoretical base. In the future this methodology is required to calculate capacities hourly for the whole Nordic <b>synchronous</b> <b>area.</b> This sets a strict operational environment for the CNTC method, in which the methodology is meant to calculate secure values fast. CNTC method was developed to utilise a simulation environment, which is used in Fingrid’s current capacity calculation. The method is divided into three main parts, which creates the base for the calculated technical maximum capacities. In the first stage the method collects all the necessary input data. Second phase is steady state analysis, where the N- 1 principle is examined as well as the violation of thermal and voltage limits. As the greatest cross-border capacity in steady state is found, the dynamic analysis is run. Once a dynamically stable case is found, the capacity calculation is seen as completed. The developed method was tested in case study calculating the capacity for the AC-border between Finland and Sweden. In order to conduct the case study the input data was collected from the relevant TSOs, which included grid models which comprised the whole Nordic synchronous system. With these calculations the developed CNTC method was proven to give capacities close to the ones that the current NTC methodology gives for the border. In order to finalise the developed CNTC method into a capacity allocation and congestion management guideline compliant more work is needed. The topics for the further development include the implementation of the current capacity allocation methodologies and inclusion of remedial actions. The implementation of said additions require further testing in order to take the method to production use in the Nordic capacity calculation region...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} a hydro turbine model and a power system model have been developed. The {{goal is to}} develop models capable of {{preforming}} in a frequency analysis of the Nordic <b>synchronous</b> <b>area</b> and that these models can help to investigate floating frequencies in the Nordic power system. The hydro model has non-linear penstock and turbine dynamics and it is governed by PID-governor. The power system is modelled as a one-bus system, based on the mechanical swing equations. Both the turbine model and the power system model have been tested with a time series analysis and a frequency analysis. Particularly the effect of load damping and inertia has been tested. The time series analysis shows that the hydro model can work {{as a substitute for}} existing models, both in a standalone comparison to other hydro models, and in a larger power system model. The time series does find that the hydro turbine is less predictable in behaviour. As the model is non-linear, instabilities were found in some cases, when trying to find the critical stable operating point. The power system model was also tested to discover how it behaved in a time series analysis. It was scaled to an equivalent of the Nordic system and analysed to find the response to disturbances in the system. The system has been analysed to show the differences in response to a fully loaded system and a sparsely loaded system. The test show a significant deterioration in the system stability when less inertia was available in the system. A frequency analysis was conducted on both the turbine model and the power system model to test the effect of inertia and load damping. The test on the hydro turbine model confirmed that it was unstable for a selection of system parameters. Stable simulations show that the models tend to resonate at frequencies between 0. 004 Hz and 0. 022 Hz. The resonance frequency, as well as amplitude, drops as the system inertia increases. Frequency analysis of the Nordic system equivalent support this data. This test found resonance for frequencies in the between 0. 014 Hz and 0. 022 Hz. This corresponds to a time period of oscillation between 45 and 70 seconds. This is similar to the frequency oscillation found in the system today.

40|$|In an {{electric}} power system, {{there will always}} be {{an electric}} balance. Nevertheless, System Operators (SOs) often uses the term imbalance. Here, the term imbalance refers to the difference between trades and real-time measurements. This thesis defines the term imbalance and develops a framework helping SOs in finding better decisions controlling these imbalances.   Imbalances are controlled by many decisions made at various stages before real-time. A decision can be to increase the flexibility in production and consumption. However, this is not the only decision affecting real-time balancing operation. Other decisions are grid code requirements, such as ramp rates of HVDC and generation; balancing market structure, such as imbalance fees and trading period lengths; and the strategies used in the system-operational dispatch. The purpose of this thesis is to create a new possibility for SO to find decisions improving the balancing operation.   In order to find and compare decisions, the thesis develops a framework that evaluates many different decisions made at various stages before real-time. The framework consists of the following. First, it develops an intra-hour model using multi-bidding zone data from a historical time-period; able to capture the normal state frequency and active power dynamics. The model creates high-resolution data from low-resolution measurements using several data-processing methods. The uncertainty from the historical time-period is re-created using many sub-models with different input data, time-scales and activation times of reserves. Secondly, the framework validates the model and identifies system parameters based on simulated frequencies and frequency measurements in the normal state operation. Finally; new decisions' are modelled, tested, and evaluated on their impact on selected targets supporting corporate missions of the SOs. The goal of the framework is that it should be able to find better decisions for balancing operation but also that it should be applicable for real and large power systems. To verify this, the framework is tested on a <b>synchronous</b> <b>area</b> containing 11 bidding zones in northern Europe. Results show that the framework can be validated and trusted. Three new decisions, made at various stages before real time, have been modelled, tested and evaluated. The modelled decisions were (i) lower ramp rates for generation, (ii) increased capacities for automatic reserves, and (iii) a new strategy for the system-operational dispatch. One implication of applying the balancing evaluation framework on data from July 2015 is that all tested decisions improve several selected targets supporting the corporate missions of the SOs.   The conclusion is that the balancing framework is useful as a simulation tool in helping SOs in finding more efficient decisions for transmission system balancing operation.

40|$|The Nordic {{power system}} is {{changing}} towards an increasing share of new renewable power sources. Conventional power sources contribute {{with a large}} amount of kinetic energy in the system due to their synchronously connected generators. This saves the system from large frequency deviations the first seconds after a power imbalance in the system. This kinetic energy {{is referred to as the}} system inertia. Wind power and HVDC do not have their kinetic energy connected directly to the system frequency like the conventional power sources. Nuclear and thermal power plants contribute with large reserves of kinetic energy. Hydropower contributes with a smaller amount of kinetic energy, but contributes with frequency containment reserves that are activated seconds after a disturbance. Both frequency containment reserves and system inertia are crucial to avoid large frequency deviations after a large power imbalance. This thesis mainly focuses on the dynamic response after a disturbance. The system operators have several requirements for the frequency response and the power response after an outage occurs. The main part studied in this thesis is the maximum frequency deviation in the transient period, and the fastness of the system to provide extra energy. This thesis studies the frequency stability in low load scenarios for the Nordic synchronous system, which includes Norway, Sweden, Finland and eastern Denmark. A model made in Simulink, which excludes voltage stability, rotor angle stability and load flow, investigates the balance between mechanical power and electrical load after a disturbance. It is assumed that the generation and the load are equal. The model was tuned based on a real response from an outage in the Nordic <b>synchronous</b> <b>area.</b> The dimensioning incident in the Nordic power system today is 1400 MW. This means that the system should withstand a fault of this size, and still be able to operate within the requirements set for power response and frequency response. The simulations show that this can be challenging in several of the low-load scenarios. There are two main scenarios, the first with conventional power sources. This is a scenario from an early morning in June 2013. The second scenario has large integration of wind power, HVDC and small-scale hydropower. Statnett has developed this worst-case scenario for 2020. Both scenarios have a total production of about 20 000 MW. The first scenario shows that with a 50 percent share of hydropower, the system can only withstand an outage of 1300 MW maximum, with a large proportional gain in the hydropower governor. The future scenario shows that synthetic inertia can make a large contribution to the system stability. With a well-tuned synthetic inertia contribution, the system will be able to withstand an outage of 1400 MW during low-load scenarios. Some of the main findings are as follows: A. Synthetic inertia is shown to have great effect on the frequency response in the transient period. It provides active power supply after a disturbance without contributing to reduce the frequency. B. For a system at low load, the maximum frequency deviation is often at a critical point after a disturbance of the active power balance. This problem must therefore be addressed differently than today. Today, the frequency containment reserves are purchased and it is assumed that the system inertia is sufficient. This is shown not to be the case. C. To minimize the frequency deviation in the transient period, an active power supply like FCR and synthetic inertia is more efficient to apply to the system than a higher amount of system inertia...|$|E

Formålet er å undersøke de effekter uregulerbar produksjon, og systemets evne til automatisk regulering, har på kortsiktig frekvensstabilitet. Mengden tilgjengelige roterende {{reserver}} og primærreserver bestemmer systemets kortsiktige respons. Norge og Sverige inngikk i 2012 en avtale om økt energiproduksjon på 24, 6 TWh fra ny fornybar energi, kalt grønne sertifikater. Det antas at ny installert effekt fra vindkraft og uregulerbar vannkraft vil være ca. 12 500 MW i 2020. Disse prognosene er studert i simuleringsprogrammet Aristo. Simuleringene i Aristo viser frekvensforløp til identiske utfall av forbruk og produksjon, der systemets frekvens logges i 45 sekunder etter utfallet finner sted. Utfallene av forbruk og produksjon er basert på dimensjonerende utfall for Norge og synkronsystemet Norden, og er av størrelsesorden 850 MW, 1200 MW og 1360 MW. Utfallene er simulert i produksjonssituasjoner som representerer 2014 og 2020. Vi kan se fra simuleringen at systemet har en høyere H-verdi i 2014, enn i 2020. Resultatene viser at systemets reguleringsevne svekkes med økt andel uregulerbar kraft i samtlige produksjons- og lastsituasjoner. Bare ett av tre scenarier simulert for 2020 overholdt dagens krav til systemets reguleringskapasitet. Resultatene fra simuleringene i Aristo lot seg ikke separeres i effekter som skyldes ny uregulerbar produksjon eller av endret kraftflyt. Simulatorprogrammet Aristo er derfor ikke godt egnet til å studere mekanismene bak de simulerte frekvensforløp i Norden og er bedre egnet for spenningsanalyser og frekvensanalyser i øydrift for mindre avgrensede områder. Det er krav om at frekvensstabiliteten ikke skal svekkes for å unngå problemer og kostnader for forbrukerne. Det betyr økte systemkostnader for systemansvarlig. Økte balanseringskostnader dekkes av økt innmatingstariff for samtlige kraftprodusenter. Dette bryter med et prinsipp for samfunnsøkonomi som tilsier at en enhet som påfører systemet en kostnad, bør belastes kostnaden. Felles innmatingstariff for samtlige kraftprodusenter begrunnes med politisk vedtatt satsningen på økt utbygging av fornybar kraft. Abstract This thesis analyses simulated {{effects of}} increased installed unregulated {{power in the}} interconnected grid in the Nordic countries in 2020. The purpose {{is to examine the}} effects of new renewable production, and the system's ability to maintain a short-term frequency stability. The total rotatational inertia and primary frequency control are the short-term frequency responses of the power system. The agreement on green certificates from 2012, will initiate new renewable energy production of total 24, 6 TWh in Norway and Sweden. It is believed that the installed capacity of wind turbines and small-scale hydropower will be 12 500 MW by 2020. This prognosis is further studied in the simulation program Aristo. The simulations in Aristo show the development of the system frequency at losses of consumption or production. The system frequency is logged for 45 seconds after the fault occurs. The frequency deviations that occur when consumption or production is lost, is dimentional to the size of the incident. The size of the faults studied, are the biggest faults the power system of Nordic <b>synchronous</b> <b>area</b> are designed to handle. Fault sizes are 850 MW, 1200 MW and 1360 MW. The faults are simulated in different production modes which represent year 2014 and 2020. We can see from the simulation that the system reaches a higher frequency, and the frequency deviation is bigger at identical incidents in 2020 from 2014. The results show that the system frequency control deteriorates with increased amount of wind and small-scale hydropower production units. Only one of the three scenarios simulated for 2020, complied within the limits of the required control capacity of the power system. The effects arising from renewable power production, or from the change of system power flow, could not be isolated or determinated in the simulations. Aristo is therefore not well suited for analysis of total power system stability of the interconnected synchrounous grid. Aristo is better suited for analysis which involves voltage deviations and stability, or frequency analysis studied in grid islands. A decrease in frequency stability, leads to increased demand for frequency control. The TSO`s demand for primary control increase, meaning increased system stability costs. The increased system operating costs, are today covered by tariffs for all power producers. This violates a principle of economics, that indicates that a unit that inflicts the system a cost, should be charged by this cost. Equal increase of tariffs for all power producers, is justified by the political focus on increased development of renewable energy. M-B...|$|E
40|$|Small signal {{stability}} {{is a crucial}} aspect to accurately keep under control in modern interconnected power systems {{in order to ensure}} their security and reliability. Such an aspect could represent a serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power systems exploitation levels. Power oscillations not well-damped may jeopardize the system integrity on large scale: several incidents caused by the establishment of large oscillations have been recorded in the past around the world. Therefore, a basic assessment that must be done before setting a certain optimal operational framework is the determination of the actual dynamic stability margins. The fast deployment of measurement and instrumentation facilities provided by the Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) technology offers a valid support in this sense. Large amount of data coming from Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) installed in the key points of power systems (e. g. primary substations) increases the Transmission System Operators (TSO) situational awareness. Thanks to accurate and timely information the stability margins can be precisely determined and optimized so that power systems can be operated at their actual full capacity while staying within the stability boundaries. A deep investigation about the WAMS currently in operation or under testing around the world confirms how power oscillations tracking {{is one of the main}} functionality/application envisaged in these architectures. Real time detection of dangerous power oscillations and hence their related continuous parameters estimation, in wide area sense, is vital in the framework pointed out above. The output of this task is therefore represented by estimates of the oscillations fundamental parameters (e. g. frequency, damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase). If potential unstable phenomena are detected (e. g. estimating a damping ratio lower than a certain threshold value) all the necessary countermeasures have to be implemented for restoring secure and stable operating conditions (e. g. generators’ re-dispatch, tie line flows adjustment, load reduction, network topology change etc.). It was moreover found that the major problems which characterize these infrastructures rely on their own technological complexity, on the data management but especially on the research of robust identification techniques for implementing all the Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA) tasks that must be run in parallel in the central control centres. In this regard, two fundamental approaches could be applied for tracking the electromechanical modes in an electrical power system. Model-based methods (a. k. a. Component-based method), which use an electric power system model linearized around a certain equilibrium point to identify the electromechanical modes characteristics through eigenvalue analysis (whose chief rudiments are reported in the Chapter 3). Eigenvalue analysis is not suitable for on-line tracking, especially for large scale power systems due to both high computational time and uncertainties in power system modeling. Measurement-based methods (a. k. a. Mode Meters), estimate an updated model of the electric power system from direct system measurements which come from measurement devices installed on power systems. These techniques, freeing themselves from the system modeling, they consider the power system as a black box and by making use of the signal processing expertise, estimate the modal content of the acquired signals. Being moreover less expensive than the first class of methods in large scale power systems model set up, it appears clear that they are suitable for an on-line DSA task. However, the set of available measurement-based estimation techniques is fairly wide. Besides I note that relevant journal databases are regularly filled by novel more and more advanced algorithms. My personal feeling in this regard is that the basic methodologies are really few, while several refinements of the same algorithms, aimed at overcoming specific weaknesses, are regularly proposed. From the experience gained working hardly on the topic I can state that no best estimator exists due to the lack of an accepted definition of optimality. Furthermore, it is a difficult task to assess the performance of different estimation methods because each of them was initially designed for a specific field, has its own features and sometimes presents parameters chosen according to experience or through heuristic considerations. This means that for instance a method could show good performance in damping and frequency estimation if the modes number is known while may fail if it is not know in advance. In addition, a method could work better than another for noiseless sampled signals while could deteriorate its efficiency when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases. Nonetheless, there exist estimation techniques which are “generally” characterized by good performance with respect to the others. The meaning of the term “generally” should be intended as “with respect to the main situations that may occur”(different data typologies, various SNR levels, a priori knowledge of the intrinsic power system modes etc.). A wide set of estimation techniques will be analyzed in the present thesis. Afterwards, a performance comparison among the techniques will be accomplished with the objective of pointing out strengths and drawbacks of each of them. Once ascertained the points to improve, three novel estimation algorithms will be introduced. They represent a good complementary tool to the ordinary model-based methods implemented in the central control centres for real time monitoring power system oscillations. Almost all the estimation algorithms considered in the thesis were tested in real time on the Italian WAMS thanks to the support of the TSO, Terna. The complex infrastructure owned by Terna, thanks also to the real time information exchange with some European partners, represents a vigilant eye on the entire European Network of Transmission System Operators for electricity-Continental European <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Area</b> (ENTSO-e CESA) for the purposes of analysis.

40|$|Renewable {{generation}} is mainly connected through converters. It can provide {{more and more}} services to the grid such as voltage support or frequency control. However, these services may not be sufficient for extremely high penetrations. As the share of such generating units is growing rapidly, some <b>synchronous</b> <b>areas</b> could in the future be occasionally operated without synchronous machines. In such conditions, system stability {{will have to be}} ensured with the same level of reliability as today. Today, operation of power systems is based on the presence of synchronous machines. Frequency is linked to the balance between consumption and generation of electricity via the rotating masses equation. This will not be inherently valid for grids without synchronous machines. The issue of operating a network with 100 % power electronics is quite well solved for small isolated systems. The same doesn’t apply for large transmission systems where grid topology and power injections are highly variable and are not known at any time by all system components or even by a centralized entity. This paper describes the research that needs to be achieved to remove barriers to high penetrations of converters...|$|R

40|$|Specific authorships of Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian {{biogeography}} {{are indicated}} within] some {{exceptions to this}} generalization have been observed. On continental portions of tectonic plates, as eustatic sea level rose, epeiric seas formed in low-lying areas, providing new, more extended regions for stromatoporoid habitation. Increases in eustatic sea level result from the melting of glacial ice as a byproduct of global warming, and/or from {{an increase in the}} rate of seafloor spreading, which raises the level of the seafloor, causing seawater to spill onto low-lying parts of continents (e. g., lieBermaN, 2000, p. 86). There is no uniform agreement among biogeographers where it comes to the delin-eation of <b>synchronous</b> <b>areas</b> containing different assemblages of taxa, known as biogeographic units (CeCCa, 2002, p. 81). Among paleontologists, kauffmaN (1973), working with Cretaceous bivalves, deter-mined that a realm is a biogeographic unit containing more than 75 % endemic taxa (i. e., at least 75 % of the genera present are found in no other realm), an approach accepted in theory by BouCot (1975) for Paleozoic brachiopods. oliver (1977) found percentages of endemism for rugose coral genera in the Early and Middle Devonian ranged from 33 % in the Siege-nian (Pragian) to 92 % in the late Emsian.
