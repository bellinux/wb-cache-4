50|$|In {{response}} to the censorship of the History of Los Angeles: A Mexican Perspective, Carrasco created the <b>seriograph,</b> Self-Portrait (1985) at Self-Help Graphics. Self-Portrait depicts an artist dressed as a runner crossing a finish line. The runner, carrying a paintbrush looks over her shoulder in horror as a paint-roller whitewashes the mural grid behind her. The whitewashing of Siqueiros's controversial mural is referenced again on the brush itself.|$|E
