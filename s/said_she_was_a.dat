Larter subsequently skipped her senior year to model in Australia, Italy, and Japan, the latter a country she would temporarily settle in at the age of seventeen.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> practicing Catholic and that she cared a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E

500|$|Two of Johansson's {{films in}} 2006 {{explored}} {{the world of}} stage magicians, both opposite Hugh Jackman. Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film Scoop (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics. Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson [...] "lovely as always", and Mick LaSalle opined that she [...] "brings deftness and freshness" [...] to her part. She also appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of DePalma and had {{wanted to work with}} him on the film.

Finn confides Quinn's news to his best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who later confronts Quinn, claiming to be the baby's father, since she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> virgin when they had sex.

Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) reveals to her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) that she experienced a hysterical pregnancy and is not really carrying Will's baby.

500|$|On March 2, {{the defense}} argued {{in court that}} Cisneros should be set free on bond during the trial {{because she did not}} pose a flight risk as {{demonstrated}} by her actions during the first trial. The defense stated that she never failed to appear in court during the 1994 trial even though she was facing a possible death penalty. In addition, they <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long-time resident of Brownsville and had no previous criminal history. Though Cisneros was aware of the FBI investigation, and the possibility of a new indictment against her, she had not fled, thus justifying her bond. On March 9, Cisneros was released from jail on a US$300,000 bond. The court ruled for the defense after deciding that she would not attempt to flee before the trial. [...] Court officials imposed certain restrictions on her freedom, however. They asked her to hand over her U.S. passport and to limit her travel to the Brownsville and McAllen, Texas judicial districts. Her husband was also required to sign a document that made him a third-party custodian.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the album Hu Hu Hu (2009) Lafourcade experienced writer's block, {{and felt that}} the songs she was writing were too {{similar to those in}} her previous albums. For her new work, she sought inspiration from Agustín Lara's repertoire and her native country, Mexico. [...] "One of the things I wanted to happen with this record was to find the connection with Mexico and its people again". She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Mexican and proud of the [...] "very many" [...] positive parts it has. Musically, she wanted more simplicity in her songs. Lafourcade forced herself to write [...] "without judgement", recording voice memos on her phone as part of the writing process. She was inspired by the works of Latin American songwriters such as Simón Díaz, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing took three years, resulting in approximately 30songs. Since the album was about her personal life, she selected what she felt were [...] "the strongest ones", saying, [...] "more than making an album, I wanted to have songs... that could stand on their own".|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking.

[...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E
