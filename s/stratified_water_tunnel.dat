40|$|A <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> is {{a device}} used in {{hydraulic}} research and design studies {{for the purpose}} of observing the relative motion between a solid body and a liquid and the effect which this motion has on the body. Its basic function is the production of a test stream of water of uniform and controllable pressure and velocity in which solid bodies can be supported under varying conditions. The free-jet type of <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> has a test stream which, ideally, is surrounded by a gaseous medium and which, practically, has only a partial solid-contact boundary required to permit observation of the interior of the stream. This type of tunnel thus differs from conventional <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> such as the closed-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which has a test stream completely surrounded by a solid-contact surface, and the open-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which has a test stream surrounded by water and which thus resembles a submerged jet. The essentially unbounded nature of the test stream of the free-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> permits deformation of the test stream and avoids formation of adverse pressure and velocity gradients which form in conventional <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> because of gravitational effects and boundary layer formation; the result is that in the free-jet <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> natural cavitation about solid bodies in the test stream can be studied at lower cavitation indices and with less influence due to the finite extent of the test stream than is possible in conventional tunnels.

40|$|Oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are {{experimental}} facilities {{commonly used}} in coastal engineering research. They are intended to reproduce near-bed hydrodynamic and sediment transport phenomena at a realistic scale. In an oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a piston generates an oscillatory motion that propagates almost instantaneously to the whole tunnel; consequently, flow is uniform along the tunnel, unlike the propagating wave motion in the sea or in a wave flume. This results in subtle differences between the boundary-layer hydrodynamics of an oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> and of a propagating wave, which may {{have a significant effect}} in the resulting sediment transport. In this paper, we present a zeroth-order analytical model of the turbulent boundary-layer hydrodynamics in an oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel.</b> By using a time-varying eddy viscosity and by accounting for the constraints arising from the tunnel's geometry, the model predicts the oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> hydrodynamics and yields analytical expressions to compute bed shear stresses for asymmetric and skewed waves, both in the absence or presence of an imposed current. These expressions are applied to successfully quantify bedload sediment transport in oscillating <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> experiments.

5000|$|The <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> was {{commissioned}} by the State Hydraulic Works (DSI) on December 25, 2008. For {{the building of the}} <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> Ilci Construction Inc. was contracted. The construction works at an altitude of 580 m AMSL began on March 18, 2009. The excavation of the <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> was carried out with a tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is 152 m long and has a cutting shield of 7.83 m diameter. The TBM was transported from Italy on 300 trailers, and its assembly completed after twelve months on August 21, 2010. Synchronised with the progress of excavation, the inner walls of the tunnel were lined with 30 cm thick precast concrete hexagons. The average daily progress of the excavation works was between 30 - 40 m. The <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> has an average downhill slope of 0.49% through the Gazientep Formation of the Eocene and Oligocene [...] geological period.|$|R
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{have been}} {{utilized}} {{in one form}} or another to explore fluid mechanics and aerodynamics phenomena since the days of Leonardo da Vinci. <b>Water</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing is attractive because of the relatively low cost and quick turn-around time to perform flow visualization experiments and evaluate the results. The principal limitation of a <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> is that the low flow speed, which provides for detailed visualization, also results in very small hydrodynamic (aerodynamic) forces on the model, which, in the past, have proven to be difficult to measure accurately. However, the advent of semi-conductor strain gage technology and devices associated with data acquisition such as low-noise amplifiers, electronic filters, and digital recording have made accurate measurements of very low strain levels feasible. The principal objective of this research effort was to develop a multi-component strain gage balance to measure forces and moments on models tested in flow visualization <b>water</b> <b>tunnels.</b> A balance was designed that allows measuring normal and side forces, and pitching, yawing and rolling moments (no axial force). The balance mounts internally in the model and is used in a manner typical of wind tunnel balances. The key differences between a <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> balance and a wind tunnel balance are the requirement for very high sensitivity since the loads are very low (typical normal force is 0. 2 lbs), the need for water proofing the gage elements, and the small size required to fit into typical <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> models...|$|R

50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are tunnels (below-ground channels) used to {{transport}} water to areas with large populations or agriculture. They are frequently part of aqueducts. Some aqueducts, {{such as the}} Delaware Aqueduct are single long tunnels. In other cases, such as the San Jacinto tunnel on the Colorado River Aqueduct, <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> form parts of far longer aqueducts. In cases where the outflow of a <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> is into an existing stream or river flowing {{to the point of}} water use, the term aqueduct is less likely to be used, as with the Harold D.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are {{emerging}} as a possible useful alternative to small low-speed wind tunnels for an expanded range of aerodynamic testing. In this report, an assessment is made regarding {{the extent to which}} <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> can be used for such testing. It was found that their suitability for testing given models needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For conventional tests on aircraft, such as force and moment measurements, they compare unfavourably with similar-sized wind tunnels, due to a mismatch in Reynolds numbers. <b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are generally better suited to carrying out fundamental research than they are for applied aerodynamics testing. However, they are very useful as part of a large research program, by helping establish the testing schedule for large wind tunnels. In flow situations that are insensitive to Reynolds number, or where a test Reynolds number is close to that of a full-size vehicle, <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> should be regarded as the preferred option for experimental aerodynamics. Such examples include micro air vehicles, high-rate dynamic testing, and high-sweep sharp-edge configurations. <b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are also very useful for providing validation data for computational-fluid-dynamics analyses of a flow. An earlier version of this work was prepared for the TTCP TR-AER-TP 5 Panel in August 2010...|$|R
