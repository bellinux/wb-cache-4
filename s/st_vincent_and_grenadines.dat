The crux of his argument was that the Grenadines should not be seen as mere appendages of the island of St. Vincent, and that the integrity of all of the smaller islands should be respected.

The Black Caribs currently have their villages flanking the volcano, and are known as the poorest people on St. Vincent and Grenadines.The Black Caribs were also agricultural and navigation techniques and military skills, which were recognized by the colonial authorities and the European settlers of the island. Besides that they were also important ritual practices, whose realization is established in relation to dead people and illness (now called [...] "ancestor worship").

50|$|Black Caribs are {{indigenous}} {{people from the}} island of St. Vincent, formed by the mixture between Island Caribs and enslaved Africans produced in the 18th century. This population retains Caribbean culture and makes up a very small population in the archipelago, representing the 2.0% of the current population of <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> <b>and</b> <b>Grenadines.</b> There are also black Caribs in Dominica and Trinidad. The history of the Black Caribs is known thanks to reports that the British governor William Young sent to the British crown, in which he explained that the Black Caribs were a mix of Caribs and enslaved Africans from Spanish ships wrecked near its shores. These reports were read and taken as reference by many chroniclers and later historians. However, researchers of history and Garifuna language (the Garifunas are descendants of Black Caribs in the mainland of Central America) of the 20th and 21st centuries, such as Itarala, have their own conception {{of the origin of}} the Black Caribs. According to them, the African ancestors of the Black Caribs come from other Caribbean islands and migrated to Saint Vincent as refugees to escape slavery and as slaves bought by the Carib Amerindians. The Black Caribs are the people who originated the Garifuna people, when part of their community was expelled from St. Vincent in 1797 and exported to the island of Roatán, Honduras, from where they migrated to the coast of the mainland of Central America, spread as far as Belize and Nicaragua.|$|E
40|$|Synopsis The human {{costs of}} piracy off the Horn of Africa are {{mounting}} with an escalating {{level of violence}} and shipowners unwilling to pay higher ransoms while operating sub-standard ships. As the plight of Captain Prem Kumar demonstrates, innocent seafarers suffer most. Commentary A GENERAL cargo ship Rak Afrikana, which was hijacked by Somali pirates in April 2010 in the Indian Ocean, sank {{a few hours after}} being released 11 months later. The Rak Afrikana, which was declared a total loss in March 2011, was crewed by 23 seafarers, 11 of whom were Indians, under the command of 49 year-old Captain Prem Kumar. It was owned by a company in the United Arab Emirates and under the flag of <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> <b>and</b> <b>Grenadines.</b> As the ransom negotiations between the pirates and the shipowner dragged on, crew members were increasingly ill-treated and poorly fed by the pirates. Finally a ransom of US$ 1. 2 million was paid [...] much less than ransoms paid for other vessels...|$|E
