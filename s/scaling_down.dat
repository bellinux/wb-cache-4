Earlier that week it was reported Danish air fighters were running out of bombs. The following week, {{the head of the}} Royal Navy said the country's operations in the conflict were not sustainable. By the end of the mission in October 2011, after the death of Colonel Gaddafi, NATO planes had flown about 9,500 strike sorties against pro-Gaddafi targets. A report from the organization Human Rights Watch in May 2012 identified at least 72 civilians killed in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was built}} with one {{stand before the}} opening of another in 1928 which could hold 18,000 people to replace an earth embankment. It hosted its first {{international}} match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against Scotland. Towards {{the end of its}} lifespan, the ground eventually was replaced by Cardiff Arms Park as increasing doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground. The club record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The record stands to this day, and is unlikely to be beaten due to the <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000. In its final years of its use, the club was forced to seek special dispensation from authorities {{in order to keep the}} remaining standing areas of the ground open as clubs at Championship level or above were given three years to redevelop their grounds to remove standing areas.|$|E
5|$|Space Travel is a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is always {{in the center of the}} screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E

5|$|The design {{report for}} the Bay Freeway project was {{published}} on February 10, 1970, and was subsequently distributed to the project. The report featured a new design for the freeway, including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center. Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970, as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts {{similar to those in}} other American cities. During the April hearing, former State Department of Highways director Charles Prahl spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I-5 during rush hour. Voters rejected a Forward Thrust initiative that would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19, removing {{one of the main reasons}} to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> the proposal. The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2,610 drivers during rush hour.|$|E

Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan, where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo, had led to retailers <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely.|$|E
25|$|A major, nearly {{billion dollar}} {{expansion}} and improvements were {{undertaken by the}} county and airport authority in 1987 {{at the request of}} US Airways, which operated a hub there and took on major financing of the changes.

In the early 21st century, airlines struggled with changing financial conditions, and US Airways began <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> its local operation, shifting to Philadelphia and Charlotte. It was carrying debt and was unable to negotiate the terms for lower landing fees at the airport.

25|$|The {{stations}} between Hamar and Grundset, and Trondheim and Støre {{were designed}} by Georg Andreas Bull as his railway-architectural debut. They were designed in Swiss chalet style, all in wood. Compared to the contemporary Trunk and Kongsvinger Lines, the narrow gauge railways were to be low-cost projects, which included <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> the size of stations. The stations in the south were somewhat more decorated. On the northern line the stations were made even smaller. Few of these stations remain. Hamar received a new station designed by Balthazar Lange in 1880, and again by Paul Due in histroiricism in 1897. The only original stone station was Throndhjem Kalvskinnet. Elverum Station is also in stone, but with a less marked style than many other of Due's stations.|$|E
25|$|The Capehart Amendment put intense {{pressure}} on the Truman administration's inflation program. On August 8, the federal government imposed stricter economic controls on the economy. In the steel industry, production quotas and procurement orders were extended to all civilian steelmakers, not just large manufacturers. Steel companies had reported record and near-record profits in the summer, but by mid-fall net revenues were down as defense needs consumed larger and larger quantities of raw and finished steel and steelmakers were unable to sell steel to the higher-margin civilian market. On September 4, DPA again increased the amount of steel needed for defense use, sharply <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> allotments for the civilian economy. When steelmakers balked at expanding plant and equipment {{in order to meet}} new defense quotas, ODM officials ordered the chief executives of the nation's largest steel manufacturers to attend a meeting in Washington where they were threatened with additional government regulation and oversight. The steelmakers quickly acceded to the government's demands.|$|E
25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, <b>scaling</b> <b>down</b> the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E
