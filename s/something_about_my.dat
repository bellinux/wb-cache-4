25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> trip and the {{condition}} of the country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
60|$|He muttered <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> wanting no {{payment for}} a Christian act.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> brother, I know by mother's eyes," [...] {{answered}} the eldest girl, looking inquiringly into Mrs. Willoughby's face.|$|E
50|$|I often try to {{make people}} like or accept me more by saying <b>something</b> funny <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own weaknesses, blunders, or faults.|$|R
6000|$|... "She refused--refused me," [...] faltered Dave. [...] "She {{was very}} sweet and kind; said <b>something</b> <b>about</b> being <b>my</b> sister--I don't {{remember}} just what--but she wouldn't have me." ...|$|R
5000|$|As these rather {{dramatic}} reversals for the doomsday view mounted, however, I {{also noticed}} <b>something</b> striking <b>about</b> <b>my</b> growing cast of deniers. None {{of them were}} deniers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! my {{attendant}} knights! no, indeed; {{you gave}} me such very slight hope of success; besides, you said <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> not wanting them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply the wish, {{so common}} and natural with Americans," [...] said Middleton--"the wish {{to find out}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> kindred--the local origin of my own family." ...|$|E
60|$|I said <b>{{something}}</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> {{not being}} hurt, {{and then something}} more, urging him to run back and try if he might not yet recover the fish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, I think," [...] said Graham, smiling. [...] "There's <b>something</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>my</b> arm,--but don't you wait." [...] And then {{he found}} that he spoke with difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was my landlord, with {{a notice}} of {{ejectment}} or something. He {{held it out}} to me, saw <b>something</b> odd <b>about</b> <b>my</b> hands, I expect, and lifted his eyes to my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{this day}} last week I knew no more that I could {{do things like that}} than you did. It came quite sudden. It's <b>something</b> odd <b>about</b> <b>my</b> will, I suppose, and that's as far as I can see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply the wish, {{so common}} and natural with Americans," [...] said Middleton-- [...] "the wish {{to find out}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> kindred--the local origin of my own family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard," [...] said he, [...] "that {{my little}} friends here are to learn <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family this morning, and {{thought you would}} not mind if I joined them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty wench you make, I {{swear by}} St. Valentine," [...] cried she, falling {{back to look}} at me, and then coming forward to pin up <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> coif, with her white fingers.|$|E
5000|$|I {{read that}} play, and I was just {{destroyed}} by it. It was like finding out <b>something</b> terrible <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family. I just shook. I {{felt like my}} family's privacy had been invaded. I couldn't even talk about it for weeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind for coming, indeed, Sir Marmaduke;--very kind. I thought I might explain <b>something</b> to you <b>about</b> <b>my</b> income." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said <b>something</b> <b>about</b> {{me behind}} <b>my</b> back," [...] said Sam. [...] "I don't {{know what it}} was, but I am certain it was nothing complimentary." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{then gave}} me some {{particulars}} concerning the large thing he travelled in; and when I had expressed all the interest and admiration the subject called for, he condescendingly invited me to tell him <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own small line.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we don't want {{to fight}} at all," [...] Ronald said. [...] "What {{we want to do}} is to find out <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father. I wish the voyage was at an end, and that we had our faces towards Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I? Let's see! No; I think I {{was quite}} polite." [...] He added, with a grim, little smile: [...] "I won't swear I didn't call {{one of them}} a ruffian. I know they said <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> presuming on being a cripple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Elspeth," [...] Tommy whispered that night, [...] "I'm near sure there's <b>something</b> queer <b>about</b> <b>my</b> {{mother and}} me and you." [...] But he did not trouble himself with {{wondering}} what the something queer might be, so engrossed was he in the new and exciting life that had suddenly opened to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} talk about {{such a thing as}} this," [...] he said. [...] "If I did I am sure I should say <b>something</b> hard <b>about</b> <b>my</b> niece, and I don't want to do that." [...] With this he strode away, and {{proceeded}} to look after the concerns of his little farm.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do not conceal myself, {{he may be}} {{reminded}} to write <b>something</b> disagreeable <b>about</b> <b>my</b> lack of a crest or my appetite for scrap-iron; and although he is inexpressibly brilliant when he devotes himself to censure of folly and greed, his dulness is matchless when he transcends the limits of legitimate comment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no; {{there was}} rather a pretty {{outline of a}} nymph or muse, or {{something}} of that sort, at the top---drawn, I mean---and verses written below, <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> showing a lodestar of hope, but I barely glanced at it. I hated it too much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I thought so, I would {{endeavour}} {{to please}} him. But it isn't that. I know his manner so well! I am {{sure it is}} not that. Perhaps it is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> boy. He will not wish to separate a mother from her child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jake," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want you}} to go to the Landing and see that the Mappin people send up the plant Watson expects as soon as it's off the cars. I shall stay here a while and try to learn <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I?" [...] he answered, {{a little}} sadly. [...] "I am not feeling it just now. Besides, there is <b>something</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>my</b> enthusiasms. They are {{becoming}} altogether too pastoral. I am rather thinking of {{taking up the}} cultivation of roses and of making a terraced garden down to the sea. Do {{you know anything about}} gardening, Lady Jane?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite {{by chance}} I {{happened}} to be in the Bear’s Head a week arterwards, and, quite by chance, as I came out I saw the skipper saying ’Good-bye’ on the bridge agin. He seemed to be put out <b>about</b> <b>something,</b> and when I said ’Wot a lovely evening it would be if only it wasn’t raining ’ard!’ he said <b>something</b> <b>about</b> knocking <b>my</b> ’ead off.|$|R
60|$|At last I {{rose with}} a sigh to seek help, and as I rose I {{felt that there was}} <b>something</b> set <b>about</b> <b>my</b> neck. It was the collar of great {{emeralds}} which Guatemoc had given to me, and that I had given to Otomie. She had set it there while I slept, and with it a lock of her long hair. Both shall be buried with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{if you did}} {{not know}} there won't be," [...] she said, saucily. And then {{suddenly}} altering her tone she went on, [...] "Now, Cuthbert, you will surely tell me what you would not before. What did you find out? It is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father, I am sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First of all," [...] he said, [...] "I want to {{tell you}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family. My Dad, you know, isn't altogether--I mean, he's left my mother and they're trying to divorce him; so they've ordered him to come back, you see. You'll see that in the paper to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I may be busy, I may be {{harassed by}} tricksters and bunglers, but I am not too busy {{not to care}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> daughter's doings. I expect them to deceive me, Victoria, but I pinned my faith somewhere. I pinned it on you. On you, do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Concealed your affection, Reginald!" [...] she repeated. [...] "How strangely that sounds! But listen. You said <b>something</b> {{just now}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> allowance. If I allude {{to it in}} return, will you {{believe that it is}} entirely for your sake?" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{much for}} what I {{have heard from}} others {{on the subject of}} my Uncle George. My own {{personal}} experience of him is limited to what I remember as a mere child. Let me say <b>something,</b> however, first <b>about</b> <b>my</b> parents, my sister and myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{the best}} jest was behind--I had just power to stammer out <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Jess--by <b>my</b> faith he HAD an answer! I had taught Jess one trade, and, like a prudent girl, {{she had found}} out another for herself; unluckily, they were both contraband, and Jess Cantrips, {{daughter}} of the Lady Kittlebasket, had the honour to be transported to the plantations, for street-walking and pocket-picking, about six months before I touched shore.' ...|$|R
