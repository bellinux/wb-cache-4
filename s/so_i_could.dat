5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

25|$|I made {{a mistake}} going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> weigh in under 200pounds.

500|$|Due to {{his poor}} eyesight, Berry wore contact lenses when he played.

500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Bakshi was {{promoted}} to director. His first assignment was the series Sad Cat. Bakshi {{and his wife had}} separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: [...] "We didn't really 'direct' like you'd think. We were 'animation directors,' because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn't affect anything, but I still tried. I'd re-time, mix up soundtracks—I'd fuck with it <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make it my own." ...|$|E

I played piano a bit, too, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear what they were all doing harmonically. But if something stumped me, I'd ask and Elmo would spell out harmonies.

500|$|The album's best-known single, [...] "Fire Water Burn", is a {{diatribe}} {{against a}} white boy who attempts, and fails, {{to act like}} a black thug. [...] "I Wish I Was Queer <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Get Chicks" [...] is satirical song about the belief that girls only like gay men, playing on the stereotype that gay men are often better looking and more sensitive than straight men. [...] "Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me?"

Tuc Watkins auditioned for the role and was cast as Bob Hunter on the series a few weeks later. Lyndsy Fonseca joined the cast as Katherine's daughter, Dylan.
