One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads him to believe that his sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him {{to use as a}} decoy to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} is now generally discouraged since {{it affects the}} educational performance of school children. Top fighters can fetch up to 100 pesos (US$ 2), making the sport lucrative for children. They could <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time hunting and training spiders that lessons and homework are neglected. Adults also play the sport {{but in a way}} similar to cockfighting. Derbies are also held and bets could go as high as 50,000 pesos (about US$1,000). The cheaper maintenance cost of raising spiders compared to raising fighting cocks caused some players to switch to spider fighting.|$|E

In 1889, following a drawn-out series of provocations regarding the honour of his wife, Tomić stabbed to death a liberal political rival, Miša Dimitrijević, {{the editor of}} Branik magazine, in Novi Sad. He served seven years in prison for murder, emerging in 1896 with no loss of political zeal. Not only political but economic issues had far reaching importance to him. Tomić, then the most vociferous opponent of the hierarchy, the leader of the Serbian radical party and son-in-law of Svetozar Miletić, blamed the clergy for driving people away from churches because of its insistence on controlling church and autonomous finances: Whoever has to worry about how to <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money has no more time to care for the church and people.|$|E

500|$|ANN {{noted that}} the second anime season tends to overdramatize, {{especially}} {{in the last three}} episodes. ANN also describes the second season as [...] "more embarrassing and shoujo-ai oriented" [...] than the first season, but that the solid characterization is still a strength of the series. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime appreciated the focus on characters other than Yumi and Sachiko for the second season, regarding Shimako's loss of Sei and befriending Noriko as being [...] "one of the more moving" [...] arcs of Printemps. ANN regarded the OVA season as the best of the first three seasons, citing the improved production standards and the less melodramatic storylines. ANN notes that the fourth season is [...] "a return to dramatic form" [...] after the relaxation of the OVA series, but it is not as melodramatic as the second season, due to the increased maturity of the cast. [...] Chris Beveridge, writing for Mania.com, found it odd that Yumi and Sachiko did not <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time together in the fourth season, and felt that the series needed an epilogue, but enjoyed seeing Yumi taking on some [...] "adult responsibilities." ...|$|E

He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W.

500|$|While playing {{shows in}} England in 1969, the band {{discovered}} {{they were being}} mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema {{across the street from}} the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was [...] "strange that people <b>spend</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money to see scary movies." [...] Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called [...] "Black Sabbath", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as [...] "the Devil's Interval", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track [...] "probably the most evil song ever written". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.|$|E

[...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest".
