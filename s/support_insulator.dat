50|$|While {{operating}} at reduced power {{in anticipation of}} typhoon Talim, on , the Unit 2 main transformer differential protective relay tripped because a damaged <b>support</b> <b>insulator</b> caused one phase to flash to ground. The main transformer trip was followed by main turbine trip and then reactor scram. Following the subsequent repair work, on , as the unit was in a hot standby condition, a water hammer occurred {{in one of the}} main steam lines. It was determined that condensed water accumulated while the unit was in warm standby with the drain valve closed. When that steam line started to supply steam to the turbine, the slug of water was pushed downstream, causing a water hammer and subsequent low steam pressure, resulting in another reactor trip.|$|E

40|$|International audience— Improving the {{recyclability}} of {{the high}} voltage apparatus {{is a major concern}} of the manufacturers. In this paper, the suitability of thermoplastic polymer used as <b>support</b> <b>insulator</b> in high voltage gas insulated substation is presented in this paper.

The effect of the temperature on the dielectric strength is also investigated. In view of extremely promising results, it is worthwhile studying the evolution of the material properties under operating conditions. In that sense, mechanical creepage curves are given. It is also shown that the main electrical properties of the material are affected neither by aging under used SF 6 nor by combined thermo-electrical ageing.

40|$|Abstract-A {{computationally}} efficient, {{finite element}} idealization {{is presented to}} analyse galloping, which is characterized by large amplitude vibrations of iced, multi-span, electrical transmission lines. A three-node, isoparametric cable element having three translational and a torsional degree-of-freedom at each node is developed to model a conductor. <b>Support</b> <b>insulator</b> strings and remote conductor spans are represented by linear static springs. A transmission line’s interactions with a support tower are modelled through the tower’s equivalent stiffness at the conductor’s suspension point. An expedient time marching scheme is developed to obtain the envelope of galloping. The scheme can be utilized to integrate dynamic equilibrium equations involving not only geometric and material nonlinearities but also nonlinear damping. Time integration is performed in the sub-space to minimize computational effort. The finite element model has been employed to successfully simulate field galloping records.

This {{is due to}} increased use of sensitive electronic devices in the control circuitry of such substations. In this paper, a numerical model based on the finite-difference time-domain technique has been developed to compute the EM field emission from the gas-insulated bus duct through nonmetallic flange of the <b>support</b> <b>insulator</b> during switching operations. The shielding effectiveness (SE) of the bus duct/section for the EM fields has been evaluated using a derivative Gaussian current source and a short time sinusoidal current source. The effect of variations in dimensions of the slot formed by the nonmetallic flange as well as electromagnetic properties of the insulator/bus duct enclosure on SE has been studied. The variation in field pattern along the axis of bus duct at various distances due to the transient currents of different frequencies has been analyzed. The enhancement factor for the EM field levels due {{to the presence of}} a metallic structure has been reported. Finally, emission levels are calculated for the very fast transient currents generated in a 245 kV GIS and their dominant frequencies have been identified...|$|E

For dimensioning the gas insulated systems the <b>support</b> <b>insulators</b> (spacers) are of special interest. Contaminations on the insulator surface can cause field distortions and may lead to a significant reduction of the breakdown strength. To reduce the amount of used SF 6, the gases CO 2, N 2 and dry air are examined as possible substitutes for SF 6 at pressure range from 0. 1 to 1 MPa. Their behaviour under AC and LI stresses is investigated.
