50|$|The {{first round}} of the EFL Cup for 2016-17 <b>saw</b> <b>fixtures</b> drawn on 22 June 2016. Rovers were drawn against Championship side Nottingham Forest.|$|R
5000|$|The Netherlands {{played their}} first game in 1930, against Belgium on July 1. The Netherlands played Belgium and Germany {{as well as}} Romania. During the 1940s they played {{regularly}} against Belgium and Germany. The 1960s saw the side play West Germany regularly {{as well as other}} fixtures including matches against Poland, Sweden, Spain and Czechoslovakia. The 1970s <b>saw</b> <b>fixtures</b> played against teams including Italy. They won a number of games from 1984 through to 1987.|$|R
25|$|Rugby league was {{originally}} introduced to South Africa in the 1950s with the staging of several series tournaments {{within the country}} that <b>saw</b> <b>fixtures</b> between the English and the French however this concept failed to generate the needed interest and was not upheld. The South Africans would not see further international rugby league until the 1960s where the first national side undertook fixtures against the visiting British and a tour to Australia. From the 1960s onwards the international fixture list for the South Africans would be minimal {{and it would not}} be until the early 1990s when they would begin to play with some lasting regularity.|$|R
50|$|The team played {{its first}} match in 1869 on Ealing Common, {{prior to the}} {{founding}} of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The early years <b>saw</b> regular <b>fixtures</b> against the likes of Wasps, London Irish, Harlequins, Richmond and Blackheath with 75% win rate for a long period.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{achieve the}} {{processing}} program and simulation verification on NC Woodworking Curve Band Saw (WCBS) that facilitates the industrialization and practicality of the woodworking machinery, the articles proposes the CAM system modules by {{the analysis of}} its composition structure and working principle of the machine and the building-up of its kinematics model. The article also explains the basic functions for each module and develops the CAM systems of MJS 1325 WCBS {{with the use of}} VC++ and OpenGL. Reading and analyzing the CAD work piece graphics files, the CAM systems is able to generate the NC program and realize the simulation of machining in whole visual process environment including <b>saws,</b> <b>fixtures,</b> belt <b>saw</b> and work piece, etc. The CAM systems pass the prototype test and see a favorable effect...|$|R
50|$|The second <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> them {{square off}} against England Deaf at Folkestone, this time {{managing}} {{to keep the}} score to a respectable 21-27.|$|R
50|$|Newcastle {{returned}} to the First Division in double of the time. Promotion was achieved in 1948 in front of vast crowds. An average of almost 57,000 at every home game <b>saw</b> United's <b>fixtures</b> that year, a national record for years to come. That was just the start of another period of success.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, {{the return}} <b>fixture,</b> <b>saw</b> the first all-ticket game at Bloomfield Road. Mortensens goal, his fourteenth of the season, gave Blackpool the victory.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 February - Heart of Midlothian 1985-86: After a 31-game unbeaten run, {{defeat in}} their last two <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> Hearts miss out on a League and Scottish Cup double.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} 1973 until 2012 the Club {{retained}} a {{position within the}} top 36 clubs in the SRU league structure on Saturdays; occasional promotions into the Scottish Premiership were usually balanced by returns to the top end of the National League below. Wednesday afternoons <b>saw</b> <b>fixtures</b> in the Scottish Universities championship which was won many times and very many players represented the Scottish Universities XV. A memorable victory in the SRU'S Scottish HydroElectric Bowl competition was registered in 2009 with the final being played against Aberdeenshire RFC at Murrayfield. However great ambition coupled with reorganisations in the British University competition saw the Club qualify for admission to BUCS Premier North 'B' League at the first available opportunity; this inevitably saw a deeply reluctant departure from the SRU league structure to aid concentration on the enormous travelling requirements south of the border. The Club remains the only Scottish University at this level.|$|R
50|$|In the 2013-14 season, Stadio Sandro Cabassi hosted Serie B {{football}} {{for the first}} time. The first Serie B <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Carpi lose 0-2 to Empoli F.C. with an attendance of 2,363.|$|R
50|$|The format {{was thus}} {{established}} in that Exiles representative XVs would be produced at both senior and under 21/student levels. The {{first two seasons}} <b>saw</b> friendly <b>fixtures</b> take place, e.g. versus Ulster at Ravenhill and versus the Welsh Exiles senior XV; both the Welsh and Scottish unions saw merit in implementing similar 'Exiles' programmes. The first senior XV Coach was British & Irish Lion Dr. Ken Kennedy.|$|R
50|$|At {{the halfway}} point, they had 25 points to their name. They {{acquired}} another 25 {{in the second}} half, but a loss and three draws in their final four <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> them unable {{to keep pace with}} Birmingham and Cardiff City.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} home League <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> Blackpool extend their win streak at Bloomfield Road to fifteen League games. Their 24-game unbeaten run at home ended, after {{just over a}} year, with a defeat by Crewe Alexandra on 23 November.|$|R
50|$|Derry City loaned Boyle to Finn Harps {{in early}} 2015, {{where he made}} his debut as a {{substitute}} late {{in the second half}} in a 1-0 win over Cabinteely. The next <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> him make his first start for Harps, scoring twice in an away win over Waterford United.|$|R
50|$|The {{boxing day}} <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Stoke {{make the trip}} to Manchester City where Roberto Mancini was taking his first game in charge for the home side. His new side made a bright start and two goals from Martin Petrov and Carlos Tevez gave Man City a 2-0 win.|$|R
50|$|The launch {{was delayed}} the next day, due to {{problems}} with the exterior access hatch. First, one of the micro-switch indicators, used to verify that the hatch was safely locked, malfunctioned. Then, a stripped bolt prevented the closeout crew from removing a closing fixture from the orbiter's hatch. By the time repair personnel had <b>sawed</b> the <b>fixture</b> off, crosswinds at the Shuttle Landing Facility exceeded the limits for a Return to Launch Site (RTLS) abort. While the crew waited for winds to die down, the launch window expired, forcing yet another scrub.|$|R
5000|$|... Rovers' final {{regular season}} <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> them hammer Alfreton Town 7-0, a result which saw the Derbyshire side {{relegated to the}} National League North, {{in front of a}} Conference Premier regular season record {{attendance}} of 11,085. The result equaled Rovers' biggest ever league win and was the club's biggest margin of victory in 51 years.|$|R
50|$|Ngaruawahia United's second {{international}} <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> a {{match with}} Samoa U-20 at the Charles J. Dempsey Football Academy at the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) headquarters in Penrose, Auckland, the match finishing in an entertaining 3-3 draw. Star performers for Ngaruawahia included debutant and former Solomon Islands international midfielder David Firisua and young South African-born attacker Lance Louvie.|$|R
50|$|The {{boxing day}} <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Liverpool host Wolves. An even first half saw Kevin Doyle miss the away side's best chance {{as he headed}} over from six yards, but Stephen Ward's {{controversial}} red card {{early in the second}} half proved a turning point. Steven Gerrard powered in a header just after the hour, and Yossi Benayoun added a second deflected shot eight minutes later.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 2015, the Football League {{revealed}} the fixtures for the forthcoming season. Rovers' first fixture was against Northampton Town at the Memorial Stadium followed, {{a week later}} by a trip to Huish Park to face Yeovil Town. The traditional boxing day <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Rovers' travel to AFC Wimbledon while {{the final game of}} the season saw Dagenham & Redbridge visit the Mem.|$|R
5000|$|The Dewsbury and Savile Ground was a cricket ground {{located in}} Savile Town, Dewsbury, England. It hosted 53 first class matches between 1867 and 1933. The first <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Yorkshire play Cambridgeshire while Essex were the {{visitors}} {{in the final}} game held there. Yorkshire twice played the touring Australians at the ground and, in its earliest days, several first class 'All England' fixtures were held.|$|R
5000|$|The schools cricket ground first held {{international}} {{an international}} match when Ireland played Gibraltar in the 1997 ICC Trophy, which was hosted by Malaysia. Eight matches in that competition were {{played at the}} school. [...] The ground also played host to three List A fixtures played in the cricket competition at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. These <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> Pakistan play Scotland, Canada played India, and Malaysia play Jamaica.|$|R
50|$|Hereford's {{first season}} {{back in the}} Football League saw them beat five of the top eight {{finishing}} clubs, as well as higher graded opposition in the cup competitions. The surprise result of the season was a 4-1 win at Lincoln City with Steve Guinan, back on loan, scoring a hat-trick. This lifted the Bulls to 9th in League Two but their remaining thirteen <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> them collect just seven more points, which meant they eventually finished in 16th position.|$|R
50|$|Connacht's {{first game}} in December was away to Cardiff Blues, {{which ended in}} a 20-16 defeat. On 11 December, Connacht faced the Newcastle Falcons in Galway in the Challenge Cup, winning 25-10. A week later <b>saw</b> the return <b>fixture</b> take place in Kingston Park, with Connacht losing 29-5. This left Connacht top of the pool on 13 points, with Newcastle two points behind. In {{the final game of}} 2015 Connacht faced Ulster in Galway on St. Stephen's Day, losing 3-10.|$|R
50|$|Stoke's final away <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> {{them make}} the long trip down to Southampton. Stoke {{took the lead}} through new signing Dave Kitson, David McGoldrick {{levelled}} before Pericard scored from distance. Stern John pulled The Saints level again but Stoke {{were not to be}} denied as Jamie Hatch scored an own goal. Stoke's final friendly saw them take on Spanish side Osasuna in what was an entertaining 2-2 draw. Delap and Shawcross scored for city while Walter Pandiani and Javad Nekounam scored for Osasuna.|$|R
50|$|The game, {{which ended}} 2-1, {{was the second}} to last game and Scotland's third win in the four game {{qualification}} series in UEFA Group 8. The last <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Czechoslovakia play out a meaningless 1-0 victory over Scotland, which saw them finish second on five points, behind Scotland on six. Denmark completed the group bottom, on one point. Jordan earned nine more Scotland caps {{by the end of}} the 1973-4 season, scoring two goals on the way, which saw him be selected for the finals.|$|R
50|$|FC Halifax and Grimsby {{had met in}} {{the league}} twice and the first <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Grimsby inflict a 7-0 defeat on a {{depleted}} FC Halifax at Blundell Park, their biggest defeat as FC Halifax Town. The return fixture was quite the opposite however as a rejuvenated FC Halifax side defeated Grimsby 4-2 at the Shay; FC Halifax were 3-0 up inside half an hour. Following FC Halifax's relegation and Grimsby's promotion the match was effectively a League Two side against a National League North side and possibly it was Grimsby's swansong to non-League football.|$|R
50|$|Gregory's next spell in {{management}} was with Derby County (January 2002 - March 2003). When he took charge at Derby they were {{bottom of the}} Premiership, but after winning both of his first two games at the helm {{it looked as though}} {{he might be able to}} save them from relegation. Unfortunately, seven defeats from their final eight <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> Derby slip out of the Premiership after six years. The club's financial problems meant that Gregory hadn't purchased any players during the 2002-03 season, and their subsequent form in Division One was disappointing.|$|R
50|$|On 25 September, Blackpool faced Blackburn Rovers at Bloomfield Road in {{only their}} second home Premier League {{game of the}} opening six. The <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce's first return to the club since his sacking {{fourteen}} years earlier. Charlie Adam gave Rovers the lead with an own-goal after twenty minutes, {{and that is how}} the score remained until the 85th, when Matt Phillips equalised one minute after coming on as substitute for Neal Eardley. Brett Emerton scored the winner for Rovers three minutes into injury time.|$|R
5000|$|An A-League {{pre-season}} cup {{game was}} played in Launceston between Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United on 16 July 2006 at the same venue [...] with Adelaide getting a 1-0 win, watched by a crowd of 6,834. A 2007 repeat of the Melbourne Victory, Adelaide United pre-season cup <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> 8,061 at Aurora Stadium. The result in 2007 was a 1-1 draw between the teams. The Melbourne Victory v Adelaide game continued in both 2008 and 2009. On 25 July 2010 Melbourne Victory hosted Central Coast Mariners in another preseason game at Aurora Stadium.|$|R
50|$|United entered 1985 unbeaten at Old Trafford {{to stay in}} {{contention}} {{at the top of}} the table, but lost successive home matches to Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City, before embarking on a 10-match unbeaten run which took in big wins over Villa (Hughes scoring a hat-trick) and Stoke. Defeats at Hillsborough and Luton - not to mention the exceptional form of a resurgent Everton - effectively ended United's title hopes, and a 5-1 defeat at Watford in their final <b>fixture</b> <b>saw</b> them overhauled by both Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur to finish fourth.|$|R
50|$|Much of the Torquay's success {{during the}} season {{was due to the}} goalscoring of new forward George Appleyard, signed from local rivals Exeter City. Effortlessly filling the boots of the {{recently}} departed Billy Kellock, Appleyard scored an impressive 29 goals in all competitions. He made a particular impression in the FA Cup, scoring in all five Qualifying rounds and getting Torquay to the First Round Proper for the very first time. Their reward was a visit from high-flying Third Division South side Reading. 6,000 supporters at Plainmoor witnessed Torquay take a first half lead over their League opponents before Reading equalised through a penalty which forced a replay at Elm Park. A late equalising goal from George Appleyard in that match <b>saw</b> the <b>fixture</b> taken to a second replay, to be held at Bristol City's Ashton Gate ground. However, it was to be third time unlucky for the Magpies as the League side eventually emerged with a 2 - 0 victory.|$|R
50|$|The Trojans {{started with}} {{back to back}} games against two of the powerhouses of Irish American Football, the Dublin Rebels & the UL Vikings. Defeats in these two <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> the Belfast side going 0-2 {{at the start of}} the season. However, by game day three {{something}} had begun to click and the Trojans swept away all teams before them as they battled to their first Northern Division Title. The division win set up a semi-final playoff in Limerick where the Trojans could not find their feet against a dominating Vikings side who conquered the Trojans in a 52-8 victory.|$|R
50|$|In the 2011 season Skelmersdale again {{finished}} in 2nd place to Chester. They {{were on the}} same points but were placed second on goal difference. The final day of <b>fixtures</b> <b>saw</b> Skem needing to win by 7 clear goals and for Chester to lose. Chester did in fact lose to the bottom team, but Skem only won their game 7-2, so missed out on promotion by 2 goals. Their misery was completed by losing in the semi finals yet again to AFC Fylde 1-0. The 2012 season saw Skem finish outside the playoffs {{for the first time in}} 7th place.|$|R
