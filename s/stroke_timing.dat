5000|$|Total Immersion {{focuses on}} a handful of core {{principles}} that apply to any body moving through a fluid medium whether it be a boat, a submarine, an aquatic mammal or a fish. It emphasizes greater efficiency and lowered resistance by teaching drills and focal points that keep the swimmer's hips near the surface, reducing the drag profile of the body. Balance in the water refers to having hips, shoulders, and head all level with the surface of the water. The body acts like a see-saw with the lungs as the fulcrum. Because the legs typically weigh more than the head and upper body, swimmers must focus on getting weight forward of the lungs in order to bring the hips to the surface. Adjusting head position, usually by lowering it, and having the arms in front of the lungs by almost overlapping the timing of the stroke helps to balance the body in the same way a see-saw balances by adding weight to one side. This <b>stroke</b> <b>timing</b> is frequently called [...] "front quadrant swimming".{Total Immersion T. Laughlin & J. Delves pp. 37-41 & 90-91} ...|$|E
40|$|Practicing {{with the}} use of a ball machine could {{handicap}} a player compared to playing against an actual opponent. Recent studies have shown some differences in swing timing and movement coordination, when a player faces a ball projection machine as opposed to a human opponent. We focused on the time of movement initiation and on <b>stroke</b> <b>timing</b> during returning tennis serves (simulated by a ball machine or by a real server). Receivers’ movements were measured on a tennis court. In spite of using a serving ball speed from 90 kph to 135 kph, results showed significant differences in movement initiation and backswing duration between serves received from a ball machine and serves received from a real server. Players had shorter movement initiation when they faced a ball machine. Backswing duration was longer for the group using a ball machine. That demonstrates different movement timing of tennis returns when players face a ball machine. Use of ball machines in tennis practice should be limited as it may disrupt <b>stroke</b> <b>timing...</b>|$|E

For the NACA fin, the fast-to-centreline kinematics caused larger resultant force over a narrow range of frequencies. For the fast-to-maximum-amplitude stroke, a lower resultant force was achieved, but over a larger range of frequencies.

40|$|Initial walking {{function}} is often limited after stroke, and regaining walking ability {{is an important}} goal in rehabilitation. Various compensatory movement strategies to ensure sufficient foot-clearance are reported. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are often prescribed to improve foot-clearance and may influence these strategies. However, research studying effects of actual AFO-provision early after stroke is limited. We conducted an explorative randomized controlled trial and aimed to study the short-term effects of AFO-provision on kinematic and spatiotemporal parameters in patients early after stroke. In addition, we studied whether timing of AFO-provision influenced these effects. Unilateral hemiparetic patients maximal six weeks post-stroke {{were randomly assigned to}} AFO-provision: early (at inclusion) or delayed (eight weeks later). Three-dimensional gait-analysis with and without AFO in randomized order was performed within two weeks after AFO-provision. Twenty subjects (8 early, 12 delayed) were analyzed. We found significant positive effects of AFO-provision for ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact, foot-off and during swing (− 3. 6 ° (7. 3) vs 3. 0 ° (3. 9); 0. 0 ° (7. 4) vs 5. 2 ° (3. 7); and − 6. 1 ° (7. 8) vs 2. 6 ° (3. 5), respectively), all p <  0. 001. No changes in knee, hip and pelvis angles were found after AFO-provision, except for knee (+ 2. 3 °) and hip flexion (+ 1. 6 °) at initial contact, p ≤  0. 001. Significant effects of AFO-provision were found for cadence (+ 2. 1 steps/min, p =  0. 026), stride duration (− 0. 08  s, p =  0. 015) and single support duration (+ 1. 0 %, p =  0. 002). Early or delayed AFO-provision after stroke did not affect results.

40|$|In {{the sport}} of long track speed skating, in recent {{years there has been}} an {{increasing}} desire for training tools which provide deeper technical insight of the skating movement to the athlete and coaches. In previous literature a variety of measurement systems have been presented; one such system included the instrumented klapskate developed at the Delft University of Technology. Alongside the implementation of this new instrumented klapskate, a simplified piezo-resistive pressure sensor system has been applied with high performance Dutch speed skaters; however, to this point the best application of such a system has not been shown. This research examined the potential ways in which this simplified system may provide valuable feedback to a skater, with consideration for the feedback currently available within the sport. Through a combination of bench and on-ice testing, the system was evaluated for its ability to predict skating forces (normal, lateral, and absolute), the center of pressure of force application, peak stroke force, and finally, contact time for individual strokes. Despite an inability to generate a full profile of skating force, the PRPS system provided reasonable estimations of peak stroke normal (RMSE = 50. 2 N) and absolute (RMSE = 50. 5 N) forces in the straights, while in the curve, peak normal (RMSE = 129. 4) and absolute (RMSE = 131. 5 N) force estimates were less accurate. <b>Stroke</b> <b>timing</b> was predicted with accuracy, giving minor underestimation in both the straight (RMSE = 0. 0671 s) and curves (RMSE = 0. 0474 s). Center of pressure measurement was largely unsuccessful when attempted on the bench using a tensile load cell, however estimations applied to on-ice data yielded trends in center of pressure position consistent with previous literature, suggesting future viability as a feedback parameter. For future work, a larger sample size and further on-ice testing would be recommended for verification and improved development of this prototype system. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

If the strokeman increases or decreases the stroke rate it is essential that seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|R

Effective sprint kayaking performance was characterised by; a high cadence, a long pull phase, a large trunk rotation occurring early in the stroke, close synchronisation of the thrust elbow action with the trunk rotation, delayed draw elbow action, and effective trunk movement (flexion, lateral flexion) to minimise kayak "bobbing". Effective marathon kayaking performance was characterised by; a high cadence, a long stroke length, having the first stage of the pull phase constituting a greater percentage of the total stroke, reduced kayak velocity fluctuations, increased draw elbow flexion, reduced and delayed trunk rotation during the pull phase, and effective trunk movement (flexion, lateral flexion) to minimise kayak "bobbing".

Methods: Data from the World Mental Health Surveys were accessed. This data was collected from general population surveys over 17 countries of 87, 250 adults. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview retrospectively assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of DSM-IV mental disorders. A weighted subsample (n = 45, 288), was used for analysis in the present study. Survival analyses estimated associations between first onset of mental disorders and subsequent stroke onset. Results: Bivariate models showed that 12 / 16 mental disorders were associated with subsequent stroke onset (ORs ranging from 1. 6 to 3. 8). However, after adjustment for mental disorder comorbidity and smoking, only significant relationships between depression and stroke (OR 1. 3) and alcohol abuse and stroke (OR 1. 5) remained. Among females, having a bipolar disorder was also associated with increased stroke incidence (OR 2. 1). Increasing number of mental disorders was associated with stroke onset in a dose-response fashion (OR 3. 3 for 5 + disorders). Conclusions: Depression and alcohol abuse may have specific associations with incidence of non-fatal stroke.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Previous {{research}} suggests that blood pressure falls acutely after ischemic stroke. We aimed to further characterize this fall with a statistical technique that allows the application of regression techniques to serial blood pressure outcome data. Methods: In a prospectively recruited ischemic stroke cohort, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure was recorded every 4 h until 48 h after stroke. Potential determinants of blood pressure, including stroke severity and acute infection, were also recorded. Mixed effects models were used to model serial blood pressure measurements over time, adjusted for significant determinants. Results: In 156 patients, SBP and DBP fell by 14. 9 mm Hg (95 % CI 6. 2 - 22. 6 mm Hg) and 6. 2 mm Hg (95 % CI 1. 4 - 10. 6 mm Hg), respectively, over the first 48 h after stroke. SBP was higher in patients with premorbid hypertension, a previous history of stroke or TIA, current alcohol use, increasing age, stroke of mild to moderate severity (NIHSS 3 - 13) and in patients treated with antihypertensives. SBP was lower in smokers. There was a progressive rise in SBP in patients with acute infection. No factors other than time were associated with DBP. Conclusions: The use of mixed effects models has identified a linear SBP and DBP fall over the first 48 h after <b>stroke.</b> The <b>timing</b> and magnitude of this fall should be accounted for {{in the design of}} future prognostic and intervention studies.

The {{diminutive}} Hassett was an elegant middle-order batsman, described by Wisden as, [...] "... a master of nearly every <b>stroke</b> ... his superb <b>timing,</b> nimble footwork and strong wrists enabled him to make batting look a simple matter". His sporting career at school singled him out as a precocious talent, but he took a number of seasons to secure a regular place in first-class cricket and initially struggled to make large scores. Selected for the 1938 tour of England with only one first-class century to his name, Hassett established himself with three consecutive first-class tons {{at the start of}} the campaign. Although he struggled in the Tests, he played a crucial role in Australia's win in the Fourth Test, with a composed display in the run-chase which sealed the retention of the Ashes. Upon returning to Australia, he distinguished himself in domestic cricket with a series of high scores, becoming the only player to score two centuries in a match against Bill O'Reilly—widely regarded as the best bowler in the world.|$|R
40|$|Calligraphic writing {{presents}} a {{rich set of}} challenges to the human movement control system. These challenges include: initial learning, and recall from memory, of prescribed <b>stroke</b> sequences; critical <b>timing</b> of <b>stroke</b> onsets and durations; fine control of grip and contact forces; and letter-form invariance under voluntary size scaling, which entails fine control of stroke direction and amplitude during recruitment and derecruitment of musculoskeletal degrees of freedom. Experimental and computational studies in behavioral neuroscience have made rapid progress toward explaining the learning, planning and contTOl exercised in tasks that share features with calligraphic writing and drawing. This article summarizes computational neuroscience models and related neurobiological data that reveal critical operations spanning from parallel sequence representations to fine force control. Part one addresses stroke sequencing. It treats competitive queuing (CQ) models of sequence representation, performance, learning, and recall. Part two addresses letter size scaling and motor equivalence. It treats cursive handwriting models together with models in which sensory-motor tmnsformations are performed by circuits that learn inverse differential kinematic mappings. Part three addresses fine-grained control of timing and transient forces, by treating circuit models that learn to solve inverse dynamics problems. National Institutes of Health (R 01 DC 02852...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Concern {{over the}} {{environment}} and=or {{the increasing demand}} for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest {{in the development of}} alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect of advanced injection timing on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and ignition lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion <b>stroke.</b> Advanced injection <b>timing</b> is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard injection timing of 30 before TDC (BTDC). The injection was first advanced by 5 : 5 given injection timing of 35 : 5 BTDC. The engine ran for about 5 minutes at this timing and stopped. The engine failed to start upon subsequent attempts. The injection was then advanced by 3 : 5 (i. e. 33 : 5 BTDC). The engine ran smoothly on this timing but seemed to incur penalty on fuel consumption especially at high load levels...|$|R
