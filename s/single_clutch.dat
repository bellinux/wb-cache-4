5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{generally}} polygynous, and individual males try {{to mate with}} as many females as they can. Monogamous pairings have been recorded in American alligators. Dominant male crocodilians patrol and defend territories which contain several females. Males of some species, like the American alligator, try to attract females with elaborate courtship displays. During courtship, crocodilian males and females may rub against each other, circle around, and perform swimming displays. Copulation typically occurs in the water. When a female is ready to mate, she arches her back while her head and tail submerge. The male rubs across the female's neck and then grasps her with his hindlimbs, placing his tail underneath hers so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted. Mating can last up to 15 minutes, during which time the pair continuously submerge and surface. While dominant males usually monopolise reproductive females, multiple paternity is known to exist in American alligators, where {{as many as three}} different males may sire offspring in a <b>single</b> <b>clutch.</b> Within a month of mating, the female crocodilian begins to make a nest.|$|E

40|$|Clutch is {{a device}} {{used in the}} {{transmission}} system of a vehicle to engage and disengage the transmission system from the engine. The clutch works {{on the principle of}} friction. This paper discusses detailed study of <b>single</b> plate <b>clutch.</b> In this paper, detail study of clutch and modeling of clutch is done in proe software. Assembly of different parts of the <b>single</b> plate <b>clutch</b> is also done in software...|$|R
25|$|The {{birth process}} was widely spaced {{and may have}} {{occurred}} {{over a period of}} as long as a week. However, if disturbed the female may regurgitate all the young frogs in a single act of propulsive vomiting. The offspring were completely developed when expelled and there was little variation in colour and length of a <b>single</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many reptile species also {{demonstrate}} polyandry, {{especially among}} members of the tortoise family (Testudinidae). Through polyandry and long-term sperm storage, recent studies have found evidence for the ability of female tortoises to produce clutches of eggs that demonstrate multiple paternity. Predictably, these hatchlings showed an increase in genetic variability compared to those sired by a single male. Potential for multiple paternity within a clutch is primarily a result of sperm storage across reproductive cycles, since studies have confirmed the presence of multiple males' sperm in the female tortoise reproductive tract simultaneously. As a result of clutches with greater variation in paternal genes and increased sperm competition, females can maximize both the genetic quality and number of offspring. Multiple paternities within a <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> is therefore considered an effective strategy to increase the reproductive success and fitness of female tortoises.|$|E
500|$|Depending on the species, female {{crocodilians}} may construct either holes or mounds as nests, {{the latter}} made from vegetation, litter, sand, or soil. Nests are typically found near dens or caves. Those made by different females are sometimes {{close to each}} other, particularly in hole-nesting species. The number of eggs laid in a <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> ranges from ten to fifty. Crocodilian eggs are protected by hard shells made of calcium carbonate. The incubation period is two to three months. The temperature at which the eggs incubate determines {{the sex of the}} hatchlings. Constant nest temperatures above [...] produce more males, while those below [...] produce more females. However, sex in crocodilians may be determined in a short interval, and nests are subject to changes in temperature. Most natural nests produce hatchlings of both sexes, though single-sex clutches do occur.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their use in heavy manufacturing equipment, single-revolution clutches were applied to numerous small machines. In tabulating machines, for example, pressing the operate key would trip a <b>single</b> revolution <b>clutch</b> to process the most recently entered number. [...] In typesetting machines, pressing any key selected a particular character and also engaged a <b>single</b> rotation <b>clutch</b> to cycle the mechanism to typeset that character. [...] Similarly, in teleprinters, the receipt of each character tripped a single-revolution clutch to operate one cycle of the print mechanism.|$|R

2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change gears for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> pack (one clutch for each gear), causing the selected clutch (and gear) to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|E
2500|$|Although most female moths mate multiply, {{very low}} {{instances}} of mixed paternities occur. [...] In fact, most progeny in a <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> is sired exclusively by one male. Females {{of this species}} do not select based on age, mating order, between-mating interval, or duration of copulation. [...] Instead, female Utetheisa ornatix demonstrate female choice in mate selection that depends on body size, systemic content of defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloid, and glandular content of the courtship pheromone hydroxydanaidal. [...] Selecting for these males provides the females with multiple benefits such as obtaining sperm packages with more defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloids which results in larger offspring. Offspring fathered by larger males are generally less vulnerable to predation because of their higher alkaloid content, allowing the offspring to have higher viability and fitness.|$|E

A <b>single</b> egg <b>clutch</b> may consist of 1000 to 7000 eggs, which may be attached to submerged vegetation.|$|R
50|$|The Pagani Huayra uses a seven-speed {{sequential}} gearbox and a <b>single</b> disc <b>clutch.</b> The choice {{not to use}} a dual-clutch in an {{oil bath}} {{was due to the}} increase in weight of over 70 kg, thus negating any advantage of the faster gear changes in a double-clutch transmission. As a result, the entire transmission weighs 96 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Engine clutch and gearbox {{were held}} {{as a unit}} at three points. There was a <b>single</b> plate <b>clutch,</b> its housing cast in one piece with the gearbox, a four-speed gearbox and an {{enclosed}} drive shaft taking power to the spiral bevel final drive. The gear lever, adjustable for reach, was positioned by the driver's right hand.|$|R
50|$|Macroelongatoolithus {{specimens}} {{are extremely}} variable in size, shape, and microstructure, even in eggs laid {{by a single}} individual. For example, within a <b>single</b> <b>clutch,</b> the egg lengths can vary by several centimeters. The high amount of variability is probably due to their large size.|$|E
50|$|Reproduction is seasonal. Testicular {{volume of}} males {{reaches a maximum}} during August to September (austral spring), and follicles of females become {{enlarged}} during August to December. Females lay a <b>single</b> <b>clutch</b> per annum, about 11 eggs on average, and larger females produce larger clutches than smaller females.|$|E
5000|$|Trumpeters nest {{in a hole}} in a tree or in {{the crown}} of a palm tree. They lay 2 to 5 eggs with rough, white shells, {{averaging}} about 76 g. [...] In the pale-winged trumpeter and the grey-winged trumpeter, groups of adults care for a <b>single</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Principal {{differences}} between the US and UK models included wheelbases and transmissions. Both versions were specified with the same standard 143½ in (3644.9 mm) wheelbase; the long-wheelbase U.S. model was 146½ in (3721.1 mm) and the UK 150½ (3822.7 mm). Both versions used a <b>single</b> dry-plate <b>clutch,</b> with US models equipped with a centre change 3-speed transmission and UK a 4-speed.|$|R
50|$|Transmission {{was through}} a <b>single</b> plate <b>clutch</b> to a {{separately}} mounted four speed gearbox. The rear axle was unconventional with the differential mounted {{ahead of the}} axle. The spiral bevel crown wheel and pinion arrangement had two crown wheels each attached to a half shaft allowing them to be arranged {{at an angle to}} each other to give the rear wheels a positive camber.|$|R
500|$|Mating {{occurs in}} May and June, and females lay <b>single</b> <b>clutches</b> {{of three to}} 30 eggs in June or July. According to field research, females deposit their eggs at the same nesting sites each year. The nests are built near each other as {{suitable}} nesting sites are becoming rare. On Cuba's Isla de la Juventud, Cuban iguanas nest in pockets of earth exposed to the sun by Cuban crocodiles, after the crocodiles' eggs have hatched. [...] These nests are separate from where adult iguanas live. In areas without crocodiles, the iguanas excavate nests in sandy beaches. At the San Diego Zoo, a female built a nest {{at the end of}} a long chamber she excavated in the sand. She stood near it for weeks, defending it by shaking her head and hissing at anyone who approached; this behavior demonstrated that Cuban iguanas guard their nest sites. The hatchlings spend several days to two weeks in the nest chamber from the time they hatch to the time they emerge from the nests; dispersing individually after emergence.|$|R
