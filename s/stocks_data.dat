30|$|For {{desirable}} and undesirable outputs, I used the real GRP (billion JPY) {{and the amount}} of CO 2 emissions associated with final energy consumption (thousand t-CO 2) consisting of the manufacturing, non-manufacturing, residential, and transportation sectors for the 46 prefectures, respectively. In economic theory, labor and private capital stock are important input factors for production activities. In addition, both buildings and roads emit CO 2 —the former as commercial buildings and factories in which production activities take place, and the latter via motor vehicle transportation activity—thereby impacting environmental efficiency. For the data on the accumulated quantity of buildings and roads, I make use of the estimates from Tanikawa et al. (2015). For the data on private capital stock, total number of workers, and real GRP, I use the R-JIP Database 2014 (Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry 2014). Real GRP and private capital stock are based on 2000 prices. Finally, data on CO 2 emissions associated with final energy consumption are obtained from data on the Energy Consumption Statistics (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy 2016). The study period covers the 17  years from 1992 to 2008. Monetary-base private capital <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> also include buildings such as factories and office buildings owned by companies. As such, it is possible that these will be double-counted in physical-base building data. However, data for facilities owned by private companies are included only in private capital <b>stock</b> <b>data,</b> and data for public facilities are included only in building-related accumulated resource <b>stock</b> <b>data.</b> Accordingly, {{it is not possible to}} analyze the environmental efficiency of urban production activities by taking only private capital stock into account. Given the difficulty in differentiating these factors, in this study, I treat the monetary-base private capital <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> and building-related physical-base accumulated resource <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> as separate items. Furthermore, to be able to analyze the environmental efficiency of production activities at the city but not the prefectural level, it is necessary to have more detailed production, CO 2 emission, and private capital <b>stock</b> <b>data</b> at the city level. Thus, I did not perform city-level analysis in this study because of the problems with data availability. These are limitations of the present study as well as challenges for future research.|$|R

We evaluate it on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate that our approach can directly find all groups of intermittently correlated time series without finding spurious groups unlike other alternative approaches that find many spurious groups.
