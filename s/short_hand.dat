25|$|The scapula is {{relatively}} straight and about {{six to seven}} times longer than wide; its upper end is missing. Its lower end is connected to a semicircular coracoid. The furcula is broad and more or less U-shaped with its two branches angled at 125°. The forelimb is rather long; its length is equal to 48% of the body length {{in front of the}} pelvis. Especially the hand is elongated as is typical for compsognathids; for a member of that group Scipionyx has a relatively <b>short</b> <b>hand,</b> however. The humerus is straight with a moderately developed deltopectoral crest. The ulna is slender and cylinder-shaped with a length of 70% of that of the humerus. The wrist consists of two elements only: a radial bone capping {{the lower end of the}} radius and a disc-shaped bone below it; this is either the enlarged first lower carpal or a perfect seamless fusion of the first and second lower carpal. The metacarpus is compact and moderately elongated. Its three elements mirror the shape of the fingers they bear: the first is the shortest en thickest; the second the longest; and the third is intermediate in length and thickness. The third finger is exceptionally long for a comspognathid, with 123% of thumb length. As the lower joint of the first metacarpal is bevelled, the thumb diverges medially. Its claw is no larger than that of the second finger. The hand claws are moderately curved.|$|E
2500|$|In response, Blount and Lenski {{acknowledge}} {{that the problem is}} not with the experiments or the data, but with the interpretations made by Van Hofwegen et al. and Maisnier-Patin and Roth. Lenski notes that the rapid evolution of Cit+ was not necessarily unexpected since his team was also able to produce multiple Cit+ mutants in a few weeks during the replay experiments they reported in the 2008 paper in which his team first described the evolution of aerobic citrate use in the LTEE. Furthermore, Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit+ as a [...] "speciation event" [...] by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said [...] "that becoming Cit+ was only a first step on the road to possible speciation", and thus did not propose that the Cit+ mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution. Lenski acknowledges that scientists, including him and his team, often use <b>short</b> <b>hand</b> and jargon when discussing speciation, instead of writing more carefully and precisely on the matter, and this can cause issues. However, he notes that speciation is generally considered by evolutionary biologists to be a process, and not an event. He also criticizes Van Hofwegen et al. and Roth and Maisnier-Patin for positing [...] "false dichotomies" [...] regarding the complex concept of historical contingency. He argues that historical contingency means that history matters, and that their 2008 paper presented data that showed that the evolution of Cit+ in the LTEE was contingent upon mutations that had accumulated earlier. He concludes that [...] "...historical contingency was invoked and demonstrated in a specific context, namely that of the emergence of Cit+ in the LTEE—it {{does not mean that the}} emergence of Cit+ is historically contingent in other experimental contexts, nor for that matter that other changes in the LTEE are historically contingent—in fact, some other evolved changes in the LTEE have been highly predictable and not (or at least not obviously) contingent on prior mutations in the populations." ...|$|E

I never could find that out. However, I suppose I did it myself when I was a stranger. But I will never do it again.|$|E

6000|$|In the fresco, No. 170, we {{have the}} {{representation}} of a river with papyrus on its bank. Here the water is rendered by zigzag lines arranged vertically and in parallel lines, so as to resemble herring-bone masonry, thus. There are fish in this fresco as in the preceding, and in both each fish is drawn very distinctly, not as it would appear to the eye viewed through water. The mode of representing this element in Egyptian painting is further abbreviated in their hieroglyphic writing, where the sign of water is a zigzag line; this line is, so to speak, a picture of water written in <b>short</b> <b>hand.</b> In the Egyptian Pantheon there was but one aquatic deity, {{the god of the}} Nile; his type is, therefore, the only figurative representation of water in Egyptian art. (Birch, [...] "Gallery of British Museum Antiquities," [...] Pl. 13.) In Assyrian sculpture we have very curious conventionally imitative representations of water. On several of the friezes from Nimroud and Khorsabad, men are seen crossing a river in boats, or in skins, accompanied by horses swimming (see Layard, ii. p. 381). In these scenes water is represented by masses of wavy lines somewhat resembling tresses of hair, and terminating in curls or volutes; these wavy lines express the general character of a deep and rapid current, like that of the Tigris. Fish are but sparingly introduced, the idea of surface being sufficiently expressed by the floating figures and boats. In the representation of these there is the same want of perspective as in the Egyptian fresco which we have just cited.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{a certain}} Day when our Party were out, some upon Foraging, {{and others to}} get Intelligence, I being alone in a Cottage with this old Captain, and being desirous to know his Opinion of the Affairs of Europe in general, as also what {{was like to be}} the Issue of that Cause we had undertaken. The old Captain willing to satisfy my Curiosity as far as his Skill would reach, pulled out some Remarks he had made upon the Year 1640. Observe, says he, Child what I say to you, 'tis a Maxim never to be {{neglected}} among Politicians to keep up Divisions in an Enemies Country; you may, perhaps, imagine that this will be a short Game that is a playing, but depend upon it my Grey Hairs will not see an end of it. I allow the King of France has declar'd himself a Friend to King James II; He is a very powerful Prince, and if he would turn his Forces this Way, and be upon the Defensive near Home, a few Months would bring the War to a Period. But that Monarch has things in his Head which I must not mention. There will be great Skirmishing in the Dominions of Great Britain, but no decisive Action if Lewis le Grand can hinder it. He takes Cardinal Richlieu's Conduct for a Precedent. It would have been no difficult Task for the French to have joyn'd their Forces with King Charles I. and have made a <b>short</b> <b>Hand</b> of that Contest between the King and Parliament; but that Politick Cardinal instead of this Method, had Emissaries in the English Cabinet to exaggerate Matters between them. The same Method has been observ'd by that Nation ever since; and if Lewis le Grand does not make a Politick Use of King James II. without doing him any real Service, I shall be very willing to correct my self, and cancel that Paragraph in my Observations.|$|E
