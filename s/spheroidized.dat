5000|$|Full annealing: Carbon {{steel is}} heated to {{approximately}} 40 °C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures all the ferrite transforms into austenite (although cementite might still exist if the carbon content {{is greater than}} the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20 °C (36 °F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the [...] "bands" [...] of pearlite are thick. Fully annealed steel is soft and ductile, with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only <b>spheroidized</b> steel is softer and more ductile.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stage}} of {{tempering}} occurs between room-temperature and 200 C. In the first stage, carbon precipitates into ε-carbon (Fe24C). In the second stage, occurring between 150 C and 300 C, the retained austenite transforms into a form of lower-bainite containing ε-carbon rather than cementite (archaically referred to as [...] "troostite"). The third stage occurs at 200 C and higher. In the third stage, ε-carbon precipitates into cementite, and the carbon content in the martensite decreases. If tempered at higher temperatures, between 650 C and 700 C, or for longer amounts of time, the martensite may become fully ferritic and the cementite may become coarser or spheroidize. In <b>spheroidized</b> steel, the cementite network breaks apart and recedes into rods or spherical shaped globules, and the steel becomes softer than annealed steel; nearly as soft as pure iron, making it very easy to form or machine.|$|E

The results obtained are as follows : (1) Uniformalization in form and dispersion of <b>spheroidized</b> cementite in low carbon steel is remarkably improved by forging at the temperature range from 550 ℃ to 650 ℃, but, <b>spheroidized</b> cementite in high carbon steel is coarsened by forging at the same temperature range. (2) When comparing the <b>spheroidized</b> cementite in forged material at the temperature range from 550 ℃ to 650 ℃ with <b>spheroidized</b> cementite in material as quenched, we know the former shortens spheroidizing time by 10 hours to 15 hours under the same heating temperature. (3) In order to make uniform the uniformalization in form and dispersion of <b>spheroidized</b> cementite in low carbon steel, it is advisable to do the forging at {{the first stage of}} tempering below A_ 1 transformation rather than within the austenite range (900 ℃∿ 800 ℃) ...|$|E
40|$|Cold forging {{is often}} {{applied in the}} {{fastener}} industry. Wires in coil form are used as semi-finished products {{for the production of}} billets. This process usually requires preliminarily drawing wire coil {{in order to reduce the}} diameter of products. The wire usually has to be annealed to improve its cold formability. The quality of spheroidizing annealed wire affects the forming quality of screws. In the fastener industry, most companies use a subcritical process for <b>spheroidized</b> annealing. Various parameters affect the <b>spheroidized</b> annealing quality of steel wire, such as the <b>spheroidized</b> annealing temperature, prolonged heating time, furnace cooling time and flow rate of nitrogen (protective atmosphere). The effects of the <b>spheroidized</b> annealing parameters affect the quality characteristics of steel wire, such as the tensile strength and hardness. A series of experimental tests on AISI 1022 low carbon steel wire are carried out and the Taguchi method is used to obtain optimum <b>spheroidized</b> annealing conditions to improve the mechanical properties of steel wires for cold forming. The results show that the <b>spheroidized</b> annealing temperature and prolonged heating time have the greatest effect on the mechanical properties of steel wires. A comparison between the results obtained using the optimum spheroidizing conditions and the measures using the original settings shows the new spheroidizing parameter settings effectively improve the performance measures over their value at the original settings.

In this work, a thermomechanical processing route consisting of two steps was developed for two ultrahigh carbon steels (UHCS) containing 1. 3 and 1. 5 %C. This route develops structures of fine <b>spheroidized</b> cementite particles in a fine-grained ferrite matrix. <b>Spheroidized</b> microstructures are formed by eutectoid carbide particles in the UHCS- 1. 3 C and by proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide particles in the UHCS- 1. 5 C.

In practice of foundry production <b>spheroidizing</b> master alloys based on ferrosilicon (Fe-Si-Mg type) and «heavy» alloying alloys on copper and nickel base are widespread. The urgent issue is to improve their efficiency by increasing the degree of magnesium assimilation, reduction of specific consumption of additives, and minimizing dust and gas emissions {{during the process of}} <b>spheroidizing</b> treatment of liquid iron. One method of solving this problem is the use of inoculants in a compact form in which the process of dissolution proceeds more efficiently. For example, rapidly quenched granules or «chip»-inoculants are interesting to apply. The aim of present work was to study the peculiarities of production and application of «Chips»-inoculants on copper and magnesium base with additions of yttrium oxide. The principle of mechatronics was used, including the briquetting inoculants’ components after their mixing with the subsequent high-speed mechanical impact and obtaining plates with a thickness of 1 – 2 mm. <b>Spheroidizing</b> treatment of molten metal has been produced by ladle method using «Chips»-inoculants in the amount of 0. 8 %. Secondary graphitization inoculation was not performed. Studies have shown that when the <b>spheroidizing</b> treatment of ductile iron was performed with inoculants developed, the process of interaction of magnesium with the liquid melt runs steadily without significant pyroeffect and emissions of metal outside of the ladle. This generates a structure of spheroidal graphite of regular shape (SGf 5).

The pearlites of specimen are <b>spheroidized</b> and dispersed uniformiy in the ferrite matrix by tempering.

40|$|Thermomechanical {{processing}} of ultrahigh-carbon steels allows {{the attainment of}} <b>spheroidized</b> and pearlitic microstructures that show very different mechanical properties. <b>Spheroidized</b> microstructures are formed by proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide particles embedded in a ferrite matrix. The mean proeutectoid carbide particle size {{is larger than the}} mean eutectoid carbide particle size and is practically invariable with austenitizing temperature below 850 °C. Pearlitic microstructures exhibit prior austenite grain sizes and pearlite colony sizes which increase and interlamellar spacings which decrease as the austenitizing temperature increases above 850 °C. A proeutectoid carbide size distribution that remains basically constant with austenitizing temperature is also observed in these microstructures. Plane-strain fracture toughness of <b>spheroidized</b> and pearlitic UHCS- 1. 5 C materials do not vary significantly with austenitizing temperature, being the average fracture toughness of about 40 MPa m 1 / 2 and 30 MPa m 1 / 2, respectively. The constancy of fracture toughness with austenitizing temperature of the <b>spheroidized</b> microstructures is attributed to the constancy of the mean proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide size. Austenite grain size, pearlite colony size, interlamellar spacing and undissolved proeutectoid carbide size are evaluated for the influence of fracture toughness associated with pearlitic microstructures. It is found that proeutectoid carbide is the microstructural parameter that controls fracture toughness of pearlitic microstructures.

Two groups of parent alloys were prepared using high purity materials, i. e., Group 1 containing the <b>spheroidizing</b> element of Ce, Mg or Ca, while in Group 2, S was added as an anti-spheroidizing element. For discussing the influence of the cooling rate on the graphite morphology, 0. 5 g of the Group 1 samples were melted and held for 15 minutes at 1673 K in an Ar atmosphere, then cooled at 1000 K/min or 20 K/min. The results showed that perfect spheroidal graphite could not be confirmed, while irregular graphite appeared. The atmosphere was changed to Ar+ 3 %H 2 for preventing the oxidation, and the holding time was reduced to 10 minutes to prevent fading of the <b>spheroidizing</b> element. These results showed that the formation of spheroidal graphite was confirmed at the cooling rate of 1000 K/min in both groups.
