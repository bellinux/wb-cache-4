By assuming that only the temperature in the rooms and the solar radiation can be measured, the approach consists in writing the rst-principle thermodynamics equations of the system and then, based on them, in developing a (black-box) ARMAX model. The model parameters are estimated by initially employing a standard method with a pseudo random <b>set-point</b> <b>signal</b> and then they are adapted by using a self-calibration method when the performance deteriorates. The selection of the user de ned parameters in the overall procedure is thoroughly discussed by means of simulation results and experimental results are also shown in order to highlight the practical e ectiveness of the methodology...|$|E
40|$|The torque {{coordination}} control during mode {{transition is}} a very important task for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a clutch serving as the key enabling actuator element. Poor coordination will deteriorate the drivability of the driver and lead to excessive wearing to the clutch friction plates. In this paper, a novel torque coordination control strategy for a single-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle is presented to coordinate the motor torque, engine torque, and clutch torque so that the seamless mode switching can be achieved. Different to the existing model predictive control (MPC) methods, only one model predictive controller is needed and the clutch torque is taken as an optimized variable rather than a known parameter. Furthermore, the successful idea of model reference control (MRC) is also used for reference to generate the <b>set-point</b> <b>signal</b> required by MPC. The parameter sensitivity is studied for better performance of the proposed model predictive controller. The simulation results validate that the proposed novel torque coordination control strategy has less vehicle jerk, less torque interruption, and smaller clutch frictional losses, compared with the baseline method. In addition, the sensitivity and adaptiveness of the proposed novel torque coordination control strategy are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Thruster and {{propeller}} devices {{may be of}} {{the type}} controllable pitch propeller (CPP) with fixed speed, controllable speed with fixed pitch propeller (FPP), or controllable pitch and speed in combination. In conventional positioning systems the final thruster pitch or speed <b>set-point</b> <b>signals</b> are determined from stationary propeller-force-to-speed/pitch relations {{based on data from}} the propeller manufacturer. However, these relations are strongly influenced by the local water flow around the propeller blades subject to hull design, operational philosophy, vessel motion, waves and water current. In this paper a method based on torque control and power control of the propeller and thruster devices is presented. Instead of calculating the propeller speed and pitch <b>set-point</b> <b>signals</b> based on stationary functions, the propeller-force-to-moment and-power relations are used. Power and torque control in combination gives a significant improvement in the performance and the stability of the electrical power plant network, while the positioning accuracy and bandwidth are improved as well...|$|R
40|$|A new {{constrained}} {{control strategy}} for a solar furnace is proposed {{in this paper}} {{with the goal of}} attaining a minimum- time transition between two values of the temperature subject to constraints on both the saturation and slew rate level of the process input. In the case of <b>set-point</b> step-shape <b>signals,</b> the strategy basically consists in implementing a (model-based) feedforward control law with maximum positive and negative velocity phases in order to obtain a minimum-time transition with no overshoot. In the case of ramp-shape <b>set-point</b> <b>signals</b> (addressing the output slew-rate constraint), the suitable feedforward control law is obtained by also inverting the dynamics of the system. Implementation issues are discussed. Simulation and real experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology...|$|R

40|$|Object {{recognition}} {{through the}} use of input from multiple sensors is an important aspect of an autonomous manipula-tion system. In tactile object recognition, it is necessary to determine the location and orientation of object edges and surfaces. We propose a controller that utilizes a tactile sensor in the feedback loop of a manipulator to track edges in real time. In our control system, the data from the tactile sensor is processed in two stages to determine the location of edges. The first stage involves adaptive thresholding of tactile images. This thresholded image is used to detect edges. In the second stage, we use a combination of weighted least squares and the Modified Adaptive Hough Transform to choose the edge to be tracked from the multiple edges present in the tactile image. The parameters of these edges are then used to generate a <b>set-point</b> <b>signal</b> to drive the manipulator. In our implementation, we use a Hybrid controller that uses both position and force set points. The edge tracker, pre-sented in this article, has been implemented on the CMU DD Arm II system. While the signal processing and the control computation require 30 ms, the tactile images are transferred from the sensor to the computer every 240 ms. Consequently, the acquisition of tactile images limits the sampling rate to 4. 2 Hz. In this article, we describe both the theory and exper-imental implementation of tactile edge detection and an edge tracking controller...|$|E
40|$|Conducting polymer {{actuators}} such as polypyrrole {{can generate}} stresses over 10 {{times larger than}} skeletal muscle and have typical repeatable strains between 1 % and 12 %, making them potential candidates for lightweight, low-cost, robotic applications. Polypyrrole linear actuators under closed loop control have not been previously reported. Here we report the open and closed loop performance of polypyrrole linear contractile actuators evaluated at pre-loaded stresses of 1 MPa to 3 MPa. A standard PI control scheme driving a potentiostat was implemented in conjunction with positioning feedback from a DC/DC linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). A dynamic positioning range of 3400 is reported, with a positioning resolution of 125 nm (0. 001 % strain) and a maximum repeatable displacement of 427 microns (3. 6 % strain). The open loop frequency response of actuator strain shows characteristics of a first-order low pass filter with a log gain versus log frequency slope near - 1 for frequencies tested between 0. 05 Hz to 2 Hz. The closed loop frequency response of actuator strain when tracking a sinusoidal <b>set-point</b> <b>signal</b> of 0. 5 % strain shows characteristics of a first order system with one zero, with a corner frequency near 0. 08 Hz and an operating bandwidth up to 1 Hz. Step responses at various controller output maximum voltages show a reduction in contractile response times {{by a factor of}} four, where higher voltages yield faster contractile responses.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{the share of}} {{electricity}} production from wind power plants has increased to significant levels in several power systems across Europe and the United States. In order {{to cope with the}} fluctuating and partially unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources, transmission system operators (TSOs) have responded by increasing their reserve capacity requirements and by requiring wind power plants to be capable of providing reserves or following active power <b>set-point</b> <b>signals.</b> This paper addresses the issue of efficiently incorporating these new types of wind power control in the day-ahead operational planning. We review the technical requirements the wind power plants must fulfill, and propose a mathematical framework for modeling wind power control. The framework is based on an optimal power flow formulation with weighted chance constraints, which accounts for the uncertainty of wind power forecasts and allows us to limit the risk of constraint violations. In a case study based on the IEEE 118 bus system, we use the developed method to assess the effectiveness of different types of wind power control in terms of operational cost, system security and wind power curtailment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{automatic}} tuning technique for multiloop PID controllers applied to MIMO processes. The process parameters are estimated by employing simple closed-loop experiments (where roughly tuned PID controllers are in place), namely, by evaluating the response of the system to a sequence of <b>set-point</b> step <b>signals</b> (one for each reference input). Once the process transfer function is obtained, a (IMC-based) PID tuning rule already proposed in the literature is then applied to suitably re-design the PID controllers. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the methodology and to show its effectiveness...|$|R

PID controller {{is widely used}} in industry due to their simplicity and easy to tuning. For controller tuning, the PID parameters are tuned by any conventional method in order to assure a good reference signal to the closed loop system is obtained by filtering appropriately the <b>set-point</b> step <b>signal.</b> This study is conducted to get the optimum PID controller parameters (,,cIDKÏ„Ï„) for first order process model. Two well known methods; Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) method and Cohen-Coon (C-C) are used to tune controller. Both methods are compared to get the optimum condition for the process model with one-quarter decay ratio at minimum settling time and minimum largest error. The responses for both methods are analyzed using Simulink in MATLAB software. Block diagram for the process model with controllers was created for simulation process. Kc= 16. 667, IÏ„ = 6. 283 and DÏ„ = 1. 571 are optimum parameters setting for Ziegler-Nichols method and the minimum largest error as 0. 582 and minimum settling time equal with 11. 8 s in sample 11. For Cohen-Coon method, Kc= 14. 703, IÏ„ = 3. 622 and DÏ„ = 0. 541 are optimum parameters setting.

40|$|Potentiation of serotonergic {{transmission}} increases cognitive flexibility, but can {{in other}} circumstances increase sensitivity to stressful environmental cues. The personality trait Openness to Experience reflects {{and is also}} {{associated with an increased}} risk for mood disorders. We hypothesized that the personality trait has an association with a biomarker of serotonergic transmission, the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (5 -HTT). In 50 healthy volunteers, we tested for correlations between scores on the NEO-PI-R scale Openness to Experience and its subscales, and cerebral binding of the 5 -HTT selective PET radioligand [11 C]DASB. Subjects were genotyped for the 5 -HTT long/short polymorphism, and for a single nucleotide polymorphism in the long allele, designated LA/LG. Midbrain [11 C]DASB binding correlated negatively with scores for Openness to Experience and its two subscales, Openness to Actions and Openness to Values. The latter subscore was negatively correlated with [11 C]DASB binding in all brain regions in which [11 C]DASB binding was quantified. Genetic analysis showed that homozygote LA carriers had significantly higher [11 C]DASB binding in the caudate nucleus, but no significant differences in openness scores. Thus, high scores in personality facets indicative of cognitive flexibility and openness to change are associated with lower [11 C]DASB binding. Lower abundance of 5 -HTT sites may result in potentiation of serotonergic signaling, which occurs during treatment with SSRIs. We speculate that the <b>set-point</b> of serotonergic <b>signaling</b> in an individual represents a trade-off between flexibility and vulnerability when exposed to environmental stress...|$|R
