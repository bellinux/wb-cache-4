The winds caused some minor roof damage to buildings, and forced officials in New York City to cordon off parts of Manhattan as debris ranging from wrapping paper to crushed <b>soda</b> <b>cans</b> was blown about. This debris injured four people, one critically, and disrupted a 9/11 memorial service, though it continued as planned.|$|E

25|$|On September 1, 1978, {{there were}} three {{separate}} explosions from improvised explosive devices placed in trash bins around the town. The damage was minor, {{and no one was}} injured. Speedway authorities called on explosive experts from the Indiana State Police, Marion County Sheriff's Department, 64th Ordnance from nearby Fort Benjamin Harrison and specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. They formed a 100-strong taskforce to solve the case. The devices were simple homemade bombs constructed from <b>soda</b> <b>cans</b> packed with Tovex 200 and triggered with a rudimentary timing device. The following Saturday, two more blasts hit Speedway with another the day after at the local bowling alley. The next day, a device exploded under the car of an off duty Speedway police officer, who was on sick leave at the time and was not injured.|$|E
500|$|Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith, called the episode {{one of her}} {{favorites}} to shoot because she [...] "was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Rashida Jones, Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days." [...] Fischer agreed, calling it a [...] "fun episode to shoot" [...] due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women. Believing Meredith's minivan was [...] "another character" [...] in the series, Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously. In {{a reflection of the}} character's personality, the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol, chips, crushed <b>soda</b> <b>cans,</b> garbage, and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle. The cast however soon developed headaches, leading to the air fresheners' removal. Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode, explaining that she [...] "was nervous at first, but I think I really could be a demolition-derby star." ...|$|E
500|$|Three months later, Meg {{returns home}} with the mind and {{attitude}} of a hardened criminal, complete with a new thuggish and rebellious look. She immediately begins abusing her family, retaliating to the many years of abuse she had endured under them, such as curb-stomping Peter, raping him in the shower with a loofah, and using her mother's shirts as toilet paper (while also keeping a [...] "poop bucket" [...] next to her bed and refusing to empty it until it gets full). In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make fun of her at school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full <b>soda</b> <b>cans</b> which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended. Wanting {{to start a new life}} away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and threatens him with a gun to drive to Mort's Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than the typical American girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably not amused at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E

2500|$|The camera obscura {{principle}} {{is not limited}} to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, <b>soda</b> <b>cans,</b> cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room. [...] Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition into the rain forest of Costa Rica where he climbed into the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk. [...] This sort of experience is available across time.|$|E

She was naked and had been bound with both rope and a Venetian blind cord. She was placed in a fetal position with her hands pressed together. The body was then wrapped in a garbage bag and placed inside the cooler, which was filled with unopened <b>soda</b> <b>cans</b> and water (which was presumably ice at one time). Examiners concluded that [...] "Baby Hope" [...] was possibly Hispanic, had dark, wavy hair in a ponytail, was malnourished, weighing only , was a victim of sexual abuse, and had died on-or-about July 18.

Thor, Silver Surfer, and Hulk had to team up with Doctor Strange and Valkyrie to stop him even gaining some help from Doctor Doom and MODOK. Doctor Strange managed to trick Mordo back into the Dark Dimension and free Iron Man from his control.|$|R
