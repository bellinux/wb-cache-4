5|$|Following {{the death}} of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx {{developed}} a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a <b>stateless</b> <b>person.</b> Family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a <b>stateless</b> <b>person</b> was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a temporary protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E
5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a <b>stateless</b> <b>person,</b> but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{deportation}} order, the British government {{found that}} it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since World War II, the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced {{that he would not be}} allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a <b>stateless</b> <b>person,</b> and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.|$|E
25|$|Grothendieck {{was born}} in Weimar Germany. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his {{nationality}} were destroyed {{in the fall of}} Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. He thus became a <b>stateless</b> <b>person</b> for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a Nansen passport. Part of this reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the Algerian War (1954–62). He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, well past the age that exempted him from military service.|$|E
40|$|A {{new report}} {{published}} {{today by the}} European Network on Statelessness and aditus foundation {{on the use of}} detention of <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> in Malta, reveals that the widespread use of administrative detention has a severe impact on <b>stateless</b> <b>persons.</b> The absence of procedures to identify and recognize statelessness results in detention that in many cases is not in conformity with Malta’s human rights obligations. Furthermore, <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> are unable to receive any form of legal and social protection since their status remains largely unidentified. The report is nonetheless optimistic that up-coming changes to Malta’s detention regime, as also possible steps towards the 1954 Stateless Convention, could result in dramatic changes to the way <b>stateless</b> <b>persons</b> are treated.

25|$|Sidney (or Sydney) Stanley (né Solomon Wulkan, alias Solomon Koszyski, alias Stanley Rechtand, later Schlomo ben Chaim) (1899/1905 – 1969) was a Polish émigré to the UK {{who became}} a dubious {{businessman}} of precarious ethics before claiming to be a contact man, able to influence politicians and civil servants in return for cash bribes, claims {{that led to a}} great scandal and investigation by the Lynskey tribunal of 1948. There is also evidence that Stanley spied against the UK for the armed nationalist activist Irgun organisation. Stanley was ordered deported, but had lost his Polish nationality, and as a result was a <b>stateless</b> <b>person.</b> Stanley was then placed under heavy restrictions and police surveillance. In 1949, he evaded police and fled to France and thence to Israel, where he was granted citizenship through right-of-return. There he lived out the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.|$|E
500|$|Ahmed Al-Kateb {{was born}} in Kuwait in 1976, the son of Palestinian parents. Kuwait's Nationality Law {{is based on the}} {{citizenship}} of the parents, jus sanguinis, (Article 2) and does not provide for citizenship based on place of birth, jus soli, except in the case of foundlings (Article 3). For this reason Al-Kateb did not acquire Kuwaiti citizenship at birth, and was thus considered a <b>stateless</b> <b>person.</b> Al-Kateb left his country of birth after Kuwaiti authorities pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. In December 2000, Al-Kateb, travelling by boat, arrived [...] in Australia without a visa or passport, and was taken into immigration detention under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958.|$|E
