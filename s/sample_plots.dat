30|$|Within each site, 30 center {{points were}} located along transects running {{perpendicular}} to the long axis of each site. Four circular <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> (0.89 m 2 each) were established at 90 ° angles 7.1 meters around each center point, two along each transect {{and the other two}} {{perpendicular to the}} transects. For each sampling year (1972, 1974, 1980, 2003, 2004), two <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> were randomly selected for sampling. Midsummer of each sampling year, the herbaceous stems within the selected <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> were identified to species, counted, clipped and dried to determine biomass production. The mean of the two <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> was used in the analyses. In the earlier published manuscripts (Oswald and Covington 1983, Oswald and Covington 1984), Analysis of Variance (p= 0.05) was used to test the effect of passage of time (1972 to 1980) and severity of burn on biomass production. The Student-Newman-Kuels Multiple Range test was used to test differences. The relatively large number of N’s within each site allowed for statistical analysis even though treatments (burn severities) were not replicated.|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{the sample}} {{autocorrelation}} and partial autocorrelation functions are random variables {{and do not}} give the same picture as the theoretical functions. This makes the model identification more difficult. In particular, mixed models can be particularly difficult to identify.

Forty nine lianas have also been recorded. Twelve of these plants species have been redlisted and about 28 species of them are endemic to Western Ghats. Out of the 19 <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> Gymnacranthera farquhariana was dominant in 10 plots. Myristica fatua was the dominant tree in 6 swamps. In the remaining plots, Vateria indica was the dominant tree. Holigarna arnottiana and Lophopetalum wightianum dominated in another two plots.|$|E

50|$|The Variance/Mean ratio method focuses {{mainly on}} {{determining}} whether a species fits a randomly spaced distribution, but {{can also be used}} as evidence for either an even or clumped distribution. To utilize the Variance/Mean ratio method, data is collected from several random samples of a given population. In this analysis, it is imperative that data from at least 50 <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> is considered. The number of individuals present in each sample is compared to the expected counts in the case of random distribution. The expected distribution can be found using Poisson distribution. If the variance/mean ratio is equal to 1, the population is found to be randomly distributed. If it is significantly greater than 1, the population is found to be clumped distribution. Finally, if the ratio is significantly less than 1, the population is found to be evenly distributed. Typical statistical tests used to find the significance of the variance/mean ratio include Student's t-test and chi squared.|$|E
5000|$|Because the [...] or [...] {{terms in}} the Gran {{functions}} only asymptotically tend toward, and never reach, the x axis, curvature approaching the equivalence point {{is to be expected}} in all cases. However, there is disagreement among practitioners as to which data to plot, whether using only data on one side of equivalence or on both sides, and whether to select data nearest equivalence or in the most linear portions: using the data nearest the equivalence point will enable the two x-intercepts to be more coincident with each other and to better coincide with estimates from derivative plots, while using acid-side data in an acid-base titration presumably minimizes interference from titratable (buffering) impurities, such as bicarbonate/carbonate in the base (see Carbonate content), and the effect of a drifting ionic strength. In the <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> displayed in the Figures, the most linear regions (the data represented by filled circles) were selected for the least-squares computations of slopes and intercepts.

30|$|The {{precision}} of the <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> measurements {{in describing the}} forest stand can be measured using the standard errors of the estimators of given forest characteristics, which depends, in part, on the spatial variation {{of the characteristics of}} interest within the forest.

5000|$|CCF is an {{approach}} to forest management which respects the characteristics and processes inherent to the site, and will normally involve a mixture of tree species and ages. In French, it {{is referred to as}} sylviculture irrégulière, continue et proche de la nature (SICPN) (i.e., continuous, irregular and close to nature silviculture), and in German as Dauerwald, or naturgemässe waldwirtschaft (close to nature forestry). [...] Management is based on the selection and promotion of individual trees, of all sizes, rather than the creation of areas with trees of uniform size. Any monitoring of the development of irregular stand structures will be achieved through periodic re-measurement of stem diameters in <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> or across whole stands. Repeated interventions, typically at intervals of between 3 and 7 years, focus on the removal of trees which are interfering with the growth of trees with greater potential, the harvesting of crop trees at their optimum size, and the promotion of regeneration and small trees, such that an irregular stand structure is maintained in perpetuity.|$|E
5000|$|De Vasselot's {{appointment}} as Superintendent of Woods and Forests followed in 1880. This {{was the first}} time that a professional forester had been put in charge and was a turning point in South African forestry. For the first time the authorities were persuaded that a sound silvicultural policy was of greater importance than the revenue derived from exploitation. The details of the new management system were spelled out in the Forest Regulation of 1883. When de Vasselot left the Cape in 1891, the forests of George, Knysna and the Tsitsikamma were being managed on a scientific basis. Two important publications by de Vasselot in 1885 were an [...] "Introduction to the Systematic Treatment of the Crown Forests of the Cape Colony" [...] and a pamphlet on [...] "Selection and Seasoning of Wood", both translated into English by the then Conservator of Transkeian Forests, A. W. Heywood. In 1898 Heywood was succeeded by Colin MacNaughton as Conservator at Knysna,where he marked out the first permanent <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in the forests to study indigenous tree communities, laying a valuable foundation for research into forest ecosystems. [...] McNaughton strongly believed that the ‘forests must be worked in the interests of the country, and not in the interests of the immediate population’. That is, trees should be considered a national resource, and not relevant to the livelihood of communities who exploited the forest.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of tests of 3 logging systems in Alberta, Brace (1990) affirmed that {{significant}} amounts of understorey can be retained using any of those systems provided that sufficient effort is directed towards protection. Potential benefits would include increased short-term softwood timber supply, improved wildlife habitat and cutblock aesthetics, as well as reduced public criticism of previous logging practices. Stewart et al. (2001) developed statistical models to predict the natural establishment and height growth of understorey white spruce in the boreal mixedwood forest in Alberta using data from 148 permanent <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and supplementary information about height growth of white spruce regeneration and the amount and type of available substrate. A discriminant model correctly classified 73% of the sites as to {{presence or absence of}} a white spruce understorey, based on the amount of spruce basal area, rotten wood, ecological nutrient regime, soil clay fraction, and elevation, although it explained only 30% of the variation in the data. On sites with a white spruce understorey, a regression model related the abundance of regeneration to rotten wood cover, spruce basal area, pine basal area, soil clay fraction, and grass cover (R² = 0.36). About half the seedlings surveyed grew on rotten wood, and only 3% on mineral soil, and seedlings were 10 {{times more likely to have}} established on these substrates than on litter. Exposed mineral soil covered only 0.3% of the observed transect area.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} if the vegetative composition of burned sites differed from unburned sites, we compared species richness and density of functional groups at each burned site with data from a paired unburned site. We paired data from the Chavez Fire site with data collected at vegetation <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> at the same site measured in 2000 and 2001 prior to the fire in 2002. We did not collect data at the other sites prior to burning, so we used data collected for another study (Finch et al. 2006) at unburned <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> for burned-unburned site comparisons. Because we used data from unburned <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> opportunistically, we lacked true “control” sites needed to infer effects of fire on riparian vegetation. Instead, we compared composition of burned and unburned sites during {{the period in which}} data were collected. We collected unburned <b>sampling</b> <b>plot</b> data between 2000 and 2004 (Table 1). We assumed that vegetation composition of unburned <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> was similar to that of paired wildfire plots prior to burning because unburned plots were located {{on the same side of}} the river and were no more than 5 km from paired wildfire sites. We did not measure vegetation composition of burned and comparison plots during the same years (Table 1). This should not be a confounding factor in comparisons of burned and unburned community composition because most vegetation mortality and resprouting occurred during the year of each fire (D.M. Smith, University of Oklahoma, personal observation), mortality of mature vegetation is low, and seedling regeneration rarely occurs within the forest (Howe and Knopf 1991, Molles et al. 1998).|$|R

The greatest number of samples exceeds 10, 000 (Inner Mongolia 17, 951, Hebei 11, 709, Anhui 11, 678, Henan 10, 358, and Sichuan 10, 007).

30|$|Woody {{cover in}} the KNP {{has been shown to}} vary {{depending}} on topographic position, with the valleys having more woody cover (Gertenbach 1983). The topographic location of the field <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> was, therefore, purposefully varied in order to represent woody cover in valley, crest and mid-slope positions. Therefore, purposive sampling was employed in the field, with the goal of representing these topographic positions in the sample data. The overall layout of the <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> at each of the study sites approximated linear transects. Logistics and the time-consuming nature of the field work limited the total number of <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and necessitated separate fieldwork excursions to the study sites during 2013 and 2014.

The system dynamics cannot be recovered from the global or local controls alone. Ground forest inventory is able to accurately estimate forest carbon stocks at <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> but these <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> are too sparse to support the spatial simulation of carbon stocks with required accuracy. Satellite observation is an important source of global information for the simulation of carbon stocks. Satellite remote-sensing can supply spatially continuous information about the surface of forest carbon stocks, which is impossible from ground-based investigations, but their description has considerable uncertainty. In this paper, we validated the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ), the Kriging method for spatial interpolation of ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and a satellite-observation-based approach as well as an approach for fusing the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with satellite observations and an assimilation method for incorporating the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> into LPJ.
