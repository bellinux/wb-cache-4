40|$|Background: This {{thesis is}} was {{designed}} to evaluate aspects of {{reliability and validity of}} the School Version of the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (School AMPS) (Fisher, Bryze, Hume, & Griswold, 2007), an observation-based evaluation of quality of occupational performance when children perform schoolwork tasks in school settings. The long term goal was to contribute to knowledge about children at risk or with mild disabilities who experience difficulties with occupational performance in school settings, and describe how the School AMPS can be used when a true top−down process of planning and implementing school-based occupational therapy services is implemented in a Swedish context. Methods: In Study I, two different <b>split-half</b> <b>methods</b> and were used to estimate reliability of the School AMPS measures. These were cross-validated using Rasch equivalent of Cronbach’s alpha. The standard error of measurement (m) was also calculated. In Studies II and III, many-facet Rasch analyses and/or relevant inferential statistics (e. g., ANOVA, tests) were used to examine for evidence of validity based on (1) internal structure related to differential item functioning (DIF), (2) relations to other variables (sensitivity) in terms of comparing groups (typically-developing children vs. children with mild disabilities), and (3) consequences of testing (benefits of testing) in terms of test fairness. In Study IV, ANOVA and tests were used to examine relations to other variables in terms of sensitivity of the School AMPS measures for detecting change based on repeated School AMPS evaluations pre- and post-interventions. Results: The three methods for estimating reliability of the School AMPS measures yielded high reliability coefficient estimates (≥ 0. 73) and low ms. Minimal DIF was identified, and despite minimal DIF, the School AMPS measures were found to be free of differential test functioning. The School AMPS measures were sensitive enough to detect differences between groups as well as changes following consultative occupational therapy services provided in natural school settings. Conclusions: The results support {{the reliability and validity of}} the School AMPS scales and measures when used to evaluate quality of occupational performance in school settings. The results are also of clinical importance as they provide evidence that occupational therapists can have confidence in the School AMPS measures when they are used in the process of making decisions about individual students, planning interventions, and later perform follow-up evaluations to measure the outcomes. We also have objective evidence that children with mild disabilities demonstrate diminished quality of "doing" when performing schoolwork tasks. The potential long term benefits of such evidence may be to support or justify the need for children with mild disabilities to receive occupational therapy services within school settings in Sweden; and through collaboration with teachers, plan and implement better targeted and more effective interventions...|$|R

The items of IIT were developed with the help of material obtained from own culture and were constructed in simple English language. The IIT comprises of six sub-scales: Vocabulary, Arithmetic, Analogy, Information, Comprehension, and Similarity. The test was planned to measure various aspects of intelligence verbal ability, to understand concepts, general reasoning factor, element of discovery, acquired knowledge, social intelligence, eduction of relations and correlates. The usefulness of the items was judged through item analysis by administering the test to a sample of 200 subjects with minimum Intermediate qualification. Items were evaluated by considering two main aspects; discrimination power and difficulty level. Items with discriminatory power less than. 30 and level of difficulty below. 30 and above. 70 were discarded. The final draft of the test comprised of 71 items Vocabulary and Arithmetic sub-scales consists of 12 items each, Analogy 14, Information 11, Comprehension 12 and Similarity 10. In the main study the test was administered to 1669 students both male and female, belonging to various Government Colleges & universities of four provinces of the country including AJK and FATA.

Two methods were used to establish reliability of the test i. e., KR 20 and <b>Split-half</b> <b>methods.</b> The estimated indices of reliability were,. 79 and. 69 respectively. To determine validity of indigenous intelligence test different validity criteria were used including urban/rural differences, province wise differences, correlation of the total test and sub-scales (construct validity) and marks in last qualified examination to determine concurrent validity Significant differences in the mean scores of the male and female candidates on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy and information were found whereas non significant difference was observed on comprehension and similarity subscales. Significant mean differences on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy and information and non significant difference on comprehension and similarity were also found. Inter-correlation among the subscales and IIT were calculated to determine construct validity of the test. The concurrent validity was determined by correlating scores on IIT with the college marks obtained by each student in the last annual examination. Both indices established the evidence of high validity of the test. Significant differences in urban/rural mean scores on vocabulary, analogy, information, comprehension subscales and IIT were observed.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 51 - 53 The goal of {{this study}} was to develop and pilot a model of a test based on course objectives that could be used for both a proficiency test and an achievement test for Erciyes University Preparatory School (EUPS) and that could be demonstrated to have reasonable reliability and validity. Only general English and reading skills were included in this pilot study. This newly developed model test, the Erciyes University Proficiency/Final Achievement Test (EUPFAT, or PAT, for short), consisted of 64 open-ended items such as short-answer, sentence completion, interrogatives, and rational cloze as recommended by a number of researchers (e. g., Heaton, 1988; Hill and Parry, 1992). No multiple-choice items were included as it has been suggested that they can produce negative backwash (Hughes, 1989). Twenty-two items testing general English skills and 42 items testing reading comprehension were included. There were 35 intermediate-level English as a Foreign Language students attending the prep school who volunteered to pilot the PAT. Of these 35 subjects, 30 also took the English as a Second Language Achievement Test (ESLAT) (1984), which was one of two criteria for estimating validity of the PAT. Teachers' evaluations of the 35 subjects who took the PAT were also used, as the second criterion. Following piloting, the PAT was scored independently by two scorers using an answer key prepared by the researcher. Inter-rater reliability was. 99. The PAT was then evaluated for reliability and validity. Item analysis was also performed to identify items that should be replaced or rewritten for future administration of the tests. For internal consistency, the split-half reliability estimate of Pearson Product-Moment Correlation adjusted for length by Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formula, the Guttman split-half reliability estimate, the K-R 20, and the K-R 21 reliability formulas were used. The reliability coefficients estimated for internal consistency using these different <b>split-half</b> <b>methods</b> ranged from. 87 to. 96. The descriptive statistics of the PAT are as follows: N = 35, Mean = 29. 86, Variance = 110. 89, Standard Deviation = 10. 53, Sum of Item Variance = 11. 93. To determine the correlation between the PAT and the ESLAT, and between the PAT and the teacher evaluations, Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) was used. PPMC between the PAT and the ESLAT is. 61, df = 28, p<. 0004, and the correlation between the PAT and the teacher evaluation of subjects is. 74, df = 33, p =. 0000. Item analysis of the PAT has demonstrated that if the 19 of 64 items which are lying outside the acceptable range for item difficulty and discriminability are eliminated from the test, the rest of the test items can be used as part of a proficiency/final achievement test. Because the total number of subjects in this study was not very high (N = 35), generalizing the results to other EFL situations should be avoided. However, the results of this study should be taken into consideration while developing a new test, or evaluating existing tests by those who are interested or involved in language testing.

30|$|Cronbach’s alpha, {{a measure}} of {{internal}} consistency (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) was then performed. It describes {{the extent to which}} all the items in a test measure the same concept or construct, and hence, it is connected to the inter-relatedness of the items within the test (Tavakol and Dennick, 2011). Internal consistency reveals the extent to which items on a particular test are measuring the same attribute. Internal consistency can be measured through the split-half reliability index (Wong et al., 2012) and Cronbach’s alpha (Cronbach, 1951). Out of all the internal consistency measures, Cronbach’s alpha is the most widely used and is the most suitable (De Vaus, 2002) and provides the most thorough analysis of patterns of internal consistency. Alpha is preferable to the <b>split-half</b> <b>method</b> because it does not rely on just one split-half coefficient but on all the possible combinations of splits (De Vaus, 2002). Alpha is most appropriately used when the items measure different substantive areas within a single construct (Manerikar and Manerikar, 2015). In this study, home literacy environment is a single construct with five dimensions as the different substantive areas. According to Field (2009), if an instrument has subscales, then internal consistency measure should be applied separately to the subscales.|$|E
40|$|Current {{practices}} recommend {{placing a}} self-rated health question before specific health items in survey questionnaires to minimize potential order effects. Because this recommendation {{is based on}} data collected in English, its applicability to other languages is unknown. This study examines {{whether there is an}} order effect associated with self-rated health for interviews conducted in English and Spanish languages. An experiment was conducted by using the 2007 California Health Interview Survey, where questions on self-rated health were inserted in 1 of 2 locations: preceding and following question items on specific chronic conditions. Respondents were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 versions of the locations by the <b>split-half</b> <b>method.</b> Although no order effect was present in the English interviews, the authors found a significant and large effect with Spanish interviews: Self-rated health appeared much worse when asked before chronic conditions than when asked after them. This order effect was larger among females than males. Order effects for self-rated health differ by interview language; inferences about the health status of Spanish-speaking populations (and potentially Latinos) depend on question order. If maintaining comparability is important, the authors’ finding contradicts current recommendations, as inserting the self-rated health question before specific questions led to larger differences in health status between English and Spanish speakers...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{concept of}} Internet Addiction (IA) had been widely debated, and the reliabilities and validities of the IA {{instruments}} in Japan were not reported. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the validity and reliability of the existing measurements and to empirically compare the psychometric properties of the three IA instruments developed from 1990 's to 2010 's by proposing the conceptual model of IA in Japanese population. The three scales were Japanese Internet Addiction Test (JIAT), Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS), and General Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS 2). Procedure: CIUS and GPIUS 2 were translated into Japanese utilizing forward-back translations procedures. Subsequently, both translated scales and JIAT were used for the survey. 623 respondents were successfully recruited. Results: All three scales demonstrated excellent internal consistency of a=. 924 -. 943, acceptable construct validity, good concurrent validity, and clear discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were tested with cross-validation <b>split-half</b> sampling <b>method.</b> Extracted factors were stable across gender. Both JIAT and CIUS yielded a clear three factor solutions, and GPIUS 2 yielded two equivalent structures, indicating four and five factors solution. Correlations among the factors demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity with similar constructs. Conclusions: CIUS and GPIUS 2 were successfully translated in to Japanese version, where the development process of the scales along with their reliability and validity were reported in details. JIAT is recommended for clinical diagnosis purpose that works well on young people. CIUS is recommended for both clinical diagnosis and population screening purpose. GPIUS 2 is recommended to use along with JIAT and CIUS to clarify concepts. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(保健学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 医学系研究科健康科学・看護学専...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} fifteen items were {{initially}} constructed {{on the basis}} of promoting thinking rather than memorization and differentiate the well-known target people from the poorly known ones in relation to knowledge of health status. The scores from samples respondents were subjected to item analysis, comprising of item difficulty index and item-discrimination. The scores from subjects were computed for item analysis comprising of item difficulty and item discrimination index. Forty-seven items with difficulty index ranging from 30 % – 80 % and discrimination index ranging from 0. 33 to 0. 55 were included in the final format of the knowledge test. The reliability of the knowledge test was found to be 0. 896 and 0. 899 in <b>split–half</b> and test–retest <b>methods</b> respectively which was quite satisfactory (P< 0. 01). Hence the knowledge test constructed was highly stable and dependable for measurement.

40|$|Objective: In the {{literature}} {{there is no}} validated instrument for the clinical evaluation of the orofacial myofunctional condition of children that will permit the examiner to express numerically his perception of the characteristics and behaviors observed. The proposal {{of this study is}} to describe a protocol for the evaluation of children aged 6 - 12 years in order to establish relations between the orofacial. myofunctional conditions and numerical scales. The protocol validity, reliability of the examiners and agreement between them was analyzed. Methods: Eighty children aged 6 - 12 years participated in the study. All were evaluated and 30 were selected at random for the analyses (age range: 72 - 149 months, mean = 103. 3, S. D. = 23. 57). Individuals with and without orofacial myofunctional. disorders were included. The examiners were two speech therapists property calibrated in orofacial myofunctional evaluation. Two protocols were constructed. One, based on traditional models, was called traditional orofacial. myofunctional. evaluation (TOME), and the other, with the addition of numerical scales, was called orofacial myofunctional. evaluation with scores (OMES). The clinical conditions included were: appearance, posture and mobility of lips, tongue, cheeks and jaws, respiration, mastication and deglutition. Statistical analysis was performed using the <b>split-half</b> reliability <b>method.</b> Means, standard deviations and the Spearman correlation coefficient were also calculated. Results: There was a statistically significant correlation between the evaluations of 30 children assessed with the TOME and OMES protocols (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 01). The reliability between protocols was 0. 92. The test-retest reliability of the OMES instrument was 0. 99 and the correlation was 0. 98. Reliability between examiners 1 and 2 using the OMES protocol was 0. 99, and the correlation was 0. 98 (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: The OMES protocot proved to be a valid and reliable instrument for orofacial myofunctional evaluation, permitting the grading of orofacial myofunctional conditions within the limits of the selected items.

40|$|This M. A. thesis {{deals with}} the topic of magical {{thinking}} in the adult population. The theoretical section of the thesis summarizes the existing findings {{in regard to the}} theory and research of magical thinking. The empirical section is dedicated to the development and subsequent validation of the new testing method devised to measure inclinations to magical thinking. Proving the method's validity is firstly aimed at gathering convergent proofs based on the relations towards methods measuring similar constructs, the external criterion being the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) and the subscale of Esoteric and Personal Superstitious Thinking of the Contrastive Thinking Inventory (CTI). The second part of the research focuses on the validity proofs gathered in relation to the categorical variable - group affiliation - where we test a selective collection of the general public against a selection of technical and natural scientists and a selection of people attending courses with esoteric content. The research results confirm the method's reliability based on the <b>split-half</b> <b>method</b> and they also confirm a high coefficient of inner consistence of Cronbach's alpha. The results of the validation study show a strong correlation between the research inventory and selected scales of the CTI method as [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to find out whether there is a significant difference of using RT strategy to the 3 rdsemester students’ reading skill at reading comprehension course. The sample of the research was the third semester students at English study programme of Sriwijaya State Polytechnic in the academic year 2013 / 2014 consisting of fourty eight students. The RT strategy developed by Palincsar and Brown was modified into three steps of instruction consisting of nine activities. A quasi-experimental design of the pretest-posttest non-equivalent control group design was applied. To collect the data, fourty multiple choice questions of reading comprehension were used. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation, and <b>Split-half</b> <b>Method</b> + Spearman-Brown of the test were > 0. 312 and 0. 834. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Levene test were 0. 200 and 0. 570, indicating the normality and homogeneity of data distribution. The findings from the pairedsample t-test showed that students who were taught with modified RT attained higher scores (14. 792) than those who were not (6. 042). Since the modified RT strategy had a significant effect on the students’ reading comprehension achievement, modified RT strategy can be applied in teaching reading comprehension.

40|$|Background. Pharmaceutical {{supplies}} {{sufficient to}} protect {{millions of people}} are positioned to respond to a bioterrorist attack in the United States of America, but the educational resources, programs, material, and health professional staffing, to utilize those supplies optimally may be underdeveloped. Professionals and municipalities require objective tools to measure their ability to communicate necessary drug information to adhere to emergency prophylactic regimens. ^ Objective. This research project created a survey tool and laid the foundation to establish the tool 2 ̆ 7 s validity to measure patient drug knowledge in bioterrorism preparedness activities that involve the dispensing of prophylactic medications. ^ Methods. Test construction was based upon establishing content validity, and ensuring all relevant knowledge domains are addressed through literature review and professional consultation. Further evidence for understanding of the tool was accumulated through the testing of several theories, or constructs regarding known groups and drug knowledge. The reliably of the measure was assessed by the reliability coefficient, by the <b>split-half</b> reliability <b>method,</b> and by Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha using the internal consistency method. ^ Results. The study identified six categories of drug knowledge that enable appropriate patient behavior, around which the survey was constructed. Construct validity trials confirmed the score correct 2 ̆ 7 s correlation with progress through professional pharmacy curriculum in an academic setting, and the highest grade level completed by participants in a community setting. The supplementation of oral information with written information was found to correlate with a reduction in incorrect scores on the instrument in an experimentally controlled academic setting. The reliability estimates from community trial produced a Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha of 0. 849 for score correct and a Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha of 0. 631 for score incorrect. ^ Discussion. The evidence compiled from this investigation allows confidence that the tool can be appropriately used to measure patient level drug knowledge for bioterrorism preparedness activities. Further testing in diverse populations will complement the findings of this tool, and begin to allow for normalized comparisons. The evaluation of content validity, construct validity and reliability in this investigation support the adequacy of this tool for making inferences, and provide support for the tool 2 ̆ 7 s continued use for this purpose. ...|$|R
