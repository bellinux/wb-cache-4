2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Out {{of concern}} about energy wasted by the {{standing}} pilot flame, designers of many newer appliances have switched to an electronically controlled pilot-less ignition, also called intermittent ignition. With no standing pilot flame, there is no risk of gas buildup should the flame go out, so these appliances do not need thermocouple-based pilot <b>safety</b> <b>switches.</b> As these designs lose the benefit of operation without a continuous source of electricity, standing pilots are still used in some appliances. The exception is later model instantaneous (aka [...] "tankless") water heaters that use {{the flow of water}} to generate the current required to ignite the gas burner; these designs also use a thermocouple as a safety cut-off device in the event the gas fails to ignite, or if the flame is extinguished.|$|E
2500|$|A {{residual-current device}} (RCD), or {{residual-current circuit breaker}} (RCCB), is a device that {{instantly}} breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human falls after receiving a shock. In the United States and Canada, the device is more commonly known as a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI). In the United Kingdom, these are better known by their initials RCD, and a combined RCD+MCB (miniature circuit breaker) is known as a RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection). In Australia, they are sometimes known as <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> or an RCD. An earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a residual-current device, although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists.|$|E

40|$|DE 102008063976 A 1 UPAB: 20100712 NOVELTY - The switch (100) has {{a housing}} (101) fixed {{in a vacuum}} chamber such that {{pressure}} within the chamber acts on a compensator pipe (104) and on a flexible membrane. A form or position of the pipe and membrane is changeable in dependence of the pressure. A contactless-detection is made whether deformation or position change of the pipe and the membrane reaches a desired value, using a commercial <b>safety</b> magnet <b>switch</b> (107). The magnet switch actuates a switching contact or produces a signal when the deformation or position change of the pipe and the membrane reaches the value. USE - Pressure <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> for a vacuum chamber that is utilized for coating substrates. ADVANTAGE - The switch is designed such that electrical components provided downstream to the <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> are reliably switched at zero voltage while opening the vacuum chamber. The <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> is suitable to standard-conform for application in safety-relevant functions...|$|R
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> on the slide. The ambidextrous <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Square D sold the {{majority}} of their fuse business in order to focus more on their <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> and other safety products. The company began an aggressive marketing campaign to promote their <b>safety</b> <b>switches.</b> Their advertisements, which became to be known as [...] "Jones is Dead!", directed public attention to the safety hazards of exposed electrical switches in factories. Square D hoped to capitalize on the growing concern of factory safety. One such fully working Square D safety switch from 1922 was donated in November 2003 to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded on December 15, 1902 by Bryson Dexter Horton and James B. McCarthy. In 1903 they {{incorporated}} as the McBride Manufacturing Company. During {{the first decade of}} business, the company expanded into various other electrical products. In 1908, the company was renamed Detroit Fuse and Manufacturing. Horton, an 1895 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, was credited with the invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>switch,</b> which encased high voltage switches and started the company's main line of business of circuit breakers and encased control panels. Their first enclosed <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> was introduced in 1909.|$|R

50|$|The {{operator}} {{is protected}} from electrocution by <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> and fuses. There {{may also be}} controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard, coming from a generator or bank of electrical generators, especially frequency control of AC power and load sharing controls, plus gauges showing frequency and perhaps a synchroscope.

50|$|Open knife {{switches}} were {{supplanted by}} <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure {{which can only}} be opened by switching off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|E

50|$|Seen as a {{temporary}} solution, this grade was twice the percentage normally allowed for a downhill train track. The first construction train {{to go down the}} pass ran away off the hill to land in the Kicking Horse River, killing three. The CPR soon added three <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> (runaways) on the way down to protect against runaway trains. The switches led to short spurs with a sharp reverse upgrade and they were kept in the uphill position until the operator was satisfied that the train descending the grade towards him was not out of control. Speed was restricted to eight miles per hour (13 km/h) for passenger trains and six (10 km/h) for freight, and elaborate brake testing was required of trains prior to descending the hill. Nevertheless, disasters occurred with dismaying frequency.|$|E

5000|$|The FN Forty-Nine is a recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{developed by}} the Belgium company Fabrique Nationale (FN). The Forty-Nine uses an improved linkless locking principle intended for police use. The pistol is striker fired and uses FN's Repeatable Secure Striker mechanism. This means that unlike many other striker-fired pistols, such as the Glock family, the Forty-Nine operates on a double-action only (DAO) trigger mechanism, meaning that the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull before every shot. This allows the user to re-strike a misfired cartridge simply by pulling the trigger again. The Forty-Nine has no external (manual) <b>safety</b> <b>switches.</b> The double-stacked detachable magazine holds sixteen rounds in 9mm caliber and fourteen in [...]40 S&W. The frame is constructed of polymer and the slide of stainless steel. An accessory rail under the barrel allows for quick and easy mounting of laser aiming modules and flashlights.|$|E

5000|$|Pistols {{made and}} {{imported}} by Glock Ges.m.b.H., {{such as the}} Glock 17, incorporate a design with three levels of integrated safety, known as safe action; there are no external <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> on these handguns. First, an integrated trigger latch prevents the trigger body from moving unless the trigger is positively squeezed. Second, the gun's striker-firing mechanism is locked in place by an extension bar linked to the trigger; the striker cannot move unless the trigger is depressed. Third, as with most pistols, a firing pin block actuated by the same extension bar prevents the pin coming {{into contact with the}} primer unless the trigger is pulled to clear the block. Although not generally considered a safety feature, the resting state of the gun (excluding a dry/misfire) has the striker in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] state; pulling the trigger will fully cock the weapon before releasing the striker, and the mechanism is designed to have insufficient force to ignite the primer of an active cartridge from this state even if the sear lock and firing pin block both fail.|$|E
