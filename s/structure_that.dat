5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E

5000|$|In {{research}} on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion {{in response to}} hearing a musical piece. Researchers have investigated whether the same <b>structures</b> <b>that</b> conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively. [...] Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with <b>structures</b> <b>that</b> convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with <b>structures</b> <b>that</b> convey sadness. [...] This evidence suggests <b>that</b> the same <b>structures</b> <b>that</b> convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.|$|R

5|$|Ants are eusocial insects of {{the family}} Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like {{ancestors}} in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.

The hammam was built in 1775 by Qassim Agha Abdullah. It went out of service during the 1970s and was renovated in 1979, although many original architectural details were lost.|$|E

5|$|In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of two {{individuals}} fuse, forming a gametangium, a specialized cell <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> becomes a fertile gamete-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a thick-walled spore {{formed by the}} union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.|$|E
