5|$|In October 2004, Totalprosjekt {{presented}} the concept Skibladner Stadion, {{which would have}} been located on Tjuvholmen, a peninsula which <b>sticks</b> <b>out</b> into Mjøsa. In addition to a 9,000-seat stadium, the project included a cultural center with an 800-seat auditorium and a 22-story hotel. However, Tjvuholmen is a popular recreational areas and a process to regulate the area as such had just been completed. The location would also cause problems for the railway, who wanted to expand Hamar Station. The Tjvuholmen project was rejected by the municipal executive committee on 8 December, and on 16 March 2005, the municipal council voted to continue working on a new venue at Briskeby. This caused Totalproject to leave the project.|$|E

In January 1982 Richard Burton had his private aeroplane fly Lowe to film a cameo role in the television series Wagner, his last screen performance.|$|E

25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lack {{a secondary}} palate, {{meaning that they}} must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate {{that allows them to}} continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension <b>sticks</b> <b>out</b> like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.|$|E

Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It <b>sticks</b> <b>out</b> into the cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density {{which is an}} electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 Le Mesurier reprised {{the role}} of Arthur Wilson for It <b>Sticks</b> <b>Out</b> Half a Mile, a radio sequel to Dad's Army, in which Wilson had become bank manager of the Frambourne-on-Sea branch, while Arthur Lowe's character, Captain George Mainwaring, was trying {{to apply for a}} loan to {{renovate}} the local pier. The death of Lowe in April 1982 meant that only a pilot episode was recorded, and the project was suspended. It was revived in 1982 with Lowe's role replaced by two other Dad's Army cast members: Pike, played by Ian Lavender, and Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee. A pilot and twelve episodes were subsequently recorded, and broadcast in 1984. Le Mesurier also teamed up with another ex-Dad's Army colleague, Clive Dunn, to record a novelty single, [...] "There Ain't Much Change from a Pound These Days"/"After All These Years", which had been written by Le Mesurier's stepson, David Malin. The single was released on KA Records in 1982.|$|E
500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of <b>sticks</b> <b>out</b> in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E

Meanwhile, the upper segment of the Toshiba billboard shows more gears and the 2010 sign slowly being lifted up towards the ball, becoming 2010 as it neared {{the top of the}} sign. At midnight, the hand stops ticking and the words [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] flip out and the sign that once showed the numbers 2010 on the upper half of the Toshiba Vision comes back down and says [...] "TOSHIBA" [...] instead. This was the first countdown utilizing Toshiba's new interlocking display system known as ToshibaVision. The countdown made its only appearance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to simulcast on the lower right corner, via camera. The countdown's theme was loosely based on the entrance to the Paramount Building in Times Square. This countdown is also used for the Global Countdown ceremonies that take place in Times Square on December 31, replacing the year with the current year, then rolling to the next year.|$|E
