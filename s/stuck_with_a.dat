And obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? So {{we had to have}} some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could be <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted that}} Doom 3 <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> similar [...] "run and gun" [...] {{gameplay}} style that was successful with its predecessors, {{and the game}} was alternately praised and criticized for this element. Several reviews were critical of a perceived repetitiveness in gameplay after a while. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence was not regarded as particularly challenging, with GameSpot noting that [...] "enemies follow the same sorts of predictable patterns that [...] may remember from previous Doom games" [...] while GameSpy stated the way enemies would spawn to attack the player was [...] "gimmicky"; the reviewer noted that players would realize that picking up a lone armor vest would cause a variety of zombies to emerge from hidden compartments in the dark. In addition, several reviewers noted that the game's methods of conveying the story were [...] "ineffectual", compounded {{by the lack of}} an identity for the player character. Finally, the game's multiplayer was seen as lacking in innovation, with its low player limits and small number of game modes, particularly in contrast to id Software's influential Quake III Arena.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Diamandis took {{inspiration}} from the differing musical tastes of her parents – Dolly Parton, Enya and George Michael from her mother, and Haris Alexiou from her father – while also admiring pop acts of the era including the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and S Club 7. Diamandis has revealed that [...] "Madonna was the reason I {{wanted to be a}} pop star from the age of 15," [...] however she also stated that she did not listen to music [...] "properly" [...] until the age of 19, when she took influence from acts including PJ Harvey, Fiona Apple and The Distillers. She began smoking two years later in an attempt to sound like The Distillers' frontwoman Brody Dalle, [...] "but it never worked, and now I'm just <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bad habit." [...] She has cited Dalle and Spears as her musical influences, and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo-fi production he uses. She has jokingly stated that [...] "I probably have a bit of a different sound because I don't really know what I'm doing!," [...] referencing her lack of formal musical training. Diamandis has synesthesia, and as a result associates particular colours with musical notes and days of the week.|$|E

2500|$|Catalyst's first US {{investment}} was Snowflake Mill, which was acquired in 2008. Catalyst {{took steps to}} upgrade the mill, including investments to allow the plant to produce finer grades of paper. Snowflake was an early user of deinkling pulp and was amongst {{the first in the}} US to accept single-source recycling materials. This moves some of the recycling work from the recyclers, thus cutting their costs, in exchange for a stronger market position and lower raw prices. However, Snowflake Mill was <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> raw product flow which contain contaminants, such as plastic and metals.|$|E

2500|$|Boise State {{also became}} just the second team from a non-AQ (automatic qualifier) conference team to both play in {{and win a}} BCS bowl game (the 2004 Utah Utes team was the first, playing in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl). [...] However, the {{presence}} of Boise State, a non-AQ school, quite possibly led {{to some of the}} lowest TV ratings ever for a BCS game. Of the 37 BCS bowl games played through the 2006 season, only two received lower ratings than this game—the 2005 Fiesta Bowl, the only other BCS game up to that time to feature a non-AQ school (although this most likely was due to getting <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clearly over-matched Pitt team from the Big East [...] who did receive an AQ bid [...] and the resulting blow-out was not a surprise, in any way); and the 2007 Orange Bowl, which featured two non-traditional teams in Louisville and Wake Forest (although, to be fair, both of these teams were AQ conference champions, were awarded the guaranteed spots in a BCS bowls due to their conference memberships in the Big East Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, respectively, and were presumably supposed to be bigger draws, whereas neither 2004 Utah nor 2006 Boise State had automatic bids as a conference champions and yet both outscored them in ratings in their games).|$|E

40|$|In his {{influential}} paper Contracting into Liability Rules: Intellectual Property Rights and Collective Rights Organizations, Robert Merges {{makes the}} case that intellectual property (IP) owners vested with property entitlements can and do contract away their right to an injunction when it is efficient {{for them to do}} so. The result was to cement for many the superiority of property over liability rules, since Merges demonstrated a seemingly critical asymmetry between the two. Merges’s evidence suggested that if a judge or a legislature got the damages calculation wrong, we were <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inefficient liability rule, but that we weren’t similarly <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inefficiently-allocated property rule. The evidence Merges brought to bear in his path-breaking article is extremely important. But it is incomplete. True, parties can contract around inefficient property rules in IP cases. But as I show in this Essay, they can—and do—contract around inefficient liability rules as well. The result does not prove the superiority of liability rules over property rules, but it does undermine a major premise that has been used to support the claim that IP rights must be protected by property rules...|$|R
50|$|The Suez Crisis of October 1956 was a {{catalyst}} that undermined {{the position of}} the V8 Simcas, however, due to the fuel shortages and price increases that it triggered.

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} Pigg's playing style {{is the use}} of complex open-fingered ornaments, in imitation of Irish and Highland piping.

60|$|Methinks I at {{this moment}} behold him in my imagination; or rather, I behold his goodly portrait, which still hangs in the family mansion of the Stuyvesants, arrayed in all the terrors of a true Dutch general. His regimental coat of German blue, gorgeously {{decorated}} with a goodly show of large brass buttons, reaching from his waistband to his chin; the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners, and separating gallantly behind, so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone-colored trunk-breeches, a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our day, and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes, who scorned to defend themselves in rear. His face, rendered exceeding terrible and warlike {{by a pair of}} black mustachios; his hair strutting out on each side in stiffly pomatumed ear-locks, and descending in a rat-tail queue below his waist; a shining stock of black leather supporting his chin, and a little but fierce cocked hat, <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gallant and fiery air over his left eye. Such was the chivalric port of Peter the Headstrong; and when he made a sudden halt, planted himself firmly on his solid supporter, with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in advance, in order to strengthen his position, his right hand grasping a gold-headed cane, his left resting upon the pummel of his sword, his head dressing spiritedly to the right, with a most appalling and hard-favored frown upon his brow, he presented altogether one of the most commanding, bitter-looking, and soldier-like figures that ever strutted upon canvas. Proceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fell {{in with a}} band of half-breeds," [...] he replied, [...] "members of a proscribed {{race that}} dwells in the rock-bound gut through which the {{principal}} river of the valley empties into the morass. They are called Waz-ho-don and their village is partly made up of cave dwellings and partly of houses carved from the soft rock {{at the foot of}} the cliff. They are very ignorant and superstitious and when they first saw me and realized that I had no tail and that my hands and feet were not like theirs they were afraid of me. They thought that I was either god or demon. Being in a position where I could neither escape them nor defend myself, I made a bold front and succeeded in impressing them to such an extent that they conducted me to their city, which they call Bu-lur, and there they fed me and treated me with kindness. As I learned their language I sought to impress them more and more with the idea that I was a god, and I succeeded, too, until an old fellow who was something of a priest among them, or medicine-man, became jealous of my growing power. That was the beginning of the end and came near to being the end in fact. He told them that if I was a god I would not bleed if a knife was stuck into me--if I did bleed it would prove conclusively that I was not a god. Without my knowledge he arranged to stage the ordeal before the whole village upon a certain night--it was upon one of those numerous occasions when they eat and drink to Jad-ben-Otho, their pagan deity. Under the influence of their vile liquor they would be ripe for any bloodthirsty scheme the medicine-man might evolve. One of the women told me about the plan--not with any intent to warn me of danger, but prompted merely by feminine curiosity as to whether or not I would bleed if <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dagger. She could not wait, it seemed, for the orderly procedure of the ordeal--she wanted to know at once, and when I caught her trying to slip a knife into my side and questioned her she explained the whole thing with the utmost naivete. The warriors already had commenced drinking--it would have been futile to make any sort of appeal either to their intellects or their superstitions. There was but one alternative to death and that was flight. I told the woman that I was very much outraged and offended at this reflection upon my godhood and that as a mark of my disfavor I should abandon them to their fate.|$|E
