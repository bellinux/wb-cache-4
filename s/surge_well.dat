Prior to the contest most observers noted that the 1976 contest was the easiest for many years to predict, with [...] "Un, deux, trois" [...] and the United Kingdom's [...] "Save Your Kisses for Me" [...] as the only possible winners.

However [...] "Un, deux, trois" [...] finished a huge 55 points ahead of third-placed Monaco.

40|$|In 2006, a {{drilling}} campaign {{was conducted at}} the Project Shoal Area (PSA) to provide information for model validation, emplace long-term monitoring wells, and develop baseline geochemistry for long term hydrologic monitoring. Water levels were monitored {{in the vicinity of}} the drilling, in the existing wells HC- 1 and HC- 6, as well as in the newly drilled wells, MV- 1, MV- 2 and MV- 3 and their associated piezometers. Periodic water level measurements were also made in existing wells HC- 2, HC- 3, HC- 4, HC- 5 and HC- 7. A lithium bromide chemical tracer was added to drilling fluids during the installation of the monitoring and validation (MV) wells and piezometers. The zones of interest were the fractured, jointed and faulted horizons within a granitic body. These horizons generally have moderate hydraulic conductivities. As a result, the wells and their shallower piezometers required strenuous purging and development to remove introduced drilling fluids as evidenced by bromide concentrations. After airlift and <b>surging</b> <b>well</b> development procedures, the wells were pumped continuously until the bromide concentration was less then 1 milligram per liter (mg/L). Water quality samples were collected after the well development was completed. Tritium scans were preformed before other analyses to ensure the absence of high levels of radioactivity. Tritium levels were less than 2, 000 pico-curies per liter. Samples were also analyzed for carbon- 14 and iodine- 129, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, as well as major cations and anions. Aquifer tests were performed in each MV well after the bromide concentration fell below acceptable levels.

40|$|Abstract: In an open channel, the {{operation}} of a gate {{is associated with a}} lowering of the water level {{on one side and the}} generation of a negative surge. Herein some physical modelling of rapid gate opening was studied under controlled flow conditions in a relatively large size facility. The gate opening induced a negative surge travelling upstream into the canal. Detailed free-surface and velocity measurements were performed with three types of roughness. The experiments were repeated 25 times and the results were ensemble-averaged. The propagation of negative surges was gentle and barely perceptible, but very close to the gate. Large free-surface fluctuations and turbulent velocity fluctuations were recorded beneath the negative <b>surge,</b> as <b>well</b> as turbulent Reynolds stresses. For all bed configurations, the data of surge leading edge celerity showed a characteristic trend with an asymptotical value: (U+Vo) /(g×do) 1 / 2 = 1 independently of the bed roughness. The results implied that the bed roughness had little effect within the experimental flow conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the issue of}} "dangerous human-made interference with climate" using simulations with GISS modelE driven by measured or estimated forcings for 1880 – 2003 and extended to 2100 for IPCC greenhouse gas scenarios {{as well as the}} "alternative" scenario of Hansen and Sato (2004). Identification of "dangerous" effects is partly subjective, but we find evidence that added global warming of more than 1 °C above the level in 2000 has effects that may be highly disruptive. The alternative scenario, with peak added forcing ~ 1. 5 W/m 2 in 2100, keeps further global warming under 1 °C if climate sensitivity is ~ 3 °C or less for doubled CO 2. The alternative scenario keeps mean regional seasonal warming within 2 σ (standard deviations) of 20 th century variability, but other scenarios yield regional changes of 5 – 10 σ, i. e. mean conditions outside the range of local experience. We conclude that a CO 2 level exceeding about 450 ppm is "dangerous", but reduction of non-CO 2 forcings can provide modest relief on the CO 2 constraint. We discuss three specific sub-global topics: Arctic climate change, tropical storm intensification, and ice sheet stability. We suggest that Arctic climate change has been driven as much by pollutants (O 3, its precursor CH 4, and soot) as by CO 2, offering hope that dual efforts to reduce pollutants and slow CO 2 growth could minimize Arctic change. Simulated recent ocean warming in the region of Atlantic hurricane formation is comparable to observations, suggesting that greenhouse gases (GHGs) may have contributed to a trend toward greater hurricane intensities. Increasing GHGs cause significant warming in our model in submarine regions of ice shelves and shallow methane hydrates, raising concern about the potential for accelerating sea level rise and future positive feedback from methane release. Growth of non-CO 2 forcings has slowed in recent years, but CO 2 emissions are now <b>surging</b> <b>well</b> above the alternative scenario. Prompt actions to slow CO 2 emissions and decrease non-CO 2 forcings are required to achieve the low forcing of the alternative scenario...|$|R
