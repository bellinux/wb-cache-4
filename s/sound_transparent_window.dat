40|$|In {{precision}} machining, it {{is desirable}} to measure workpiece form profiles to provide feedback for control to maintain high machining quality. In many removal type machining processes, coolants are used to reduce the thermal effects to avoid thermal deformation. But the opaque optical property of coolant produces an inaccessibility problem for in-process optical form error measurement. To solve this problem, a new measurement approach in which an optically clean zone is generated by a water beam was proposed. In order to investigate input parameter effects on the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> generation process, an experimental testing rig was designed and developed. This testing rig {{can also be used}} to investigate the characteristics of the water beam assisted form error in-process optical measurement method. A new applicator was also designed and fabricated for implementation. It {{can also be used to}} investigate the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> generation process. Through an orthogonal factorial test, the ranking of four key input parameters is found. The water flow rate Qw and the height of medium hm are the most important parameters affecting the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size At. Through a preliminary parameter test, parameter value selection in the experimental testing was finalized. Through a series of experimental studies, effects of five key input parameters on the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size At and the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> stability est were found. The effects of five key input parameters on the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size At and their ranking agree with the results of the factorial orthogonal test. Through a series of experimental studies, suitable ranges of the five key input parameters were found. The objective is to obtain suitable At and est values to permit stable and accurate form error in-process optical measurement. The results are ○ Qw ∈[0. 45 - 0. 75 ml/s]; ○ hm ∈[0. 3 - 0. 5 mm]; ○ cc ∈[0. 05 - 0. 15]; ○ vt ∈[60 - 150 mm/s]; ○ ∅w ∈[1. 0 - 1. 5 mm]. Within the above ranges, the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size At is approximately 20 - 40 mm 2, and the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> stability est is typically less than 6 %. This value is acceptable for the form error in-process optical measurement. The suitable ranges for At are almost the same as the ones for est. It means that, when the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> is formed in a size approximately 20 - 40 mm 2, it will be very stable. This finding is a very useful for accurate form error in-process optical measurement...|$|R

Based on the method of water beam assisted form error in-process optical measurement, a new air beam approach was proposed {{to solve the problems}} of coolant dilution and optical transmittance through multiple media. In order to identify key parameters to reduce the workload of experimental tests, a factorial test was conducted on <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size A(t) and stability e(st). Calibration and assessment of A(t) and e(st) were introduced. Factorial test design was also examined. Results of the study show that v(t), v(a), and d(a) are the key parameters on A(t). Although all 6 main parameters are not significant, v(t) is relatively more important on e(st). When v(t) increases, A(t) will decrease. When v(a) or d(a) increases, A(t) will increase. The findings agree with our understanding of the physical process of fluid flow. When v(t) decreases, the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size stability e(st) will be better. Consider both stability e(st) and air velocity v(a), Run 11 should be the best choice of conditions for A(t). A larger <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size A(t) typically gives better <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size stability e(st). To achieve a balance between e(st) and v(a), a suitable size of <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> at A(t) =similar to 30 mm(2) should be a good choice. Further studies are necessary to confirm the findings...|$|R

40|$|Form error in-process optical {{measurement}} {{is among}} {{one of the}} most important surface profile measurement techniques. Inaccessibility problem is caused by the application of opaque coolant during the surface grinding process. A new method using water beam in creating a transparent area for direct access by measurement beam to surface of workpiece was proposed previously. To gain better understanding of the proposed method, this project studied the integrated effect of five input parameters on the size of <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> generated with the CFD modeling approach. A stable CFD model was successfully constructed. Stable range of conditions for <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size value determination was identified. The development of the CFD model used for the study was reported. CFD generated results are being compared with the results of the collaborated experiment both qualitatively and quantitatively. Compared the CFD result against the result from the collaborated experiment, it was founded that the CFD model is capable in identifying <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size rate with changing parameters. The CFD model was also found to have difficulties in simulating the experimental value of <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size in specific parameter conditions like coolant concentration at 20 %. Reasons were found to be related to the instability of the experimental data and suggestions for improvements were made. By adopting the various solution representation methods given by the CFD program, new insights to future design and direction for further studies were identified. It was found that smaller water channel diameter will give better conditions for <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> generation. Slower workpiece velocities below certain critical value approximately 20 mm/s will a cause reduction in <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> size due to the definition of problem. Suggestions for future design and applications of the proposed method were made...|$|R

40|$|Coolant fluid {{is often}} {{utilized}} in precision machining processes. The optical measurement method {{is a highly}} accurate method. However, the coolant fluid blocks the light beams from this layer and makes optical measurement impossible. This dissertation describes the fluid and optical characteristics of a new in-process measurement method assisted by a transparent fluid. Fluid model of the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> and related experiments are provided. In modeling the motions of the fluids for the <b>transparent</b> <b>window,</b> the <b>transparent</b> flow is simplified as a line source, when it flows into the narrow gap zone between {{the bottom of the}} applicator and the workpiece surface. The coolant flow and the line source are combined to a flow potential field. The complex potential theory is utilized to find the boundary line of the two fluid flows. Furthermore, the equations of the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> boundary line are obtained, which are functions of the transparent fluid flow rate, the gap, and the velocity of workpiece movement. An experimental setup is developed to simulate the movement of the worktable and workpiece, the coolant fluid condition, and to capture images of the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> under various conditions. After analysis, the experimental results are found to correspond with the results of the theoretical model in the effective area of the applicator. There are two assisting layers in the new method, the applicator and fluid layer. These layers are the extra parts for a laser sensor, and change the properties of the sensor, and so as the measurement results. The experimental results show that the laser beam propagation will be changed when it passes through the assisting layers. The effects are governed by the thickness of the applicator and the fluid layer, the refraction indexes of the layers, and the incidence angle of the laser beam. A correction formula has been derived to correct the measurement output. The experiments also indicate that the installation error should be limited to less than 2 degrees for correct measurement. The Reynolds number of the flow in the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> region is in the range from 50 to 6000. This makes the flow either laminar or turbulent. The theoretical analysis and experiments show that the deflection of laser beam through a laminar or turbulent flow fluid layer is small under the conditions of the method. However, in the turbulent flow, air bubbles may exist, which will be a serious problem for laser beam propagation in the <b>transparent</b> <b>window.</b> The experiments and analyses show that the effect of the flowing fluid layer can be controlled to an acceptable level. The coolant fluid is opaque for a laser beam. The effects on the optical measurement depend on the density of the coolant and the thickness of the fluid layer. When the density is high, the propagation of the laser beam becomes more difficult, and the diffusion of the laser increases. A large number of the experiments were performed. The results show that, if the thickness of the fluid layer is less than 0. 5 mm and the density of the coolant in the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> is lower than 2 %, the measurement error is acceptable...|$|R
