40|$|<b>Sarcosporidiosis</b> (Sarcocystis infection) {{is caused}} by an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite that predominantly affects animals. It can rarely be found in human skeletal and cardiac muscle in humans. There are two different forms of <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> in humans. These cases of muscular sarcocystosis were probably zoonotic in origin and associated with close contact with definitive hosts (both domestic and wild animals) thus permitting the contamination of food and drink with sporocystis shed by these definitive hosts. The second mode of infection for humans is ingested animal tissues which containing sporozoites (e. g., undercooked meats). These sporozoited directly intestinal epithelial cells and can enter the circulation in an manner similiar to those released from oocysts from the intermediate or accidental host...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sarcosporidiosis</b> {{is caused}} by {{ingestion}} of contaminated raw or undercooked bovine meat and, although considered a minor zoonosis, it can represent a threath for immunocompromised people. Aim {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. in bovine minced meat intended for raw consumption collected from butcher shops and retail stores in Turin’s province (Piedmont region, Northwest Italy). Twenty-five samples were examined in parallel by histology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of infestation of Sarcocystis spp. resulted to be 64 % [confidence interval (CI) 95 % 42 - 82] and 88 % (CI 95 % 69 - 97) respectively by histology and PCR. In detail, the prevalence resulted 80 % for S. cruzi (CI 95 % 59 - 93), 68 % for S. hominis (CI 95 % 46 - 85) and 4 % for S. hirsuta (CI 95 % 0. 10 - 20).

40|$|From a {{total of}} 32 717 cattle slaughtered, 183 whole carcass condemnations were {{attributable}} to 9 diseases and conditions, namely, tuberculosis (TB), cysticercosis, emaciation, generalised lymphadenitis, jaundice, abscesses, moribund, <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> and odour. Bovine TB {{was the most important}} cause of condemnations (152 / 183, 83. 1 %). Bovine cysticercosis and <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> accounted for 5 / 183 (2. 7 %) and 8 / 183 (4. 4 %), respectively, while each of the remaining conditions contributed less. Among the many conditions responsible for offal / organ condemnations were fascioliasis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, hydatidosis and TB. In terms of number and weight, Fasciola gigantica infections made livers and lungs the most condemned offals (20. 1 % and 0. 7 %, respectively). Hydatidosis was the cause of 0. 9 %lung and 0. 1 %liver losses. Cysticercus bovis contributed to only 0. 05 %of all inspected tongues, hearts, and heads. TB was very rare in heads (0. 01 %). The financial impact of whole carcasses and offals condemned during the study period was enormous and deprived livestock farmers of the much needed revenue and consumers of protein sources. Much or all of the condemned material that could have been useful was wasted by not being retrieved for conversion to processed meat, bone meal or pet food.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Worldwinde, cervids are {{considered}} {{an important source}} of infection and dissemination {{of a wide variety of}} pathogens, both for farm animals and humans. Among this diseases is <b>sarcosporidiosis,</b> which is a parasitic disease caused by Sarcocystis spp. (Protozoa: Apicomplexa). Most frequent clinical signs are hemolytic anemia, weakness, weight loss and decrease of growth and some species of Sarcocystis might cause abortions. The clinical disease in ruminants is fairly rare but the infection is very frequent. Infections are accumulative and the parasite does not generate immunity in any of the hosts. Ovine <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> is a serious issue in the some regions of Chile due to the macrocysts located in the muscle which means condemnation of the whole carcass. Sarcocystis spp. has been widely reported in red deer and other cervid species but in Chile the situation remains unknown. Nowadays there is little to no evidence of Sarcocystis in foreign deer in Chile and there is only one report of the parasite on pudu. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate the presence of Sarcocystis spp. in myocardium of red deer and fallow deer in Chile, and confirm the presence of Sarcocystis spp. in pudu. All cervid cases from 1994 to 2013 of the Institute of Animal Pathology of the Universidad Austral de Chile were reviewed. The animals selected were those in which a myocardium sample was taken. From the histopathological samples observed, it was found that 5 of the 9 red deer, 1 of the 4 fallow deer and in 11 of the 23 pudu there were Sarcocystis cysts in the myocardium. This study represents the first record for Chile of Sarcocystis spp. in myocardium of red deer and fallow deer. Stablishing the red deer, fallow deer and pudu as hosts of Sarcocystis aids to have a better understanding of the parasite epidemiology in Chile and the role of wild and captive cervids in the maintenance and spread of these parasites...|$|E

Macroscopic cysts of Sarcocystis gigantea were identified in six oesophagi (1. 03 %). The enzymatic digestion and the histopathological analysis showed a high prevalence (99. 14 % and 94. 03 %, respectively). The thin-walled cysts of Sarcocystis arieticanis (92. 54 %) remained more predominant than the thick-walled cysts of Sarcocystis tenella (43. 88 %). The prevalence of the thin-walled microcysts was higher in the diaphragm (80. 60 %) than in the oesophagus (62. 69 %).

40|$|Abstract. Seven {{members of}} a 15 -man U.

Sarcocysts of an unidentified Sarcocystis species were found in skeletal muscle biopsies of the index case. Albendazole ameliorated symptoms in the index case; however, his symptoms persisted for more than 5 years. Symptoms in 5 other men were mild to moderate and self-limited, and 1 team member with laboratory abnormalities was asymptomatic. Of 8 team members tested for antibody to Sarcocystis, 6 were positive; of 4 with the eosinophilic myositis syndrome who were tested, all were positive. We attribute this outbreak of eosinophilic myositis to accidental tissue parasitism by Sarcocystis.

40|$|Summary: This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the prevalence of ovine Sarcocystis species in Izmir province. A total of 734 muscle samples of 200 sheep from four different age groups were surveyed by the digestion and histological examination methods {{for the presence of}} Sarcocystis species. Sarcocystis ovifelis, Sarcocystis ovicanis, and Sarcocystis arieticanis were detected as the responsible species for ovine <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> in Izmir province. Macrocysts of S. ovifelis were found in 24. 5 % (49 / 200) of sheep and the highest prevalence was detected in the oesophagus in all age groups. Microcysts of S. ovicanis and S. arieticanis were present in 86. 5 % (173 / 200) of sheep. The prevalence of Sarcocystis cysts increased significantly with the age. Although microcysts were detected in 46 % (23 / 50) of lambs up to 6 months of age, they were present in all muscle samples of sheep (150 / 150) over 6 months of age. Histologically, no inflammatory reaction was seen against sarcocysts within the infected muscles, unless they degenerated. There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) statistically between sensitivities of two diagnostic methods (digestion and histology) in detecting Sarcocystis species. These results reveal the fact that the environment is heavily contaminated with sporocysts, and the ingestion of sporocysts by sheep begins from the young ages in Izmir province...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades the pig {{production}} improvement had impacted on zoonotic profile attributed to pork. This fact has created a need to modernize the meat inspection system traditionally applied, driving the focus to risks that really threaten food safety nowadays. This modernization is a trend in meat producer countries and European Union is ahead in this process. In this way, Brazil is assessing the new systems and building an own proposal which has been conducted under a national project linked by many coordinated actions. The first step of this work is {{to analyze the data}} of current inspection system. Then, the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the carcasses and viscera disposition reported by Brazilian Federal Meat Inspection. The analyzed database encompasses the reports of 114 slaughterhouses recorded from 2012 to 2014 into SIGSIF platform. The results were summarized by descriptive statistics on tables and figures using the SAS software. It was possible to show that the major “post mortem” causes of carcass/viscera trimming or condemnation were resulted from production diseases, as adherences (3. 72 %), pleurisy (0. 85 %), abscess (0. 58 %) and pneumonia (0. 20 %). Likewise for industrial process problems, as carcass contamination by evisceration leaking (1. 8 %) and traumatic lesions (1. 57 %). Zoonosis injuries condemnations were reported in very low frequency in a few slaughterhouses, usually once. Among the total of organs and carcass inspected, cysticercosis was registered in just 0. 00092 % in 25 slaughterhouses, endocarditis in 0. 00193 % (23 slaughterhouses), erysipelas in 0. 0045 % (38 slaughterhouses), <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> in 0. 00051 % (17 slaughterhouses) and tuberculosis in 0. 000046 % (12 slaughterhouses). Thus, the current meat inspection system is prepared to detect zoonosis that no longer occur or happen in very low frequency. In the other hand, the traditional ante and post mortem inspection methodologies are not able to detect the main current foodborne pathogens globally distributed as Salmonella...|$|E
40|$|Minipig breeds {{are being}} used as {{experimental}} animals in medico-biological research. The cardiovascular system of the pig frequently serves {{as the model for}} the human cardiovascular system. Histopathological myocardial alterations which may {{have an impact on the}} survivability in stress situations can be proven in clinically healthy fattened pigs. The objective is to examine whether similar myocardial alterations are present in minipigs. These processes must be distinguished from phenomena which result in the course of the use of the animals for research purposes. The present thesis is thus aiming at the completion of the spectrum of criteria concerning the experimental animal Berlin minipig. The hearts of 87 Berlin minipigs were examined. They were classified into different age groups (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 months). 9 and/or 8 myocardium samples taken from each heart were prepared with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and 1 with Sudan red G staining. The following criteria were considered in the histological examination: inflammations, degenerations and necroses, fatty degenerations, dystrophic calcinoses, <b>sarcosporidiosis</b> as well as vascular alterations. The findings were collected semiquantatively by classifying them into different degrees of severity, they were compared with each other and statistically evaluated. For 35 hearts, the Luxol Fast Blue staining was applied in addition. The method of stunning was taken into account when the evaluation was made. The histological examination showed that pathological myocardial findings can be detected in clinically healthy Berlin minipigs. These alterations are age-dependent. Inflammatory processes had the highest incidence. The portion of tissue samples showing the said pathohistological alterations was 3. 4 % of the tissue samples examined in the first month of life, it rose to a maximum of 38. 9 % at an age of 12 months and it fell to 24. 4 % in the 24 th month of life. The portion of tissue samples showing degenerative and necrotic alterations was 25. 6 % at an age of 12 months, and 14. 4 % at an age of 24 months of life. No degenerative necrotic alterations were found in the 1 month old animals. Degeneration and necrosis were always connected with inflammatory alterations. Dystrophic calcinosis was only found in one tissue sample of the 6 -month-old Berlin minipigs. No degenerative fatty infiltration was found in any of the preparations. The portion of tissue samples with Sarcosporidia cysts varied between 0 % (1 and 2 months) and 30 % (12 months). Muscular-elastic intima proliferations at the intramural coronary arteries were found with a higher incidence with increasing age. The degree of severity of these processes was age-dependent, too. The first presence of swellings of the intima and of the media was proven in 6 -month-old animals (10. 5 % of the hearts). At an age of 12 and 24 months, their share was 50 % each. Intima-media swellings were exclusively found in the papillary muscles. The LFB staining is used for the detection of the myofibrillar degeneration as a form of early myocardial damage. The myofibrillar degeneration may occur in a diffuse form or as a myofibrillar degeneration of the transverse band type. An LFB-positive myocardial damage could be proven in 82. 9 % of the hearts that were examined. The animals stunned by the captive bolt pistol showed 75 % of LFB-positive myocardial damage, and the animals stunned by electroshock had a positive reaction to LFB of 93. 3 %. Two thirds (66. 7 %) of the pigs stunned by means of electroshock showed a moderate reaction. 13. 3 % of the hearts showed a moderate to severe myocardial damage. 6. 7 % each of the hearts of the pigs that had been stunned by means of electroshock showed a mild and a mild to moderate damage. In 6. 7 % of the hearts of this group no LFB-positive reaction could be determined. 25 % of the animals stunned by the captive bolt pistol showed a moderate damage. 15 % of them had the transitional form of a mild to moderate damage. In 25 % of the hearts of this examination group no LFB-positive damages at all could be proven. In one preparation each of the two groups that were examined, the myofibrillar degeneration of the transverse band type was proven whereas the remaining LFB-positive myocardial samples showed the diffuse type. An artifical damage of the cardiac muscle by the stunning and killing process itself seems to be given. Consequently, the significance of LFB staining for the determination of early myocardial damage in killed miniature pigs not caused by stunning is to be termed unreliable. The results show that pathohistological myocardial alterations can be proven in clinically healthy Berlin minipigs. The incidence and the degree of severity of the pathomorphological alterations are at the same level as was also determined for slaughter pigs of a different genetic stock. Infectious, infectious-toxic and metabolism-induced factors as well as repeated stress-induced micronecroses must be taken into consideration as the cause of the said alterations. When using the Berlin minipig in biomedical research, the presence of these natural myocardial alterations must be taken into account...|$|E
