5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will <b>still</b> <b>say</b> no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. The {{fact is that the}} women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins <b>still</b> <b>say</b> that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E

Landa said, [...] "Even when playing with (Geoffrey), and him being in the same room, I will <b>still</b> <b>say</b> they were a very big influence on me. I'd almost dare to say that had it not been my hearing their records, I would never have been into Celtic music to begin with -- so the band may not even exist." ...|$|E

500|$|While mass-classifiers do not {{necessarily}} bear any semantic relationship to the noun {{with which they are}} used (e.g. box and book are not related in meaning, but one can <b>still</b> <b>say</b> [...] "a box of books"), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects {{solely on the basis of}} inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and prototypical theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, with critics highlighting Ellen Pompeo's performance, Washington's {{direction and}} McKee's writing. TV Line gave Pompeo's performance the most praise, called it [...] "visceral" [...] and wrote, [...] " [...] If a picture really says a thousand words, this review is superfluous: Any image 'we publish of Pompeo’s stricken face from this week’s Grey’s {{will tell you}} {{all you need to}} know about her [...] " [...] Praising McKee the site called [...] the episode a [...] "stunner". The site added, [...] "We long ago gave up predicting what the Emmy Awards will do. But we will <b>still</b> <b>say</b> that, if there’s any justice, Pompeo’s transcendent work ought to get the leading lady at very least the nomination for which she is so long overdue." ...|$|E
500|$|During Stewart's {{appearance}} on CNN's Crossfire, Stewart criticized that show {{and said that}} it was [...] "hurting America" [...] by sensationalizing debates and enabling political spin. When co-host Carlson argued that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on The Daily Show, Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews and that a [...] "fake news" [...] comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalism. [...] "You're on CNN!" [...] Stewart said, [...] "The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls! What is wrong with you?" [...] Media critic Dan Kennedy says that Stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange because [...] "you can't interview Bill Clinton, Richard Clarke, Bill O'Reilly, Bob Dole, etc., etc., and <b>still</b> <b>say</b> you're just a comedian." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often {{suffered}} {{emotional abuse}} {{from her husband}} J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show. Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." [...] She also added, [...] "The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end." [...] In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: [...] "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. But I <b>still</b> <b>say</b> she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties." [...] The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented, ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much do anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I <b>still</b> <b>say</b> do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{the term}} [...] "cologne" [...] {{has entered the}} English {{language}} as a generic, overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man, regardless of its concentration. The actual product worn by a man may technically be an eau de toilette, but he may <b>still</b> <b>say</b> that he [...] "wears cologne."

2500|$|Because many {{of these}} plurals do not end in -s, {{some of them have}} been reinterpreted as {{singular}} forms: particularly the words datum and medium (as in a [...] "medium of communication"), where the original plurals data and media are now, in many contexts, used by some as singular mass nouns: [...] "The media is biased"; [...] "This data shows us that ..." [...] (although a number of scientists, especially of British origin, <b>still</b> <b>say</b> [...] "These data show us that ..."). See below for more information. Similarly, words such as criteria and phenomena are used as singular by some speakers, although this is still considered incorrect in standard usage (see below).|$|E

I haven't {{got rid of the}} moustache and long hair from my cricketing days, which gets a mixed reaction. Babies in prams look at me strangely quite a lot, so when I talk to them I have to put my finger over my top lip to soften the blow. They think the hair bear bunch [...] have arrived.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Britain {{marked the}} first major defeat of Hitler's {{military}} forces, with air superiority seen {{as the key to}} victory. Pre-war theories had led to exaggerated fears of strategic bombing, and UK public opinion was buoyed by coming through the ordeal. For the RAF, Fighter Command had achieved a great victory in successfully carrying out Sir Thomas Inskip's 1937 air policy of preventing the Germans from knocking Britain out of the war. Churchill concluded his famous 18 June 'Battle of Britain' speech in the House of Commons by referring to pilots and aircrew who fought the Battle: [...] "...if the British Empire and its Commonwealth lasts for a thousand years, men will <b>still</b> <b>say,</b> 'This was their finest hour.'" ...|$|E
