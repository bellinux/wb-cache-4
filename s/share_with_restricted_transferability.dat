Gizmondo hemorrhaged {{hundreds of}} millions of dollars before filing for bankruptcy: in 2004, Tiger Telematics reported a loss of $99.29 million, and between January and September 2005, they lost $210 million, [...] "Principally due to development costs for the Gizmondo and non-cash expenses associated <b>with</b> <b>shares</b> of <b>restricted</b> common stock issued for services". In other words, it had bartered shares in lieu of cash payments. Soon after Gizmondo retail locations in both the US and the UK closed, and the Gizmondo website was shut down. The game development arm of Gizmondo also went out of business.|$|R

Working together, they are able to consolidate and deliver the networking components using standard IT virtualization technologies making, in such a way, carriers infrastructures more flexible and adaptive in respect to the needs of both end-users and service providers. In this context, this paper presents the architecture and the related prototype of a video broadcasting service tailored for SDN-NVF enabled networks, allowing network and application functions deployment simplification and management cost reduction. In such a way, the proposed solution enables small/medium and unusual content providers to <b>share</b> events <b>with</b> a <b>restricted</b> number of interested users without the need of adopting a dedicated and expensive data delivery infrastructure...|$|R

30|$|However, {{this study}} is subject to several limitations. First, it is {{possible}} that the measure of tax certification captures unobservable differences of auditors’ psychological cognitive base and values and unobservable selection choices by clients which cannot be fully controlled for by entropy balancing. Individual (non) tax consultants might select into specific audit firms or auditor career stages that might be associated with the results found as well as the unobservable characteristics for their decision to become chartered tax consultants. A tax certification is for sure only one of far more personal qualifications which affect individual auditors’ perceptions of situations and values influencing their strategic choices which can due to data restrictions not be controlled for in this study (Hambrick and Mason 1984). Additionally, very few of the control variables in the regression models are significant and some control variables show opposite directions in comparison to results revealed by prior U.S. studies. This might indicate differences of corporate tax law and influential factors on effective tax rates by German companies leading to <b>restricted</b> <b>transferability</b> of the results but leaves avenues for more evidence. Further, the common relatively low explanatory power indicates that much of the variation of effective tax rates is unexplained.|$|R

40|$|Group have {{proposed}} diagnosing personality disorders in part based on maladaptive trait dimensions. The work group initially described 37 maladaptive traits sorted rationally into six broader groups. Research operationalizing the DSM- 5 traits {{resulted in a}} condensed set of 25 trait scales that delineate five higher-order domains (Krueger, Derringer, Markon, Watson, & Skodol, 2011; Wright et al., 2012), listed in Table 1. These traits can be organized hierarchically as follows: negative affectivity (e. g., emotional lability, anx-iousness), detachment (e. g., withdrawal, anhedonia), antag-onism (e. g., manipulativeness, deceitfulness), disinhibition (e. g., impulsivity, irresponsibility), and psychoticism (e. g., eccentricity, unusual beliefs; Krueger et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2012). Four of the 25 traits cross-load on two domains in the DSM- 5 proposal. Each of these traits <b>shares</b> content <b>with</b> negative affectivity; three also <b>share</b> content <b>with</b> detachment (<b>restricted</b> affectivity, depressivity, suspicious-ness) and one <b>shares</b> content <b>with</b> antagonism (hostility). Notably, {{the structure of the}} maladaptive traits proposed for DSM- 5 bears clear resemblance to the structure of nor-mal personality as represented by the Five-Factor Model (FFM; Costa & McCrea, 1992). Specifically, DSM- 5 nega-tive affectivity appears akin to FFM neuroticism, DSM- 5 detachment to low FFM extraversion, DSM- 5 antagonisim to low FFM agreeableness, DSM- 5 disinhibition to low conscientiousness, and DSM- 5 psychoticism to FFM open-ness. This finding buttresses arguments that the FFM is capable of linking normal personality traits with disordered personality features (e. g., Widiger, 2011). Although previous research suggests that these models correspond at the level of higher-order factors in Belgian adolescents and young adults (De Fruyt, De Clercq, De Bolle, Markon, & Krueger, 2012), generalizability across cultures and FFM measures is currently unknown. The pur-pose {{of this study was to}} test the correspondence between the higher-order domains of the DSM- 5 and FFM trait mod-els in adults using a brief FFM rating form (Mullins-Sweatt, Jamerson, Samuel, Olson, & Widiger, 2006).
