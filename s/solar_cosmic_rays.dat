40|$|Under the {{assumption}} that the solar-flare bombardment of the irradiated grains of gas-rich meteorites occurred about 4. 5 b. y. ago on the parent body regoliths at 3 A. U., an estimate of the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray-produced Ne- 21 is made by studying etched pyroxene minera separates from both light and dark portions of the gas-rich meteorites Fayetteville and Kapoeta. Excesses of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> Ne- 21 were observed in dark portions of these meteorites, after accounting for their galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> Ne- 21 production and solar flare Ne- 21.

40|$|We have {{compared}} the abundances of galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> at their source and solar cosmic-rays utilizing new data {{which includes the}} first determination of the abundances of Na and Al in the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> population. We find the relative abundances of the solar and galactic species to be identical within experimental error for 8 elements. One clear abundance difference exists for C. He and Fe have a variable <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> abundance, and the unbiased abundance of both of these nuclei is also probably different than that in the galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> sources. We also {{have compared}} the <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> abundances with <b>solar</b> system and solar atmospheric abundance determinations. We find an abundance ratio which depends on the first ionization potential for galactic cosmic rays; however, in addition, we find this same dependence on ionization potential for <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> abundance ratios.

40|$|Abstract: The solar {{images are}} {{taken by the}} CCD {{detectors}} of the Sun monitoring satellites such as SOHO, TRACE, STEREO, SDO, and so on. The solar images are constructed after removing the traces of <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> on the raw CCD data files. Thus, while applying the method of removing the <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> traces, we can estimate the <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> flux by {{counting the number of}} traces. The <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux in the steady state might be the sum of the <b>solar</b> and galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> However, the abrupt change in the flux could be assumed to be originated from the Sun. Therefore, we can identify the solar origins of the sudden <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux changes from the phenomena shown in the processed solar images. The results using the data of SOHO/EIT are presented. The estimated <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux in the steady state is the anti-correlated with sunspot numbers, which shows the minima in <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux at the solar cycle maxima defined by the sunspot numbers. The profiles of estimated <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> associated with ground level enhancements observed by the ground neutron monitor have the significant increase in the <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux with good correlation. Thus, the solar images are valuable data useful in estimating the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> long term and transient flux variations...|$|R

5000|$|We {{can follow}} the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most {{volatile}} and primitive elements. The trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs {{in terms of their}} diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000). From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements ("volatile" [...] elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to be formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain [...] "matrix" [...] consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust. The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. Solar wind ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> A dust particle that originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40 AU would have many more times the density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt.|$|E
40|$|Discussion {{of solar}} cosmic ray {{phenomena}} and related topics from the solar physical point of view. Since <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> are usually produced by solar flares, {{it is necessary}} to understand the processes and mechanism of solar flares, especially the so-called proton flares, {{in order to understand the}} acceleration mechanism of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> and their behavior in both the solar atmosphere and interplanetary space. For this reason, a detailed discussion is given of various phenomena associated with solar flares, proton flare characteristics, and the mechanism of solar flares. Since the discovery of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> by Forbush, the interplanetary space has been thought of as a medium in which <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> propagate. The propagation of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> in this space is therefore discussed briefly by referring to the observed magnetic properties of this space. Finally, some problems related to the physics of galactic cosmic rays are discussed...|$|E
40|$|High-energy particles, the {{so-called}} <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays,</b> are often generated {{in association with}} solar flares, and then emitted into interplanetary space. These particles, consisting of electrons, protons, and other heavier nuclei, including the iron-group, are accelerated {{in the vicinity of}} the flare. By studying the temporal and spatial varation of these particles near the earth's orbit, their storage and release mechanisms in the solar corona and their propagation mechanism can be understood. The details of the nuclear composition and the rigidity spectrum for each nuclear component of the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> are important for investigating the acceleration mechanism in solar flares. The timing and efficiency of the acceleration process can also be investigated by using this information. These problems are described in some detail by using observational results on <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> and associated phenomena...|$|E
40|$|A general, {{numerical}} {{method for}} calculating activities of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> produced radionuclides {{at any point}} within an irregularly shaped lunar rock of known surface contour and lunar surface orientation is described. This method is then used to predict the activities of Mn- 53 andAl- 26 {{as a function of}} postion within lunar rock 68815 for various assumed values of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux (J), rigidity (R sub 0), and rock erosion rate (ER). The predicted activities agree with the measured activities of Kohl et al. (1978) when values of R sub 0 = 100 MV, J = 70 p/sq cm-sec (4 pi, E greater than 10 MeV), ER not greater than 1 mm/m. y. and a total exposure time of 2 m. y. are assumed. These values are in agreement with those found for rocks exposed for not less than 10 m. y. and provide no evidence for variation of the average <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> parameters between the last 2 and 10 m. y. intervals. When interpreted with the improved model the activity vs. depth profiles for three faces of 68815 show no evidence of SCR anisotropy or differential erosion...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{compelling}} similarity of impulsive nitrate enhancements observed in polar ice {{from the northern}} and southern hemispheres. This analysis concentrates on the period 1940 – 1950, during which time the first four recorded <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> ground-level enhancements (GLEs) occurred. GLEs are strong solar proton events. We show that large and sudden enhancements in the nitrate records from both hemispheres were observed within weeks following the recorded <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> ground-level event. The observation of impulsive nitrate enhancements simultaneously in both hemispheres shortly after a large fluence solar proton event is strong evidence in support of a causal connection and argues strongly for rapid transport of atmospheric nitrates generated through the polar atmosphere by energetic solar proton events...|$|R

40|$|The use of cosmogenic {{radionuclides}} in lunar {{materials as}} indicators of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> fluxes and thus solar activity over the past 10 million years is discussed. The nature of <b>solar</b> and galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> particles and their interactions with matter are reviewed, with particular emphasis on nuclide production by cosmic-ray-induced nuclear reactions. Evidence of galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> flux variations from measurements of radionuclide activities in meteorites is considered which has indicated changes of less than about 25 - 50 % {{over the last few}} million years. Measurements of radionuclide activities in lunar materials which are used to determine <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> fluxes are then examined together with direct proton measurements indicating variations in solar fluxes with different solar cycles. It is noted that whereas average solar proton fluxes determined for the last 1 - 10 million years from Al- 26 and Mn- 53 data show little variation and are similar to recent values, lunar C- 14 and Kr- 81 activities indicate average solar proton fluxes several times greater over the past 10, 000 to 100, 000 years...|$|R
40|$|A two-dimensional, {{time-dependent}} magnetohydrodynamic {{model is}} {{used to describe the}} possible mechanisms for the source of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> acceleration following a solar flare. The hypothesis is based on the propagation of fast mode MHD shocks following a sudden release of energy. In this presentation, the effects of initial magnetic topology and strength on the formation of MHD shocks have been studied. The plasma beta (thermal pressure/magnetic pressure) is considered as a measure of the initial, relative strength of the field. During dynamic mass motion, the Alfven Mach number is the more appropriate measure of the magnetic field's ability to control the outward motion. It is suggested that this model (computed self-consistently) provides the shock waves and the disturbed mass motion behind it as likely sources for <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> acceleration...|$|R
40|$|The {{neutrino}} flux {{detected in}} the C 1 -Ar experiment seems {{to respond to the}} powerful <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> bursts. The ground-based detectors, the balloons and the satellites detect about 50 % of the bursts of soalr <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> generated on the Sun's visible side. As a rule, such bursts originate from the Western side of the visible solar disk. Since the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> bursts are in opposite phase withthe 11 -year galactic <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> cycle which also seems to be reflected by neutrino experiment. The neutrino generation in the bursts will flatten the possible 11 -year behavior of the AR- 37 production rate, Q, in the Cl-Ar experiment. The detection of solar-flare-generated gamma-quanta with energies above tens of Mev is indicative of the generation of high-energy particles which in turn may produce neutrinos. Thus, the increased Q during the runs, when the flare-generated high energy gamma-quanta have been registered, may be regarded as additional evidence for neutrino geneation in the solar flare processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{acceleration}} phase of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> and relativistic electrons is studied {{on the basis}} of the observational data available on the optical, radio, X-ray, and particle events associated with the solar flare that occurred on July 7, 1966. The generating process of hydromagnetic shock waves which excited the type-II radio burst detected at a frequency below about 100 MHz is also discussed. The results of the study suggest that no secondary acceleration process after the explosive phase can contribute much to the generation of high energy particles. The ejection of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> and relativistic electrons seems to be related to the expansion of the magnetic bulge which can trap accelerated electrons from the triggering region of solar flares...|$|E
40|$|The {{charge and}} isotopic {{composition}} of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> potentially contain {{a wealth of}} information on the acceleration and confinement of energetic particles at the sun. As the experimental techniques have improved and with the increasing number of measurements, this potential is now being realized. It is convenient to divide the composition studies into three areas: (1) helium-iron, with energies above 10 MeV per nuc; (2) helium-iron, and the trans-iron elements, with energies below 2 MeV per nuc; (3) the isotopic composition. In the first area at energies above 10 MeV per nuc, the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> appear to provide a representative sample of the solar corona.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{observation of}} neutron - antineutron oscillations {{is one of}} the oldest problems of elementary-particle physics. However, the search for these processes in the laboratories on the Earth have thus far yielded no results. In this paper, we consider the possibility of finding n - ñ oscillations in the <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> at flare increases. There are two arguments in favour of such an approach to this problem: a long distance for a neutron run and a weak magnetic field in the solar cosmic-ray environment. Therefore, the presence of antinucleons in <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> may be a evidence of the existence of n - ñ oscillations.

Using appropiate SCR and GCR production rates, {{in the case of}} Pantar, for example, a GCR exposure age of 2 m. y. was estimated for Pantar-Dark while Pantar-Light yielded a GCR age of approx. 3 m. y. However the SCR exposure age of Pantar-Dark is two orders of magnitude higher than the average surface exposure ages of lunar soils.
