With Low-power Schottky (LS), internal resistance values were increased to reduce power consumption and increase switching speed over the original version. The introduction of Advanced Low-power Schottky (ALS) further increased speed and reduced power consumption.

40|$|H 2 -production from {{renewables}} using sunlight {{is probably}} the holy grail of modern science and technology. Among the many approaches for increasing reaction rates, by increasing light absorption, plasmonic materials are often invoked. Yet, most plasmonic metals on semiconductors are also good for Schottky barrier formation. In this work, we are presenting evidences of de-coupling the plasmonic from <b>Schottky</b> <b>effects</b> on photoreaction. To conduct this we have systematically changed the under-layer gold film thickness and associated particle size. On top of the thin film layer, we have deposited the exact amount of a prototypical Schottky-based photo-catalyst (Pd/TiO 2). We found up to 4 times increase in the H 2 -production rate at a critical Au film thickness (8  nm-thick). Below this thickness, the plasmonic response is not too strong while above it, the PR decays {{in favor of the}} Drude absorption mode. The reaction requires the presence of both UV (to excite the semiconductor) and visible light (to excite Au particles) in order to obtain high hydrogen production, 800  µmol/gCatal. min (probably the highest direct hydrogen (not current) production rate reported on a performing catalyst). The enhancement origin is quantitatively traced to its computed electric field strength (EFS). Adding a dielectric (SiO 2) in between the Au thin layer and the catalyst exponentially decreased the reaction rate and EFS, with increasing its thickness.
