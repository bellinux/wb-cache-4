5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E
5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{the library}} is an unusual shape from the outside, the architects' {{philosophy}} was to let the building's required functions dictate what it <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> rather than imposing a structure and making the functions conform to that.|$|E
25|$|Each of the EOBD fault codes {{consists}} of five characters: a letter, followed by four numbers. The letter {{refers to the}} system being interrogated e.g. Pxxxx would refer to the powertrain system. The next character would be a 0 if complies to the EOBD standard. So it <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> P0xxx.|$|E
25|$|As late as 1779, the War Board of Continental Congress {{had still}} not settled {{on what the}} Standard of the United States <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> The {{committee}} {{sent a letter to}} General Washington asking his opinion, and submitting a design that included the serpent, {{as well as a number}} corresponding to the state which flew the flag.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Baas; {{only then}} {{we do not know}} why they <b>should</b> all <b>look</b> <b>like</b> dead people--princes, some of them, by their dress--and walk upon the air a man's height from the ground." ...|$|R

25|$|Boeing {{used the}} Dash 80 on {{demonstration}} flights for airline executives and other industry figures. These {{focused attention on}} the question of what the cabin of a passenger jet <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> In a departure from its usual practice Boeing hired industrial design firm Walter Dorwin Teague to create a cabin as radical as the aircraft itself.|$|E
25|$|For a {{settlement}} of such size, New Belgrade has some unusual cultural characteristics, influenced by the Yugoslav communists' ideas how a new and modern city <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> If it can be understood why there were no churches built, a fact that a city of 250,000 has no theaters and only one museum (out of the residential area) is much less comprehensible, underlying the decades long Belgrader's feel of New Belgrade being nothing more but a big dormitory.|$|E
25|$|The cover art {{and other}} album artwork {{is based on}} a concept that Oakey wanted, that the album <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an edition of Vogue magazine. The final design is a joint effort between Philip Adrian Wright (also the band's {{director}} of visuals) and graphic designer Ken Ansell. Oakey is solo on the front cover with Sulley and Catherall on the internal gatefold, and the whole band on the reverse. The artwork has been reproduced in numerous forms for the various re-releases and sold as posters.|$|E

I shall finish it some day, when I've settled what sort of ghost is the most terrible--whether it <b>should</b> <b>look</b> solid, <b>like</b> a dead man come to life, or half transparent, like a mist." ...|$|R
25|$|Käßmann {{promotes}} larger {{emphasis on}} Christianity in the Protestant church, compared to past decades; for example, she is {{concerned by the}} fact that lessons for confirmation candidates focus more on cults and drugs than on the Bible. She argues for a clearer spiritual profile in church-run facilities, for example, more Bible stories being told in Protestant kindergartens rather than only secular songs being sung. In her opinion, children and adults should pray more, and churches <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> churches and not like noncommittal community centers.|$|E
25|$|Kotarō (actually Benten Kozō in disguise) then appears with an {{attendant}} (his fellow thief, Nangō Rikimaru in disguise), {{and the couple}} go into a nearby teahouse on the grounds; Senju has never before met Kotarō, and so {{has no reason to}} know what he <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> Meanwhile, Akaboshi Jūzaburō, another thief, attempting to swindle money intended for the memorial service from members of Senju's party, is discovered. A scuffle erupts, and the group rush to the teahouse, where Benten Kozō is attempting to obtain from Senju a valuable gold incense burner which was a gift to her from Kotarō's family. Tadanobu Rihei, yet another thief, disguised as an anonymous ronin, drives them away, and defuses the situation.|$|E
25|$|Marton and Canutt filmed {{the entire}} chariot {{sequence}} with stunt doubles in long shot, edited the footage together, {{and showed the}} footage to Zimbalist, Wyler, and Heston to show them what the race <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> and to indicate where close-up shots with Heston and Boyd should go. Seven thousand extras were hired to cheer in the stands. Economic conditions in Italy were poor at the time, and as shooting for the chariot scene wound down only 1,500 extras were needed on any given day. On June 6, more than 3,000 people seeking work were turned away. The crowd rioted, throwing stones and assaulting the set's gates until police arrived and dispersed them. Dynamite charges were used to show the chariot wheels and axles splintering {{from the effects of}} Messala's barbed-wheel attacks. Three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots.|$|E

So I will be speaking about positioning and other terms. In the second part, which is practical section, I am {{going to use this}} theoretical knowledge and put them in motion. There will be some graphs and charts which allows me to evaluate this business idea...|$|R
6000|$|So {{we settled}} on our method and {{principal}} character right away.

"Yes," [...] the Englishman muttered, [...] "there's {{no doubt}} about the likeness, though I suppose I <b>should</b> <b>look</b> more <b>like</b> you than I do if I'd taken care of myself. But I haven't. That's the devil of it. I've gone the other way; tried to chuck my life away and pretty nearly succeeded, too." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{disaster}} {{was all but}} officially forgotten until 2006, when {{historian and}} filmmaker Royd Anderson wrote and directed the documentary The Luling Ferry Disaster for his Master's thesis project in Communication at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The film was released on the 30th anniversary of the disaster and sparked a movement to bring a memorial for the victims and survivors to St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. Soon after the movie's release, on November 6, 2006, local government officials voted to have 2 memorials constructed, but the issue lost traction after those elected officials were not re-elected the following year. Anderson raised the issue again to the newly elected parish president and officials, bringing a score of relatives of the victims to a council meeting on January 28, 2009. A memorial committee led by St. Charles Parish Councilman Larry Cochran was formed soon afterwards, composed of {{family members and friends}} of the deceased, St. Charles Parish Council members, and concerned citizens, including Anderson. The committee met for several months, voting on where the monument should be placed and what it <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> St. Charles Parish Councilman Paul J. Hogan, an architect, created the design for the monument. Local suppliers, vendors, companies, and individuals donated the equipment, labor, and materials to build it. The memorial was unveiled in a solemn ceremony at the East Bank Bridge Park in Destrehan on October 17, 2009, with over 300 people in attendance. A bell rang as each name was called; a white balloon rose in memory of each of the deceased, and a blue balloon rose in memory of each of the survivors. By the end, 95 balloons were drifting slowly over the Mississippi River near the spot where the accident occurred.|$|E
500|$|Romney's {{wide margin}} of {{re-election}} as governor in November 1966 thrust {{him to the}} forefront of national Republicans. [...] In addition to his political record, the tall, square-jawed, handsome, graying Romney matched what the public thought a president <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> [...] Republican governors were determined not to let a Goldwater-sized loss recur, and neither Rockefeller nor Scranton wanted to run again; the governors quickly settled on Romney as their favorite for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1968 U.S. presidential election.|$|E
500|$|Wooller is {{a former}} honorary {{chancellor}} of the Irish International University. When the university was investigated by the BBC, Wooller {{told them that the}} university was not recognised anywhere and its website was [...] "a figment of someone's imagination. Someone's dreamt up what a university <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> and that's what's on the website." [...] He admitted that the university's operations were dodgy. Wooller had previously raised issues with Hardeep Singh Sandhu, the owner of the university, regarding its non-existent campus and accreditation by the Quality Assurance Commission, an organisation owned by Sandhu. Wooller's response to the BBC London investigation was published by Accountancy Age.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fourth and}} fifth {{characters}} are defined {{in the same way}} as the third, but using bits B7-B4 and B3-B0.

Hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F), while relatively rare, are allowed in the last 3 positions of the code itself.|$|R
500|$|The {{campaign}} emphasized Romney's highly profitable {{career in}} the business world and his stewardship of the Olympics. He also had political experience as a governor, together with a political pedigree courtesy of his father (as well as many biographical parallels with him). Ann Romney, who had become an advocate for those with multiple sclerosis, was in remission and would be an active participant in his campaign, helping to soften his political personality. Media stories referred to the [...] Romney as handsome. Moreover, a number of commentators noted that with his square jaw and ample hair graying at the temples, he physically matched one of the common images of what a president <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
500|$|He {{declared}} that [...] "Soviet government is {{many millions of}} times more democratic than the most democratic-bourgeois republic", the latter of which was simply [...] "a democracy for the rich". He regarded his [...] "dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] as democratic because, he claimed, it involved the election of representatives to the soviets, workers electing their own officials, and the regular rotation and involvement of all workers {{in the administration of}} the state. Lenin's belief as to what a proletariat state <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> nevertheless deviated from that adopted by the Marxist mainstream; European Marxists like Kautsky envisioned a democratically-elected parliamentary government in which the proletariat had a majority, whereas Lenin called for a strong, centralised state apparatus that excluded any input from the bourgeois.|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 2007, {{the crew}} began filming at Barrandov Studios in Prague. There, sets such as Miraz's castle, Aslan's How and the {{underground}} hiding places of the Narnians were created. The [...] castle {{was built to}} scale because Adamson felt he overused digital sets on the last film. The castle {{was built in the}} open air during winter, where the temperature would drop to minus 20°C. Miraz's courtyard is the largest set in production designer Roger Ford's career, including the previous Narnia film. Aslan's How was modified into the hideout after filming for those scenes was finished. To create Trufflehunter's den, Ford's crew put a camera inside a badger's den to study what it <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> The den's roof had to be raised by three inches because Ben Barnes was too tall.|$|E
40|$|With {{the success}} of {{scientific}} theories in describing events, most {{people have come to}} believe that God allows the universe to evolve according to a set of laws and does not intervene in the universe to break these laws.
