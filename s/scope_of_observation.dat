The novel of manners of wide scope in subject and theme was the province of Honoré de Balzac, who reported the complexity of industrial-age life in the 19th century, with realistic and descriptively detailed stories from private life, public life, and military life, as lived in the cities and towns of France.|$|E

We believe that part of the issue lies in the mismatch between PPC- and ground-based measurement approaches, including subjective judgement on behalf of ground crews: a topic that requires more investigation. Our work highlights the emerging value of UAV-based PPCs to complement, and in some cases supplement, traditional ground-based sources of measured vegetation structure...|$|E
40|$|Small-form-factor, {{low-power}} wireless sensors—motes—are {{convenient to}} deploy, but lack the bandwidth {{to capture and}} transmit raw high-frequency data, such as human voices or neural signals, in real time. Local filtering can help, but we show that the right filter settings depend on changing ambient conditions and network effects such as congestion, which makes them dynamic and unpredictable. Mote collection systems for high-frequency data must support iteratively-tuned, deployment-specific filter settings as well as fast sampling. VANGO, our software system for high-frequency data collection, achieves these goals via integrated processing across network tiers. Bandwidth-limited sensor nodes reduce data in network but rely on microservers, which have greater computational capabilities and a wider <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation,</b> to plan how. VANGO provides a cross-platform library for data transformation, measurement, and classification; a fast and low-jitter data acquisition system for motes; and a mechanism to control mote and microserver signal processing.

Certain dances limit themselves to the supporting elements of costumes, make-up, property (tools) and musical instruments; others equip with stages, decorations, and lightings. Traditional dances—in particular—extensively equip themselves with supporting elements to show its characteristics. Thus, since dance requires the supporting element of visuals, it is reasonable to observe it as similar to the way we observe the object of fine art.

30|$|The {{temporal}} {{dimension of}} assessments correlates {{with the system}} in focus, but especially with the driver a system is exposed to. Research into vulnerability and climate change exemplifies {{the need for a}} distinctive temporal <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> Research in this domain is driven by (at least) two theses: (1) It is widely assumed that climate change and the occurrence of extreme weather events correlate (for example, Kunreuther and Michel-Kerjan 2009). As a consequence, the scope of hazard and vulnerability assessment must include short-term, instantaneous events as well as long-term developments. Scientific estimations of significant changes in the dynamics of the climate system are in the range of decades and centuries (Lenton et al. 2008); (2) Any design and implementation of action plans must also consider distinctive temporal horizons in preparing for immediate threats or for the adaptation to long-term climate change as well as in responding to sudden weather events and using long-term mitigation strategies (Füssel 2007). For example, researchers call for multiple perspectives when analyzing large urban agglomerations: “A resilient community is one that maintains a current information base to understand potential hazards, and is well informed in the preparation and implementation of its future growth and improvement plans” (Prasad et al. 2009, p. 4).|$|E

We propose a classification that is consistent with the analysis and is in the span of time 2000 / 2007. The classification adopted for the {{analysis of the}} contributions of research exploits similar research carried out at the international level. By reading these studies we were able to process and define a model to interpret findings of the previous literature. An analysis of database information is useful to study: the type of investigation (case study, bibliographic, sectorial, generic, etc.) the branches of more diffused research (field production, retail, consumption, etc.), the types of adopted methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, etc.), the involvement among research groups (universities, public and private institutions, involvement of foreign researchers, etc.), the beneficiaries of research (pure research, policy makers, businesses, etc.). The results will be expressed on the basis of different approaches, tools and considering the possible exogenous variables affecting reality. The analysis will allow to identify the areas of research which involve the relationship between food and health and in which agri-food economists are more involved. In addition, we can describe the most promising areas of research which should be undertaken or strengthened. Attention will be placed also in highlighting the link between research and production in the broadest sense, to gather information about the level of its appropriateness...|$|E
40|$|Using {{examples}} {{from studies of}} dance clubs, the authors offer a solution {{for dealing with the}} problems of maintaining the optimal research distance in field investiga-tions. This method is based on teamwork, in which one researcher assumes the role of participant-as-observer and the other has the role of observer-as-participant. In addition to describing the developments of the two roles, the authors provide first-hand accounts of common pitfalls in fieldwork and how they have handled them. An ongoing issue in fieldwork in the social sciences is the dilemma of dis-tance. This dilemma arises from the contrasting stances of the investigator as both the participant and observer (Davis 1973; Lofland and Lofland 1984; Neuman 1997; Dewalt, Dewalt, and Wayland 1998; Angrosino and Mays de Perez 2000; Tedlock 2000). As a participant, the researcher attempts to get {{as close as possible to}} the group that he or she is studying to best understand it. Such an intense effort, however, could result in “going native ” or triggering reactivity (i. e., changing the setting by being in it). Furthermore, deep involvement may also limit the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> (for an alternative view, see Bernard 2000 : 323, 339; Dewalt, Dewalt, and Wayland 1998 : 280 – 84). On the other hand, while a detached observer, by maintaining a distance, may have the advantages of greater objectivity, less reactivity, and a broader perspective, he or she is not likely to achieve the quality of observation of a full participant. The richness of the data is likely to suffer. A pure observer is “essentially an outsider, a stranger to the field ” (Baker 1988 : 237). In an attempt to overcome the fear of being either too close or not close enough, textbooks on methods typically recommend a balance between observation and participation—the oft-cited participant-observation.

It is a very important thing to convert information from computer databases into normal human language. Sample data taken from features with the same backgrounds are used to compile different portfolios that investment companies and investment advisors can employ to satisfy the investor' needs. The method not only can provide decision-making rules, but also can offer alternative strategies for better data analysis.

40|$|As Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) {{become more}} {{technically}} capable and economically feasible, {{they are being}} increasingly used in a great many areas of defence, commercial and environmental applications. These applications are tending towards using independent, autonomous, ad-hoc, collaborative behaviour of teams or fleets of these AUV platforms. This convergence of research experiences in the Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) and Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) fields, along with the increasing Level of Automation (LOA) of such platforms, creates unique challenges to secure the operation and communication of these networks. The question of security and reliability of operation in networked systems has usually been resolved by having a centralised coordinating agent to manage shared secrets and monitor for misbehaviour. However, in the sparse, noisy and constrained communications environment of UANs, the communications overheads and single-point-of-failure risk of this model is challenged (particularly when faced with capable attackers). As such, more lightweight, distributed, experience based systems of “Trust” have been proposed to dynamically model and evaluate the “trustworthiness” of nodes within a MANET across the network to prevent or isolate the impact of malicious, selfish, or faulty misbehaviour. Previously, these models have monitored actions purely within the communications domain. Moreover, the vast majority rely on only one type of observation (metric) to evaluate trust; successful packet forwarding. In these cases, motivated actors may use this limited <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> to either perform unfairly without repercussions in other domains/metrics, or to make another, fair, node appear to be operating unfairly. This thesis is primarily concerned {{with the use of}} terrestrial-MANET trust frameworks to the UAN space. Considering the massive theoretical and practical difference in the communications environment, these frameworks must be reassessed for suitability to the marine realm. We find that current single-metric Trust Management Frameworks (TMFs) do not perform well in a best-case scaling of the marine network, due to sparse and noisy observation metrics, and while basic multi-metric communications-only frameworks perform better than their single-metric forms, this performance is still not at a reliable level. We propose, demonstrate (through simulation) and integrate the use of physical observational metrics for trust assessment, in tandem with metrics from the communications realm, improving the safety, security, reliability and integrity of autonomous UANs. Three main novelties are demonstrated in this work: Trust evaluation using metrics from the physical domain (movement/distribution/etc.), demonstration of the failings of Communications-based Trust evaluation in sparse, noisy, delayful and non-linear UAN environments, and the deployment of trust assessment across multiple domains, e. g. the physical and communications domains. The latter contribution includes the generation and optimisation of cross-domain metric composition or“synthetic domains” as a performance improvement method...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the social processes that produce more effective risk-takers in the practice of high-risk climbing. In a process of dispositional accumulation, climbers must undergo a change {{in the way that they}} perceive and embody vertical space. This extends the concept of ‘edgework’ (Lyng, 1990) into what I call critical necessity, where climbers become ‘committed’ and must continually remain engaged in specific and intense practices in order to return. The attributes of vertical space provide the perfect place to experience ‘social weightlessness’ (Bourdieu, 2000 : 14). Those who can enter this space are not screened by arbitrary social requisites but instead by the mountain itself. The distinction of entering this space comes with a genuine threat of injury and death. But the climbing field is protected through an interplay of illusio and a doxic misinterpretation of the shift between the epistemological basis of the field, and the ontological experience of climbing itself. Dispositions are argued to be developed through more than a simple transferral (Bourdieu, 1984 : 170) but instead can be acquired in a variety of ways that must be considered in their empirical context. Along with thirty five interviews, this research is based on eighteen months of multi-site ethnographic fieldwork with climbers engaged in high-risk rock climbing styles and ice, alpine and expeditionary climbing. The concept of habitus has been a guiding concept for this research, as it allows for a careful study of the dispositional attributes of the climbing body. Habitus has been used with a two-fold purpose. It is firstly used as a means of understanding how agents gain skills and orientate themselves to climbing practice. It has secondly been used, through the researchers own development, as a means of gaining greater embodied awareness of the social process required to become a climber. One of the crucial insights habitus offers is its improvisational and generative components. This is useful for exploring climbing practice, as climbing lacks organisational structures that guide its practitioners with authority – yet climbers maintain regularity. However, habitus is shown to have shortcomings in dealing with accounts of the individual in action because it has been theorised with an insensitivity to the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> and analysis. In order to address this, the concept of the embodied echo is introduced as a means to explore the more radically embodied and experiential components of habitus. Through the use of echoes as an allegory for the construction of dispositions, it is possible to give specific accounts to the processes of dispositional acquisition, mutation and activation. In effect, it functions as a theory of the habitus in motion...|$|E

40|$|Problem: Planners may read plans often, but the {{profession}} continues {{to view the}} interpretation of plan content as something that is either too obvious or too unimportant to require explicit discussion. Plans are seldom adequately interpreted. This is regrettable because plans contain a rich variety of content and meaning. Purpose: This article calls for planners to “read through” plans, not just to grasp their essential ideas or the means of implementing those ideas, but also to perceive additional levels of meaning relating to a) a plan's place within a larger intellectual sphere, b) a plan's statement on {{the social and political}} values of the time, and c) a plan {{as a part of the}} history of the planning profession and the life of cities. Methods: I propose a visual approach to plan reading descended from Panofsky's (1939) theory of iconology and use this to examine three very different plans that describe different size cities (small, large, very large) during different periods over the past 80 years (the 1930 s, 1960 s, 2000 s). I analyze three levels of meaning in each plan: its factual meaning, or “plain sense” (Mandelbaum, 1990); its contextual meaning, or relation to political, social, economic, and physical conditions; and its temporal meaning, or setting within the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> made by other plan readers in the perspective of elapsed time. Results and conclusions: Factual readings show that information may be found in diverse aspects of a plan document, from seemingly superficial aspects like its cover to unarguably central elements such as recommendations. Factual readings depend on understanding the relationships among different elements, and reveal information about the plan and its framers that may not otherwise be readily apparent. Contextual readings show us that plan recommendations are as much a product of contemporary conditions and norms as they are of plan-specific “survey and diagnosis” (Nolen, 1936). This raises the question of whether plan quality is to be judged only in terms of skillful execution of concerns of the day or whether innovation is also important. Temporal readings reveal that plans and planning have changed dramatically over time, simultaneously confirming and questioning the conventional wisdom of planning history. Takeaway for practice: Many planners read plans on a regular basis, and plans continue to constitute the major printed currency of the planning profession. Both plans and planning will benefit if planners become more discerning readers of {{the profession}}'s principal idea vessels. Formal plan interpretation is rare, but each planner can become a better plan interpreter...|$|R

In this paper, we consider a different sensing model using uncoordinated mobile nodes whose mobility is not directed for any specific sensing activity. Instead, a node independently observes {{a cross section of}} the field along its own path. The limited <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> a node can be greatly extended via information exchange among collaborating nodes coming across each other. In this model, the inherently noisy nature of mobile measurements, incomplete <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> individual node <b>observations,</b> different sensing objectives, and collaboration policies must be addressed. The paper proposes a design framework for uncoordinated mobile sensing and a sensing approach based on profile estimation that is useful for target detection, field estimation, and edge detection. With simulations, relative performance measures are compared with typical solutions utilizing stationary sensors and controlled mobile sensors to illustrate their relative strengths and tradeoffs.

Über das zuletzt 2003 und 2006 fortgeschriebene Landesentwicklungsprogramm ist auch die Raumbeobachtung den Zielen der Nachhaltigkeit mit den Dimensionen Umwelt, Wirtschaft und Soziales verpflichtet. Nachhaltigkeit stellt damit den inhaltlichen Bezugspunkt dar. Schließlich wird mit dem Stichwort „Entbürokratisierung“ der institutionelle Bezugspunkt bzw. Rahmen beschrieben, vor dem die Bemühungen der Raumbeobachtung um eine inhaltliche Weiterentwicklung immer wieder auf den Prüfstand gestellt werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird der Aufbau des Informationssystems der Landesentwicklung in Bayern beschrieben, seine inhaltliche Ausrichtung dargestellt und seine Anpassungsfähigkeit an neue Entwicklungen beleuchtet. The term “monitoring” {{is used to}} {{describe}} the methodological point of reference in a field of conflicting interests in which spatial observation in Bavaria currently finds itself. Under both the 2003 and 2006 revisions to the State Development Programme, spatial observation is now also bound to the environmental, economic and social dimensions of the goal of sustainable development. “Sustainability” thus represents the material point of reference. Finally, the phrase “cutting bureaucracy” refers to the institutional point or frame of reference which is the backdrop against which all attempts to develop the substantive <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>observation</b> have to be constantly reassessed. In this context the author describes the design of an information system for state-level spatial development in use in Bavaria, focusing both on its substantive coverage and its adaptability to take account of new developments...|$|R

It is often descriptively noted that apposition is scopeless {{in the sense that}} its content escapes the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> any operators that occur in the sentence the appositive is anchored in. I focus on exceptions to that characterisation and compare to what extent existing formal semantic analyses of apposition offer a handle on such exceptions. I then propose an analysis that predicts–rightly it turns out–that the exceptional cases, where appositives occur in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> amatrix operator, are part of a general pattern. Unfortunately, this analysis also over-generates severely. This issue, however, offers a newinsight in the interaction between the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the appositive and the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> its anchor. A final set <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> ultimately suggests that for a full understanding of appositive semantics {{it may be necessary to}} acknowledge the heterogeneity of the class of appositive constructions...|$|R
