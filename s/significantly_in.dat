40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} unilateral PIC and specific dentofacial parameters. Materials and methods A sample of 216 subjects, with 108 subjects in the retrospective and prospective samples respectively. Dental parameters: The following dental parameters were assessed: Inter-canine and intermolar width; palatal depth and palatal area; anterior Bolton tooth-size discrepancy (TSD); maxillary arch shape and ratio and maxillary central and lateral incisor shape and ratio. Facial parameters: Three-dimensional (3 D) images were taken for subjects in the prospective sample only, and {{were used to assess}} the following facial parameters: Face shape; face ratio and 3 D distances and angles. Results Dental parameters: Inter-canine width was <b>significantly</b> smaller <b>in</b> the test group compared to the control group in the retrospective (p= 0. 0002) and prospective (p= 0. 0018) samples respectively. Anterior Bolton TSD was <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> the prospective test group compared to controls (p= 0. 0070). Arch ratio was <b>significantly</b> smaller <b>in</b> the test group than the control group for the retrospective sample (p= 0. 0029), whereas no significant difference was recorded in the prospective sample (p= 0. 1017). Arch shape distribution was <b>significantly</b> different <b>in</b> the retrospective sample (p= 0. 009).

40|$|Background: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) {{may create}} some {{difficulties}} in the differential diagnosis of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) and of EORA with PMR-like onset (EORA/PMR). Aim: To investigate possible differences between three groups of patients, with regard to serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and steroidal hormones at baseline and after 1 month of treatment with glucocorticoids (prednisone 7. 5 - 12. 5 mg/day). Patients and methods: 14 patients with PMR, 15 with EORA and 14 with EORA/PMR, as well as 15 healthy, matched controls were analysed. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin (IL) 6, IL 1 receptor antagonist (IL 1 Ra), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and 17 -hydroxy-progesterone (PRG) were evaluated. Results: Serum levels of both TNF alpha and IL 6 were <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> all three groups of patients than in controls (p < 0. 01). Serum IL 6 levels were <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> patients with both PMR and EORA/PMR than in patients with EORA (p < 0. 05). IL 1 Ra serum levels were <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> patients with EORA than in controls (p < 0. 001) and in patients with PMR and EORA/PMR (p < 0. 05). DHEAS was <b>significantly</b> lower <b>in</b> patients with EORA/PMR than in those with EORA (p < 0. 05). PRG was <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> all patient groups (p < 0. 05).
