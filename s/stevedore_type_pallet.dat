40|$|In this study, we {{manufactured}} {{three types}} of the wooden flat pallet with different {{in the number of}} sheets of the top board of the backside. First type (7 – 7 type); the number of sheets of the top board of the backside was seven pieces. Second type (7 – 5 type); the number of that was five pieces. Third type (7 – 3 type); the number of that was three pieces. The number of the surface of three types was all seven pieces. In the manufacturing, the staggered connections using sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) compressed–dowel were applied to the pallet, and the evaluation test in accordance with Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS Z 0602) was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: The pallet weight became small in decreasing the number of sheets of the top board and the difference of the weight was about 6 kgf (20 %). The bend rate in the bending test for each <b>type</b> <b>pallet</b> was smaller than 2. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. The residual bend rate in the bending test for each <b>type</b> <b>pallet</b> was also smaller than 0. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. Therefore, it was confirmed that the condition as the pallet of both the bend rate and the residual bend rate was cleared. In each <b>type</b> <b>pallet,</b> the condition as the pallet in the change rate of the diagonal length in the fall down test was cleared because the change rate of the each value was smaller than 3 % of the standard value of JIS. The remarkable difference of the withdrawal strength of each <b>type</b> <b>pallet</b> in the pull–out test for the staggered connections using sugi compressed dowel was not recognized. Moreover, it became clear that approximately 56 minutes in manufacturing process of one pallet can be shortened and the manufacturing cost can be decreased because four top boards of the backside of the pallet were decreased...|$|R

Environmental performance of three different <b>types</b> of <b>pallets</b> such as Re-load, plastic and corrugated fibreboard pallets are evaluated in this project. LCA tool is used to assess and compare their environmental performance in all phase of their life cycle but more focusing on end of life phase.   This study gives more emphasis to waste treatment options such as incineration, landfilling and recycling. Three different end of life scenarios {{have been used in}} this study such as 100 % incineration, 100 % landfilling and 100 % recycling.   This study includes results of all the phases of all three <b>types</b> of <b>pallets</b> which are analysed in this report. More detailed results could be seen in excel sheets. Results of impact analysis tells that landfilling contributes to 14793 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential in case of corrugated pallets. Incineration contributes to 12148. 6 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Recycling contributes to 7136 Kg CO 2 of global warming. Re-load pallets show the major contribution of global warming is from landfilling approx 813. 2 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Recycling and incineration contribute to 438 Kg CO 2 and 726. 7 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential respectively. In plastic case incineration contributes the most to global warming approximate 1183. 8 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Landfilling and recycling contribute almost the same approximate 932. 6 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential and 924. 5 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential respectively. Acidification impact show corrugated pallets cause high emissions when they are treat with landfilling and give negative values of incineration. In Eutriphication impact corrugated pallets are considered better in a sence they are inbetween 150 and 100 kg of PO- 4. Re-load pallets give the least values when they are applied to different end of life scenarios.   According to the results recycling could be replace other waste treatment options because of less impact through out the end of life.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{has been}} around for roughly 40 years, yet the {{technology}} has not been widely implemented. Bar codes currently dominate supply chains as the main method for tracking asset, but RFID has the potential to completely remove the need for bar codes. While bar codes need to be individually scanned RFID tagging allows for instantaneous scanning of complete pallet loads. This drastically reduces the amount of time and labor needed to monitor and track assets throughout supply chains. Yet, at this time RFID tagging is unable to be adopted by the majority of manufacturers due to the high cost of readability. RFID tag readability is easily influenced by the surrounding environment. As such, the consistencies of modern RFID systems vary greatly in relation to their operating environment. In order for RFID to move towards complete adoption, tag readability needs to be consistent throughout all environment situations while remaining cost effective. This study was focused on the evaluation of Sirit Technology’s Electronic Transfer Device (ETD) as a possible solution for cost effectively improving tag readability in supply chain conditions. In order to simulate actual supply chain conditions, the ETD was tested with different product <b>types,</b> <b>pallet</b> orientations and forklift speeds.

The total life-cycle environmental impact of pallets depends on materials, manufacturing, handling processes, and the disposal practice (end-of-life). Plastic pallets can be lighter and might last longer but their manufacturing processes are energy intensive and could contribute significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, wooden pallets can be cheaper and easily repaired but present a shorter life.
