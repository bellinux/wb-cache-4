50|$|Couplers are the {{fittings}} which {{hold the}} tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, {{and there are}} three basic types: right-angle couplers, putlog <b>couplers</b> and <b>swivel</b> <b>couplers.</b> To join tubes end-to-end joint pins (also called spigots) or sleeve couplers are used. Only right angle <b>couplers</b> and <b>swivel</b> <b>couplers</b> {{can be used to}} fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{couplers}} previously mentioned, right-angle couplers join ledgers or transoms to standards, putlog {{or single}} couplers join board bearing transoms to ledgers - Non-board bearing transoms should be fixed using a right-angle <b>coupler.</b> <b>Swivel</b> <b>couplers</b> are to connect tubes {{at any other}} angle. The actual joints are staggered to avoid occurring {{at the same level}} in neighbouring standards.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the characteristics of a family of space structures that are referred to as 'nexorades'. Typically, a nexorade is constructed from scaffolding tubes, connected together with <b>swivel</b> <b>couplers.</b> An important application of nexorades is for shelters of various sizes and shapes for temporary or permanent purposes. In such a shelter, the structural skeleton is provided by a nexorade and the cover is provided by a membrane material...|$|R
5000|$|The swivel adapter, more {{commonly}} referred to as a <b>swivel</b> <b>coupler</b> or swivel hitch, functions by connecting one end to the trailer tongue and the other end directly to the hitch on the tow vehicle or to a coupler. This mechanism is engineered to rotate on the vertical axis so as to eliminate the possibility of coupler binding. As a result, the motorcyclist is able to lean into a turn as far as necessary at high speeds while keeping the trailer upright.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A series Anti-slipping {{tests on}} steel pipe joints with <b>swivel</b> <b>coupler</b> {{were carried out}} in this paper. Sixteen {{specimens}} after turnover loaded, were tested to investigate the influence of variations in the Fastener tightening torque (Tr, from 20 to 40 N·m), fastener turnover frequency (N, from 10 to 50) and turnover loading amplitude (△P, from 4. 0 to 8. 0 kN) on the anti-slipping performance of steel pipe joints with <b>swivel</b> <b>coupler.</b> The experimental results showed that, the anti-slipping ultimate strength and stiffness of specimens were increased first and then decreased with increasing Tr or N, and decreased with increasing △P. The <b>swivel</b> <b>coupler</b> turnover should not exceed the number of 20, and the force of diagonal bracing bearing should less than 6 kN...|$|E

The Energy Group includes three divisions: Petroleum Pump, Nash, and EMCO Wheaton. The Petroleum Pump Division designs, manufactures, tests and markets a diverse range of pumps for the oil & gas industry. Nash is the leader in liquid ring vacuum pumps. The Emco Wheaton Division designs, manufactures and installs a wide range of solutions for the loading and unloading of almost any liquid and compressed gas products from river barges, ships and oceangoing supertankers. In addition, Emco Wheaton and Todo <b>swivel</b> joints, Dry-Break <b>couplers</b> and adapters, off-highway fueling systems and grounding equipment are all used within bunkering applications; the transfer of oil via hoses, pipelines, or loading arms for the purpose of providing fuel or lubricants to a tank vessel or nontank.|$|R
