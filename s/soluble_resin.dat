40|$|Aesthetics {{and design}} have become {{critical}} factors for the jewelry industry, especially considering that product value no longer concerns just precious metal content but {{is more and}} more related to fashion trends, innovative design concepts, and new artistic expressions. In the last decade the jewelry industry has therefore shown an increasing interest in innovation, both in terms of design and production capabilities. Digital modeling is becoming essential, allowing designers to fully express themselves. This powerful technique is completely exploited only when coupled to innovative production processes and materials. Designers then have to analyze and further deepen their knowledge of new processes in order to shape their ideas, using technical and constructive parameters completely different from traditional handicraft criteria. Their intensive use is leading to better application of new technologies, taking full advantage of all possible potentials. The aim of this work is to analyze a real-case scenario and to show an example of the "idea to product" path, mainly taking into account technology options and their feasibility and effectiveness.

40|$|The {{development}} and characterization of fluoroaryl functionalized organic-inorganic hybrid polymers for optical waveguide applications is presented. The materials are prepared from organoalkoxysilanes in a two-step process. The {{first step is}} {{the formation of the}} inorganic polysiloxanc network by hydrolysis and polycondensation in order to obtain a <b>soluble</b> <b>resin.</b> This can be mixed with a photo initiator and applied onto a substrate as a photo-sensitive film. Micro patterns (waveguides with core and cladding) are then manufactured in a second step by exposure to UV-light through a mask. The polymers are characterized with respect to application in the fabrication of telecom optical waveguide devices. Thus, special attention is turned to optical losses in the telecom wavelengths at 1310 nm and 1550 nm as well as to refractive indices. During all stages of ORMOCER® preparation, structure-property correlations are deduced from presented characterization data. Various spectro scopic tools give an insight into network structures of polycondensate resins and cured hybrid polymer samples. 29 Si-NMR in particular is used for the quantitative analysis of siloxane species. With the aid of molecular modeling, structural characteristics of oligomeric intermediates as determined by experiment are visualized. ORMOCER® resins with low optical losses of 0. 28 dB/cm at 1310 nm and 0. 42 dB/cm at 1550 nm, respectively, are prepared. Subsequent micropatterning by means of photolithography results in waveguide and other test patterns.

40|$|The {{operation}} {{and performance of}} anaerobic digesters treating thermomechanical pulping wastewater was investigated. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} reactor design that could successfully treat the wastewater with minimal pretreatment. Six reactors were trialed, all modifications of the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket [UASB] reactor design. Seed sludge source, start-up regime and suspended solids retention were varied to determine effective operation methodology. A screw press effluent from Pan Pacific Forestry Industries Ltd thermomechanical pulp [TMP] mill at Whirinaki, North Island, New Zealand was used as feed for all of the reactors. Seed sludge was obtained in granular form from UASB reactors treating dairy industry wastewaters and in nongranular form from the aerated lagoons of the New Zealands central North Island pulp mills. Operation of all six experimental reactors was difficult due to many feed blockages caused by the relatively high suspended solids concentration in the feed. Inhibition was frequently observed after feed interruptions with slow recovery of performance, possibly {{due to the lack of}} a co-metabolite soon after the feed supply ceased. Many modifications to the reactor inlet and feed system greatly reduced blockage problems. In the later reactors a low suspended solids retention allowed granulation to be achieved from a non-granular forestry industry sludge. With the final reactor configuration total COD removals of 50 - 60 % and dissolved COD removals of 70 - 85 % were achieved at organic loading rates up to 40 kgCOD. m- 3. d- 1. A 20 to 50 % conversion of feed suspended solids to methane was calculated on a COD basis. Granulation was achieved without a gas-solids-separator. This was attributed to the need for severe selection against poorly settling wood suspended solids, and the presence and precipitation of iron. The granules were approximately 37 % iron on a dry weight basis and had densities averaging 2000 kg. m- 3. Scanning electron microscope work indicated that extensive precipitates, presumed to be iron based complexes, were responsible for the structural integrity of the granule. An abundant layer of bacteria of predominantly Methanothrix morphotypes was found beneath the surface of the granules. The granules have been demonstrated to provide some protection from inhibition, probably by diffusional gradients. After five years exposure to TMP wastewater a dissolved extract of feed resin acids exerted an inhibitory effect on granules at similar concentrations to that reported for dehydroabietic acid with unacclimated granules. Thus no acclimation to <b>soluble</b> <b>resin</b> acids was evident. Changes in the distribution of resin acids suggested that some degree of resin acid dissolution occurs within the reactors but degradation of the total concentration of resin acids is poor, averaging 10 % reduction as total acids. Overall, the final reactor design has proved to be an effective treatment of TMP wastewater. Suspended solids removal rates are not high but equally the suspended solids do not threaten the viability of the reactor system. Changes in the nature of the suspended solids passing through the reactor are such that subsequent suspended solids removal will be more efficient and have a lower loading rate than for the untreated wastewater. The reactor has demonstrated a high degree of ability to accept large variations in feed rate and strength and still function efficiently. The work has produced the basis for a successful primary reactor design for the treatment of a problem wastewater and the necessary information on which a pilot scale plant could be designed for high suspended solids wastewaters. A possible method for the cultivation of granules in difficult wastewaters has been identified...|$|E
50|$|Hash oil is {{an extract}} that is formed when a solvent, {{commonly}} including; butane, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, hexane, or toluene, {{is used as}} to dissolve THC concentrations. The plant particulates are filtered out and then the solvent carrying the <b>soluble</b> <b>resins</b> is evaporated or purged under vacuum. The resultant oil may have a high THC content (depending on the parent material) and is used in various cannabis-based products or smoked or vaporized as a concentrate. Delta 9 THC (D9 THC) is strongly soluble in petroleum ether and less so in ethanol. Adding petroleum ether to the tincture will extract D9 THC, leaving water-soluble chemicals in the ethanol (certain cannabinoids, proteins, chlorophyll, etc.). Butane is a more selective solvent which typically carries lower amounts of undesired solubles, resulting in a more pure THC. Alcohol is less selective than butane, carrying other types of plant matter such as chlorophylls and lipids, resulting in a less pure hash oil, freezing the plant matter prior to making hash from alcohol can prevent some chlorophyll from being carried. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has also been used to extract hash, but special laboratory equipment is needed since CO2 only functions as a solvent under high pressure.|$|R

Comparisons were made as to wettability, viscosity, surface tension, the ability to clean the plate, the resistance to scum, printing sharpness, resolution, and the plate-press characteristic curve. The experiments were made under controlled conditions; the only variable being one ingredient of the fountain solution. The properties of each solution were discussed and reported.

Poly (ethylene oxide) is comparable in regard to the ability to clean the plate, resistance to scum, and printing sharpness. The gum arabic solution gives better resolution.

These polymers are composed of a monomer repeat unit, [R-SiO{sub 1. 5 }]{sub n}, with a single silicon atom attached to other repeat units in the polymer through one to three siloxane bonds. The remaining substituent is an organic group attached to the silicon through a silicon-carbon single bond. Silsesquioxanes {{have been the subject of}} intensive study in the past and are becoming important again as a vehicle for introducing organic functionalities into hybrid organic-inorganic materials through sol-gel processing. Despite all of this interest, there has not been a systematic study of the ability of trialkoxysilanes to form gels through the sol-gel process. In fact, it has been noted that silsesquioxanes are generally isolated as <b>soluble</b> <b>resins</b> rather than the highly crosslinked network polymers (gels) one would expect from a tri-functional monomer.

This cofactor {{is formed}} from a tyrosine residue through a self-catalytic mechanism {{with the participation}} of the copper ion at the active site. Although pathways have been postulated for topaquinone biogenesis, portions of this scheme are still unclear. We utilized 4 -tert-butyl-derived models for the putative intermediates of topaquinone generation and studied the effect of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions on each autoxidative step from dopa-to topaquinone-like compounds at physiological pH (7. 4). Several polyvinyl-alcohol-based <b>soluble</b> <b>resins</b> bearing mono-and di-hydroxyphenolic moieties were also pre pared, and their tendency to give hydroxyquinonic structures when incubated at alkaline pH values was investigated. Our results confirm (although indirectly) the formation of dopa and dopaquinone during topaquinone biosynthesis. Moreover, we collected evidence that, following the formation of dopa, the role of the active-site copper ion in topaquinone biogenesis would be limited to the catalysis of the two subsequent quinonization steps (i. e. from dopa to dopaquinone and from topa to topaquinone), thus disfavoring the possibility of a direct intervention of the metal ion in the hydroxylation of dopaquinone. In particular, Cu(II) was shown to influence deeply the autoxidation of 1, 2, 5 -trihydroxy- 4 -tert-butylbenzene, used as model of topa, both increasing the reaction rate and changing its mechanism. The mechanistic implications of these findings for the biogenesis of topaquinone and its analogs at the active site of various amine oxidases are discussed...|$|R

Experiments were conducted using resins with different epoxy resin-to-water (ER/W) ratios. The results indicate that the epoxy resins improve the physical and mechanical properties of sand significantly, and if successfully grouted into a formation, the resins could provide a suitable solution for the stabilization of foundation material. Based on the experimental results, a nonlinear regression analysis was performed to correlate the mechanical properties and permeability with curing time and ER/W ratio.

40|$|Electrodeposition {{of paint}} {{has become one}} of the {{effective}} methods of application of coatings. It has several advantages over conventional paint application methods, the most important one being the control of pollution, since water is the main solvent used in the process in place of toxic organic solvents. Both anodic and cathodic processes have been developed, but the latter has clear cut advantages over the former, because, in cathodic process, the substrate dissolution can be avioded, which helps in eliminating the threat of coating discoloration and also the bath instability. Epoxy resins are well known for their corrosion protective properties. In the present work, water <b>soluble</b> epoxy <b>resin</b> is prepared by modifying with amine for getting cathode systems. The resin, on dissolution in water by adding organic acids, could be cathodically deposited. The studies made with the cathodic epoxy resin with and without pigmentation and also the evaluation of the electrocoating are detailed in this pape...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{modified}} {{black wattle}} tannin as an antifouling pigment is {{reported in this}} work. A mixture of tannin adsorbed in activated carbon (soluble fraction of tannin) and low soluble fraction of tannin {{was used as an}} antifouling pigment. The <b>soluble</b> rosin <b>resin</b> was used as a paint matrix. C- 13 NMR analysis confirm the modification of black wattle tannin through the cleavage of tannin interflavonoid bonds. FTIR spectra indicate the presence of tannin in the formulated antifouling coating even after 7 months of its exposure in a marine environment. Water contact angle analysis shows the hydrophilic characteristic of the tannin antifouling coating surface. Immersion tests at Badalona Port in the Mediterranean Sea shows the high antifouling efficiency of the TAN coating, comparable to commercial paint, until 7 months. The use of a natural black wattle tannin, without its complexation with metals, can eliminate the release of metals and other toxic biocides to the marine environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} the {{successful}} fabrication of micro-sized pillar arrays of Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 TiO 3 (BST) electroceramics via cost effective epoxy gel casting (EGC) consolidation method based on the in situ polymerization of aqueous suspensions with added water <b>soluble</b> epoxy <b>resin.</b> The synthesized BST solid solution powder was fine milled and surface protected against hydrolysis to avoid its degradation in the aqueous environment. The micro patterning process was divided in the following steps: (i) production of high quality SU- 8 master moulds by photolithography and of the respective negative replicas in PDMS (soft mould); (ii) casting of stable high solid loading BST suspensions in the soft moulds with added setting agents followed by de-moulding, drying and sintering. Patterned array of hexagonal shaped pillars with 320 mu m of height and side length similar to 40 mu m were obtained with smooth side wall features along height. Various structural, mechanical and electrical properties of BST material after sintering were also measured to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed aqueous processing route.

The methods of modification are discussed, consisting of the introduction of polar hydrophilic groups such as carboxylic and sulfonic ones (sodium 5 -sulfonatoisophthalic acid) into the resin molecule, which ensure good tolerance with water. Instead of styrene, glycerol monoethers of allyl alcohol and unsaturated fatty alcohols were used as reactive built-in crosslinking monomers for resin modification. The influence of the resin composition and method of synthesis on the dispersion stability and properties of photocurable lacquer coatings obtained from the waterborne resins were investigated...|$|R

Porous polyacenic semiconductor carbon (PPAS) {{materials were}} prepared by heat treatment of phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin doped with different {{contents of a}} foaming agent (ZnCl(2)) at lower temperatures (500 similar to 900 degrees C) in inert gas atmosphere. The structure of the synthesized materials was characterized by means of FTIR, XRD, TG, SEM and other analysis methods. The effects of the foaming agent oil the structure of PPAS were studied in detail. The experimental results Showed that doping the foaming agent, on one hand, could increase the dehydration speed of pyrolysis processing of PF resin, and decrease the pyrolysis temperatures {{of it at the}} same time; on the other hand, the structures changed greatly in crystallite sizes and interlayer spaces for doped pyrolysis materials. Furthermore, when PF resin was doped with the foaming agent, the pyrolysis materials showed the ball or ellipsoid states, however, the un-doped pyrolysis materials showed the bulky and amorphous states with sharp edges and angles. The surface area measurements (BET method) showed that when resin-ZnCl(2) ratio was 1 : 3 (mass ratio), and the speed of heat treatment, 30 degrees C/h, and the pyrolysis temperature, 600 degrees C, the specific surface area could increase to 2150 m(2) center dot g(- 1), and the average diameter of the powders got to 11 angstrom...|$|R
40|$|A resin monomer-soluble polyrotaxane (PRX) {{crosslinker}} with cleavable end {{groups was}} synthesized to develop degradable photosetting composite resins. The PRX containing 50 α-cyclodextrins (α-CDs) with disulfide end groups was initially modified with n -butylamine {{to obtain a}} resin monomer-soluble PRX. The PRX containing 13 n -butyl groups per α-CD molecule was completely <b>soluble</b> in conventional <b>resin</b> monomers such as 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA). The synthesized n -butyl-containing PRX was further modified with 2 -aminoethyl methacrylate to provide crosslinkable acrylic groups onto PRX. The prepared resin monomer-soluble PRX crosslinker was successfully polymerized {{with a mixture of}} HEMA and UDMA to provide photosetting plastic. It was confirmed that the Vickers hardness of the prepared plastic was greatly decreased after treatment with dithiothreitol.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study characterizes and {{evaluates the}} effects of a {{thermoplastic}} polyester preform binder on a thermosetting vinyl ester resin. It was observed that the binder material is <b>soluble</b> in the <b>resin</b> and that the dissolution of the binder drastically affects the viscosity of the resin. It was determined that the binder can significantly delay the gel time, and influence the reaction kinetics of the resin. Additionally, results show that the binder concentration and extent of dissolution affect the mechanical and thermophysical properties of the resin. Higher binder concentrations and larger dissolution times resulted in increased tensile strengths, elongations, and glass transition temperatures of the matrix resin. In order to characterize binder dissolution times, an experimental technique was introduced in which the binder dissolution is correlated to increases in the resin viscosity. The results from this study quantify the affects of thermoplastic polyester binders on vinyl ester resin and provide the basis for refining the processing window o...|$|R
40|$|Silicic acid is a water <b>soluble</b> {{colloidal}} <b>resin</b> {{which can}} be obtained commercially. The effect of silicic acid as a desensitizer in fountain solution was studied. The resin of this colloidal solution was compared to gum arabic solution. The study included {{the investigation of the}} physical properties of the solution at different concentrations as well as press performance. Comparisons were drawn regarding wettability, viscosity, surface tension, dot size change, minimum dampening rate to clean-up the non-image areas, resolution, resistance to scum, blinding of image areas, rate of de-inking over- run non-image areas, performance distinction between lithium silicate and sodium silicate, and changes with aging in solubility properties of silicates in fountain solutions. The experiments were carried out under carefully controlled conditions; the only variable present was one ingredient of the fountain solution. The concentration of the necessary solution was determined. The effect of concentration was discussed and reported. A considerable number of the results were statistically analyzed by the two factor analysis of variance. The effectiveness of silicic acid solution as a substitute for gum arabic solution varied. Silicic acid is comparable in regard to the ability of the solution to clean the plate with minimum number of sheets, resistance to scum, resolution, and blinding of image areas. Performance distinctions between lithium silicate and sodium silicate and solubility properties of silicates with aging were noted. Gum arabic produces smaller changes in dot size and does not blind images as quickly as silicic acid does. The advantages of silicic acid are good resistance to bacterial attack, longer shelf life, and better wetting of the plate than gum arabic when properly diluted...|$|R
40|$|A {{modicum of}} {{progress}} has been made in an effort to exploit single-walled carbon nanotubes as fibers in epoxy-matrix/fiber composite materials. Two main obstacles to such use of carbon nanotubes are the following: (1) bare nanotubes are not <b>soluble</b> in epoxy <b>resins</b> and so they tend to agglomerate instead of becoming dispersed as desired; and (2) because of lack of affinity between nanotubes and epoxy matrices, there is insufficient transfer of mechanical loads between the nanotubes and the matrices. Part of the effort reported here was oriented toward (1) functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes with methyl methacrylate (MMA) to increase their dispersability in epoxy resins and increase transfer of mechanical loads and (2) ultrasonic dispersion of the functionalized nanotubes in tetrahydrofuran, which was used as an auxiliary solvent to aid in dispersing the functionalized nanotubes into a epoxy resin. In another part of this effort, poly(styrene sulfonic acid) was used as the dispersant and water as the auxiliary solvent. In one experiment, the strength of composite of epoxy with MMA-functionalized-nanotubes was found to be 29 percent greater than that of a similar composite of epoxy with the same proportion of untreated nanotubes...|$|R
40|$|Supported {{ionic liquid}} {{membranes}} (SILMs) have a promising prospect of application in flue gas separation, owing to its high permeability and selectivity of CO 2. However, existing SILMs have {{the disadvantage of}} poor stability due {{to the loss of}} ionic liquid from the large pores of the macroporous support. In this study, a novel SILM with high stability was developed by confining ionic liquid in a mesoporous polymer membrane. First, a mesoporous polymer membrane derived from a <b>soluble,</b> low-molecular-weight phenolic <b>resin</b> precursor was deposited on a porous Al 2 O 3 support, and then 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([emim][BF 4]) was immobilized inside mesopores of phenolic resin, forming the SILM under vacuum. Effects of trans-membrane pressure difference on the SILM separation performance were investigated by measuring the permeances of CO 2 and N- 2. The SILM exhibits a high ideal CO 2 /N- 2 selectivity of 40, and an actual selectivity of approximately 25 in a mixed gas (50 % CO 2 and 50 % N- 2) at a trans-membrane pressure difference of 2. 5 bar. Compared to [emim][BF 4] supported by polyethersulfone membrane with a pore size of around 0. 45 m, the [emim][BF 4] confined in a mesoporous polymer membrane exhibits an improved stability, and its separation performance remained stable for 40 h under a trans-membrane pressure difference of 1. 5 bar in a mixed gas before the measurement was intentionally stopped...|$|R
