40|$|The project {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the management parameters, options and performance {{of a system of}} strip intercropping of herbage legumes and organic vegetables in which nitrogen transfer and conservation is effected by a combination of grazing ruminant livestock and crop rotation. The study will involve 3 inter-related approaches: a theoretical evaluation, a field experiment and a financial and economic evaluation. The theoretical evaluation will be achieved via a combination of a review of relevant literature and consultation with horticulturists, scientists and representatives from the organic food industry. The field experiment will be conducted {{to investigate the}} management parameters and performance of a theoretically promising intercropping system consisting of red clover/timothy as the legume and spring cabbage as the first crop followed by a second crop such as <b>salad</b> <b>beetroot,</b> with sheep grazing introduced at certain stages. Objectives of the field experiment will include assessing the effects of varying strip width on system performance, examining the effects of sheep grazing on transfer of N from legume to crop and investigating the effects of crop rotation on nutrient transfer and conservation. A financial evaluation of the proposed system will be conducted initially using costs and values derived from literature and industrial sources; this will then be refined using data provided by the field experiment. The economics and implementation of the system will be assessed via a survey of organic vegetable growers and via a market assessment in collaboration with Safeway plc...|$|E

40|$|A ingestão potencial de nitrato e de nitrito através das refeições oferecidas nos restaurantes universitários da UNICAMP foi estimada com base nos dados de consumo de alimentos e valores das determinações analíticas desses compostos nos alimentos consumidos. Foi feito o perfil dos usuários de acordo com as seguintes características demográficas: sexo idade, atividade profissional e peso corpóreo. Dados de consumo alimentar foram obtidos de trabalho desenvolvido previamente nestes restaurantes. Através de método colorimétrico determinou-se o conteúdo de nitrato e de nitrito em 22 alimentos componentes das refeições dos restaurantes. Os níveis mais altos de nitrato foram encontrados em salada de beterraba crua 2138, 6 :t 657, 5 mg/kg, salada de acelga 935, 5 :t 315, 6 mg/kg, salada de repolho 811, O :t 604, 3 mg/kg e laranja 711, 1 :t 653, 3 mg/kg; enquanto que o conteúdo mais elevadp de nitrito foi encontrado em salsicha ao molho de tomate 19, 3 :t 1, 6 mg/kg, salada de beterraba crua 9, 5 :t 7, 1 mg/kg E 7 laranja 1, 9 :t 1, 9 mg/kg.

Para o usuário que consome duas refeições, almoço e jantar, a ingestão potencial estimada para o nitrato estava acima da Ingestão Diária Aceitável IDA, enquanto que para o nitrito, esta representa um quinto de valor máximo recomendado.
