40|$|These days, automation, {{digitalization}} {{and mobile}} application are driving {{forces in the}} development of innovations in public transportation. Interactive digital approaches like serious games are a promising way to introduce new <b>mobility</b> <b>services</b> to the public in a contemporary manner. The trend towards a flexibilization of life- and workstyles entails a growing demand for individualized and more flexible forms of personal mobility. People no longer want to adapt their need for mobility to fixed schedules of public transport. The emergence of new <b>mobility</b> <b>services</b> that are based on reservation and payment via mobile devices, for example Car 2 Go (carsharing), CallaBike (bikesharing), Uber (ride sharing) or BlaBlaCar (carpooling), proves the need for demand driven <b>mobility</b> <b>services.</b> A growing flexibility can be expected to be accompanied by an increase in the inherent complexity of <b>mobility</b> <b>services.</b> This results in an increasing relevance of users’ information requirements that have to be incorporated in <b>mobility</b> <b>services</b> to enable planning and projection of routes and arrivals. An insufficient provision of information about how to use the <b>mobility</b> <b>service</b> or the absence of a transparent and understandable information environment could create usage barriers that cause a refusal of the <b>mobility</b> <b>service.</b> New <b>mobility</b> systems need to be systematically introduced to the prospective users. To improve users’ conceptual understanding of a new demand responsive transport system a serious game is developed by the authors. A serious game is characterized by an explicit educational purpose. The objective behind the serious game is to provide information about the operating concept of a demand responsive bus in a playful way. The underlying concept of the <b>mobility</b> <b>service</b> is introduced to the player as well as possible use cases and system constraints. To enhance knowledge about the new bus system players are put in the position of a public traffic planner. Players have the mission to plan and operate a bus system that satisfies customer needs {{on the one hand and}} meets the goal of an efficient and environmental friendly operation on the other hand. It is hypothesized that the serious game improves the conceptual understanding of the <b>mobility</b> <b>service,</b> reduces usage barriers and increases the intention to use the new bus system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mobility</b> <b>services</b> are {{widening}} <b>mobility</b> portfolio. It {{deals with}} emerging {{means of transportation}} such as carpooling, car-sharing, bike-sharing and demand responsive transport. The state-of-usage is badly known. The master thesis aims to study the French statistical apparatus and improve it to capture usage data on these services. Statistical computation enables highlighting travel behaviour in France. The international comparison shows that some countries are more developed than other in such <b>services</b> but <b>mobility</b> <b>services</b> remain niche markets. Carpooling would represent nearly 15 % of trips whereas bike-sharing, car-sharing and demand responsive transport hardly reach 1 % of trips in France. Potential estimation shows that using these transportation modes would affect very positively the three fields of sustainability. Car-sharing could go to 7 % of the French population. Bike-sharing could represent 2. 5 % of total trips. It is now needed to develop surveys in order to catch users of <b>mobility</b> <b>services</b> and to compare supply and demand side.

40|$|Abstract: Lately, the {{proliferation}} of small portable devices has driven {{the introduction of a}} new mobility concept called <b>service</b> <b>mobility.</b> In order to support <b>service</b> <b>mobility,</b> we introduce a new architecture implementing mechanisms to access end user’s personalized services regardless of his physical location. The proposed architecture leverages on mobile agent technology to transport and move services to the end user’s registered terminals and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for user location signaling. A decentralized approach purely based on mobile agents is compared with a centralized approach. The performance measurement results show that mobile agents are worth being used for realizing <b>service</b> <b>mobility</b> but in specific conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{ubiquity of}} {{wireless}} ad hoc networks {{and the benefits}} of loosely coupled services have fostered a growing interest in service oriented architectures for mobile and pervasive computing. Many ar-chitectures have been proposed that implement context-sensitive service discovery, selection and composition, or that use a component-based soft-ware engineering methodology to facilitate runtime adaptation to chang-ing circumstances. This paper explores live <b>service</b> <b>mobility</b> in pervasive computing environments as a way to mitigate the risk of disconnections during service provision in mobile ad hoc networks. It focuses on context-aware service migration and diffusion to multiple hosts to increase acces-sibility and expedite human interaction with the service. We analyze the basic requirements for <b>service</b> <b>mobility</b> and discuss an implementation on top of OSGi. Finally, we evaluate our approach to <b>service</b> <b>mobility</b> and illustrate its effectiveness by means of a real-life scenario. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Next {{generation}} wireless networks {{will take}} advantage of the popularity and the data rates offered by unlicensed wireless networks to enhance cellular services. Nowadays, it is not surprising to see heterogeneous wireless networks coexisting on a daily basis i. e. UMTS, WiFi, and WiMAX. Unfortunately, technical issues and the lack of roaming agreements between network operators prevent interoperability. One of the goals of next generation wireless networks is to enable <b>service</b> <b>mobility</b> between heterogeneous wireless networks, thus we present in this article a SIP-based roaming architecture to enable <b>service</b> <b>mobility</b> in heterogeneous multi-operator wireless networks. Our objective is to establish mutual trust between cellular network operators and unlicensed wireless networks through a efficient SLA monitoring and enforcement and brokerbased access control. All this, with minimal changes in current wireless network architectures. Index Terms — wireless convergence, <b>service</b> <b>mobility,</b> roaming architecture, heterogeneous wireless networks.
