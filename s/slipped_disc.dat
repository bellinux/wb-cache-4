25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a <b>slipped</b> <b>disc,</b> is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E
500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either {{malformation}} or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to [...] "luxate" [...] (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain {{is caused by the}} knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the <b>slipped</b> <b>disc.</b>|$|E

500|$|Beadle {{agreed with}} Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior {{agreement}} on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians, but still felt that Salisbury should agree.

Smith refused to make such a commitment, much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs, and signed the final document only to acknowledge it as an accurate record. Wilson was furious with Beadle, feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle; after Beadle left the meeting, Wilson said that he [...] "could not understand how any man could have a <b>slipped</b> <b>disc</b> whom Providence had failed to provide with a backbone".

2500|$|Some of {{the terms}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} condition include herniated disc, prolapsed disc, ruptured disc and <b>slipped</b> <b>disc.</b> Other phenomena that are closely related include disc protrusion, pinched nerves, sciatica, disc disease, disc degeneration, degenerative disc disease, and black disc. The popular term <b>slipped</b> <b>disc</b> is a misnomer, as the intervertebral discs are tightly sandwiched between two vertebrae to which they are attached, and cannot actually [...] "slip", or even get out of place. The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot [...] "slip". Some authors consider that the term [...] "slipped disc" [...] is harmful, as it leads to an incorrect idea of what has occurred and thus of the likely outcome. However, during growth, one vertebral body can slip relative to an adjacent vertebral body, a deformity called spondylolisthesis.|$|E

50|$|This {{disease can}} lead to excess {{pressure}} on the spine, causing pain and discomfort. If the spine is bent too far, a patient may have difficulties breathing in the future because of {{the pressure of the}} spine pressed against the lungs. Camptocormia may also lead to aging, muscle weakness in the upper back, arthritis and other bone degeneration diseases. Due to loss of bone strength, injury to the spine and <b>slipped</b> <b>discs</b> become increasingly significant.

2500|$|Disc herniations are {{normally}} a {{further development of}} a previously existing disc protrusion, {{a condition in which}} the outermost layers of the anulus fibrosus are still intact, but can bulge when the disc is under pressure. In contrast to a herniation, none of the central portion escapes beyond the outer layers. Most minor herniations heal within several weeks. Anti-inflammatory treatments for pain associated with disc herniation, protrusion, bulge, or disc tear are generally effective. Severe herniations may not heal of their own accord and may require surgery. The condition is widely referred to as a <b>slipped</b> <b>disc,</b> but this term is not medically accurate as the spinal discs are firmly attached between the vertebrae and cannot [...] "slip" [...] out of place.|$|E

The King was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital after a blood clot complicated a <b>slipped</b> <b>disc</b> and underwent successful back surgery. The lead surgeon was Muhammad Zaka, who probably removed the herniated disk and performed a lumbar fusion. He subsequently had another successful surgery in which surgeons [...] "stabilized a number of vertebras". He left the hospital on 22 December 2010 and convalesced at The Plaza in New York City.

There followed a sequence of films, a mixture of comedies and detective stories, including Wedding Group (1936), in which Sim and his wife both appeared, he as a Scottish minister, she as the maid; Edgar Wallace's The Squeaker (1937) after a stage production of the same piece; Alf's Button Afloat (1938) with the Crazy Gang; and the [...] "Inspector Hornleigh" [...] series (1939–41), as the bumbling assistant of Gordon Harker.|$|E
