5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> of my head and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about {{the right amount of}} blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

It's all about reuse and keeping good <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> of landfills. Membership is normally free. In, addition, there are directory-based resources such as RecycleChicken.com which point consumers to local and national locations for reuse and repurposing of materials not normally accepted in recycling programs.|$|E

500|$|With the {{assistance}} of the National Guard and Air Force personnel, several hundred patients were evacuated from local hospitals with no injuries or loss of life during the evacuation process. Many residents also evacuated to motels and homes in neighboring communities. Some residents of Grand Forks criticized the National Weather Service for its incorrect prediction of the river level, as it had prevented them from securing their possessions from their homes. One resident said: [...] "If they'd said earlier the river would hit , I would have moved my <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> of my house. At 49, it was safe." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] {{was written}} by Scott M. Gimple and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren. It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, IronE Singleton, Madison Lintz, Emily Kinney, Jane McNeill, James Allen McCune, and Amber Chaney. Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment, [...] "Secrets", writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already". He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I {{think people are going to}} be a little shocked." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Taboo" [...] is an R {{song that}} borrows {{influences}} from numerous genres including hip-hop, Japanese pop, and dance-pop. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express noted elements of 80s pop and disco music. Koda's vocals are heavily processed through vocoder pyrotechnics, and are delivered during the chorus {{and parts of}} the bridge section. The lyrics to [...] "Taboo" [...] emphasize the term with the same name, discussing taboo nature and exploring it. Regarding homosexuality, Koda commented to Oricon; [...] "Instead of trying <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] In terms of musical depth and lyrical diversity, Koda found that [...] "Taboo" [...] was one of her most [...] "widen" [...] tracks throughout her entire music career.|$|E

500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E

500|$|On January 7, 2008, Rise Against {{announced}} on their website {{that they had}} begun writing and demoing for their next album. When asked in May what {{the status of the}} album was, frontman Tim McIlrath told the Los Angeles modern rock radio station, KROQ, that the band {{was in the middle of}} the recording process. He also stated that the album would be recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado and produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, who had produced The Sufferer & the Witness. Also in May 2008, Rise Against posted a blog on their website, stating that they were back in the studio working on the album. It explained that they had [...] "spent many weeks in Chicago throughout the end of winter writing new songs" [...] in their [...] "rehearsal space". Asked later about the writing and recording process, McIlrath said, [...] "We kind of blocked a month off over the winter and said, 'Let's all get together, get the rehearsal space, and start putting some ideas together,' which is what we did. And then, we also blocked off a week or two at the Blasting Room after we arrived in Fort Collins to just kind of jam <b>stuff</b> <b>out,</b> get some new ideas going." ...|$|E
500|$|Koda {{has even}} {{explored}} {{the themes of}} sexuality and taboos in her lyrics. While listening {{to the music of}} [...] "But", the first thing that came to Koda's mind was homosexuality. Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm {{the type of person who}} thinks that [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there really is no such thing as a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits. The video of [...] "Ima Sugu Hoshii" [...] featured two males in sexual positions, and the video of [...] "Juicy", which also featured sexual posturing, was censored in Taiwan.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfram {{has since}} {{expressed}} [...] "A central lesson of A New Kind of Science is that there’s {{a lot of}} incredible richness {{out there in the}} computational universe.

50|$|Under the {{management}} of Hugh Kenny Wicklow lined out against Meath in the opening round of the 2004 Leinster Championship. They were playing exceptionally well and were leading Meath by 1-6 to 0-7 {{early in the second}} half when midfielder Ciaran Clancy was harshly sent off. This seemed to knock the <b>stuffing</b> <b>out</b> of Wicklow who never recovered and were hammered 2-13 to 1-8.|$|R
5000|$|Ben Brantley, in {{his review}} for The New York Times wrote:"In 'Romance,' the latest work from this most imitated and parodied of living American playwrights, Mr. Mamet knocks the four-letter <b>stuffing</b> <b>out</b> of his own staccato style. He then {{proceeds}} to beat up on classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and, it might be argued, his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't capture laughs either." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{his first}} release under Pipe Records, Far From Silent, Joseph {{explored}} {{the complications of}} fame and fortune, in the second track [...] "Celebrity". The eighth track, entitled [...] "The Good in Me is Dead", written in {{the perspective of a}} Kosovo refugee in light of the Balkan atrocities, reflects Joseph's penchant for writing about social tragedies and injustice. [...] "The prime motive in the instant that I pick up the guitar is a selfish one," [...] Joseph says. [...] "It's because I need to deal with the world. I'm in the world and it's horrible, and what can I do? I'm just getting this <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> of my system as it were." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Drumchapel is {{a housing}} estate just outside Glasgow. Well, it's in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation," [...] he has joked. [...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E
2500|$|Watts {{wanted to}} heavily pre-visualize the film, {{especially}} its action sequences, {{as he does}} on all his films. For Homecoming, Watts worked with a team to [...] "figure out the visual language for the action sequences and just ... you get to try <b>stuff</b> <b>out</b> before you’re actually on-set shooting it" [...] which helped Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale action films. For the [...] "web-slinging" [...] sequences in the film, Watts wanted to avoid the big [...] "swoopy" [...] camera moves that had been previously used for such Spider-Man scenes and instead [...] "keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him, and everything was something you could actually film." ...|$|E
5000|$|Producer Mark Di Salle said he {{was looking}} for [...] "a new martial arts star who was a ladies' man, Van Damme appeals to both men and women.
