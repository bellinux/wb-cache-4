5|$|Heart {{problems}} (mainly <b>systolic</b> dysfunction) {{appear in}} over 10% of patients, while leukemia prevalence is 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to keep a}} person's <b>systolic</b> blood {{pressure}} below somewhere between 140 and 160 mmHg is generally recommended. Medications to achieve this may include labetalol or nicardipine.|$|E
5|$|The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) {{classification}} {{is equivalent}} to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures {{to deal with this}} were devised (such as <b>systolic</b> arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far {{the most common type of}} parallel programs.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{a cardiac}} {{troponin}} activator {{could be useful}} for increasing cardiac contractility {{in the treatment of}} <b>systolic</b> heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. Troponin modulators could also be used to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
5|$|While {{reduction}} of sodium intake {{to less than}} 2,300mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200mg (contained in 3g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake the greater the fall in <b>systolic</b> blood pressure for all age groups and ethinicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{mitral valve}} {{prolapse}} may have a holosystolic murmur or often a mid-to-late <b>systolic</b> click and a late <b>systolic</b> murmur. Cases with a late <b>systolic</b> regurgitant murmur may still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>systolic</b> {{ramifications of}} hyperellipticity have been {{identified}} in genus 2.|$|E
25|$|A {{family of}} optimal <b>systolic</b> inequalities is {{obtained}} as {{an application of}} the techniques of Burago and Ivanov, exploiting suitable AbelJacobi maps, defined as follows.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{showed that}} L-arginine reduces blood pressure with pooled estimates of 5.4 mmHg for <b>systolic</b> {{blood pressure and}} 2.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Presence of a {{carotid pulse}} has been {{estimated}} to indicate a <b>systolic</b> blood pressure of more than 40 mmHg, as given by the 50% percentile.|$|E
25|$|It {{turns out}} that the minimal entropy of a closed surface can be related to its optimal <b>systolic</b> ratio. Namely, there is an upper bound for the entropy of a systolically extremal surface, in terms of its systole. By {{combining}} this upper bound with Katok's optimal lower bound in terms of the volume, one obtains a simpler alternative proof of Gromov's asymptotic estimate for the optimal <b>systolic</b> ratio of surfaces of large genus. Furthermore, such an approach yields an improved multiplicative constant in Gromov's theorem.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{showed that}} sesame consumption produced small reductions in both <b>systolic</b> and diastolic blood pressure. Sesame oil studies reported {{a reduction of}} oxidative stress markers and lipid peroxidation.|$|E
25|$|A rise in {{baseline}} {{blood pressure}} (BP) of 30nbsp&mmHg <b>systolic</b> or 15nbsp&mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, {{is important to}} note but is not considered diagnostic.|$|E
25|$|The new {{invariant}} {{was introduced}} by Katz and Rudyak (see below). Since the invariant {{turns out to be}} closely related to the Lusternik-Schnirelman category (LS category), it was called <b>systolic</b> category.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit from resveratrol in those who already have heart disease. A 2014 Chinese meta-analysis found weak evidence that high-dose resveratrol supplementation could reduce <b>systolic</b> blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{treatment}} of severe hypertension in pregnancy {{is to prevent}} cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications. The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg <b>systolic</b> and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.|$|E
25|$|In a {{woman with}} {{essential}} hypertension beginning before 20 weeks gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are: an increase in <b>systolic</b> blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15mmHg.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{pressure}} ≥ 140mm Hg <b>systolic</b> or ≥ 90mm Hg diastolic on {{two separate}} readings taken {{at least four}} to six hours apart after 20 weeks gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Stenosis of the {{aortic valve}} is {{typically}} {{the next most}} common heart murmur, a <b>systolic</b> ejection murmur. This {{is more common in}} older adults or in those individuals having a two, not a three leaflet aortic valve.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation with L-arginine reduces diastolic blood {{pressure}} and lengthens pregnancy for women with gestational hypertension, including women with high {{blood pressure}} as part of pre-eclampsia. It did not lower <b>systolic</b> blood pressure or improve weight at birth.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have been done to {{investigate}} whether ACEi plus ARB is better than an ACEi treatment alone in reducing death, disability or hospital admission in CHF with <b>systolic</b> dysfunction. The two largest studies were CHARM-Added and Val-HeFT.|$|E
25|$|High blood {{pressure}} accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk. Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg <b>systolic</b> or 5 mmHg diastolic {{reduces the risk}} of stroke by ~40%. Lowering {{blood pressure}} has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It is equally important in secondary prevention. Even patients older than 80 years and those with isolated <b>systolic</b> hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy. The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs —therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered. The routine use of beta-blockers following a stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{striking}} applications of systoles is in the context of the Schottky problem, by P.Buser and P.Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for <b>systolic</b> arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|Indications {{for surgery}} for chronic MI include signs of left {{ventricular}} dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 60%, severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery <b>systolic</b> pressure greater than 50 mmHg at rest or 60 mmHg during activity, and new onset atrial fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} {{study showed that}} the {{administration}} of synephrine by continuous intravenous infusion, {{at the rate of}} 4mg/minute, significantly increased mean arterial and <b>systolic</b> pressure, but diastolic pressure and heart rate were unaltered.; further details of this investigation are summarized in a review by Fugh-Berman and Myers.|$|E
25|$|Hypertension is a {{risk factor}} for renal injury and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Renal risk appears to be more closely related to <b>systolic</b> than to diastolic blood pressure, and black men are at greater risk than white men for {{developing}} ESRD at every level of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} (within {{the last}} 20 years), β-blockers were contraindicated in CHF, owing to their negative inotropic effect {{and ability to}} produce bradycardia – effects which worsen heart failure. However, current guidelines recommend β-blocker therapy for patients with <b>systolic</b> heart failure due to left ventricular <b>systolic</b> dysfunction after stabilization with diuretic and ACEI therapy, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. As with ACEI therapy, {{the addition of a}} β-blocker can decrease mortality and improve left ventricular function. Several β-blockers are specifically indicated for CHF including: bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol and extended-release metoprolol. The antagonism of β1 inotropic and chronotropic effects decreases the amount of work the heart must perform. It is also thought that catecholamines and other sympathomimetics have an effect on cardiac remodeling, and blocking their activity can slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|While diastolic blood {{pressure}} is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, <b>systolic</b> {{blood pressure}} generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic insufficiency with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see <b>systolic</b> pressures diminish. Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} in an obese population over four years is decreased with orlistat (6.2%) compared to placebo (9.0%). Long-term use of orlistat also leads to a very modest reduction in blood pressure (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 mmHg in <b>systolic</b> and diastolic blood pressure respectively).|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} formulation is as follows. Any centrally symmetric {{convex body}} of surface area A can be squeezed through a noose of length , with the tightest fit achieved by a sphere. This property {{is equivalent to}} a special case of Pu's inequality (see below), {{one of the earliest}} <b>systolic</b> inequalities.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of diastolic function, {{ranging from}} {{asymptomatic}} heart disease to overt heart failure, {{are common in}} hypertensive patients. Patients with diastolic heart failure have a preserved ejection fraction, which {{is a measure of}} <b>systolic</b> function. Diastolic dysfunction is an early consequence of hypertension-related heart disease and is exacerbated by left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemia.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens palsies, and the Cushing's triad. Cushing's triad involves an increased <b>systolic</b> blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and an abnormal respiratory pattern. In children, a low heart rate is especially suggestive of high ICP.|$|E
25|$|Reserpine {{is one of}} the few {{antihypertensive}} {{medications that}} have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce mortality: The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group in Anti-hypertensive Agents, and the <b>Systolic</b> Hypertension in the Elderly Program. However, these studies are dated, with the results of the most recent study being published in 1991.|$|E
25|$|By {{attaching}} {{both the}} injector {{site and the}} ventricular thermistor to a small computer, the thermodilution curve can be plotted. If details about the patient's body mass index (size); core temp, <b>Systolic,</b> diastolic, central venous pressure CVP (measured from the atrium by the third lumen simultaneously) and pulmonary artery pressure are input, a comprehensive flow vs pressure map can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{specific}} recommendations {{have been made}} for women including taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy {{if there is a}} history of previous chronic high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications during pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150mmHg <b>systolic</b> or greater than 100mmHg diastolic. In those who have previously had preeclampsia other risk factors should be treated more aggressively.|$|E
25|$|Hypertension is an {{important}} risk factor for brain infarction and hemorrhage. Approximately 85% of strokes are due to infarction and the remainder are due to hemorrhage, either intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of stroke rises progressively with increasing blood pressure levels, particularly <b>systolic</b> blood pressure in individuals >65 years. Treatment of hypertension convincingly decreases the incidence of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.|$|E
