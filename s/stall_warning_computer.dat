50|$|The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system {{utilizes}} a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> vane on {{each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above <b>stall,</b> the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an audible <b>warning</b> as the <b>stall</b> speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> horn, which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch, and produces an audible warning in response.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an article}} in Vanity Fair, William Langewiesche noted that once the angle of attack was so extreme, the system {{rejected}} the data as invalid and temporarily stopped the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b> However, [...] "this led to a perverse reversal that lasted nearly to the impact: each time Bonin happened to lower the nose, rendering the angle of attack marginally less severe, the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> sounded again—a negative reinforcement that may have locked him into his pattern of pitching up" [...] which increased the angle of attack and thus prevented the plane from getting out of its stall.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the crew}} {{did not respond}} to the <b>stall</b> <b>warning,</b> whether due to a failure to {{identify}} the aural warning, to the transience of the <b>stall</b> <b>warnings</b> that could have been considered spurious, to the absence of any visual information that could confirm that the aircraft was approaching stall after losing the characteristic speeds, to confusing stall-related buffet for overspeed-related buffet, to the indications by the Flight Director that might have confirmed the crew's mistaken view of their actions, or to difficulty in identifying and understanding the implications of the switch to alternate law, which does not protect the angle of attack.|$|R
50|$|Blockage, damage, or inoperation of {{stall and}} {{angle of attack}} (AOA) probes can lead to {{unreliability}} of the <b>stall</b> <b>warning,</b> and cause the stick pusher, overspeed warning, autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.|$|R

50|$|On December 30, 2014 the Ministry of Water and Air Transport of Venezuela {{published}} {{that the}} probable {{cause of the}} accident was the malfunction of the central crew alerting system with erroneous activation of the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system.Contributing factors were weaknesses of the flight crew’s resource management, their loss of situational awareness, their inadequate coordination during the decision-making process to deal with abnormal situations in flight, their {{lack of knowledge of}} the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system, and their mishandling of the flight controls.The aircraft was flown with two abnormal conditions, activation of the <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> system and the decoupling of the elevators of the aircraft, requiring a constant effort by the pilot in command to maintain control of the aircraft.There was improper handling of the aircraft in the final phase of landing, which led the commander to exercise great effort on controlling the flight before impact.The commander’s defective emotional and cognitive skill level, lack of leadership, and errors of judgment led him to make unwise decisions.Both pilots showed confusion, poor coordination in the cockpit, serious failures in communication, lack of knowledge of the aircraft systems and loss of situational awareness.|$|R

25|$|These {{systems were}} {{the subject of}} a {{comprehensive}} stall programme, involving some 3,500 stalls being performed by Hawker Siddeley before the matter was considered resolved by the Air Registration Board. The <b>stall</b> <b>warning</b> and recovery systems tended to over-react: of ten activations between the Trident entering service and June 1972, only half were genuine, although in the previous 6½ years there had been no false activations when an aircraft was actually in the air. When BEA Trident pilots were questioned informally by one captain, over half of the pilots said that they would disable the protection systems on activation rather than let them recover the aircraft to a safe attitude. Random checks carried out by the airline after the accident showed that this was not the case; 21 captains stated that they had witnessed their co-pilots react correctly to any <b>stall</b> <b>warnings.</b>|$|R
