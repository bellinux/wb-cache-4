5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight {{earlier in the season}} with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL <b>senior</b> <b>vice-president</b> and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E

25|$|Player safety {{has become}} a major issue within the past five years and concussions, which result from a hard hit to the head, have been the biggest cause.

25|$|Mark Tauber, <b>senior</b> <b>vice-president</b> of HarperOne, {{has stated}} that the Green Bible was {{developed}} {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the first things that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E
25|$|Roberts was a {{real estate}} {{salesperson}} in 1964 when Abe Hirschfeld hired her {{to sit in the}} lobby and sell at 925 Park Avenue in New York.

In 1970, she joined one of Helmsley's brokerage firms—Brown, Harris, Stevens—as a <b>senior</b> <b>vice-president.</b> At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Helmsley divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. Roberts's marriage to Helmsley may well have saved her career. Late in 1971, several of her tenants sued her for forcing the tenants of one of the apartments she managed to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Helmsley's growing hotel empire.|$|E

After testing for the character of Cane for Latham and casting director Karen Rea, Goddard received the role. The Australian actor auditioned with an American accent, but when the writers found out about his Australian background, that influenced Cane's backstory. The actor stated that, [...] "The concept of Cane {{was that he was}} given away at birth. So he could have been from Mongolia. It just worked out luckily for me that I was the right person for the job." [...] Since the producers could not understand the actor's real Australian accent, Goddard [...] "Americanized" [...] it while portraying the character.|$|E
