5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of <b>sows,</b> or groups {{of one or more}} <b>sows</b> and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} two <b>sowing</b> {{machines for}} interval <b>sowing,</b> differing {{in the mode}} of operation. The pneumatic vacuum <b>sowing</b> machine OLT and the pneumatic pressure <b>sowing</b> machine Aeromat - Becker for <b>sowing</b> sugar beet are compared.

Design/methodology/approach: The measurements were performed with two <b>sowing</b> machines which are most widely used in Slovenia; the <b>sowing</b> machines were tested in completely identical conditions at different speeds of <b>sowing.</b> Findings: The parameters such as working efficiency, depth of <b>sowing,</b> inter - row distance and distance between seeds in the <b>sowing</b> row were measured and calculated.

40|$|Lodging {{resistance}} of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{can be increased}} by late <b>sowing.</b> However, whether grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) can be maintained with delayed <b>sowing</b> remains unknown. During the 2013 â 2014 and 2014 â 2015 growing seasons, two winter wheat cultivars were <b>sown</b> on three dates (early <b>sowing</b> on October 1, normal <b>sowing</b> on October 8, and late <b>sowing</b> on October 15) to investigate the responses of lodging resistance, grain yield, and NUE to <b>sowing</b> date. No significant differences in lodging resistance, grain yield, or NUE between early and normal <b>sowing</b> were observed. Averaging over the two cultivars and years, postponing the <b>sowing</b> date significantly increased lodging resistance by 53. 6 % and 49. 6 % compared with that following early and normal <b>sowing,</b> respectively. Lodging resistance was improved mainly through {{a reduction in the}} culm height at the center of gravity and an increase in the tensile strength of the base internode. Late <b>sowing</b> resulted in similar grain yield as well as kernel weight and number of kernels per square meter, compared to early and normal <b>sowing.</b> Averaging over the two cultivars and years, delayed <b>sowing</b> resulted in a reduction in nitrogen uptake efficiency (UPE) by 11. 0 % and 9. 9 % compared to early and normal <b>sowing,</b> respectively, owing to reduced root length density and dry matter accumulation before anthesis. An average increase in nitrogen utilization efficiency (UTE) of 12. 9 % and 11. 2 % compared to early and normal <b>sowing,</b> respectively, was observed with late <b>sowing</b> owing to a reduction in the grain nitrogen concentration. The increase in UTE offset the reduction in UPE, resulting in equal NUEs among all <b>sowing</b> dates. Thus, <b>sowing</b> later than normal could increase lodging resistance while maintaining grain yield and NUE.

5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or <b>sows</b> (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for <b>sows</b> who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} {{period in}} most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts {{a month and a}} half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour, in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of <b>sows,</b> eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the <b>sows.</b> At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals, A single male can mate with 5–10 <b>sows.</b> By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older <b>sows.</b> Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 piglets, with the maximum being 10–12. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other <b>sows</b> in the sounder.|$|E
