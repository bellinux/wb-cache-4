5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> {{only a few}} eurozone countries, with the three most affected countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), {{it has become a}} perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, Irish and German immigration to St. Louis increased <b>substantially.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many Irish were motivated by the Irish potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848. Other Irish settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E

5|$|Morris died in 1896, and {{the health}} of the devastated Burne-Jones {{declined}} <b>substantially.</b> <b>In</b> 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured. Burne-Jones was buried in the churchyard at St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean, a place he knew through summer family holidays.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{given that}} both {{population}} and prosperity increased <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> this period, economic recovery in Byzantium {{appears to have}} been strengthening the economic basis of the state.

5|$|The diet of the {{bramble shark}} {{includes}} smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, {{it is an}} occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers, and {{may be used for}} fishmeal and liver oil. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> {{design and}} degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E

5|$|In Naju, the country's largest {{producer}} of pears, approximately 1,400hectares (3,460acres) of pear trees, or 60% {{of the total}} crop, was destroyed. Agriculture as a whole suffered significantly from the storm, {{with a total of}} 9,000hectares (22,000acres) of apple and pear plantations being destroyed. As a result, the price of produce across the nation jumped <b>substantially.</b> <b>In</b> Yesan alone, a town where more than 1,500 families relies on their apple orchards for a living, losses to the orchards reached ₩300billion (US$265.4million). The prices of spinach, cabbage, and lettuce rose by 124%, 72%, and 26% respectively in just one day. Total losses throughout the country were estimated at ₩420billion (US$374.3million). More than 500 people were left homeless as a result of Bolaven, mostly in South Jeolla Province. Additionally, economic losses to airlines related to the typhoon reached ₩17billion ($15million). Korean Air and Asiana Airlines suffered the greatest losses of the affected companies.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who {{is equipped with a}} Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size <b>substantially.</b> <b>In</b> this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs, now {{firmly in}} control of Syria and the Levant, sent {{frequent}} raiding parties deep into Asia Minor, and in 674–678 laid siege to Constantinople itself. The Arab fleet was finally repulsed {{through the use of}} Greek fire, and a thirty-years' truce was signed between the Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate. However, the Anatolian raids continued unabated, and accelerated the demise of classical urban culture, with the inhabitants of many cities either refortifying much smaller areas within the old city walls, or relocating entirely to nearby fortresses. Constantinople itself dropped <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> size, from 500,000 inhabitants to just 40,000–70,000, and, like other urban centres, it was partly ruralised. The city also lost the free grain shipments in 618, after Egypt fell first to the Persians and then to the Arabs, and public wheat distribution ceased.|$|E

5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The fur {{trade was}} in decline {{by the late}} 1830s. The American Fur Company went {{bankrupt}} in 1842, though the Missouri Fur Company and other operations kept the trade from collapsing entirely. As this trade declined the lumber industry began to grow <b>substantially</b> <b>in</b> {{areas such as the}} Saint Croix Valley where valuable white pine was plentiful. New saw mills appeared in Marine and Stillwater. Lumber was typically cut during winter and sent downstream in the spring. In 1848, businessman Franklin Steele built the first private sawmill on the Saint Anthony Falls (which would later become the town of Saint Anthony) opening commercial lumbering on the Mississippi River. More sawmills quickly followed. Soon the Saint Croix and Mississippi Rivers in Minnesota had become major conduits for lumber headed for Saint Louis and other destinations.|$|E
