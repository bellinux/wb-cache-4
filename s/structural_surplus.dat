5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E

40|$|This paper calculates {{structural}} balances for EU-countries and relates them to fiscal sustainability. Although the Stability Pact implicitly {{accepts the}} need {{to distinguish between the}} structural and the cyclical component of net deficits, the issue of long-term sustainability is only covered by the need not to exceed a certain threshold value of the net lending. While the OECD and the European Commission (EU) assume constant elasticities when calculating cyclical budget components to derive structural deficits from the net deficits, the present paper choses time series technique to extract the structural balances directly. = Structural balances are calculated on a disaggregated level considering five different government receipts and expenditure components. With the same method, structural primary balances are estimated to analyse long-term sustainability of fiscal policy in the EU. Therefore, we set the <b>structural</b> primary <b>surpluses</b> against those primary balances, necessary to stabilise the debt to GDP ratio. It is shown that in some of the so-called core-countries like Germany and France, <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses</b> are still below those required to stabilize the debt ratio. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates several {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} exceptional period {{of growth in the}} nineties in the US [...] These years can be characterised as a case of an expansionary fiscal consolidation as strong growth and <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses</b> were observed. Five different channels, the literature suggests for relationships between government spending and consumption are investigated. There are hints that the economy did not work in a Keynesian way but there is no proof of the existence of a Non-Keynesian effect. Expectational effects could not be separated empirically from asset wealth. Whereas standard consumption estimations failed, a model adding a factor containing asset wealth and expectations was finally able to explain consumption from 1996 onwards. This has important implications for policy. Moreover, compositional effects were found to be important. The two main findings of the paper, namely an asset wealth/expectations effect and compositional effects support the interpretation of a positive link between public savings, asset values and growth.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} the {{structural budget balance}} methodology, adopted {{for use in the}} Chilean public sector. The structural balance methodology adjusts fiscal accounts so they reflect changes in net worth and makes it possible to isolate changes in fiscal policy resulting from the main exogenous factors determining fiscal revenues: GDP and copper price. This facilitates the analysis and evaluation of fiscal policy in Chile, which, since 2000, has focused on achieving a <b>structural</b> budget <b>surplus,</b> thus ensuring the existence of counter-cyclical fiscal policy in a framework of robust fiscal accounts. ...|$|R
40|$|The Stability and Growth Pact sets a {{medium-term}} {{target for}} fiscal policy of a budgetary position 'close to balance or in surplus'. This {{addition to the}} deficit rule defined by the Maastricht Treaty has been interpreted {{as an attempt to}} reconciliate the objective of sound public finances with the availability of adequate margins for stabilisation. However, with the debt rule set in the Treaty unchanged, there is a risk that the Pact will not fully achieve the desired reconciliation. Using the budget to implement stabilisation policy while still ensuring a reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio during cyclical downturns, as required by the Treaty, is likely to require large <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Assuming positive nominal growth rates, the closer the debt ratio is to 60 per cent the larger are the surpluses needed. If countries with debt ratios higher than 60 per cent set insufficiently ambitious deficit targets, {{they will not be able}} to make full use of the margins allowed by the 3 per cent threshold. During cyclical downturns such countries may have to adopt a pro-cyclical budgetary stance. The regulation of the interaction between deficit and debt rules is complicated by the EU definitions of debt and deficit, as they refer to different groups of transactions and are based on different accounting conventions.

40|$|A UK {{company may}} give its {{shareholders}} {{the option to}} elect to receive additional shares in the company {{in lieu of a}} cash dividend. The share alternative is referred to as a scrip dividend. Scrip dividends offer tax savings to some UK companies, and may be beneficial to certain shareholders. The type of company that can benefit from scrip dividends is one that has <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> advance corporation tax (ACT). This may arise because the company distributes either foreign source profits or preference income (income that is subject to tax). There has been a {{decline in the number of}} companies with <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT over the past ten years. This has been largely due to the reduction of preference income following the Finance Act of 1984. On the basis of the analysis presented in the paper it is expected that companies with <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT will offer scrip dividends and, as the number of companies in this position has declined over the past decade, there will be a reduction in the number of companies offering scrip dividends. A company without <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT obtains a timing benefit rather than a tax savings by offering scrip dividends. As there are costs in offering scrip dividends, it is expected that companies without <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT will not offer scrip dividends. The results of the study show that the scrip dividends became popular amongst UK companies when fewer companies had preference income as the effect of the Finance Act of 1984. Also, contrary to expectations, companies without <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT offer scrip dividends. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the paper. The tax rules on scrip dividends make a scrip dividend equivalent to the value of the net cash dividend unattractive to some groups of shareholders. It is therefore expected that the take-up of the scrip alternative will be low. This is confirmed by the results of the stud...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that a fiscal rule should boost {{discipline}} and credibility. A rule should also reduce macroeconomic volatility and be easily understood.

40|$|From 2001 {{the fiscal}} policy in Chile {{has been based}} on a <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> rule. Under this rule, the {{government}} is committing itself to maintain its expenditures equal to the structural revenue minus the target for the <b>structural</b> <b>surplus,</b> which is expressed in terms of the GDP. The calculation of the structural balance depends on trend output, the long-run copper price and the structural income from Codelco's molybdenum sale. While the latter is calculated with a reference price determined as the average of past prices, panels of independent experts, who meet once a year, determine the two former. The fact that independent experts have substantial influence on the fiscal budget makes the Chilean fiscal rule different from similar rules applied in other countries.
