500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, sitting {{president}} George H.W. Bush banned broccoli from Air Force One, stating, [...] "I {{do not like}} broccoli. And I haven't liked it <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid and my mother made me eat it, and I'm President of the United States. And I’m not going to eat any more broccoli." [...] In response to the ban, an estimated ten tons of broccoli {{were sent to the}} White House, which Barbara Bush in turn donated to the Capital Area Food Bank. That same year, the president visited the food bank and incorporated it into his Points of Light Foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Afterward, Jack {{returns to}} the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two {{converse}} fondly: [...] "My son—I love you." [...] Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can't decide. Mary challenges him: [...] "Were you lying when you said your career came before everything?" [...] Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: [...] "I haven't sung Kol Nidre <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy." [...] His mother tells him, [...] "Do what is in your heart, Jakie—if you sing and God is not in your voice— your father will know." [...] The producer cajoles Jack: [...] "You're a jazz singer at heart!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers {{was raised}} in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often {{reported}} that {{she was born in}} Westport; however, in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers attended Burr Farms Elementary School, Hillspoint Elementary School, Long Lots Junior High School, and Staples High School. Her father tried to discourage her from pursuing a modeling career, citing brutal competition. [...] "Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid, I've always wanted to be an actress," [...] Chambers said in 1997. [...] "I was always a performer, a junior Olympic diver, a junior Olympic gymnast. My mother always told me I was a show-off".|$|E

2500|$|Jemison flew {{her only}} space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as a Mission Specialist on STS-47, a {{cooperative}} mission between the United States and Japan, {{as well as}} the 50th shuttle mission. Jemison was a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. [...] "The first thing I saw from space was Chicago, my hometown," [...] said Jemison. [...] "I was working on the middeck where there aren't many windows, and as we passed over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl I had always assumed I would go into space," [...] Jemison added. Despite NASA's rigid protocol, Jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate. [...] "Hailing frequencies open," [...] she could be heard repeating throughout the eight-day mission.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approval}} {{came after}} nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the {{executive vice president of}} Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. [...] Trevino later recalled: [...] "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved." [...] Wallenda later remarked [...] "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know [...] ". [...] Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. [...] After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. [...] Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. [...] The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
