40|$|Several {{technologies}} for characterizing genes and proteins from humans and other organisms use yeast growth or color development as read outs. The yeast two-hybrid assay, for example, detects protein-protein interactions {{by measuring the}} growth of yeast on a <b>specific</b> <b>solid</b> <b>medium,</b> or {{the ability of the}} yeast to change color when grown on a medium containing a chromogenic substrate. Current systems for analyzing the results of these types of assays rely on subjective and inefficient scoring of growth or color by human experts. Here an image analysis system is described for scoring yeast growth and color development in high throughput biological assays. The goal is to locate the spots and score them in color images of two types of plates named “X-Gal ” and “growth assay ” plates, with uniformly placed spots (cell areas) on each plate (both plates in one image). The scoring system relies on color for the X-Gal spots, and texture properties for the growth assay spots. A maximum likelihood projection-based segmentation is developed to automatically locate spots of yeast on each plate. Then color histogram and wavelet texture features are extracted for scoring using an optimal linear transformation. Finally an artificial neural network is used to scor...|$|E
40|$|Ureaplasma urealyticum is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{during pregnancy}} and in newborns. Other clinical {{problems related to}} U. urealyticum infections are: no susceptibility to cell wall-active drugs, limits of antibiotic treatment in pregnancy, and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility against U. urealyticum from various countries are few and controversial. The antimicrobial susceptibility of U. urealyticum, isolated from cervical swabs and collected from outpatient childbearing-aged women in Italy from 2009 to 2012, was performed against fluoroquinolones, macrolides, streptogramin and tetracyclines, using an available biochemical commercial kit and a <b>specific</b> <b>solid</b> culture <b>medium,</b> to improve the therapeutic management of these pathogenic agents.

Results indicated that steam explosion changed {{the structure of}} <b>solid</b> <b>medium</b> at both molecular and three-dimensional structural levels, which exposed hydrophilic groups and enlarged pores and cavities.

Therefore, steam explosion sterilization increased the effective contact area for microbial cells on <b>solid</b> <b>medium,</b> which contributed to improving SSF performance.
