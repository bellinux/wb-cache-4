5|$|Considering Ragnvald's background, {{it is not}} <b>surprising</b> that he rose {{to become}} {{an officer of the}} Varangian Guard: he was a wealthy {{chieftain}} who brought many ambitious soldiers to Greece.|$|E
5|$|G.E. Authentick Memoirs of the Life and <b>Surprising</b> Adventures of John Sheppard by Way of Familiar Letters from a Gentleman in Town. 1724.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>surprising</b> {{moment of}} candour at the ZANU-PF {{congress}} in December 2014, President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip {{that the opposition}} had in fact won the contentious 2008 polls by an astounding 73%.|$|E
5|$|Jimmie Åkesson of the Sweden Democrats, {{coming off}} a <b>surprising</b> electoral result himself, called the result {{delightful}} and that his party has such common themes with the True Finns as criticism of the EU and immigration.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} not <b>surprising</b> that the cure for {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat <b>surprising</b> because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing <b>surprising</b> about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E
5|$|As a goaltender, Lehman was {{a strong}} skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, {{and was able to}} pass the puck to his forwards, <b>surprising</b> the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by {{shooting}} the puck in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender to duplicate such a feat was Ron Hextall, who did it in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Fischer played 1.c4 (instead of 1.e4) {{for only}} {{the third time in}} a serious game. With 3.d4 the game {{transposed}} to the Queen's Gambit, <b>surprising</b> many who had never seen Fischer play the White side of that opening. In fact, he had previously openly condemned it.|$|E
5|$|In Ardis, Maryland, a {{high-speed}} police chase unfolds at a waterfront. The {{driver of the}} car, Dr. William Secare, is cornered by officers but fights them off with <b>surprising</b> ease. Secare is shot as he runs up a gangplank and leaps off a ship into the water. The police fail to locate him but discover that his blood is green.|$|E
5|$|In September 1946, Broderick was {{assigned}} to the office of Mayor William O'Dwyer in an unannounced confidential capacity, a move that many in city government found <b>surprising.</b> After a few months he was abruptly transferred to the Main Office Division, and in July 1947, he retired from the police department.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{where there}} was an {{increasing}} interest in {{the remains of the}} city's pagan past, where scholars turned from reading Medieval Church Latin to Classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of St Augustine, the presence, in the Sistine Chapel of five pagan prophets is not <b>surprising.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{molecular}} studies, the preservation of a specimen that can vouch {{for the source of}} the tissue sample used to gather genetic data has been recommended, as genetic analysis often yields <b>surprising</b> results that make reexamination of the original specimen crucial.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>surprising</b> {{then that}} Kaiser, Hunka, and Bianchini (1971) {{concluded}} that the affective symptoms of depression are less specific and appear to shift from loading on one dimension to another {{depending on the type}} of sample being studied.|$|E
5|$|Its great {{distance}} and <b>surprising</b> activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{rounded off}} his Ashes {{series with the}} Fifth Test at The Oval. English skipper Norman Yardley elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, a {{decision}} many regarded as <b>surprising.</b> Precipitation {{in the past week}} rendered play before midday impossible. Former Australian Test batsman and leading commentator Jack Fingleton speculated that the tourists would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|Normally a {{sluggish}} species, {{it relies on}} camouflage for protection. Locomotion is primarily rectilinear, using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided by its own weight for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with <b>surprising</b> speed.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its <b>surprising</b> effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1917, he was {{temporarily}} placed {{in command of}} his battalion's South Australian-raised sister unit of the 3rd Brigade, the 10th Battalion. After briefly returning to his old unit on 6 July, he took command of the 10th Battalion with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 15 July. This was considered a <b>surprising</b> promotion, as {{at the time he}} was junior to forty majors then in the AIF.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1974 a {{coalition}} government was finally established by a royal decree with Souvanna as president. Due to the defeatism and political deterioration of the rightists within the kingdom, the Pathet Lao moved adroitly, slowly preempting the government and military and soon winning a <b>surprising</b> popularity among the Lao population.|$|E
5|$|One <b>surprising</b> {{prediction}} of the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{an example}} of an aposematic organism. Their bright {{coloration}} advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is <b>surprising</b> given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Ragnarök is briefly {{referenced}} in stanza 40 of {{the poem}} Helgakviða Hundingsbana II. Here, the valkyrie Sigrún's unnamed maid is passing the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane's burial mound. Helgi is there with a retinue of men, <b>surprising</b> the maid. The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if Ragnarök has occurred. In stanza 41, Helgi responds that it is neither.|$|E
5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, {{a witness}} to the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet. Only the remarkable punting of Simkins kept the game from being a debacle. I recall vividly one incident of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how <b>surprising</b> was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{was glad}} to be back at winter {{quarters}} in Camp Piatt, Virginia, and believed they had completed their work for the year. On November 22, Colonel Paxton received a <b>surprising</b> order from the new division commander, recently promoted Brigadier General George Crook.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a pivotal {{moment in the}} Southern campaign. The <b>surprising</b> victory of the American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats {{at the hands of}} Lord Cornwallis, and greatly raised the Patriots' morale. With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed, Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina and retreated into South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 2017 {{of a third}} species, P. tapanuliensis, from Sumatra south of Lake Toba, came with a <b>surprising</b> twist: it is {{more closely related to}} the Bornean species, P. pygmaeus than to its fellow Sumatran species, P. abelii.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is not <b>surprising</b> that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this <b>surprising</b> {{turn of events}} defused the situation, but to many observers the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king come back with them to Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{impulse to}} make {{teaching}} or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and <b>surprising</b> or pleasing shapes. Some {{of these have}} inspired artists such as the Dadaists Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst, and following Man Ray, Hiroshi Sugimoto.|$|E
5|$|The most {{interesting}} and <b>surprising</b> results occur when i>n. The first such surprise was {{the discovery of}} a mapping called the Hopf fibration, which wraps the 3-sphere S3 around the usual sphere S2 in a non-trivial fashion, and so is not equivalent to a one-point mapping.|$|E
5|$|Turning down {{job offers}} from Fisk and Howard, Du Bois re-joined the NAACP as {{director}} of the Department of Special Research. <b>Surprising</b> many NAACP leaders, Du Bois jumped into the job with vigor and determination. During the 10 years while Du Bois was away from the NAACP, its income had increased fourfold, and its membership had soared to 325,000 members.|$|E
5|$|What {{is perhaps}} more <b>surprising</b> is that Prince of Wales {{returned}} to British ownership. There is an entry {{for her in}} the supplemental (i.e., late addition) pages for the 1797 volume. One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured her in the West Indies, but so far evidence for the conjecture is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed {{one after another}} of his more <b>surprising</b> claims, including the active camouflage of the octopus {{and the ability of}} elephants to snorkel with their trunks while swimming. The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E
5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, <b>surprising</b> most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, <b>surprising</b> many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
