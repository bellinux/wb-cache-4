5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! <b>Second,</b> <b>she</b> {{was in love with}} Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

40|$|Learning English {{becomes more}} and more {{important}} nowadays since we know that English is one of the international languages which can be used to communicate around the world. In Indonesia, English is learnt as a foreign language. Learning a different language is sometimes difficult since the target language has different elements compared to the native language. These differences sometimes cause students to make errors when using it. This final project primarily deals with grammatical error analysis. It describes the grammatical errors on speaking competence made by 2010 Speaking Class of ELT Department of IAIN Walisongo. The writer used the qualitative approach of which the data were obtained from the students’ monolog speaking. These writings were then analyzed. The grammatical errors were classified as in producing verb group, errors in subject-verb agreement, errors in the use of articles, errors in the use of prepositions, errors in noun pluralization, errors in the use of pronouns, and errors in the use of conjunctions. The methods will be used by the researcher to get the data in this research is as follows: Observation; can be defined as the systematic noting and recording of events, behaviors, and artifacts (object) in the social setting chosen for the study. Interview; in this research, researcher will do the interview with the students to show their errors and ask them to find the correct one. Documentation; By this method, researcher seeks the data about the grammatical errors of ELT department students of IAIN Walisongo Semarang. From the result in chapter IV The writer can conclude that the analysis with eight students, Azis made eight sentences in 1 minute 37 second. He made seven errors in six sentences.
