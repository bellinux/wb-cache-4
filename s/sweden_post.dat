40|$|Objective—To analyse {{incidence}} of sick-ness {{for women and}} men relative to potential aetiological factors at work— physical, psychosocial, and organisa-tional. Methods—The study group comprised 1557 female and 1913 male employees of <b>Sweden</b> <b>Post.</b> Sickness absence was measured by {{incidence of}} sickness (sick leave events and person-days at risk). Information on explanatory factors was obtained by a postal questionnaire, and incidence of sickness was based on admin-istrative files of the company. Results—Complaints about heavy lifting and monotonous movements were associ-ated with increased risk of high incidence of sickness among both women and men. For heavy lifting, an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 70 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 22 to 2. 39) among women, and OR 1. 70 (1. 20 to 2. 41) among men was found. For monotonous movements the risk esti-mates were OR 1. 42 (1. 03 to 1. 97) and OR 1. 45 (1. 08 to 1. 95) for women and men, respectively. Working instead of taking sick leave when ill, was more prevalent in the group with {{a high incidence of}} sickness (OR 1. 74 (1. 30 to 2. 33) for women,OR 1. 60 (1. 22 to 2. 10) for men). Overtime work of more than 50 hours a year was linked with low incidence of sickness for women and men. Among women, 16 % reported bully-ing at the workplace, which was linked with a doubled risk of high incidence of sickness (OR 1. 91 (1. 31 to 2. 77)). For men, the strongest association was found for those reporting anxiety about reorganisa-tion of the workplace (OR 1. 93 (1. 34 to 2. 77)). Conclusions—Certain physical, psychoso-cial, and organisational factors were im-portant determinants of incidence of sickness, independently of each other. Some of the associations were sex specific...|$|E
40|$|In Sweden like in {{many other}} {{countries}} in Europe there is an ongoing process of making old, bureaucratic public service organizations, such as Vattenfall (heat and electricity generation), <b>Sweden</b> <b>Post,</b> Swedish Rail and Telia (telecommunication), more business like and capable of operating in a deregulated market in competition with other service providers. This paper focuses on Swedish Rail and its line maintenance operations in particular. We analyse the efforts of line maintenance management to construct a business organization {{in accordance with the}} intentions and values expressed by top management and within the web of interdependences which constitute Swedish Rail. We see (re) organizing as an ongoing process of social construction among actors both internal and external to the organization. Internally interaction cuts across hierarchical levels which cause problems of translation and interpretation. (Czarniawska&Sevón, 1996). The social construction of a new business organization includes several dimensions such as redefining the relations to important others such as top management, internal and external customers and suppliers which will determine its autonomy, boundaries and social identity, the construction of internal coordination and control and the definition and measurement of results. Social reconstruction is interactive which also means that ideas and initiatives must be reciprocated by others for the new identity of the organization to gain legitimation. We will illustrate and analyse texts, talk and rituals in the line maintenance management team and face-to-face interaction between managers at the division level with those at the shop level. We will also analyse texts from top management and the views which are expressed mutually by the line maintenance and its customers and suppliers. Our analysis will show the process of sensemaking (Weick, 1995) in action to deal with the confusion of identity and the dilemmas created by the new ideals. The main dilemmas we define as - being businessminded without doing business - being customeroriented without any customers - being in control without having contro...|$|E

Then, Anton sent me some really cool graphics that he painted that set the whole tone for the video. The whole video gives me a lot of disclosure, both on the inside and on the outside but I like it.

40|$|The {{level and}} costs of {{sickness}} absence in Sweden have fluctuated over time {{and there are also}} important regional variations within the country with a higher rate of sickness absence in the northern part. Sickness absence tend to be more common in women than in men and several factors, besides ill health, at a societal, organisational, social and individual level have been discussed as possible causes of sickness absence. Sweden has had a long tradition of low unemployment. During the last decade there have been substantial changes in the Swedish labour market that have resulted in an increased unemployment rate. Large studies have shown an increased mortality associated with unemployment but it is still controversial to what extent this represents a causal association. The general aim of this thesis was twofold: Firstly, to study factors at work and outside work in relation to sickness absence in an integrated fashion and keeping a gender perspective. Secondly, to analyse unemployment in relation to subsequent mortality taking into account sociodemographic, lifestyle, personality and early childhood factors. In the analyses of sickness absence the study population consisted of all employees in three of <b>Sweden</b> <b>Post's</b> regional organisations (n= 3 470). Incidence of sickness absence in the study population was recorded during the period 1992 - 1994. An extensive questionnaire was sent out in 1994 including questions about factors at work and outside work of possible importance for sickness absence. The association between unemployment and mortality was analysed using the younger cohort of the Swedish twin registry including all same sexed twin pairs born 1926 - 1958. The study population encompassed those responding to a comprehensive mailed questionnaire in 1973 reporting a job title (n= 20 632 individuals). All causes of death as well as specific causes of death were followed between 1973 and 1996. A decrease in the incidence of sickness absence was observed after the introduction of a qualifying day in 1993. The proportion of long-term sick-leave events (15 - 365 days) increased and among men, long-term events of sickness absence increased also in absolute terms. Long-lasting or serious illness and frequent colds showed strong associations with sickness absence. Subjects with high sickness absence frequently reported physical exhaustion after work and tiredness prohibiting leisure time activities. Among women, m particular complaints due to work in a forward-bent position, complaints due to heavy lifting, occurrence of bullying at the workplace and working while ill (sickness presenteeism) was associated with a high sickness absence. Among men, a high sickness absence was related to anxiety about reorganisation of the workplace, working while ill, no supervisor position and complaints due to heavy lifting. Concerning factors outside work, use of tranquillizers, and a need to recover from staying at home with sick children was associated with high sickness absence among women. In addition, for married/cohabitant women with children a high domestic workload increased the occurrence of sickness absence. Among men, experience of a relative's serious sickness, accident or death, use of alcohol as sedative, and divorce were suggested to be important determinants. Unemployment was found to increase the risk of early death even after adjustment for several social, behavioural, health, personality and early childhood factors among both women and men. Use of tranquillisers or sleeping pills, certain personality characteristics, low education, and serious or long lasting illness was found to further strengthen the association between unemployment and mortality The increased mortality among unemployed subjects was in part attributable to an increased mortality from suicides and accidents or injuries with uncertainty if caused by accident or by intention. In conclusion the results of this thesis suggest that changes in the sickness benefit system as well as several factors at work and outside work, besides Ill health, influence the incidence of sickness absence. In addition, the results indicate that unemployment increases the risk of early death, in part due to an increased risk of suicides, in both men and women taking several sociodemographic, lifestyle, personality and early childhood factors into account...|$|R

40|$|Communicating archaeological {{findings}} to the public has become increasingly important in contract archeology {{in recent years and}} is now a legal requirement. Public contacts earlier meant that it was the experts, the archaeologists, who would communicate the knowledge to the public.

It may therefore be important to present the own activities in a way that strengthens the brand and to legitimize the business for the County Administration that shares the commissions, as well as for those providing the funding, the taxpayers. This paper is based on a case study on how archaeologists produce narratives on themselves, their profession and archaeology as a science on a Facebook page and on blog posts, connected to an archaeological project in the county of Östergötland in <b>Sweden.</b> The Facebook <b>posts</b> and snapshots from the blog have been reviewed and classified in an analysis of the narrative the archaeologists mediates.

40|$|Directive 96 / 71 /EC {{concerning}} the {{posting of workers}} {{in the framework of}} the provision of services has as its main purpose to prevent social dumping throughout the European Union. This stated purpose is obtained by establishing conditions that posting employers have to comply with regarding for example wages. These conditions will be implemented in the Member States through laws, collective agreements or arbitrations that has general effect. Previously the implementation of a directive through a collective agreement has not been allowed but with this new directive even the Swedish model of collective agreements has been accepted as a method of implementation. Most of the regulations in the Directive have been implemented in the Swedish law on posted workers. In this law there are references to already existing Swedish legislation regarding the different areas. Rules concerning minimum wages are found in the Swedish collective agreements, as Swedish legislation regarding this area, do not exist. In the Swedish law on posted workers there are no references that refer to the collective agreements in these matters. There are however rules stipulating that Arbetsmiljöverket, the Swedish office of relations, will give needed information {{concerning the}} employment- regulations that have to be applied when sending <b>posted</b> workers in <b>Sweden.</b> Companies that are interested in sending <b>posted</b> workers to <b>Sweden</b> will have to contact Arbetsmil-jöverket in order to get information about the applicable collective agreements and minimum wages. Arbetsmiljöverket has however recieved critique for not fulfilling this responsibility in a satisfying way. When foreign employers arrive to <b>Sweden</b> with <b>posted</b> workers they mostly sign a local collective agreement in order to be bound by the conditions stated there. Foreign employers also have the possibility to get a temporary membership in a Swedish employers’ association in order to be bound by the collective agreement that already exists between the association and the corresponding employee association. The employers’ association, above all Teknikföretagen, has recieved critique from the Swedish unions for allowing temporary memberships in their organisations. The unions find that they, in those situations, lack satisfying opportunities to control the foreign employers. If a foreign employer refuses to sign a Swedish labour contract, the union may take offensive action to force the employer to sign the contract. According to the rules of Lex Britannia, the union also has the possibility to force foreign employers to sign a labour contract although they might already be bound to a contract in their native country. These rules have received a great deal of criticism for being contrary to EC-law. Most recently the issue was raised in the “Vaxholm-case”. This case made the Swedish labour court request a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice, in accordance with article 234 in the EC-treaty. It is difficult to ensure that foreign employers do not breach the Swedish labour con-tracts they have signed, for example by not paying the salaries they are obliged to pay. According to § 19 MBL, the Swedish union has the right to collect information from the employer if their employees are members of the union. This has caused problems when it comes to posted workers since it is very rare that they are members of a Swedish union. There is a proposal to extend the § 19 MBL. If the proposal is accepted the Swedish union will also be allowed to control employees that are employed by a company even if they are not members of the union. An alternative to the Swedish system of collective contract is the system of contract with general effect that is used in Finland. Finland has a labour legislation that is relatively similar to the Swedish legislation. Both sides on the Swedish labour market are however satisfied with the Swedish system. The system allows great amount of flexi-bility as it is not influenced by the Swedish government. The current Swedish system sufficiently guarantees minimum wages to posted workers. With some changes the system could however become even better. Arbetsmiljöverket must, for example, control that the information given is enough and also that it is understandable for foreign employers. If the suggested changes in the 19 § of MBL will be accepted, the Swedish system will become even more secure regarding the possibility of guaranteeing minimum wages to posted workers...|$|R

All of these contributions adopt the framework of "neo-corporatism" in their analysis. By contrast, this paper is grounded in the theory of public choice. The concept of "neo-corporatism" has been developed in a body of international literature concerned with the institutional structures through which policy was developed and implemented in countries such as Austria and <b>Sweden</b> in the <b>post</b> war period (Grant, 1985). These institutional structures evolved out of the imperatives of post-war reconstruction and the balance of power between labour, capital and state. The prefix neo- is used to distinguish the institutional arrangements in these social democracies from those in place in fascist Italy which have been referred to as corporatist. There is much confusion over the exact meaning of "neo-corporatism", but there seems to be some agreement that it centrally involves the relationship between the state and organised interests such as business and labour. In the countries identified as neo-corporatist, this relationship was structured in such a way as to influence the behaviour of each of these parties towards the attainment of national objectives such as growth and low unemployment (ibid: 4). There are two reasons why I have chosen not to use neo-corporatism as the means of analysis in this paper. Firstly, the thinking around the concept has been developed inductively from the experiences of particular societies, but a plausible deductive theory of what transpired in these societies has not been forthcoming (Olson, 1986). To use a crude example, it might thus be said that while we can observe that Sweden had very low levels of unemployment for most of the post-war period and that Swedish policy making was characterised at the time by a particular type of interaction between government, labour and business, neo-corporatist theory does not offer a robust (deductive) argument of why certain policy making institutions led to particular desirable social outcomes. In other words, the understanding of the causal relationship between existing institutions and social outcomes remains undeveloped. The second reason for not using a neo-corporatist framework in the analysis which follows is that the political and economic conditions in contemporary South Africa are very removed from those of European neo-corporatist countries, and thus inductive theory based on the European experience is not of much use. In particular, as is argued in Chapter Two, the state, seen as the primary factor directing the policy making process in neo-corporatist theory, has played a very ambiguous role in the South African experience of forum based policy making. As South African policy forums have arisen during a period of political transition, the government has had neither the confidence nor the legitimacy to play the directing role which has characterised episodes of neo-corporatism in other countries. The paper is divided into two chapters. The first considers a deductive theory of interest group behaviour developed from the literature of public choice and the second applies this to South Africa's recent experience of policy forums. Most public choice literature {{is concerned with}} the state, as processes influencing government such as voting and lobbying are seen as a central means through which individuals take collective action. In addition, it is through government bureaus that the goods and services demanded through this action are supplied (Mueller, 1976; Wolf, 1979). As stated, the emphasis in what follows is slightly different in that the activities of interest groups is the major subject of consideration...|$|R
