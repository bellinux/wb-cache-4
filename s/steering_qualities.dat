[...] "The object of lengthening was to provide more space for an armament mounted entirely on one deck except for chase guns. Such extensions are carried out by a process well recognised in naval architecture; which is quote possible at any stage {{in the building of}} a ship afterwards, not by adding to the extremities, but in cutting her in two at the point of greatest beam and separating the halves sufficiently to insert a new section between them. This is usually done by erecting a launching cradle round the stern half, moving it down the slipways on the cradle as far as required and building up the gap. In such fashion the Prince Consort, Caledonia and Ocean (as well as the Royal Alfred and Royal Oak) were each drawn out 23 feet when already partially on the frame... But as the midship portion of a hull is always the part subjected to the greatest sagging and hogging strains in a head or following sea, special care is necessary to ensure the inserted section is sufficiently strongly built in; particularly if it has to bear the burden of the engines {{as it did in the}} Prince Consort class. Exceptionally stout timbering was therefore used for the purpose in those ships; even with that their central structure sometimes exhibit signs of stress giving rise to trouble in a minor degree." [...] "Although the added central section had a full bilge throughout, their floors rose in the old fashion forward and aft, because their underwater lines had taken shape before conversion was ordered and could not be altered without an almost entire rebuilding of the ship. This reduced the carrying capacity of the hull compared with that of a full bodied vessel such as the Bellerophon; but retained a good model for easy movement and contributed to their excellent <b>steering</b> <b>qualities</b> alike under steam and sail." ...|$|E

40|$|Beam {{steering}} {{has been}} achieved using shear horizontal waves generated using a periodic permanent magnet (PPM) electromagnetic transducer (EMAT). Unlike phased arrays, where steering is achieved by carefully controlling the firing of individual elements, the spatial periodicity of the PPM EMAT is ultilised to steer the beam whilst exciting all elements simultaneously. Due to the periodic nature of the array, the interference of individual waves {{from each of the}} elements creates a highly frequency dependent angle of propagation, allowing the directivity to be changed by simply varying the frequency of the input signal. Simultaneous excitation precludes the need for complicated and expensive phased array hardware. A frequency domain model is developed so that the beam characteristics, such as steering angle and beam width, can be calculated, allowing for investigation into the beam <b>steering</b> <b>qualities</b> of the PPM transducer. Broadband pulsed generation is also demonstrated, showing how a wave is generated over a large range of angles, meaning a large area can be covered with a single pulse. Interesting properties of this wave, such as a variation of frequency as a function of angle, and how this can be useful, are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Steering</b> {{feel and}} <b>quality</b> are terms {{commonly}} used in the automotive industry when describing passenger car steering systems. However, a procedure for the quantification of these terms does not exist, let alone a concise definition of what they constitute. This thesis puts forward a hypothesis by which <b>steering</b> <b>quality</b> and feel are described by the input/output relationships of the steering system {{and how they are}} perceived by the driver. Good control properties are postulated for these relationships and an experiment is conducted, where they are altered in a manner proposed to affect quality. A methodology for the objective assessment of the control properties is developed, employing vehicle dynamic testing and representation by a mathematical model. This is put into practice to evaluate the outcome of the experiment. It was found that the methodology was successful in detecting and quantifying the alteration in the vehicle control properties. A subjective evaluation was performed to assess the experiment in terms of the quality and feel perceived by the driver. The subjective judgement delivered a result, where the deviation in quality agreed with the objective quantities hypothesised to describe quality. The thesis provides a significant step in the understanding of what is termed <b>steering</b> feel and <b>quality.</b> The methodology, successful in quantifying the experimental results with respect to quality, constitutes a scientific advancement in the current procedures for the assessment of <b>steering</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|R

Two vehicle models, the common single track model and a detailed model from the Mod-elica vehicle dynamics library are investigated. Since exact inversion of the detailed vehicle model turns out not to be feasible, approximate inversion is accom-plished by means of a novel control structure called inverse disturbance observer. Simulations of a double lane change maneuver are conducted for illustration. Finally, wavelet power spectra of the steering angle signal are used for steering effort assessment. ...|$|R

Normally simulators are used for familiarisation with the practical aspect of ship manoeuvrability. However, for providing knowledge on university level it is necessary to explain the dynamics of ship motion characteristic in more detail and based on the mathematical equation of ships motion. In the paper and presentation some examples will be given on how to use the software package MATLAB & SIMULINK as simulation Tool in teaching maritime students and even to build up more sophisticated programs for use in teaching, simulation and on board ships. The introduction starts with a simplified approach of the Equations of ships motion and samples for manoeuvres on straight track like coasting from full ahead to stop. Extending the equation for steering forces gives access to discuss steering motion of ships. Simplified Modelling of ships forces acting on the vessel like thrust and steering forces complete the set of equations. The graphical representation of the dynamic system by blocks in SIMULINK allows for an overview easy to understand to students as a sort of flow diagram. Results from fast time simulation of several manoeuvres using a more enhanced program version SIMOPT allow for a discussion of yaw stability of ships and its impact on <b>steering</b> <b>quality.</b> A simplified model for rolling motion of ships is given and some examples are simulated to explain the general effects of stability and wave parameters. The relation of these results to the more practical use for decision making to avoid resonance effects of ships in waves by loading operations or speed/course changes is demonstrated by means of a sophisticated software tool ARROW interfaced to a voyage planning program.

This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year.

It has recently {{built up a}} large motion based simulator {{to be able to}} simulate driving situations and new assistance functions with a very high degree of realism. This paper will describe in detail the requirements and design ideas of the new simulator and show some first impressions of the simulator in operation. The simulator is a motion based system with a high quality large field of view projection system and carries a full vehicle cabin. An innovative hexapod design with the hydraulic cylinders hinged at the upper rim of the projection system delivers a very large motion envelope within only six meters ceiling height. Another benefit of the novel design is that the rotation point is lying in a plane below the actuator hinges, which promises a big advantage for tilt coordination. A modular rear-projection system with nine channels equipped with high resolution DLP-projectors offers a field of view of 270 °x 40 ° and a total resolution of about 8500 x 1240 pixels. The use of a rear projection system guarantees an unobstructed projection even with a large cockpit. The simulator is driven by a real passenger car, a VW Golf.

This was greatly enhanced by World War I military uses and {{the beginning of a new}} age of fuel usage and consumption. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1909 set national policy for an intracoastal waterway from Boston to the Rio Grande, and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1910 authorized a 9 x 100 ft channel on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway between the Apalachicola River and St. Andrews Bay, Florida, as well as a study of the most efficient means to move cargo. Between 1910 and 1914, navigation channels were deepened, and the screw propeller proved efficient for improved <b>steering</b> and flanking <b>qualities.</b> Also during this period the Panama Canal Act was passed, in 1911; it proved key to the revival of waterway transportation in the United States, because the opening of Panama Canal in 1914 allowed coastal shipping to extend to the US west coast for the first time. The law also prohibited railroads from owning, controlling, or operating a water carrier through the canal and led to succeeding legislation that eliminated monopoly of transportation modes by railroads. The country's World War I experience demonstrated the need for bulk cargo transportation, with Congress establishing the Federal Barge Lines and spurring development of cheaper ways to transport farm commodities, including the first use of standardized freight barges.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Outcome {{assessment}} {{is the standard}} for {{evaluating the quality of}} health services worldwide. In this study, outcome has been divided into immediate and final outcome. Aim was to compare an intervention hospital with a Continuous Quality Improvement approach to a control group using benchmark assessments of immediate outcome indicators in surgical care. Results were compared to final outcome indicators. METHOD: Surgical care quality in six hospitals in Tanzania was assessed from 2006 - 2011, using the Hospital Performance Assessment Tool. Independent observers assessed structural, process and outcome quality using checklists based on evidence-based guidelines. The number of surgical key procedures over the benchmark of 80 % was compared between the intervention hospital and the control group. Results were compared to Case Fatality Rates. RESULTS: In the intervention hospital, in 2006, two of nine key procedures reached the benchmark, one in 2009, and four in 2011. In the control group, one of nine key procedures reached the benchmark in 2006, one in 2009, and none in 2011. Case Fatality Rate for all in-patients in the intervention hospital was 5. 5 % (n =  12, 530) in 2006, 3. 5 % (n =  21, 114) in 2009 and 4. 6 % (n =  18, 840) in 2011.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used treatment for men with localised prostate cancer. Conformal radiotherapy (CFRT) is a relatively new development. MRC RT 01 was set-up to explore optimum CFRT dose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RT 01 was an international multi-centre randomised controlled trial for men with T 1 b-T 3 a, N 0, M 0 prostate cancer that evolved from a single-centre pilot trial of similar design. All men received at least 3 months of pre-radiotherapy hormone treatment, before randomisation to standard (64 Gy) or high dose (74 Gy) radical CFRT. Accrual was completed in December 2001 with 843 men randomised from 25 centres in less than 4 years. RT 01 has been a catalyst for implementing CFRT across UK. In addition to the Trial Management Group, independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and independent Trial <b>Steering</b> Committee, a <b>Quality</b> of Life and Health Economics (QL/HE) group, a radiotherapy Quality Assurance (QA) Group and a Radiography Trial Implementation Group were set up. The QL/HE group ensured implementation, compliance, analysis and interpretation of the QL and HE data in the trial. The inauguration of QA and Radiography groups facilitated inter-centre collaboration. The QA Group ensured procedures were in place before and during trial participation, and monitored quality and consistency with systems including a physics questionnaire, a clinical examples exercise, a standard operating procedure document, designing and building a phantom, and convening a complications modelling subgroup. The Radiography group agreed and implemented technique improvements. RESULTS: More centres participated than initially predicted, enabling recruitment better than scheduled. The trial expedited the implementation of CFRT in many UK radiotherapy centres. Additionally, the QA and Radiography groups helped ensure smooth initiation and established consistency in planning, dosimetry and delivery of prostate CFRT services at participating UK centres. Considerable data has been collected; a series of papers will be produced, although mature clinical trial results are not anticipated until 2006 - 2008...|$|R
40|$|Background: High {{quality of}} HIV care in low-income {{countries}} {{is vitally important}} {{in order to ensure}} the long-term success of HIV treatment programs. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the quality of health services at the HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment Center of the regional referral hospital Bombo Regional Hospital in Northern Tanzania. Methods: In 2010 and 2013, a quantitative quality assessment tool was used to assess immediate outcome indicators for structural and process quality in all areas of hospital services with HIV-specific relevance. The results were compared to final outcome data. In a checklist-based peer-assessment, a total of 446 items were rated on a Likert scale from " 0 " (0 %) to " 2 " (100 %) in which " 2 " represented the Expected Performance Level derived from evidence-based guidelines. The benchmark for sufficient quality was set at 80 % of the Expected Performance Level. Results: Clinical Areas: The level of structural quality was sufficient in the Out-Patient Department, but below benchmark in the Medical Wards and the Care and Treatment Center itself. Regarding process quality, none of the 15 key procedures concerning clinical procedures scored above 80 % in 2010. During the study period, four key procedures improved. However, only two out of these four key procedures improved sufficiently to reach the benchmark in 2013. Non-Clinical Areas: The average ratings for structural and process quality in the non-clinical areas "Pharmacy" and "Main Laboratory" were better than those in the clinical areas. Process quality at the pharmacy increased from 2010 to 2013. Final Outcome Data: Mortality and loss to follow-up as reported by hospital statistics decreased during the study period, corresponding with the increase in quality measured by the immediate outcome indicators. However, latency and limited specificity of final outcome data may impede the utilization of final outcome as a <b>steering</b> tool for <b>quality</b> improvement efforts. Conclusion: These two benchmark assessments of HIV-related care quality identified areas of strength and those in need of improvement. Comparison of data from 2010 and 2013 suggested that the implementation of quality assessments had a positive effect on the quality of care. Nevertheless, shortcomings in important areas of clinical care remained. In order to address these problems, the results of the quality assessments should be used to plan targeted interventions in the context of a quality improvement program...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} biopharmaceuticals has strengthened {{the interest in}} the development of specific analytical and separation technologies to resolve complex mixtures of proteins into highly pure end products at an industrial scale. One of the key elements of these purification processes is the preservation of the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein products to maintain their biological efficiency. The knowledge about possible conformational state(s) and the thermodynamic behaviour of important biomolecules such as peptides and proteins when associated with chromatographic ligands commonly used in these purification processes is crucial for effective productivity <b>steering</b> and <b>quality</b> control. Thermodynamic information can direct the design of new chromatographic methods for the isolation and purification of recombinantly produced proteins increasing the selectivity for the desirable product using ideal combinations of chromatographic ligands and experimental conditions. Chromatographic conditions which specifically eliminate conformationally problematic contaminants are still under-developed as the thermodynamic differences between product and by-product retention behaviour have not been established for many biomolecules. In previous work, Melander and Horvath have established that the salt dependence of solubility and retention in hydrophobic interaction chromatography can be described by the two antagonistic effects of salts on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Because of this latter property, the chemical nature of the applied salts has a determining role in hydrophobic interaction chromatography. However, since proteins can undergo structural changes such as unfolding in solution with different salt composition and be subject to structural rearrangements as they interact with chromatographic ligands, the thermodynamic framework of Melander and Horvath requires a re-evaluation and further development to include an interactive term. The changes in thermodynamic parameters can be monitored by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPC) or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and compared to the results obtained in bulk solution. Differences in thermodynamics may reveal different protein unfolding routes in the two different systems as well as shed light on the validity of the underlying assumptions incorporated into the van`t Hoff equation. In this PhD thesis RPC and HIC were used to assess the thermodynamics of the interaction of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and horse heart myoglobin (HMYO) with n-butyl and n-octadecyl chromatographic ligands commonly used in protein analysis and purification in various organic and aqueous salt solutions and at various temperatures. Thermodynamic parameters derived from their retention times are expected to shed light on the nature of molecular occurrences that lie behind the hydrophobic interaction processes. These parameters such as the Gibbs free energy ∆G_assoc^o, the enthalpy ∆H_assoc^o, the entropy ∆S_assoc^o and the heat capacity ∆C_p^o elucidate how the hydrophobic effect in different solvational environments, such as aqueous-organic or aqueous-salt solutions affects the thermodynamics of protein immobilised-ligand interactions. Solubility of proteins and their retention on hydrophobic surfaces follow similar principles; both are related to the interactions that occur on the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interfaces. However, in a very special case if a protein is close to salting out conditions the hydrophobic interactions are strengthened providing an opportunity for in-depth investigations of the molecular arrangements on a hydrophobic contact area. An elegant tool for such investigations applicable for high-throughput analysis of protein solubility is a fully automated liquid handling robot which also allows obtaining retention data of proteins on HIC ligands in various chromatographic media obtained under identical handling conditions. Correlation of the HIC retention data with the results of the solubility experiments using the corresponding salt solutions within the concentration range of protein elution is expected to deliver information about the unique chromatographic behaviour of proteins from a different aspect as normally used in HIC methods. Solubility data when correlated with the thermodynamic parameters obtained on HIC ligands will shed light on the energetic conditions of the proteins in various solutions which are related to the hydrophobic effect both in solution and on hydrophobic surfaces. Monitoring the expected heat- and salt-induced changes of the shape and structure of HEWL and HMYO with circular dichroism spectroscopy (CDS) is expected to reveal the contribution of the helical, β-sheet, β-turn and unordered structural motifs to the protein ligand interaction under the applied conditions. Furthermore, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments can provide valuable information about the outer shape of the proteins in various salt solutions and temperatures. The outcome of the CDS and SAXS experiments will be correlated with the thermodynamic data obtained on butyl and phenyl HIC ligands. This may allow deep insights into the energetics of the globular protein - non-polar surface interactions governed by the physical and chemical properties of the solid phase, eluent and temperature and will reveal variations of the structural elements and the molecular shape of the proteins {{as a result of the}} employed experimental conditions. The knowledge of the conformational state(s) that proteins can adopt in association with these chromatographic ligands and the thermodynamic parameters underlying these interactions will allow informed choices on column materials, eluent composition and separation conditions for the preservation of their biologically active secondary and tertiary structures in production and quality control. Once the differences in the interaction thermodynamics between the folded, native protein and its unfolded forms have been determined, improved quality-by-design methods for column-assisted protein refolding methods may be possible. Finally this study is intended to advance knowledge on how to best guide the development of green, tailor-made chromatographic methods for protein analysis and purification in the pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the quality management practices at the teacher education institutions in Pakistan. The study was delimited to the Departments of Education/ Institutes of Education and Research of public sector universities in Pakistan. All the teachers including heads of the Departments/Institutes of Education at public universities of Pakistan formed the population of the study. Since the number of teacher educators was limited, all the population was taken as sample for questionnaire survey. The required data was collected by administering two questionnaires i. e. Teachersï¿½€™ Questionnaire and Expertsï¿½€™ Questionnaire, and conducting interviews of QEC heads and HODs. Teachersï¿½€™ Questionnaire, which contained two scales, was meant for investigating the perceptions of teacher educators of 19 public universities about current practices of quality management in their respective institutions and identifying the important components of quality in teacher education. The Quality Management Practices Scale (QMPS) consisted of 75 statements on five-point Liker scale relating to nine subscales: top management commitment, leadership, human resource management, benchmarking, processes, stakeholder focus, physical and academic resources, partnership and linkages, and information and analysis. In the Quality Management Components Scale (QMCS), teacher educators were requested to identify on four-point scale the relative importance of 30 items for managing quality at teacher education departments/institutes of public universities. The return rate of Teachersï¿½€™ Questionnaire was 70. 72 %. The Cronbach Alpha values for the QMP Scale and QMC Scale were 0. 859 and 0. 885 respectively, which showed high reliability of the scales. The Expertsï¿½€™ Questionnaire was used for validation of the Draft Quality Management Model developed by the researcher. In this questionnaire, experts were asked five open ended questions pertaining to following aspects of the proposed modelsimplicity and comprehensiveness, viability, deficiency, relevance with Pakistani context, and its attraction for the relevant organizations. The return rate of Expertsï¿½€™ Questionnaire was 63. 33 %. The Interview Schedule included five openended questions covering following aspects use of quality assurance/ quality management model, implementation of the HEC guidelines for quality assurance, major initiatives taken for quality improvement, effectiveness of quality assurance initiatives, and major problems affecting quality of academic programmes. The data collected through Teachersï¿½€™ Questionnaire was analyzed by using frequency distribution, calculating mean response scores and applying chi-square test, wherea information collected through interviews and expertsï¿½€™ questionnaire were analyzed qualitatively. It was concluded that low to moderate level quality management practices xisted at teacher education institutions included in the study. A sizable number of teacher educators were not satisfied with the present state of quality management at their institutions. Comparatively, the most favourable views were given from the respondents about the subscale ï¿½€œhuman resource managementï¿½€ï¿½ whereas teachers were least satisfied with the ï¿½€œbenchmarkingï¿½€ï¿½ aspect of quality management at their institutions. There {{was no significant difference between}} the perceptions of male and female teachers for majority items of the QMP Scale. On various aspects of quality management, old institutions appeared to be slightly stronger than newly established teacher training organizations, and other teacher education institutions were relatively better as compared to University of Education. Out of 30 elements rated by teachers, the components that received ï¿½€˜most importantï¿½€™ rating by the majority of respondents included ï¿½€œtop management commitment to qualityï¿½€ï¿½, ï¿½€œestablishing academic standards/ performance indicatorsï¿½€ï¿½, ï¿½€œteachers' satisfaction with working conditionsï¿½€ï¿½, ï¿½€œteachers' professional developmentï¿½€ï¿½, and ï¿½€œlong-term planningï¿½€ï¿½. The findings of interviews of QEC heads and HODs revealed that universities including Departments of Education/ IERs were following Quality Assurance Framework suggested by the Higher Education Commission. Major initiatives taken by Education Departments/ IERs included outlining the missions and visions of the departments and the academic programmes following admission criteria suggested by HEC; revision of curricula of teacher education programmes obtaining feedback from the important stakeholders about the effectiveness of teaching and academic courses self-assessment of academic programmes documentation of self-assessment results; analysis of selfassessment data; and preparation for accrediting teacher education programmes. For implementing and improving the quality related initiatives, it was suggested that a <b>Quality</b> <b>Steering</b> Committee should be constituted at all the teacher education institutions of public universities. It was further recommended that the proposed quality management model (attached in Appendix VI) may be implemented by the university Departments of Education/ IERs to improve quality of academic programmes and institutional management...|$|R
