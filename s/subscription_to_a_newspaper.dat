The problem was to determine the pattern of mortality of <b>subscriptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> daily <b>newspaper,</b> and thereby to ascertain the average life of such subscriptions. The method of solution, here with indicated, involved the collection of data from a probability sample of subscribers to the newspaper, and use of these data <b>to</b> construct <b>a</b> Markov chain. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{digitalization}} and {{the diffusion}} of connected mobile devices have urged media companies to deliver their content in digital formats such as apps. We evaluate differences in customers' preferences and willingness to pay between traditional and digital content services conducting an adaptive conjoint analysis. Within this analysis we compare <b>subscriptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> printed <b>newspaper</b> with <b>subscriptions</b> <b>to</b> the website, e-paper, smartphone app or tablet app of this newspaper. Our results show that customers still prefer the printed newspaper over any digital format. The acceptance of digital newspaper formats depends on device ownership but the website is most popular in general. Our findings have profound implications for multi-platform publishing strategies. Content providers have to examine carefully in in which situations their products might be used and which devices their potential customers own in order to choose the right formats and prices...|$|R

60|$|From Quebec to Montreal {{there are}} two modes of travel. There are the steamers up the St. Lawrence, which, as all the world know, is, or at any rate {{hitherto}} has been, the high-road of the Canadas; {{and there is the}} Grand Trunk Railway. Passengers choosing the latter go toward Portland as far as Richmond, and there join the main line of the road, passing from Richmond on to Montreal. We learned while at Quebec that it behooved us not to leave the colony till we had seen the lake and mountains of Memphremagog; and, as we were clearly neglecting our duty with regard to the Saguenay, we felt bound to make such amends as lay in our power by deviating from our way to the lake above named. In order to do this we were obliged to choose the railway, and to go back beyond Richmond to the station at Sherbrooke. Sherbrooke is a large village on the confines of Canada, and, as it is on the railway, will no doubt become a large town. It is very prettily situated on the meeting of two rivers; it has three or four churches, and intends to thrive. It possesses two newspapers, of the prosperity of which I should be inclined to feel less assured. The annual <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> such <b>a</b> <b>newspaper,</b> published twice <b>a</b> week, is ten shillings. A sale of a thousand copies is not considered bad. Such a sale would produce 500 pounds a year; and this would, if entirely devoted to that purpose, give <b>a</b> moderate income <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gentleman qualified <b>to</b> conduct <b>a</b> <b>newspaper.</b> But the paper and printing must cost something, and the capital invested should receive its proper remuneration. And then--such at least is the general idea--the getting together of news and the framing of intelligence is a costly operation. I can only hope that all this is paid for by the advertisements, for I must trust that the editors do not receive less than the moderate sum above named. At Sherbrooke we are still in Lower Canada. Indeed, as regards distance, we are when there nearly as far removed from Upper Canada as at Quebec. But the race of people here is very different. The French population had made their way down into these townships before the English and American war broke out, but had not done so in great numbers. The country was then very unapproachable, being far to the south of the St. Lawrence, and far also from-any great line of internal communication toward the Atlantic. But, nevertheless, many settlers made their way in here from the States--men who preferred to live under British rule, and perhaps doubted the stability of the new order of things. They or their children have remained here since; and, as the whole country has been opened up by the railway, many others have flocked in. Thus a better class of people than the French hold possession of the larger farms, and are on the whole doing well. I am told that many Americans are now coming here, driven over the borders from Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont by fears of the war and the weight of taxation. I do not think that fears of war or the paying of taxes drive many individuals away from home. Men who would be so influenced have not the amount of foresight which would induce them to avoid such evils; or, at any rate, such fears would act slowly. Laborers, however, will go where work is certain, where work is well paid, and where the wages to be earned will give plenty in return. It may be that work will become scarce in the States, as it has done with those poor jewelers at Attleborough of whom we spoke, and that food will become dear. If this be so, laborers from the States will no doubt find their way into Canada.|$|R
