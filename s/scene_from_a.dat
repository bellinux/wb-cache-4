5|$|Sierra {{wanted the}} game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a {{director}} with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris, whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated {{a great deal from}} the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro VLahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.|$|E
25|$|The <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>A</b> View to a Kill (the last James Bond film to star Roger Moore) is {{particularly}} memorable for the blaze which tore {{through the building}} {{as a result of}} an attempt to kill Bond and Stacey Sutton, however they managed to escape stealing a fire truck in the process.|$|E
25|$|This lanx, {{what was}} left of it, was {{decorated}} with pastoral and hunting motifs around the edges, and at the centre was a <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> boar hunt, similar to the pagan ones on the Mildenhall bowls. On one fragment there was also a curious scene of a cherubic figure riding a lion.|$|E

The employee was later identified as first-year social studies teacher Megan Silberberger, who tried to apprehend Fryberg as {{he may have been}} attempting to reload.|$|E

25|$|The image {{dates to}} 1852, the most {{productive}} year of Kunisada's career, during which he produced almost one thousand compositions. The image depicts a <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> kabuki play entitled Otogi banashi Hakata no imaori (御伽譚博多新織), which was staged at Edo's Nakamura-za theatre in 1852. The image takes its original title from the character represented: Yaeki hime no rei (八重機姫の霊 - the ghost of Princess Yaeki). Although not named on the print, the character was played by actor Onoe Baikō (尾上梅幸).|$|E

The 150th anniversary of Tennessee statehood was commemorated by a 3-cent stamp on June 1, 1946. The Tennessee State Capitol is in the center, flanked by portraits of Andrew Jackson, the first U. S. President from Tennessee (left) and John Sevier, the first governor of Tennessee (right).|$|E
25|$|This {{ran from}} a point just {{upstream}} of Temple Island. At the first regatta in 1839, the finish line was Henley Bridge itself, but it was presumably quickly realised that this had inherent problems. From 1840 onward the finish was moved downstream slightly; eventually a point opposite the lawn of the Red Lion Hotel became the standard finish line. A grandstand was erected for the Stewards and their guests outside the Red Lion. Other spectators could watch from the adjacent roadway (in front of the Little White Hart Hotel) while those with carriages surveyed the <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> vantage point on Henley Bridge. There were three racing stations (Berkshire, Centre and Buckinghamshire). When only two crews raced, the Centre Station was not used.|$|E
25|$|Garland {{was elected}} to the United States Senate for a term {{beginning}} in 1867, but was not allowed to take the seat as Arkansas had not yet been readmitted to the Union. He continued practicing law and observing the political <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance. In 1872, with the Republican Party split into three factions, Arkansas Democrats sought Garland to help elect Democrats into the state legislature and had been considered for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. During the conflict known as the Brooks-Baxter War, he sided with Governor Elisha Baxter and was a primary strategist for him. He was an advisor and constitutional scholar at the next state constitutional convention and, with strong support from the Democratic Party, was elected Governor of Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|Kröd, however, {{refuses to}} kiss his Succubus because he still misses Aneka. Kröd is {{attacked}} by the demons and his possessed friends, but he fights his way loose and kills the Succubi and Incubus, freeing Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce. They find the tower, but Kröd realizes he has lost the key Grimshank gave him, so he instead lights it by firing a flaming arrow at the pyre. Once it is lit, however, the group is surprised when the tower explodes and collapses. Grimshank, who watched the <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> telescope, informs Aneka that Kröd has been killed, causing her to weep on his tunic. He leaves and places the tears in a vial. Meanwhile, Dongalor is told by Barnabus that Grimshank, actually a double agent, has succeeded in killing Kröd and retrieving the Pagan tears needed to activate the weapon.|$|E
25|$|To {{convince}} the Fox Studio that a Planet of the Apes film could be made, the producers shot a brief test <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Rod Serling {{draft of the}} script, using early versions of the ape makeup. Charlton Heston appeared as {{an early version of}} Taylor (named Thomas, as he was in the Serling-penned drafts), Edward G. Robinson appeared as Zaius, while two then-unknown Fox contract actors, James Brolin and Linda Harrison, played Cornelius and Zira. This test footage is included on several DVD releases of the film, as well as the documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes. Linda Harrison, at the time the girlfriend of studio chief Richard Zanuck, went on to play Nova in the 1968 film and its first sequel, and had a cameo in Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes more than 30 years later, which was also produced by Zanuck. Although Harrison often opined that the producers had always had her in mind for the role of Nova, they had, in fact, considered first Ursula Andress, then Raquel Welch, and Angelique Pettyjohn. When these three women proved unavailable or uninterested, Zanuck gave the part to Harrison. Dr. Zaius was originally to have been played by Robinson, but he backed out due to the heavy makeup and long sessions required to apply it. Robinson later made his final film, Soylent Green (1973), opposite his one-time Ten Commandments (1956) co-star Heston.|$|E

The song, along with the rest of Reign in Blood, was {{recorded}} in 1986 in Los Angeles, California, with producer Rick Rubin.|$|E

500|$|In May 1903, Trueblood {{became the}} subject of {{national}} media attention {{as a result of a}} newspaper article written by a 17-year-old freshman student claiming Trueblood was teaching a new [...] "course in lovemaking." [...] The student, Jam Handy, was a campus correspondent for the Chicago Tribune. In the class, Trueblood taught [...] "the delivery of short extracts from masterpieces of oratory." [...] One such extract involved a <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> play in which a man kneels in front of a woman pleading for her hand. In his 1893 textbook Practical Elements of Elocution, Trueblood used the scene to illustrate the [...] "aspirate explosive" [...] form of speech.|$|E
500|$|As a nude <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{major and}} well {{respected}} work of English literature, {{the theme of}} Musidora {{was one of the}} few pretexts under which mainstream English painters felt able to paint nudes, and Musidora has been described as [...] "the nation's surrogate Venus". Four versions of Musidora attributed to Etty exist in total, the first of which was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1843. The best known version is that now in Tate Britain, painted in 1844 and probably first exhibited at the British Institution in 1846. The four paintings are identical in composition, although the landscape background varies slightly. One of the paintings is of poorer quality, and may be a later copy by a student.|$|E
500|$|Sex {{has also}} become an object of modern culture references. American {{performance}} artist Ann Magnuson, {{who had worked with}} Madonna on the 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan, released a parody of the book's photo sessions, where she simulated sex with a giant stuffed bear. In 2010, writer-performer Greg Scarnici released a book parody of Sex, titled Sex in Drag, which featured over 70parodied images from the book. In a deleted <b>scene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 1993episode (Krusty Gets Kancelled) of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, aired as part of The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular, Krusty the Clown attempts to market a book extremely similar to Sex as a means of resolving his financial woes. Krusty is seen in a suggestive pose on the front cover. Unlike Madonna, however, Krusty apparently never appeared fully nude, as he quickly claimed that he used a body double.|$|E
