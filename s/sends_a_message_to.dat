25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the bipolar cell layer, which in turn <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E

500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was glad that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the harder it is for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E
