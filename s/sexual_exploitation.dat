5|$|King {{argues that}} enslaved {{children}} {{did not have the}} opportunities for childhood and thus, did not have childhoods. Slave children instead worked as soon as they could, were often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes no different than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, <b>sexual</b> <b>exploitation,</b> inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|E

40|$|United Nations {{peacekeeping}} {{has been}} distinguished as a bringer {{of peace and}} stability to countries plagued by war and insecurity. However, reports since the 1990 s of <b>sexual</b> <b>exploitations</b> by peacekeeping personnel have tainted these accomplishments. At {{the same time as}} these reports started to surface there was an internal development within the UN where the security discourse went from being state focused to being focused on securing the population’s security and health. This new trend was established in the United Nations Development Programme in 1994 as Human Security and laid the ground for the structure of the peacekeeping operations. This study asks the question how these exploits can occur in a discursive context where the population’s welfare and health is the reference of intervention. By examining the following representative cases: the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR), it can be seen how human security expresses a discursive reproduction of two different kinds of power: biopower and sovereign power. Through an analysis of the discourse in documents relating to the interventions it can be seen how these expressions of power creates a contextual environment where the <b>sexual</b> <b>exploitations</b> can take place...|$|R
