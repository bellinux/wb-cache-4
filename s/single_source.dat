5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a <b>single</b> <b>source</b> and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face.

5|$|Allegorical {{stories are}} central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were {{prominent}} in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest <b>single</b> <b>source</b> of allegorical poetry through the ages.

Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.|$|E

5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the <b>single</b> <b>source</b> vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no obvious}} <b>single</b> <b>source</b> for {{the plot of}} The Tempest, but {{researchers}} have seen parallels in Erasmus's Naufragium, Peter Martyr's De orbe novo, and eyewitness reports by William Strachey and Sylvester Jordain of the real-life shipwreck of the Sea Venture on the islands of Bermuda, and the subsequent conflict between Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers. In addition, one of Gonzalo's speeches is derived from Montaigne's essay Of the Canibales, and much of Prospero's renunciative speech echoes a speech by Medea in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses.

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a <b>single</b> <b>source</b> and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies a buyer’s {{inventory}} control problem under a long-term horizon. The buyer has one major supplier that {{is prone to}} disruption risks and one backup supplier with higher wholesale price. Two kinds of sourcing methods are available for the buyer: <b>single</b> <b>sourcing</b> with/without contingent supply and dual sourcing. In contingent sourcing, the backup supplier is capacitated and/or has yield uncertainty, whereas in dual sourcing the backup supplier has an incentive to offer output flexibility during disrupted periods. The buyer’s expected cost functions and the optimal base-stock levels using each sourcing method under long-term horizon are obtained, respectively. The effects of three risk parameters, disruption probability, contingent capacity or uncertainty, and backup flexibility, are examined using comparative studies and numerical computations. Four <b>sourcing</b> methods, namely, <b>single</b> <b>sourcing</b> with contingent supply, dual <b>sourcing,</b> and <b>single</b> <b>sourcing</b> from {{either of the two}} suppliers, are also compared. These findings {{can be used as a}} valuable guideline for companies to select an appropriate sourcing strategy under supply disruption risks...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} in {{contrast}} to results in the extant literature, <b>single</b> <b>sourcing</b> {{may not be the}} optimal strategy of a buyer facing suppliers with strictly convex costs. As we argue, previous findings relied crucially on the joint assumption that, first, there is only a single buyer and that, second, procurement takes place in an auction organized by the buyer. Relaxing these restrictions, we obtain a richer set of results. In particular, we show that even in the original setting, where suppliers bid, committing to <b>single</b> <b>sourcing</b> is only optimal if the respective buyer controls a sufficiently large fraction of the whole procurement market.

5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a <b>single</b> <b>source</b> for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a <b>single</b> <b>source</b> (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

40|$|A {{tomography}} {{of neural}} sources could be constructed from EEG/MEG recordings once the neuroelectromagnetic inverse problem (NIP) is solved. Unfortunately the NIP lacks a unique solution and therefore additional constraints {{are needed to}} achieve uniqueness. Researchers are then confronted with the dilemma of choosing one solution {{on the basis of}} the advantages publicized by their authors. This study aims to help researchers to better guide their choices by clarifying what is hidden behind inverse solutions oversold by their apparently optimal properties to localize <b>single</b> <b>sources.</b> Here, we introduce an inverse solution (ANA) attaining perfect localization of <b>single</b> <b>sources</b> to illustrate how spurious sources emerge and destroy the reconstruction of simultaneously active sources. Although ANA is probably the simplest and robust alternative for data generated by a <b>single</b> dominant <b>source</b> plus noise, the main contribution of this manuscript is to show that zero localization error of <b>single</b> <b>sources</b> is a trivial and largely uninformative property unable to predict the performance of an inverse solution in presence of simultaneously active sources. We recommend as the most logical strategy for solving the NIP the incorporation of sound additional a priori information about neural generators that supplements the information contained in the data.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a gradient-based method for simultaneous blind separation of arbitrarily linearly mixed source signals. We consider the regular case (i. e., the mixing matrix has full column rank) {{as well as}} the ill-conditioned case (i. e., the mixing matrix does not have full column rank). We provide one necessary and sufficient condition for the identifiability of simultaneous blind separation. According to our identifiability condition and the existing general identifiability condition, all source signals are separated into two categories: separable <b>single</b> <b>sources</b> and inseparable mixtures of several <b>single</b> <b>sources.</b> A sufficient condition is also derived for the existence of optimal partition of the mixing matrix which leads to a unique maximum set of separations. One sufficient condition is proved to show that each maximum partition of the mixing matrix corresponds to a unique class of separated signals and as a result we can determine the number of maximum partitions from the classes of outputs under different separation matrices. For sub-Gaussian or super-Gaussian source signals, a cost function based on fourth-order cumulants is introduced to simultaneously separate all separable <b>single</b> <b>sources</b> and all inseparable mixtures. By minimizing the cost function, a gradient-based method is developed. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the present method.
