40|$|A common {{assumption}} of the shape from texture problem is that a perceived image mainly contains only one type of texture with the same <b>surface</b> <b>orientations.</b> Unfortunately, a natural image is often composed of textured planes with different <b>surface</b> <b>orientations.</b> In {{order to deal with}} the shape from texture problem in a practical manner, we need to segment these <b>surface</b> <b>orientations.</b> The ridges are wavelet attributes in which information about spatial frequencies resides.

This phenomenon was attributed to the creation of an oscillating electric moment that couples to the electromagnetic radiation. Further work lead to the investigation of the role of surface space charge electric fields and associated band-bending in inducing an otherwise forbidden Raman scattering by longitudinal optical vibration modes in InSb.

In a previous paper [2] we carried out evaluations of integration approaches.

Previous methods considered only single light source configurations or particular image irradiance triples, hence no general predictions could be made.

40|$|The {{apparent}} three-dimensionality of a viewed surface presumably {{corresponds to}} several internal preceptual quantities, such as surface curvature, local <b>surface</b> <b>orientation,</b> and depth. These quantities are mathematically related for points within the silhouette bounds of a smooth, continuous surface. For instance, surface curvature {{is related to}} the rate of change of local <b>surface</b> <b>orientation,</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> {{is related to the}} local gradient of distance. It is not clear to what extent these 3 D quantities are determined directly from image information rather than indirectly from mathematically related forms, by differentiation or by integration within boundary constraints. An open empirical question, for example, is to what extent surface curvature is perceived directly, and to what extent it is quantitative rather than qualitative. In addition to <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> and curvature, one derives an impression of depth, i. e., variations in apparent egocentric distance. A static orthographic image is essentially devoid of depth information, and any quantitative depth impression must be inferred from <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> and other sources. Such conversion of orientation to depth does appear to occur, and even to prevail over stereoscopic depth information under some circumstances...|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{relation}} between image intensity and object shape. It is shown that image intensity is related to <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> and that a variation in image intensity is related to surface curvature. Computational methods are developed which use the measured intensity variation across surfaces of smooth objects to determine <b>surface</b> <b>orientation.</b> In general, <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> is not determined locally by the intensity value recorded at each image point. Tools are needed to explore the problem of determining <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> from image intensity. The notion of gradient space, popularized by Huffman and Mackworth, is used to represent <b>surface</b> <b>orientation.</b> The notion of a reflectance map, originated by Horn, is used to represent {{the relation between}} <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> image intensity. The image Hessian is defined and used to represent surface curvature. Properties of surface curvature are expressed as constraints on possible surface orientations corresponding to a given image point. Methods are presented which embed assumptions about surface curvature in algorithms for determining <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> from the intensities recorded in a single view. If additional images of the same object are obtained by varying the direction of incident illumination, then <b>surface</b> <b>orientation</b> is determined locally by the intensity values recorded at each image point. This fact is exploited in a new technique called photometric stereo. The visual inspection of surface defects in metal castings is considered. Two casting applications are discussed. The first is the precision investment casting of turbine blades and vanes for aircraft jet engines. In this application, grain size is an important process variable. The existing industry standard for estimating the average grain size of metals is implemented and demonstrated on a sample turbine vane. Grain size can be computed form the measurements obtained in an image, once the foreshortening effects of surface curvature are accounted for. The second is the green sand mold casting of shuttle eyes for textile looms. Here, physical constraints inherent to the casting process translate into these constraints, {{it is necessary to}} interpret features of intensity as features of object shape. Both applications demonstrate that successful visual inspection requires the ability to interpret observed changes in intensity in the context of surface topography. The theoretical tools developed in this report provide a framework for this interpretation...|$|E
