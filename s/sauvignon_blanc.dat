5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E
5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>Blanc</b> is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> grape {{is also known as}} Fumé Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> have more tropical fruit undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.|$|E
5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>Blanc</b> vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Languedoc-Roussillon area {{is home to}} {{numerous}} grape varieties, including many international varieties like Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc,</b> and Chardonnay. The traditional Rhône grapes of Mourvedre, Grenache, Syrah, and Viognier are also prominent.|$|E
50|$|Semillon {{is one of}} the Cape’s true {{heritage}} white varietals, with origins {{as early}} as the 17th century (when it became known as Groendruif which translates as Green grape), the grape variety accounted for more than 90% of plantings {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. While South African Semillon has not quite taken off as a serious commercial category in single varietal form in the modern era, there are stunning wines being made from especially older vineyards (some of them centurions). More often, the variety plays a role in beefing up the volume of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blancs.</b>|$|R
40|$|New Zealand’s {{climate and}} soil or the “ Terroir” along with {{carefully}} selected suitable grape varieties or the “Cultiva” that allow the varieties to only just ripe have made the country’s wine regions world famous over the last decade. Hence, understanding the nexuses between such unique climate, soil and variety combinations is significantly vital {{to the future of}} New Zealand wine industry. The wine interpretations, for example, Hawke’s Bay <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>Blancs</b> described as mouthfilling, riper and rounder than the more penetrating zingly <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>Blancs</b> from Marlborough or Auckland’s reds portrayed as an earthy, spicy and warmth contrasting to those from the southern that are seen as possessing fresh, vibrant and fruit characters, in fact say a lot about the “Terroir” and “Cultiva”. Interestingly, within some wine regions, there are sub-regions and some instances even within vineyards so called “within-field” variability in soil and climate conditions that seem to influence wine styles to greater extents. Such exceptional environmental conditions, combined with grape varieties and wine making talents have resulted in premium wine styles that have earned New Zealand winemakers a number of accolades in international wine events and soaring wine prices in overseas, especially in UK and USA. Nonetheless, New Zealand wine regions have been poorly mapped when compared to other fine-wine producing countries. In this context, the paper looks at digitising soil, climate, environmental (independent) and wine quality (dependent) related data for mapping and analysing New Zealand’s wine regions at different scales, such as “macro”, “meso” and “within-field”, ultimately for establishing the co-relations between the factors associated with grape vine growth and wine quality ratings...|$|R
5000|$|White Sancerre {{was one of}} the {{original}} AOCs awarded in 1936, with the same area being designated for red wines on 23 January 1959. The AOC area has expanded fourfold over the years, most recently on 18 March 1998.

5|$|The <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> grape traces {{its origins}} to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, {{it is not}} clear that the vine {{originated}} in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with Cabernet Franc to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> is also {{beginning}} to gain prominence {{in areas like}} South Africa's Stellenbosch and Durbanville and Italy's Collio Goriziano areas. It {{is also one of}} the main ingredients in Muffato della Sala, one of Italy's most celebrated sweet wines.|$|E

50|$|Cygne blanc {{is a white}} Australian {{wine grape}} variety that is a {{seedling}} of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 in Western Australia. Unlike Cabernet blanc, which was a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and Resistenzpartner, and Shalistin which is a white-berried color mutation of Cabernet <b>Sauvignon,</b> Cygne <b>blanc</b> is a selfling that sprang from a seed of a Cabernet Sauvignon berry that fell {{on the ground and}} took root.|$|R

5|$|In Australia, {{particularly}} the Margaret River region, the grape is often blended with Sémillon. Varietal styles, made from only the <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> grape, from Adelaide Hills and Padthaway have a style distinctive from their New Zealand neighbors {{that tend to}} be more ripe in flavor with white peach and lime notes and slightly higher acidity.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc.</b>|$|E
5|$|The grape {{originated}} in France, {{in the regions}} of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study we use six nuclear SSR loci (SS 2, MD 5, MD 7, MD 27, ZAG 62 and ZAG 79) to {{characterize}} four autochthonous grapevine cultivars (Băbeasca neagră, Feteasca regalǎ, Frâncuşa, and Grasa de Cotnari), including four international comparative genotypes (Cabernet <b>Sauvignon,</b> Chardonnay <b>Blanc,</b> Riesling Italian and Merlot Noir). The DNA microsatellite {{analysis was used to}} construct a barcode system. The advantage of this mode of grouping data is a visual representation of the number and size of alleles, allowing easy detection of genotypic differences between analysed cultivars. Our results shows that this system of data grouping can be useful for characterisation of Romanian cultivars at molecular level. The integration of such DNA barcodes into nationally and internationally coordinated databases could increase the accuracy with which grapevine genetic resources are managed in Romania...|$|R
25|$|Over 30 {{different}} grapes {{varieties are}} {{grown in the}} Friuli-Venezia Giulia including international varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot {{as well as local}} varieties like Refosco dal peduncolo rosso, Schioppettino, Friulano, Ribolla gialla and Verduzzo. Of the local varieties, Friulano is the most well known and important variety, producing crisp, floral wines that develop notes of nuts and fennel as it ages. The grape was widely known as Tocai Friulano but in 2006 the European Union banned names that have some similarity or association with the Hungarian wine Tokaji. Now Tocai Friulano is called Friulano. The very acidic Ribolla gialla grape was primarily used as a blending component until winemakers started to apply the techniques used with Chardonnay (such as malolactic fermentation) to produce softer, more buttery wines that still retain the crisp, lemon edge of the grape. Wines made from Verduzzo have peach and nutty flavors in their youth but develop more honeyed flavors as the wine ages. The high acidity of the grape works well in sweet production and in regions like Ramandolo it is often dried to make a passito wine. The Picolit grape also does well in sweet wines where it can produce elegant, floral wines that have a dry finish. In contrast to the thin, sometimes bland Pinot grigio produced {{in other parts of the}} Tre-Venezie, well made examples of Friuli Pinot grigio are known for their fuller body and delicate peach, almond and green apple flavors. <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blancs</b> are made in a style reminiscent of Sancerre with smoke, herbs and elements of honey and hazelnut. Some of the most expensive Friuli wines are made from the Picolit grape which is prone to grape diseases and mutations which cause the vine to lose its flowers and grape clusters. In most years, less than half of a vineyard Picolit crop will survive and be able to make wine. The light, honeyed dessert wine that it can produce is often in high demand because of restricted supply.|$|R
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc.</b> In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Other {{varieties}} {{with significant}} production by harvested acres in 2016 are Syrah, Merlot, Tempranillo, Pinot blanc, Gewürztraminer, Viognier, Cabernet franc, Müller-Thurgau, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc,</b> and Zinfandel, V. vinifera based wines produced in smaller quantities include Arneis, Baco noir, Black Muscat, Chenin blanc, Dolcetto, Gamay noir, Grenache, Marechal Foch, Malbec, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petite Syrah, Sangiovese, and Sémillon. The state also produces fruit wine, sparkling wine, late harvest wine, ice wine, and dessert wine.|$|E
5|$|Along with Riesling, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
40|$|Response of grapevine leaf tissue {{naturally}} {{infected by}} Plasmopara viticola in field {{was measured by}} means of chlorophyll fluorescence and reflectance signals. Three susceptible grapevine varieties (Cabernet <b>Sauvignon,</b> Pinot <b>Blanc</b> and Pinot Gris) were used in this study. Since the infection impairs photosynthetic activity, distribution of FV/FM parameter (maximum quantum yield of Photosystem II) over the leaf was effective to discriminate healthy and naturally infected leaf tissue. FV/FM was reduced ~ 25 % in all infected leaf parts. Infected leaf spots expressed significantly altered chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetics expressing much slower electron transport rate both on donor and acceptor site of PSII. Vegetation reflectance indices followed the variations in pigment content after the fungal infection. R 750 /R 700 (R 2 = 0. 877) and CRI (carotenoid reflectance index; R 2 = 0. 735) were the most potent to follow changes in chlorophylls and carotenoids contents, respectively. Infected leaf tissue exhibited decrease in chlorophyll a (~ 50 [*]%) as well as carotenoids (~ 70 %). We conclude that combination of chlorophyll fluorescence and reflectance measurements {{can be used as}} an effective non-invasive tool for an early detection of Plasmopara viticola in field as well as for estimation of the level of infection...|$|R
50|$|It was a {{long road}} for the Indian wine {{industry}} {{to recover from the}} devastation {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Unfavorable religious and public opinion on alcohol developed and culminated in the 1950s when many of India's states prohibited alcohol. Vineyards were either uprooted or encouraged to convert to table grape and raisin production. Some areas, like Goa, continued to produce wine but the product was normally very sweet and highly alcoholic. The turning point of the modern Indian wine industry occurred in early 1980s with the founding of The Tonia Group in the state of Goa. With the assistance of French winemakers, The Tonia Group began to import Vitis vinifera grape varieties like Cabernet <b>Sauvignon,</b> Chardonnay, Pinot <b>blanc,</b> Pinot noir and Ugni blanc and started making still and sparkling wines. Other wineries soon followed as the emergence of India's growing middle class fueled the growth and development of the Indian wine industry.|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of 1005 grapevine accessions was genotyped at 34 microsatellite loci (SSR) {{with the aim}} of analysing genetic diversity and exploring parentages. The comparison of molecular profiles revealed 200 groups of synonymy. The removal of perfect synonyms reduced the database to 745 unique genotypes, on which population genetic parameters were calculated. The analysis of kinship uncovered 74 complete pedigrees, with both parents identified. Many of these parentages were not previously known and are of considerable historical interest, e. g. Chenin <b>blanc</b> (<b>Sauvignon</b> x Traminer rot), CovS (Harslevelu selfed), Incrocio Manzoni 2 - 14 and 2 - 15 (Cabernet franc x Prosecco), Lagrein (Schiava gentile x Teroldego), Malvasia nera of Bolzano (Perera x Schiava gentile), Manzoni moscato (Raboso veronese x Moscato d'Amburgo), Moscato violetto (Moscato bianco x Duraguzza), Muscat of Alexandria (Muscat blanc A petit grain x Axina de tres bias) and others. Statistical robustness of unexpected pedigrees was reinforced with the analysis of an additional 7 - 30 SSRs. Grouping the accessions by profile resulted in a weak correlation with their geographical origin and/or current area of cultivation, revealing a large admixture of local varieties with those most widely cultivated, as a result of ancient commerce and population flow. The SSRs with tri- to penta-nucleotide repeats adopted for the present study showed a great capacity for discriminating amongst accessions, with probabilities of identity by chance as low as 1. 45 x 10 (- 27) and 9. 35 x 10 (- 12) for unrelated and full sib individuals, respectively. A database of allele frequencies and SSR profiles of 32 reference cultivars are provided...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc,</b> Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision {{is the amount of}} contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In {{the early years of the}} New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|In France, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E
25|$|White Bordeaux is predominantly, and {{exclusively}} {{in the case of}} the sweet Sauternes, made from Sémillon, <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc</b> and Muscadelle. Typical blends are usually 80% Sémillon and 20% <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc.</b> As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of Sémillon and a smaller proportion of <b>Sauvignon</b> <b>blanc.</b> Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac.|$|E
