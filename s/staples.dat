40|$|The <b>stapled</b> haemorrhoidectomy {{procedure}} {{has been}} popularized as a painless and effective treatment for prolapsing haemorrhoidal disease. We {{have noted that}} <b>staple</b> line bleeding is a contributory factor to postoperative morbidity. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of consecutive <b>stapled</b> haemorrhoidectomy procedures performed in patients over a 1 -year period. The outpatient, operative and inpatient records were reviewed. We assessed the incidence of intraoperative <b>staple</b> line bleeding, its management and early postoperative outcomes in our patients undergoing <b>stapled</b> haemorrhoidectomy. Results: From March 2000 to March 2001, 39 <b>stapled</b> haemorrhoidectomy procedures were performed. Intraoperative <b>staple</b> line bleeding was recorded in 17 patients (44 %) and suture reinforcement of this <b>staple</b> line was required in 12 (31 %). Nine patients (23 %) were admitted for postoperative per rectal bleeding, four of whom required surgical haemostasis of bleeding points along the <b>staple</b> line. Delayed secondary haemorrhage was seen in one patient. The incidence of postoperative bleeding in patients with noted <b>staple</b> line bleeding was 35 %, compared with 14 % in those without evidence of bleeding. Conclusion: <b>Staple</b> line bleeding is a technical difficulty and complication associated with <b>stapled</b> haemorrhoidectomy.

40|$|<b>Stapled</b> {{peptides}} {{have arisen}} {{as a new}} class of chemical probe and potential therapeutic agents to modulate protein-protein interactions. Here, we report the first two-component i,i+ 7 <b>stapling</b> methodology using two orthogonal, on-resin <b>stapling</b> reactions to incorporate linkers bearing a chiral center on a p 53 -derived <b>stapled</b> peptide. Post-stapling modifications to the <b>staple</b> chain were performed on-resin, enabling rapid access to various peptide derivatives from a single <b>staple.</b> The <b>stapled</b> peptides have increased helicity, protease stability and in vitro binding affinities to MDM 2 compared to the unstapled peptide. This approach can be used to generate a diverse library of <b>stapled</b> peptides with differing properties starting from a single <b>stapled</b> peptide, with scope for much greater functional diversity than that provided by existing <b>stapling</b> methodologies.

After being fed to lose 15 % of their liveweight over 10 weeks, sheep within each <b>staple</b> strength group were assigned in equal numbers to either a low or high protein diet designed to re-gain initialliveweight in 8 weeks. Liveweight, feed intakes and the growth, fibre diameter and fibre length characteristics of wool were measured at regular intervals. After the weight loss and growth regimes were imposed there was no difference in <b>staple</b> strength between the low and high <b>staple</b> strength groups (14. 4 and 14. 9 Nt ktex, respectively). However, coefficient of variation (CV) of fibre diameter remained significantly different between <b>staple</b> strength groups. Wool growth rate at the time of diet change was the only significant component of wool growth and fibre measurements. that was significantly correlated with <b>staple</b> strength. Supplying a high protein diet after a period of weight loss increased wool growth. This changed the position of break along the <b>staple</b> and increased the fibre diameter at the point of break from 13. 0 to 13. 9 J. 1 m without affecting <b>staple</b> strength. It also increased fibre diameter and mean fibre length growth rate. The low <b>staple</b> strength group had a significantly higher CV of fibre length than the high <b>staple</b> strength group. Fibre length growth rate to fibre diameter ratio was stable over time in the high <b>staple</b> strength phenotype but declined with time in the low <b>staple</b> strength line. The results suggest that large weight losses will reduce the difference in <b>staple</b> strength between animals with a history of large difference in <b>staple</b> strength.
