2500|$|With {{regard to}} education, Diogenes says that Heraclitus was [...] "wondrous" [...] (thaumasios, which, as Socrates {{explains}} in Plato's Theaetetus and Gorgias, {{is the beginning}} of philosophy) from childhood. Diogenes relates that Sotion said he was a [...] "hearer" [...] of Xenophanes, which contradicts Heraclitus' statement (<b>so</b> <b>says</b> Diogenes) that he had taught himself by questioning himself. Burnet states in any case that [...] "...Xenophanes left Ionia before Herakleitos was born." [...] Diogenes relates that as a boy Heraclitus had said he [...] "knew nothing" [...] but later claimed to [...] "know everything." [...] His statement that he [...] "heard no one" [...] but [...] "questioned himself," [...] can be placed alongside his statement that [...] "the things that can be seen, heard and learned are what I prize the most." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hasdai I was {{probably}} Bostanai's grandson. The latter's son Solomon had a deciding {{voice in the}} appointments to the gaonate of Sura in the years 733 and 759 [...] Isaac Iskawi I died very soon after Solomon. In the dispute between David's sons Anan and Hananiah regarding the succession the latter was victor; Anan then proclaimed himself anti-exilarch, was imprisoned, and founded the etc. of the Karaites. <b>So</b> <b>says</b> the Jewish Encyclopedia of 1906; {{the origin of the}} Karaites is not uncontroversial. His descendants were regarded by the Karaites as the true exilarchs. The following list of Karaite exilarchs, father being succeeded always by son, is given in the genealogy of one of these [...] "Karaite princes": Anan, Saul, Josiah, Boaz, Jehoshaphat, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Hasdai, Solomon II. Anan's brother Hananiah is not mentioned in this list.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the lead}} up to the Battle of Northampton, the Earls of Warwick and March sent envoys to negotiate, but Buckingham, backed in his {{position}} by his son-in-law, the Earl of Shrewsbury and Lords Beaumont and Egremont, was no longer conciliatory. Buckingham was once again acting as representative of the King and did not allow the Yorkists' envoys to meet Henry. The duke informed them '"the Earl of Warwick shall {{not come to the}} King's presence and if he comes he shall die," [...] and told a group of Yorkist bishops that they were not men of peace, but men of war, and there could be no peace with Warwick. It is likely that a personal animosity pre-existed between the two men by this timeâ€“ possibly as a result of Warwick's previous rent evasion, and that Buckingham's influential voice was used to vote for action in the King's camp. The duke may also have misinterpreted the Yorkists' requests to negotiate as a sign of weakness. It is possible that Buckingham saw the coming battle as an opportunity to settle scores with Warwick (rather than with the Duke of York). If this was <b>so,</b> <b>says</b> Rawcliffe, then these plans [...] "ended abruptly" [...] on the battlefield. Not only this, but Buckingham may also have misjudged the size of the Yorkist army as well the royal soldiers' loyalty.|$|E

2500|$|Ian and Jane {{get married}} in the {{restaurant}} with their friends and family as witnesses. After Lauren tells Peter that she believes Lucy was murdered {{by a member of}} the family, he accuses them of killing Lucy. Jane admits that Bobby accidentally killed Lucy by hitting her over the head with a jewellery box. [...] Though Bobby believed that Lucy was still alive, Jane realized she was dead and covered up her murder by faking a mugging. Ian, Jane and Cindy decide to cover up Lucy's murder however Peter does not agree to do this. Ian, Jane, Bobby and Beth go on holiday for Ian and Jane's honeymoon, and Peter leaves Walford along with Lauren. A few weeks later, Ian and the rest of the Beales return to Walford and reunite Beth with Cindy, but Cindy believes that she is not a capable mother and abandons Beth at the park, but she is picked up by Ian's great nephew Liam Butcher (James Forde). Ian and Jane agree to adopt Beth, but Cindy decides she does not want to be in the same house as her baby, <b>so</b> <b>says</b> that if she is not adopted into a different household, she will tell everyone Bobby killed Lucy. After Beth is taken in by her paternal relatives, Ian tells Cindy to leave and not come back. Jane pays Carol to look after Cindy and Ian finds out from Carol after an argument with her. On the day of Cindy's school prom, Ian reveals this to Cindy. After Cindy gets into a car with two strange men, feeling she has no home, a concerned Ian phones the police. After Cindy returns, Ian tries to convince her she is wanted and Liam convinces her to give her family a chance, so she and Ian make up. Ian and Jane are upset to learn about a new lead in the murder investigation but they still plan silence even after Ben is arrested in the hope that he is released. However, when Max is arrested and charged for the murder, Jane begins to contemplate telling the truth when she feels guilty for not being able to help Carol prove Max's innocence. Ian is adamant that Bobby's role in the murder will not be made public and confronts Sharon when she discovers the truth. Max is found guilty and sentenced to 21 years in prison.|$|E

Though the gold was gone, those were still left. Great babies they were, these Teutons, as I told you at the first; and Narses knew it well, and had used them for his ends for many a year.|$|E
