50|$|The {{saddle coil}} shows {{the most complex}} {{geometry}} of these three coil types.The B1 field is generated primarily by the four vertical wire segments. Because of this coil geometry, the B1 field of a saddle coil is more homogeneous in z direction {{than that of a}} planar coil. The saddle coil can be formed from wire, but it is also often etched from thin copper foil, which is then adhered to glass or PTFE tubing. The latter procedure leads to a high geometric precision, resulting in better B1 homogeneity. The saddle coil is easily accessible and provides a good ‘filling factor’ of the usable area in the magnet bore. For these reasons it is widely used in NMR microscopy. However, these advantages are achieved at the price of decreased sensitivity. Compared to a saddle coil, the sensitivity performance of a <b>solenoidal</b> <b>coil</b> of the same dimensions is approximately three times better.|$|E

40|$|Low-inductance <b>solenoidal</b> <b>coils,</b> {{which usually}} {{refer to the}} nonintersecting type and the braid type, have already been {{employed}} to build superconducting fault current limiters because of their fast recovery and low inductance characteristics. However, despite their usage {{there is still no}} systematical simulation work concerning the AC loss characteristics of the coils built with 2 G high temperature superconducting tapes perhaps because of their complicated structure. In this paper, a new method is proposed to simulate both types of coils with 2 D axisymmetric models solved by H formulation. Following the simulation work, AC losses of both types of low inductance <b>solenoidal</b> <b>coils</b> are compared numerically and experimentally, which verify that the model works well in simulating non-inductive coils. Finally, simulation works show that pitch has significant impact to AC loss of both types of coils and the inter-layer separation has different impact to the AC loss of braid type of coil in case of different applied currents.

40|$|AbstractImproved Poynting's vector method without {{movements}} {{was proposed}} to measure ac losses of HTS tapes, formed into a short straight or a <b>solenoidal</b> <b>coil,</b> which were carrying ac transport currents under transverse ac magnetic fields. In the previous Poynting's vector methods, {{for a short}} straight case two sets of both potential lead pairs and pickup coils were rotated around tapes {{in order to measure}} local energy flow densities, i. e., the distribution of Poynting's vector; for a <b>solenoidal</b> <b>coil</b> case two sets of both potential lead coils and spiral pickup coils were shifted to the coil axis direction by one winding pitch of the <b>solenoidal</b> <b>coil.</b> During moving these sets at low temperature, the data acquisition system was working and the value of ac losses was finally obtained. These previous methods, therefore, have inconveniences such as much time to get the value, much space needed for moving sets, or frequent troubles of movements due to low temperature deformation. The present method based on the following idea can resolve them: as for pillar parts of potential lead lines which are standing on the tape surface, only one plays a substitute role for all as long as all lines are connected together. As a result, immovable arrays of sets can be rigidly arranged, so that the signal measured at each position can be simultaneously. Moreover, information enough to clarify the electromagnetic behavior inside the tape can be obtained, because the sets can put more closely to the tape surface.
