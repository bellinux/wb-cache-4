Al-Maeena, a {{columnist}} for the Saudi Gazette, used the quotation on August 23, 2017 (“Netanyahu is calculatedly following the game plan set by his mentor Ariel Sharon, a former Israeli prime minister who once said in a recorded interview: ‘I don’t know <b>something</b> <b>called</b> International Principles. I vow that I’ll burn every Palestinian child (that) will be born in this area.’”).|$|E

For example, the satirist John Bird is quoted as saying, I {{was a member of}} <b>something</b> <b>called</b> the Socialist Party of Great Britain at school for a while. You had to pass an exam, you know. You could not just join.|$|E

Soon afterwards he learns that this second girl, Thomasina Tuckerton, has died. At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions <b>something</b> <b>called</b> the Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will say no more.|$|E

25|$|The {{general idea}} behind hydropathy during the 1800s {{was to be}} able to induce <b>something</b> <b>called</b> a crisis. The {{thinking}} was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise {{to the surface of the}} skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to cold water in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, Guth heard colleagues {{discussing}} <b>something</b> <b>called</b> {{the horizon}} problem. The microwave background radiation discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson appeared extremely uniform, {{with almost no}} variance. This seemed very paradoxical because, when the radiation was released about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the observable universe had a diameter of 90 million light-years. There {{was no time for}} one end of the cosmos to communicate with the other end, because energy can not move faster than the speed of light. The paradox was resolved, as Guth soon realized, by the inflation theory. Since inflation started with a far smaller amount of matter than the Big Bang had presupposed, an amount so small that all parts would have been in touch with each other. The universe then inflated at billion times the speed of light so the homogeneity remained unbroken. The universe after inflation would have been very uniform even though the parts were not still in touch with each other.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure <b>something</b> <b>called</b> spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{finished}} editing City Lights in December 1930, {{by which}} time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, [...] "Nobody {{in the world but}} Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is the only person that has that peculiar <b>something</b> <b>called</b> 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk." [...] Given its general release in January 1931, City Lights proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million. The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as [...] "the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies". City Lights became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.|$|E

5000|$|Talal Asad later refined {{this notion}} {{by showing that}} many {{assumptions}} about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.Asad argues that before the word [...] "religion" [...] came into common usage, Christianity was a disciplina, a [...] "rule" [...] just {{like that of the}} Roman Empire. This idea {{can be found in the}} writings of St. Augustine (354-430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than <b>something</b> <b>calling</b> one to self-discipline through symbols.|$|R

George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are imagining that there is <b>something</b> <b>called</b> human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us.

[...] Twelve years previously (1999), the Stoics committed a series of murders to further their cause, but have neither been seen nor heard of since. [...] Blanks retrieves DS Mira Barkley (Channing) from her dissatisfying work in another precinct to help with the Stoics; Barkley was his partner during the previous Stoics case. [...] Blanks partners Barkley with rookie detective Jimmy Travers (Long) due to the latter's potential as an intuitive savant. [...] Investigating a nuisance case in an apartment building, Barkley and Travers unwittingly allow the Stoics access to murder an otherwise protected tenant, a college professor of [...] "advanced magical engineering and biology with an emphasis on power plant design." [...] In the dénouement, it is revealed that the Stoics use [...] "mechanical, rather than 'true' magic" [...] which nothing in their world can defend against; the professor was killed using the Stoics' means, <b>something</b> <b>called</b> a bullet.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] to be {{composed}} was the instrumentation, which was done by Xenomania in 2005.

[...] Polydor Records originally intended to release it as a single for [...] (2006) the same year, but was deemed [...] "too downbeat, when a greatest hits single {{needs to be a}} celebration." [...] Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Cole, Sarah Harding and Kimberley Walsh recorded vocals for the song in London, England, while Nadine Coyle recorded her vocals in Los Angeles. Cole deemed the song her favourite from Tangled Up, adding that it gave her [...] "goosebumps". An early version of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] leaked online in September 2007. On 16 November 2007, Tangled Up was released, with [...] "Call the Shots" [...] being released for digital download on 26 November 2007, through Polydor Records, while it was also made available on two different CD single formats the same day.
