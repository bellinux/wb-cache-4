50|$|In {{a master}} keyed lock, {{some or all}} of the shaft hole in the lock have three pins in them instead of two. Between the driver pin and the key pin is a third pin called the <b>spacer</b> <b>pin.</b> Thus each pin line has two shear points, one where the driver and spacer pins meet, and one where the spacer and key pins meet. So the lock will open with two keys; one aligns the first set of shear points and the other aligns the second set of shear points. The locks are {{manufactured}} so one set of shear points is unique to each lock, while the second set is identical in all the locks. A more secure type of mechanism has two separate tumblers, each opened by one key.|$|E
50|$|Above each key pin is a {{corresponding}} set of driver pins, which are spring-loaded. Simpler locks typically {{have only one}} driver pin for each key pin, but locks requiring multi-keyed entry, such {{as a group of}} locks having a master key, may have extra driver <b>pins</b> known as <b>spacer</b> <b>pins.</b> The outer casing has several vertical shafts, which hold the spring-loaded pins.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on post dryout heat transfer regime in annuli with flow obstacles {{was conducted in}} the High-pressure Water Test (HWAT) loop at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. An annulus consisting of two concentric heated pipes (12. 7 x 24. 3) mm, with total heated length equal to 3650 mm was employed as a test section. Three kinds of flow obstacles were used: pin-spacers, cylindrical obstacles and grid obstacles. The experiments performed in the test section with pin-spacers only were considered as the reference case. In two consecutive sets of runs, additional obstacles were placed inside the flow channel while keeping the <b>pin</b> <b>spacers</b> in the same positions. In that way {{the net effect of}} obstacles on heat transfer was measured. The experimental investigations were performed {{in a wide range of}} the operational conditions: mass flux (500 - 1750) kg/(m 2 s), inlet subcooling (10 - 40) K and system pressure (5 - 7) MPa. The wall superheat was measured at 88 different axial positions (40 on the inner tube and 48 on the outer tube) for the conditions mentioned above. A local heat transfer coefficient was calculated based on the measured annulus wall temperatures and the saturated fluid (water) properties. The results show an enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient downstream of flow obstacles. The most significant influence has been observed in case of <b>pin</b> <b>spacers.</b> This result is consistent with blockage area of various obstacles, which was the highest in case of <b>pin</b> <b>spacers.</b> The data obtained in more than 200 runs were compared with two pre-dryout and post-dryout correlations. The correlations show a slight over-prediction of the heat transfer coefficient in both pre-dryout and post-dryout regions. The thesis contains a detailed description of experimental procedures as well as an analysis of the results of measurements.  QC 20111024 SKC: Post Dryout Regim...|$|R
25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff <b>spacers,</b> and push <b>pins</b> with ends that expand after installing.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on post-dryout heat transfer {{was conducted in}} the High-pressure WAter Test (HWAT) loop at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The objective of the experiments {{was to investigate the}} influence of flow obstacles on the post-dryout heat transfer. The investigated operational conditions include mass flux equal to 500  kg/m 2  s, inlet sub-cooling 10  K and system pressure 5 and 7  MPa. The experiments were performed in annuli in which the central rod was supported with five <b>pin</b> <b>spacers.</b> Two additional types of flow obstacles were placed in the exit part of the test section: a cylinder supported on the central rod only and a typical BWR grid spacer cell. The measurements indicate that flow obstacles improve heat transfer in the boiling channel. It has been observed that the dryout power is higher when additional obstacles are present. In addition the wall temperature in post-dryout heat transfer regime is reduced due to increased turbulence and drop deposition. The present data can be used for validation of computational models of post-dryout heat transfer in channels with flow obstacles.

40|$|Gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GFR) designs are being {{developed}} to meet Gen IV goals of sustainability, economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance and physical protection {{as part of an}} International Generation IV Nuclear Energy System Research Initiative effort. Different organizations are involved {{in the development of a}} variety of GFR design concepts. The current analysis has focused on the evaluation of low-pressure drop, pin-core designs with favorable passive cooling properties. Initial evaluation of the passive cooling safety case for the GFR during depressurized decay heat removal accidents with concurrent loss of electric power have resulted in requirements for a reduction of core power density to the 100 w/cc level and a low core pressure drop of 0. 5 bars. Additional design constraints and the implementation of their constraints are evaluated in this study to enhance and passive cooling properties of the reactor. Passive cooling is made easier by a flat radial distribution of the decay heat. One goal of this study was to evaluate the radial power distribution and determine to what extent it can be flattened, since the decay heat is nearly proportional to the fission power at shutdown. In line with this investigation of the radial power profile, an assessment was also made of the control rod configuration. The layout provided a large number of control rod locations with a fixed area provided for control rods. The number of control rods was consistent with other fast reactor designs. The adequacy of the available control rod locations was evaluated. Future studies will be needed to optimize the control rod designs and evaluate the shutdown system. The case for low pressure drop core can be improved by the minimization of pressure drop sources such as the number of required fuel spacers in the subassembly design and by the details of the fuel pin design. The fuel pin design is determined by a number of neutronic, thermal-hydraulic (gas dynamics) and fuel performance considerations. For the purposes of this study, the starting point is the fuel pin design established by the CEA-ANL/US I-NERI collaboration project for the selected 2400 MWt large rector option. Structural mechanics factors are now included in the design assessment. In particular, thermal bowing establishes a bound on the minimum of fuel <b>pin</b> <b>spacers</b> required in each fuel subassembly to prevent the local flow channel restrictions and pin-to-pin mechanical interaction. There are also fabrication limitations on the maximum length of SiC fuel pin cladding which can be manufactured. This geometric limitation effects the minimum ceramic clad thickness which can be produced. This ties into the fuel pin heat transfer and temperature thresholds. All these additional design factors were included in the current iteration on the subassembly design to produce a lower core pressure drop. A more detailed definition of the fuel pin/subassembly design is proposed here to meet these limitations. This subassembly design was then evaluated under low pressure natural convection conditions to assess its acceptability for the decay heat removal accidents. A number of integrated decay heat removal (DHR) loop plus core calculations were performed to scope the thermal-hydraulic response of the subassembly design to the accidents of interest. It is evident that there is a large sensitivity to the guard containment back pressure for these designs. The implication of this conclusion and possible design modifications to reduce this sensitivity will be explored under the auspices of the International GENIV GFR collaborative R&D plan. Chapter 2 describes the core reference design for the 2, 400 MWt GFR being evaluated. The methodology, modeling, and codes used in the analysis of the fuel pin structural behavior are described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 provides the result of the thermal-hydraulic study of the assembly design for the accidents of interest. An evaluation of the performance and control rod reactivity control is also presented in Chapter 2...|$|R
