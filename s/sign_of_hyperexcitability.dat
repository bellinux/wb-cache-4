Gene targeted mouse models of DS mutations replicate patients' phenotype and show reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic inhibition. However, little is known on the properties <b>of</b> network <b>hyperexcitability</b> and on properties of seizure generation in these models. In fact, seizures have been studied thus far with surface electroencephalography (EEG), which did not show if specific brain regions are particularly involved. We have investigated hyperexcitability and epileptiform activities generated in neuronal networks of a mouse model of DS. METHODS: We have studied heterozygous NaV 1. 1 knock-out mice performing field potential recordings in combined hippocampal/cortical slices in vitro and video/depth electrode intracerebral recordings in vivo during hyperthermia-induced seizures. KEY FINDINGS: In slices, we have disclosed specific <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>hyperexcitability</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal circuits in both the pre-epileptic and epileptic periods, and a specific epileptiform activity was generated in the hippocampus upon application of the convulsant 4 -aminopyridine in the epileptic period. During in vivo hyperthermia-induced seizures, we have observed selective hippocampal activity in early preictal phases and pronounced hippocampal activity in the ictal phase. SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified specific epileptiform activities and <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> network <b>hyperexcitability,</b> and disclosed {{the important role of}} the hippocampus in seizure generation in this model. These activities may be potentially used as targets for screenings of antiepileptic approaches...|$|R

40|$|Findings from {{neurological}} {{and clinical}} groups {{have shown that}} increased predisposition to anomalous experience/aura reflects an elevation in aberrant neural processes in the brain. However, studies of anomalous experiences in non-clinical/non-neurological groups are less clear on this matter and are more typically confined to subjective questionnaire measures alone. The current investigation, the first to our knowledge, carried out a transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) study <b>of</b> cortical <b>hyperexcitability,</b> and its association with anomalous experience in non-clinical/non-neurological groups. Sixty participants completed; (i) both excitatory (anodal) and inhibitory (cathodal) brain stimulation conditions of the visual cortex; (ii) a computerised pattern-glare task, where observers reported phantom visual distortions from viewing highly irritable visual patterns (a metric <b>of</b> cortical <b>hyperexcitability),</b> and; (iii) questionnaire measures of predisposition to anomalous perceptions. There were no reliable <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> cortical <b>hyperexcitability</b> (via pattern-glare tasks) when collapsed across the whole sample. However, a significant positive correlation between predisposition to anomalous experience and elevated <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> cortical <b>hyperexcitability</b> was observed. Crucially, {{there was a significant}} negative correlation between tDCS stimulatory conditions. A visual cortex that reacted more strongly to excitatory stimulation, responded less well to inhibitory suppression, and this pattern was related to predisposition to anomalous perceptions. Both findings are consistent with the presence of a hyperexcitable cortex. Collectively the present findings provide objective evidence that the brains of individuals predisposed to anomalous experiences/hallucinations can be hyperexcitable – even in the non-clinical/non-neurological population. These data are consistent with continuum models of anomalous experience and have important implications for contemporary theories of aberrations in self-consciousness...|$|R

Clinical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>hyperexcitability</b> and improvement <b>of</b> disease symptoms upon immunotherapy in some of these disorders suggest a possible pathogenic role of associated aAB. Recent experimental studies report inconsistent results regarding a direct pathogenic influence of anti-GAD 65 aAB affecting inhibitory synaptic transmission in central GABAergic pathways. We here provide a method for direct evaluation of aAB-induced pathomechanisms in the intact hippocampal network. Purified patient IgG fractions containing aAB to GAD 65 together with fixable lipophilic styryl dyes (FMdye) are stereotactically injected into the hilus and the dentate gyrus in anesthetized mice. 24 hours after intrahippocampal injection, acute hippocampal slices are prepared and transferred to a patch-clamp recording setup equipped with a fluorescence light source. Intraneural incorporated FMdyes show correct injection site for patch-clamp recording. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings are performed from granule cells in the dentate gyrus and extracellular stimulation is applied in the border area of the dentate gyrus-hilus region to stimulate GABAergic afferents arising from parvalbumin positive basket cells. GABA-A receptor mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) and miniature IPSC (mIPSC) are recorded after blocking glutamatergic transmission. This approach allows investigation of potential aAB-induced effects on GABA-A receptor signaling ex-vivo in an intact neuronal network.

5000|$|The Chvostek sign (...) is a {{clinical}} <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> existing nerve <b>hyperexcitability</b> (tetany) seen in hypocalcemia.

Though classically described in hypocalcemia, this sign may also be encountered in respiratory alkalosis, such as that seen in hyperventilation, which causes decreased serum Ca2+ with a normal calcium level due to a shift of Ca2+ from the blood to albumin which has become more negative in the alkalotic state.|$|R

We therefore reasoned that Kv 12. 2 (KCNH 3, Elk 2), which is highly expressed in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons 4, could also significantly contribute to the control firing because of its hyperpolarized voltage-activation range 5, 6 (Supplementary Fig. 1).

40|$|Abstract—Clonus {{is defined}} as an {{involuntary}} rhythmic muscle contraction that generally occurs in people who have sustained lesions involving descending motor pathways in the neuraxis, and is usually accompanied by other <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> reflex <b>hyperexcitability</b> such as spasticity. This paper hypothesizes that clonus arises when two conditions occur simultaneously: 1) the reflex pathway contains long delay times (implying innervation of distal limb muscles, exacerbated when these muscles display slow twitch properties) and 2) the excitability of the motoneurons is enhanced. This paper tested this dual hypothesis by developing a computer model representing the ankle reflex pathway. This model included the ankle muscles, afferent and efferent pathways, and a monosy-naptic spinal link between spindle afferents and motoneurons. Simulations show that as the motoneuron current threshold was reduced (reflecting increased excitability of spinal motoneurons), normal reflex responses became unstable and oscillations devel-oped similar to those observed in spastic patients. In parallel, when we choose reflex delay times typical for distal leg muscles in man, system stability is poor, and oscillations occur readily with increasing motoneuron excitability. As simulated pathway delays are reduced, oscillatory behavior is also reduced, and usually damps out. Conversely, as simulated reflex delays are increased, oscillations increase in amplitude and do not decay. Finally, these two phenomena interact, so that increasing motoneuron excitabil-ity will induce reflex oscillations for intermediate loop delays. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} unstable oscillatory behavior, such as the oscillations observed in clonus, will occur when the motoneuron excitability increases in a reflex pathway containing long delays. This change in excitability is mediated by a reduction in motoneuron firing threshold, rather than by an increase in feedback gain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sustained oscillations occur readily through self reexcitation, which reduces the need to propose that a “central oscillator ” must be involved in generating clonus...|$|R

Conclusion: The factorial structure of the CHi, and the increased precision could aid the interpretation of findings from neuroscientific (i. e., brain-imaging / stimulation) examinations of cortical processes underlying aberrant perceptions across a host of clinical, neurological, and pathological conditions. As a consequence, the CHi is a useful and comprehensive proxy measure <b>of</b> cortical <b>hyperexcitability</b> with considerable scientific and clinical utility...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Excessive {{accumulation}} of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides {{in the brain}} results initially in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and finally in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Evidences from experimental and clinical studies show that pathological <b>hyperexcitability</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal neurons is a very early functional impairment observed in progressive memory dysfunctions. Therefore, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) whose mechanism of action is aimed at inhibition <b>of</b> such neuronal <b>hyperexcitability,</b> {{seems to be an}} rationale choice for MCI and AD treatment...|$|R
40|$|Kindling is {{an animal}} model for {{epilepsy}} in which repeated application of an electrical stimulus to brain pathways {{results in an}} epileptic focus. The animal holds a permanent state <b>of</b> <b>hyperexcitability</b> to the stimulus {{for the rest of}} its life. Understanding the cellular and molecular processes underlying hyperexcitability could provide insight into epileptogenesis. Furthermore, it could elucidate cellular and molecular bases of synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. In the present study the long-term effect of a kindled focus in the amygdala on the gamma-isoform of protein kinase C and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor as cellular messengers was evaluated in the cerebral cortex of rats. Following an average of 10 bilaterally generalized seizures kindling stimulation was terminated and rats were left undisturbed for approximately three months. Brains were processed by immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against protein kinase C-gamma and muscarinic cholinergic receptor protein. Digital image analysis of sections through the entire forebrain revealed an increase in optical density of both protein kinase C-gamma and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in the piriform and entorhinal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation site in kindled rats. However, on the ipsilateral side no change was observed in comparison with electrode implanted nonkindled control rats. The observed increase in expression of muscarinic cholinergic receptor protein and a component of the phosphoinositide second messenger system (protein kinase C-gamma) located in specific areas of the cerebral cortex in kindled rats could serve as a basis for the permanent state <b>of</b> <b>hyperexcitability</b> in these rats. It is not the original site of stimulation that must be regarded as the focus, but a new established epileptic focus in the piriform lobe contralateral to the amygdala kindling site...|$|R

40|$|Pyrethroids are {{neurotoxic}} insecticides, {{and they}} can cause poisoning in humans. Their excitatory effect is based primarily on {{an extension of the}} inward sodium urrent in excited nerve membranes. Acute pyrethroid intoxication leads to dose-dependent characteristic clinical symptoms as a result <b>of</b> <b>hyperexcitability</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral and central nervous system. Since pyrethroids are very rapidly detoxified by the human organism and do not accumulate in the body, irreversible illnesses are not known in humans. There are single case reports however, that indicate possible severe neurological disorders caused by pyrethroids. 25 persons in whom neurotoxic diseases caused by pyrethroids had been suspected were investigated. This included analysis of exposure data, clinical neurological and laboratory tests, neuropsychological tests, imaging techniques and neurophysiological measurements. In six cases the first symptoms occurred within 24 hours after pyrethroid exposure. In 17 patients, the time interval between exposure and initial symptoms was several weeks or months. In two cases, the first symptoms occurred before exposure. 15 persons had a high exposure, six of these cases had a mild pyrethroid intoxication. 17 patients had no health disturbances caused by pyrethroids, and eight of these cases had other illnesses requiring medical treatment. In nine patients the Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome was diagnosed. Eight patients showed abnormal clinical findings possibly linked to pyrethroid exposure: in five patients <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a mild polyneuropathy were found. One patient had electroencephalographic evidence of raised cerebral excitability, but no clinical evidence for seizures. Two patients had a significant pyrethroid exposure with <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> mild intoxication: one person with significant occupational exposure to permethrin had a mild tremor, the other patient had hypothyroidism diagnosed after pyrethroid exposure. Publications regarding pyrethroids were sighted and discussed in the context of our clinical findings. Present data reveals no evidence for serious, clinically significant irreversible diseases caused by pyrethroids. According to our investigations a clinical syndrome of chronic pyrethroid intoxication does not exist. Research concerning possible neurotoxic diseases caused by synthetic pyrethroids in humans is still required. This should focus on extrapyramidal disorders, thyroid disturbances, motor neuron disease, polyneuropathy, and epilepsy. Furthermore, the effects of pyrethroids on the of brain developmental phase deserves further investigation. Additive or potentiation effects caused by simultaneous exposure to pyrethroids and other neurotoxic insecticides should be given special consideration...|$|R
