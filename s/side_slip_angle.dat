40|$|In {{a modern}} society, traffic {{congestion}} {{is a major}} problem in every metropolis. To solve the problem of traffic congestion an innovative omni-directional vehicle is proposed. The most important advantage of an omni-directional vehicle is that by steering all four wheels it can turn in a small radius. This means that a smaller area is required for turning or parking. Lots of researches have focused on the use of an omni-directional vehicle for in-door situations, but less research has focussed on its use as an on road vehicle. Therefore, this research has mainly focussed on developing the comprehensive vehicle dynamics model for an omni-directional road vehicle for high velocity conditions, transferring loads and the effect of traction and braking. This research consists of the following three parts: A model was developed for an omni-directional vehicle that mainly focussed on vehicle dynamics in the yaw plane because the <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> and yaw rate are the two most important outputs of a dynamics system and determine its total stability. An innovative four wheel, independent steering system was incorporated into this vehicle dynamics model and the effect of roll motion on the yaw plane was examined.

Then in the actual simulation, and based on the stability criterions, vehicle stability was determined under different scenarios.

Finally, the effect of roll motion such as load transfer and roll steer, and how an independent driving system would affect vehicle stability is presented.

Travertines were taken into consideration depending on DIN 51097 Standard and were categorized in accordance with safe field of use.
