50|$|The Ross <b>Sea</b> <b>circulation,</b> {{dominated}} by polynya processes, is in general very slow-moving. Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) {{is a relatively}} warm, salty and nutrient-rich water mass that flows onto the continental shelf at certain locations in the Ross Sea. Through heat flux, this water mass moderates the ice cover. The near-surface water also provides a warm environment for some animals and nutrients to excite primary production. CDW transport onto the shelf {{is known to be}} persistent and periodic, and is thought to occur at specific locations influenced by bottom topography. The circulation of the Ross Sea is {{dominated by}} a wind-driven gyre. The flow is strongly influenced by three submarine ridges that run from southwest to northeast. Flow over the shelf below the surface layer consists of two anticyclonic gyres connected by a central cyclonic flow. The flow is considerable in spring and winter, due to influencing tides. The Ross Sea is covered with ice for much of the year and ice concentrations and in the south-central region little melting occurs. Ice concentrations in the Ross Sea are influenced by winds with ice remaining in the western region throughout the austral spring and generally melting in January due to local heating. This leads to extremely strong stratification and shallow mixed layers in the western Ross Sea.|$|E
5000|$|Sudden stratospheric warming {{events are}} {{associated}} with weaker polar vortices. This warming of stratospheric air can reverse the circulation in the Arctic Polar Vortex from counter-clockwise to clockwise. These changes aloft force changes in the troposphere below. An example of {{an effect on the}} troposphere is the change in speed of the Atlantic Ocean circulation pattern. A soft spot just south of Greenland is where the initial step of downwelling occurs, nicknamed the [...] "Achilles Heel of the North Atlantic". Small amounts of heating or cooling traveling from the polar vortex can trigger or delay downwelling, altering the Gulf Stream Current of the Atlantic, and the speed of other ocean currents. Since all other oceans depend on the Atlantic Ocean's movement of heat energy, climates across the planet can be dramatically affected. The weakening or strengthening of the polar vortex can alter the <b>sea</b> <b>circulation</b> more than a mile beneath the waves. Strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles, intensify the polar vortex. La Niña-related climate anomalies significantly strengthen the polar vortex. [...] Intensification of the polar vortex produces changes in relative humidity as downward intrusions of dry, stratospheric air enter the vortex core. With a strengthening of the vortex comes a longwave cooling due to a decrease in water vapor concentration near the vortex. The decreased water content is a result of a lower tropopause within the vortex, which places dry stratospheric air above moist tropospheric air. Instability is caused when the vortex tube, the line of concentrated vorticity, is displaced. When this occurs, the vortex rings become more unstable and prone to shifting by planetary waves.The planetary wave activity in both hemispheres varies year-to-year, producing a corresponding response in the strength and temperature of the polar vortex. The number of waves {{around the perimeter of the}} vortex are related to the core size; as the vortex core decreases, the number of waves increase.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{ventilation}} of the atmospheric boundary layer is {{weak in the}} absence of fronts, but is this always true? In this paper we investigate the processes responsible for ventilation of the atmospheric boundary layer during a nonfrontal day that occurred on 9 May 2005 using the UK Met Office Unified Model. Pollution sources are represented by the constant emission of a passive tracer everywhere over land. The ventilation processes observed include shallow convection, turbulent mixing followed by large-scale ascent, a <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulation</b> and coastal outflow. Vertical distributions of tracer are validated qualitatively with AMPEP (Aircraft Measurement of chemical Processing Export fluxes of Pollutants over the UK) CO aircraft measurements and are shown to agree impressively well. Budget calculations of tracers are performed {{in order to determine the}} relative importance of these ventilation processes. Coastal outflow and the <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulation</b> were found to ventilate 26 % of the boundary layer tracer by sunset of which 2 % was above 2 km. A combination of coastal outflow, the <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulation,</b> turbulent mixing and large-scale ascent ventilated 46 % of the boundary layer tracer, of which 10 % was above 2 km. Finally, coastal outflow, the <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulation,</b> turbulent mixing, large-scale ascent and shallow convection together ventilated 52 % of the tracer into the free troposphere, of which 26 % was above 2 km.

40|$|There {{are some}} long {{established}} biases in atmospheric models that originate from {{the representation of}} tropical convection. Previously it {{has been difficult to}} separate cause and effect because errors are often the result of a number of interacting biases. Recently we have gained the ability to run multi-year global climate models simulations with grid-spacings small enough to switch the convective parameterisation off, which permit the convection to develop explicitly. There are clear improvements to the initiation of convective storms and the diurnal cycle of rainfall in the convection-permitting simulations, which enables a new process-study approach to model bias idenfication. In this study multi-year global atmosphere-only climate simulations with and without convective parameterisation are undertaken with the Met Office Unified Model and are analysed over the Maritime Continent region, where convergence from <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulations</b> is key for convection initiation. The analysis shows that although the simulation with parameterised convection is able to reproduce the key rain-forming <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulation,</b> the parameterisation is not able to respond realistically to the circulation. A feedback of errors also occurs; the convective parameterisation causes rain to fall in the early morning, which cools and wets the boundary layer, reducing the land-sea temperature contrast and weakening the sea breeze. This is, however, an effect of the convective bias, rather than a cause of it. Improvements to how and when convection schemes trigger convection will improve both the timing and location of tropical rainfall and representation of <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulations</b> {{are influenced by}} a variety of meteorological and geophysical factors that interact with one another. These circulations can redistribute aerosol particles and pollution and therefore can {{play an important role in}} local air quality, as well as impact remote sensing. In this study, we select 11 factors that have the potential to impact either the <b>sea</b> breeze <b>circulation</b> properties and/or the spatial distribution of aerosols. Simulations are run to identify which of the 11 factors have the largest influence on the sea breeze properties and aerosol concentrations and to subsequently understand the mean response of these variables to the selected factors. All simulations are designed to be representative of conditions in coastal sub tropical environments and are thus relatively dry, as such they do not support deep convection associated with the sea breeze front. For this dry sea breeze regime, we find that the background wind speed was the most influential factor for the sea breeze propagation, with the soil saturation fraction also being important. For the spatial aerosol distribution, the most important factors were the soil moisture, sea-air temperature difference, and the initial boundary layer height. The importance of these factors seems to be strongly tied to the development of the surface-based mixed layer both ahead of and behind the sea breeze front.

Most of the eddies are nonlinear, meaning that eddies can trap and transport water properties. But they weakly interact with the deep New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent that is a key piece of the equatorial circulation. Anticyclonic eddies are particularly efficient to advect salty and warm SW coming from the intrusion of equatorial Pacific waters at Solomon Strait, and to impact the characteristics of the New Guinea Coastal Current.
