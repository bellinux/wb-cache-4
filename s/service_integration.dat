40|$|In this work, {{we examine}} an access scope, a concept in {{authorization}} management broadly {{applied for the}} specification of access constraints in web <b>service</b> <b>integrations.</b> By analyzing a typical use-case of cross-organizational cloud service automation, we show the suboptimal capabilities of static, coarse-grained and inflexible scopes that negatively impact security and management of <b>service</b> <b>integrations</b> on a web scale. Using the graph-based structure that relies on semantic technologies we introduce dereferenceable and selfdescriptive authorization extents that allow expressive, granular and dynamic specification of security requirements. Through its application in the running scenario, we show how this construct can be administered to support confidentiality, integrity and privacy requirements of <b>service</b> <b>integrations</b> by allowing selective information sharing based on contextual properties...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss {{approaches}} to <b>services</b> <b>integration</b> for older people in urban and rural aging environments in The Netherlands, and the preliminary effects of these approaches on local aging conditions. In urban areas, <b>services</b> <b>integration</b> revolves around the creation of functional spatial hierarchy. In rural areas, the emphasis is on forging links between service providers. Outcomes for health and use of professional care services are similar. Out-comes for housing, informal care, and accessibility of services differ between urban and rural areas in ways that can be traced back to local aging conditions and elements of the specific approach to <b>services</b> <b>integration</b> used. In both urban and rural areas, much more could be done to connect formal programs to the lifeworlds of older dwellers...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSFinancial <b>services</b> <b>integration,</b> where a {{financial}} services organisation starts to offer products from another financial services sector, has proliferated since the 1980 ’s and this development {{is expected to}} continue into the foreseeable future. Some financial <b>services</b> <b>integrations</b> are considered to be very successful whereas others were less successful or considered to be failures. This study developed a model of enhanced profitability and competitive advantage of financial services organisations when implementing financial <b>services</b> <b>integration.</b> A draft model was developed based on a literature review making use of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM). In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 22 respondents were used to obtain the views of financial services analysts, consultants, auditors, executives and senior managers to update the FCM. The FCM was finalised following validation by the research respondents. The key drivers of enhanced competitiveness when integrating a product from another financial services sector are identified as organisational fit, compatible corporate culture, target market alignment, sourcing of appropriate skills when integrating complex or specialist products, operating scale, a strong brand and integrating complementary products...|$|R
