5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{copies of the}} genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through her}} {{retirement}} in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co-chair. Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the head of the household science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head of the household arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, {{paleontologist}} Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton {{from the}} slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana. Finding, {{largely due to}} a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1920, Alexander {{was injured}} while {{walking through the}} grounds of the Tatoi estate. A {{domestic}} Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes {{and allows for}} further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E

5|$|The redeveloped Hampden was {{the venue}} for a boxing card headlined by former world {{champion}} Mike Tyson in June 2000. Tyson knocked down Lou Savarese after just 12 {{seconds of the}} fight, which the referee stopped after 38 seconds. The fight ended in farce as the referee, who had been attempting to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> fighters, was also knocked down by Tyson. The disappointed crowd booed Tyson out of the ring, while former fighters Jim Watt and Barry McGuigan criticised his actions. After the fight, Tyson claimed {{that he wanted to}} eat the children of world champion Lennox Lewis, which also drew criticism.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bombs were {{developed}} concurrently during the war: {{a relatively simple}} gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with the marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges of the marsh rice rat, a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies of the marsh rice rat. Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under the marsh rice rat, together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the Batavian ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland, losing sight of them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly guessed the Batavian force's destination, and ordered Sylph to <b>separate,</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the Batavian squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the Batavian squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships were off the Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E

5|$|With Roosevelt's help, Taft {{had little}} {{opposition}} for the Republican nomination {{for president in}} 1908, and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November. In the White House, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs, and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then {{a major source of}} governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party, with which Taft often sympathized, and the progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men. Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates, and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of re-election; he took only Utah and Vermont in Wilson's victory.|$|E
