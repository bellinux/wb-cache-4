A portion went to purchasing and delivering food, while the majority utilized airplanes to participate in rescue missions and deliver supplies, such as plastic sheets and water. The United States ultimately gave $15million in aid to Honduras through various United Nations organizations. Mexico donated food, medicine, and clothing, and Cuba sent a team of doctors and mobile hospitals. Uruguay donated a pump {{for the city of}} Choluteca to restore water there. Several European Countries sent aid to Honduras, in addition to donations from the European Union. France sent medical equipment, and the government of Japan provided a field hospital that helped 300patients per day in the center of Tegucigalpa. Following the storm, the United Nations Development Programme sent a team to Honduras and El Salvador to determine the needs of the population. The Honduran government requested the team to assess the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>impact</b> of the storm. The World Food Programme provided $17million worth of food to the country. The Pan American Health Organization focused on restoring water systems by providing latrines, while UNICEF sent large water tanks.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{transport}} infrastructure projects {{are designed to}} enhance the rate of economic growth and income distribution of regions they link. They are often constrained by various social, economic, environmental and financial considerations. Projects are usually evaluated by economic and financial cost -benefit analysis obtained by a typical cash-flow study. This approach makes projects' appraisal deficient {{because it does not}} involve multifactor impacts of the projects. Those impacts that are not included in cost-benefit analysis are referred to as socio-economic effects. In the framework of the trans-European high-speed railway network, this thesis focuses on the London-Stockholm corridor that is only partially completed. Nowadays, one of the European Union's main objectives is a proper socio-economic integration of the different regions between themselves in order to foster regional development and sustainable mobility. Large-scale infrastructure effects on regional development and evaluation methods of such effects are analyzed to study the importance of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>impacts.</b> In megaprojects' evaluation, <b>socio-economic</b> <b>impacts</b> are no longer negligible in comparison to the financial benefits. Furthermore <b>socio-economic</b> <b>impacts</b> drive regional development and thus are the essential justification for implementing the infrastructure. Researchers are beginning to suggest that mega-projects should tend first to maximize the socio-economic benefits and second to being sound and profitable. The implication would be that governments should pay more attention to maximizing the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>impacts</b> and environmental standards and delegate to the private sector the task of making the projects profitable on a financial analysis basis. by Patrick-Henri Gest.
