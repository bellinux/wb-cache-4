40|$|The use of {{high-performance}} {{materials in}} bridges {{is leading to}} structures that {{are more susceptible to}} wind- and traffic-induced vibrations due to the reduction in the weight and the increment of the slenderness in the deck. Bridges can experience considerable vibration due to both moving vehicles and wind actions that affect the comfort of the bridge users and the driving safety. This work explored the driving safety and comfort in a very <b>slender</b> <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> under turbulent wind and vehicle actions, as well as the comfort of pedestrians. A fully coupled wind–vehicle–bridge interaction model based on the direct integration of the system of dynamics was developed. In this model, the turbulent crosswind is represented by means of aerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle and the bridge. The vehicle is modeled as a multibody system that interacts with the bridge by means of moving contacts that also simulate road-surface irregularities. A user element is presented with generality and implemented using a general-purpose finite-element software package to incorporate the aeroelastic components of the wind forces, which allows modeling and solving of the wind–vehicle–bridge interaction in the time domain without the need for using the modal superposition technique. An extensive computational analysis program is performed {{on the basis of a}} wide range of turbulent crosswind speeds. The results show that bridge vibration is significantly affected by the crosswind in terms of peak acceleration and frequency content when the crosswind intensity is significant. The crosswind has more effect on the ride comfort of the vehicle in the lateral direction and, consequently, on its safety in terms of overturning accidents...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the dynamic response of a <b>slender</b> network <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> {{by means of a}} numerical model. The numerical model is generated using a Python code written by Ph. D. Candidate Anna Ostrycharczyk. The code was modified by the authors to include pedestrian loading. Based on a modal analysis of the bridge, the first ten natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes were extracted, and attempts at exciting each mode by simulating pedestrian loading were carried out. The acceleration of the bridge deck was the main variable of study, as this is what pedestrians feel and react to while walking across the bridge. The accelerations achieved through numerical analyses have been compared to the suggested values in design guidelines, both to check if the design guidelines have valid methods for calculating accelerations and to check if the bridge in study fulfils the guideline criteria. For single pedestrian analyses the dynamic response matched the design guidelines' predicted response fairly well, and were within the presented criteria. Simulating groups of pedestrians yielded extremely high acceleration responses. They were considered worst case, but not very realistic. Other load cases such as running were also simulated. The specific acceleration values retrieved in this thesis are not useful, because the dimensions of the bridge in study are still subject to change. However, three modes were found critical for the bridge. One mode was concerned with the lateral responses of the arches and the two others with the lateral and vertical responses of the deck. It is fair to assume that similar modes will dominate the response of any <b>slender</b> network <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> These mode shapes should be studied carefully and will be governing in the placement of any external dampers. The methods for calculating vertical accelerations in the guidelines are often too simple. This should be addressed as more slender footbridges with unique designs are being built every year. The way horizontal accelerations are covered is also deficient. The guidelines propose methods dependent on frequency ranges, disregarding the fact that higher harmonics of the walking frequency might excite the bridge. Horizontal resonance was achieved in this study, despite the fact that most guidelines deemed it unnecessary to check. The numerical method used in this thesis shows promise, but needs to be developed further, especially for simulating groups of people. The material damping implemented in the numerical model proved the importance of damping, especially at resonance. Through further work a method may be obtained to calculate the dynamic response of a footbridge for a given amount of damping. This way the minimum amount of damping necessary to satisfy the comfort criteria stated in design guidelines can be found...|$|R
2500|$|The bridge has {{a single}} span of {{approximately}} [...] and was revolutionary for its time, in that it used an extremely <b>slender</b> <b>arch</b> which was not possible using traditional masonry construction. The ironwork was cast at the Plas Kynaston iron foundry at Cefn Mawr, near Ruabon in Denbighshire by William Hazledine, who cast a number of Telford bridges. The ironwork was transported from the foundry through the Ellesmere Canal and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct then by sea to Speymouth, where it was loaded onto wagons and taken to the site. Testing in the 1960s revealed that the cast-iron had an unusually high tensile strength. This was probably specified by Telford because, unlike in traditional masonry <b>arch</b> <b>bridges,</b> some sections of the arch are not in compression under loading.|$|R
