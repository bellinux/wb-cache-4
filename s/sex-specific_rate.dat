25|$|Overall, First Nations {{individuals}} {{have some of}} the highest rates of suicide globally. Suicide rates are more than twice the <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rate</b> and also three times the age-specific rates of non-Aboriginal Canadians. Residential Aboriginals between ages 10 and 29 show an elevated suicide risk as compared to non-residential Aboriginals by 5–6 times. One theory for the increased incidences of suicide within Aboriginal populations as compared to the general Canadian population is called acculturation stress which results from the intersection of multiple cultures within one's life. This leads to differing expectations and cultural clashes within the community, the family and the individual. At the community level, a general economic disadvantage is seen, exacerbated by unemployment and low education levels, leading to poverty, political disempowerment and community disorganization. The family suffers through a loss of tradition as they attempt to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture. These lead to low self-esteem in the individual as First Nations culture and tradition are marginalized affecting one's sense of self-identity. These factors combine to create a world where First Nations individuals feel they cannot identify completely as Aboriginal, nor can they fully identify as mainstream Canadians. When that balance cannot be found, many (particularly youths) turn to suicide as a way out.|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} {{a change in}} the <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rate</b> of delayed natal dispersal in a stable population of Seychelles warblers over a period of 20 years. At first, females were more likely to delay dispersal in their first year of life than were males, whereas later there was no sex bias in the rate of delayed natal dispersal. Similarly, the female-bias in helping-at-the-nest and the male-bias in floating have also weakened over time. These changes may have resulted from the decrease in variation in territory quality observed in the population over the study period. Our findings strengthen the view that natal dispersal is a highly plastic response to local ecological and social circumstances, and clearly show that rates of sex-biased dispersal cannot be considered a species or population constant. Our study also highlights the importance of collecting long-term datasets to understand complex behaviour such as natal dispersal. ...|$|E

40|$|Hypertension is {{a leading}} cause of {{premature}} death in China, but limited evidence is available on the prevalence and management of hypertension and its effect on mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). To examine the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension and to assess the CVD mortality attributable to hypertension in China. This prospective cohort study (China Kadoorie Biobank Study) recruited 500 223 adults, aged 35 to 74 years, from the general population in China. Blood pressure (BP) measurements were recorded as part of the baseline survey from June 25, 2004, to August 5, 2009, and 7028 deaths due to CVD were recorded before January 1, 2014 (mean duration of follow-up: 7. 2 years). Data were analyzed from June 9, 2014, to July 17, 2015. Prevalence and diagnosis of hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or receiving treatment for hypertension) and treatment and control rates overall and in various population subgroups. Cox regression analysis yielded age- and <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rate</b> ratios for deaths due to CVD comparing participants with and without uncontrolled hypertension, which were used to estimate the number of CVD deaths attributable to hypertension. The cohort included 205 167 men (41. 0 %) and 295 056 women (59. 0 %) with a mean (SD) age of 52 (10) years for both sexes. Overall, 32. 5 % of participants had hypertension; the prevalence increased with age (from 12. 6 % at 35 - 39 years of age to 58. 4 % at 70 - 74 years of age) and varied substantially by region (range, 22. 7 %- 40. 7 %). Of those with hypertension, 30. 5 % had received a diagnosis from a physician; of those with a diagnosis of hypertension, 46. 4 % were being treated; and of those treated, 29. 6 % had their hypertension controlled (ie, systolic BP < 140 mm Hg; diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg), resulting in an overall control rate of 4. 2 %. Even among patients with hypertension and prior CVD, only 13. 0 % had their hypertension controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension was associated with relative risks for CVD mortality of 4. 1 (95 % CI, 3. 7 - 4. 6), 2. 6 (95 % CI, 2. 4 - 2. 9) and 1. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 8 - 2. 0) at ages 35 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 79 years, respectively, and accounted for about one-third of deaths due to CVD (approximately 750   000) at 35 to 79 years of age in 2010.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} in the statistical analysis of microsatellite data permit calculation of <b>sex-specific</b> dispersal <b>rates</b> through sex- and age-specific comparisons of genetic variation. This approach, developed {{for the analysis of}} data derived from co-dominant autosomal markers, should be applicable to a sex-specific marker such as mitochondrial DNA. To test this premise, we amplified a 449 bp control region DNA sequence from the mitochondrial genome of the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), and estimated intra-class correlations among herds sampled from three Texas populations. Analyses on data partitioned by breeding group showed a clear signal of male-biased dispersal; sex-specific fixation indices associated with genetic variation among social groups within populations yielded values for females (F(GP) = 0. 91), which were significantly larger than values for males (F(GP) = 0. 24; P= 0. 0015). The same general pattern emerged when the analyses were conducted on age classes (albeit nonsignificantly), as well as categories of individuals that were predicted a posteriori to be dispersers (adult males) and philopatric (adult females and all immatures). By extending a previously published methodology based on biparentally inherited markers to matrilineally inherited haploid data, we calculated <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of contemporary dispersal among social groups within populations (m(male symbol) = 0. 37). These results support the idea that mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequency data can be used to estimate <b>sex-specific</b> instantaneous dispersal <b>rates</b> in a social species...|$|R

40|$|Length {{limits are}} used by fishery {{managers}} as a method to alter size structure of fish populations. Unfortunately, biological differences between fish sexes (i. e., sexual-size dimorphism) may lead to <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of recruitment, growth, and mortality. The addition of angler harvest to most aquatic systems likely accentuates differences in <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rates</b> by selectively harvesting the fastest-growing and largest fish from a population. The first objective {{of this study was}} to document the extent of sexual-size dimorphism for white bass and walleye at a Nebraska reservoir. Growth rates were similar between male and female white bass although male white bass were consistently shorter than their female counterparts at a given age. Male walleye grew slower and were consistently shorter than their female counterparts at a given age. The second objective was to document the size, sex, and age of white crappie, white bass and walleye harvested in two Nebraska reservoirs. Harvest was female biased for both white crappie and white bass, whereas harvest was similar for both male and female walleye. The third objective was to determine if size-, sex- or age-selective harvest was occurring for white bass and walleye at a Nebraska reservoir. Anglers harvested female white bass at a greater proportion than was sampled during NGPC annual population surveys. Anglers at Sherman Reservoir did selectively harvest walleye based on size, although in contrast to the white bass population, sex-selective harvest was not apparent for walleye. The final objective was to provide a model that predicts possible outcomes from using different length limits for sexually size dimorphic fishes. Although there was a noticeable difference in the number of fish in a population for each length limit, the pressure applied to the population by catch-and-release mortality kept the sex ratio close to a 1 : 1.

Between 1980 and 1989, asthma mortality rates per 100, 000 population per year increased from 3. 7 to 5. 3 in the total Russian population. Differences according to age and sex were observed. Asthma deaths increased with age and in most cases males showed higher death rates than females. There was a statistically significant annual increase in mortality rates for young males < 5 yrs of age and for adult males aged 35 – 64 yrs, as well as for females aged $ 65 yrs. Asthma mortality rates in Russia between 1980 and 1989 may be considered mod-erate as compared with death rates reported for the same period in other countries...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 While many {{risk factors}} for atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) are more prevalent among African Americans (AAs) than whites, AF incidence appears to be lower. Data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a community-based cohort study of cardiovascular disease among 5, 306 AAs were used to investigate incident AF. Using participant characteristic data ascertained at baseline and incident AF identified through hospital surveillance, study electrocardiogram, and Medicare claims, we determined age- and <b>sex-specific</b> AF incidence <b>rates,</b> studied associations of demographic and cardiovascular risk factors with AF, and compared age- and <b>sex-specific</b> AF incidence <b>rates</b> in JHS to those of AA participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Cox proportional hazards models {{were used to determine}} the association of risk factors with incident AF. Age- and <b>sex-specific</b> AF incidence <b>rates</b> in JHS were broadly similar to those among AAs in CHS and MESA. In a multivariable model, hypertension, higher BMI in the obese range, and history of myocardial infarction were associated with incident AF. The associations of risk factors with AF observed in JHS reinforce the importance of efforts to control blood pressure and body weight for the prevention of AF...|$|R

There is growing interest in resolving the curious disconnect between the fields of kin selection and sexual selection. Rankin’s (2011, J Evol Biol 24, 71 - 81) theoretical study {{of the impact of}} kin selection on the evolution of sexual conflict in viscous populations has been particularly valuable in stimulating empirical research in this area. An important goal of that study was to understand the impact of <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of dispersal upon the coevolution of male-harm and female-resistance behaviours. But the fitness functions derived in Rankin’s study do not flow from his model’s assumptions and, in particular, are not consistent with sex-biased dispersal. Here, we develop new fitness functions that do logically flow from the model’s assumptions, to determine the impact of sex-specific patterns of dispersal on the evolution of sexual conflict. Whilst Rankin’s study suggested that increasing male dispersal always promotes the evolution of male harm and that increasing female dispersal always inhibits the evolution of male harm, we find that the opposite can also be true, depending upon parameter values.

40|$|The rate of {{mutation}} for nucleotide substitution {{is generally}} higher among males than among females, likely {{owing to the}} larger number of DNA replications in spermatogenesis than in oogenesis. For insertion and deletion (indel) mutations, data from a few human genetic disease loci indicate that the two sexes may mutate at similar rates, possibly because such mutations arise in connection with meiotic crossing over. To address origin- and <b>sex-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of indel mutation we have conducted the first large-scale molecular evolutionary analysis of indels in noncoding DNA sequences from sex chromosomes. The rates are similar on the X and Y chromosomes of primates but about twice as high on the avian Z chromosome as on the W chromosome. The fact that indels are not uncommon on the nonrecombining Y and W chromosomes excludes meiotic crossing over as {{the main cause of}} indel mutation. On the other hand, the similar rates on X and Y indicate that the number of DNA replications (higher for Y than for X) is also not the main factor. Our observations are therefore consistent with a role of both DNA replication and recombination in the generation of short insertion and deletion mutations. A significant excess of deletion compared to insertion events is observed on the avian W chromosome, consistent with gradual DNA loss on a nonrecombining chromosome...|$|R
