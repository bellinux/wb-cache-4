25|$|<b>Self-levelling</b> rear {{suspension}} introduced for Estate models.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{practicality}} further, <b>self-levelling</b> {{rear suspension}} and an integral load restraint system {{were added to}} the options list for the Tourer. Up to 100kg can be loaded onto the roof, which is more than rival executive cars of the time, and putting loads into the boot is made easier by the 544mm sill height. Four hinged chrome lashing eyes are fitted to the floor, and oddment stowage compartments and two recessed hooks are located in the side walls.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>self-levelling</b> rear air {{suspension}} available in Caprice brought advantages when hauling heavy loads and improved vehicle dynamics when towing. Safety in the WH model was also enhanced, {{with the addition}} of side impact head & torso airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pretensioners along with drivers steering wheel and passenger dashboard airbags all as standard. If the seat belt pretensioners trigger, the doors automatically unlock, both engine and fuel pump shut down and all interior lights will switch on. Also new to the WH are the electric wing mirrors, which when reversing, the passenger mirror faces downwards to assist the driver when parking, thus preventing kerbside wheel damage.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 Arbos Spa {{became a}} branch of White and the {{following}} year it launched the <b>self-leveller</b> 100 AL. On 20 November 1975 White Arbos Spa stopped trading and was wound up on the 31 December of that year.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we first {{describe}} a broad multilevel framework representing the determinants of human behavior and consider its advantages. Expanding on {{the upper part of}} this framework, we then propose the Multilevel Personality in Context (MPIC) model, showing how it integrates and extends past theorizing on the hierarchical organization of personality. The model builds upon McAdams's three-tier (traits, goals, and selves) conception of personality, adding a foundational level (psychological needs) beneath individual differences and incorporating social relations and cultural factors as higher level influences upon behavior and individual differences. New data (N = 3, 665 in 21 cultures) are briefly presented showing that culture, self, motive, and trait variables each have independent effects upon subjective well-being (SWB) and showing that psychological need satisfaction (at the foundational level) mediates these effects as predicted. Consistent with McAdams and Pals's (2006) "fifth principle" of personality, culture had top-down effects upon <b>self-level</b> variables and moderated several of the relations to SWB. We conclude by suggesting some general heuristics for designing studies using the MPIC approach. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the main}} options {{included}} the sunroof $2390, satellite navigation $3800, rear-seat DVD players $3900, Xenon headlights $1800, tyre pressure monitoring system $1395. Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a <b>self-levelling</b> feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Cadillac {{introduced}} <b>self-levelling</b> {{air suspension}} as a $215 option, {{a first for}} an American manufacturer, and a quick response to the suspension advances of the 1955 Citroën DS. [...] This replaced the coil springs with an air-filled bladder, but the American version proved troublesome and was discontinued. Later that same year, Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile, Ford, Mercury and Pontiac also introduced air suspension as an option for select models but it was unreliable and was soon dropped. [...] For Buick, the unpopular [...] "Air Poise Suspension" [...] contributed to the division's decline to fifth place in industry sales for 1958. [...] Decades later though it became a common and reliable method of suspension on luxury cars, buses, large transport trucks, and in some custom car applications.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} {{addition to}} the 156 range came in 2000 {{with the introduction of}} the Sportwagon Station wagon or estate car, a first attempt at this configuration and size for the company.

2500|$|In 1957, Cadillac {{attempted}} to move upmarket, creating the hand-built Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. It featured <b>self-levelling</b> suspension, [...] "memory seat" [...] function, and an all-transistor signal-seeking car radio that {{was produced by}} GM's Delco Radio and which was available as standard equipment for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models. While the car showed Cadillac's technological prowess, it only sold 904 units.|$|E
2500|$|Released in June 1999, the HSV Grange (WH) {{received}} {{modifications to}} the Statesman's specification (Statesman VINs begin with [...] "6H8WHY", whereas the VIN of a Caprice is [...] "6H8WHZ"; the Grange shares the [...] "Y" [...] digit in its VIN with Statesman). Again, the Grange was finished by HSV in Clayton, Victoria. It was available with the 3.8-litre supercharged V6 and 5.7-litre V8 engines. The WH Grange had HSV's [...] "Prestige" [...] suspension tune, specially-developed Monroe Sensatrac shock absorbers, a front anti-roll bar, a rear anti-roll bar and a <b>self-levelling</b> function for the rear suspension (shared with Caprice). Standard features for the WH Grange included 18-inch ten-spoke alloy wheels, a 260-watt sound system with ten speakers and a six-disc CD changer, climate control air conditioning, eight-way power adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, a height and reach adjustable steering wheel, driver seat and mirror memory settings, an electrochromatic rear view mirror, trip computer and an immobiliser. The Grange was also fitted with a limited slip rear differential {{as well as a}} choice of two higher performance brake packages, increased diameter front and rear swaybars and an exclusive-to-Grange HSV body kit consisting of front bumper with enlarged cooling intake, unique stainless steel meshed intake grille with HSV logo in the centre, flared deep side skirts, deep skirted three-piece rear bumper, rear decklid spoiler and rear HSV badging.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 Arbos Spa {{was bought}} by the Magni {{brothers}} and renamed Nuova Arbos. The new company presented the <b>self-levelling</b> 565 AL and started producing two new <b>self-levelling</b> machines: the 565 A-4-L and the 705 A-4-L and two flat-land machines, 140 - 160.|$|E

50|$|In France in 1954, Citroën {{introduced}} the first <b>self-levelling</b> rear suspension on a production car, {{and then in}} 1955 pioneered <b>self-levelling</b> of all four wheels, using its hydropneumatic system. These cars maintain an exact height over the road when the engine is on - height control valves attached to the roll bars via linkages would open to add or drain fluid from the suspension, and when the desired height was reached the valve would automatically close due to its design. Later models would use electronic height sensors and motors so adjustment could be achieved with the engine off.|$|E
