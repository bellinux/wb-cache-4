50|$|Centrifuge rotors have {{tremendous}} kinetic energy during high speed rotation. Rotor failure, caused by mechanical stress {{from the high}} forces imparted by the motor, can occur due to manufacturing defects, routine wear and tear, or improper use and maintenance. Such a failure can be catastrophic failure, especially with larger centrifuges, and generally results in total destruction of the centrifuge. While centrifuges generally have <b>safety</b> <b>shielding</b> to contain these failures, such shielding may be inadequate, especially in older models, or the entire centrifuge unit may be propelled from its position, resulting in damage to nearby personnel and equipment. Uncontained rotor failures have shattered laboratory windows and destroyed refrigerators and cabinetry.

40|$|AbstractSince its {{inception}} in 2008, Linatron Mi 6 has been the standard x-ray source for cargo inspection. It produces interlaced dual energy (6 MV and 3. 5 MV) x-ray pulses that enable material discrimination scan in a single pass. Both pulse-to-pulse and longer term stability has been improved. With Linatron Mi 6 as the x-ray source, {{it is now possible}} to achieve a continuous material discrimination scale, instead of only dividing materials into four classes: organic material, inorganic material, metals and high atomic metals. Other advanced material discrimination features include virtual layer peeling and trust rating. Energy sensitive imaging detectors can extend material discrimination in thin-object region. Although our Linatron Mi 9 Linatron, which produces interlaced pulses of 9 MV and 6 MV x-ray pulses, provides even better material discrimination performance as well as better radiographic performance, it is not as widely used due to increased imaging system size and higher cost of <b>safety</b> <b>shielding...</b>|$|R

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} closed access. A {{considerable}} proportion of road accidents {{are attributed to}} rear-end collision, lane change collisions and run off road events. An integrated design of information, warning and intervention system might help to reduce these types of accidents.

This paper presents an approach how rear end-, lane change- and run off road-collisions can potentially be prevented and explains the required architecture and control concept. A common higher order polynomial based path planner is proposed due to its inherent advantage of stability and convergence over dynamic trajectories during the limited duration of the pre collision phase.

40|$|New {{high power}} lasers with {{excellent}} beam parameter products like fibre and disk lasers offer not only new possibilities with material processing. Their use is also connected with high demands on laser safety. Conventional laser protection systems are passive systems made of massive shields or housings which resist the {{direct or indirect}} laser radiation for a specified time. The operator has to inspect the systems to ensure the functionality and safety. The risk of dangerous penetration or destruction by the laser beam increases enormously with smaller beam parameter products and higher laser power.

The novel laser <b>safety</b> <b>shield</b> offers an active protection against direct and indirect laser radiation.

40|$|Reusable trocars {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being more costeffective than disposable trocars. However, the reusable trocar does lose its sharpness on insertion with repetitive insertion. Nonreusable trocars are expensive, but the sharpness of the knife facilitates insertion. Nonreusable trocars have a <b>safety</b> <b>shield</b> system designed to decrease abdominal organ injury, though the potential problem of bleeding from the abdominal wall port site has yet to be resolved. We therefore developed a novel ultrasonic vibrating trocar that does not lose its sharpness even with repetitive insertion. This trocar prevents bleeding by means of an ultrasonic cavitation effect. The ultrasonic vibrating trocar has the advantage of ease of insertion, and the force required for new reusable trocar insertion was only 34 % of the force required for insertion of commercially available nonreusable trocars. The force required for multiply used conventional reusable ultrasonic vibrating trocar insertion, ie, 900 insertions, was maintained at less than 46 % of the force required by the corresponding nonreusable trocars.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, efforts to develop new {{measurement}} systems to support nuclear nonproliferation and homeland security have increased substantially. Monte Carlo radiation transport {{is one of the}} simulation methods of choice for the analysis of data from existing systems and for the design of new measurement systems; it allows for accurate description of geometries, detailed modeling of particle-nucleus interactions, and event-by-event detection analysis. This paper describes the use of the Monte Carlo code MCNPX-PoliMi for nuclear nonproliferation applications, with particular emphasis on the simulation of spontaneous and neutron-induced nuclear fission. In fact, of all possible neutron-nucleus interactions, neutron-induced fission is the most defining characteristic of special nuclear material (such as U- 235 and Pu- 239), which is the material of interest in nuclear-nonproliferation applications. The MCNP-PoliMi code was originally released from the Radiation <b>Safety</b> <b>Shielding</b> Center (RSSIC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2003; the MCNPX-PoliMi code contains many enhancements and is based on MCNPX ver. 2. 7. 0.

40|$|This Alert {{described}} five {{cases in}} which persons were scalped when their hair became entangled around inadequately guarded rotating drivelines or shafts of farm equipment driven by power take offs. Four cases involved women who were baling hay. In the fifth case, a 12 year old girl was asked by her father to check the bale counter. All five of the incidents involved inadequately guarded drivelines and victims who were standing or walking near rotating drivelines. The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines. The drivelines were located about 4 feet above the ground, limiting visibility of the hazard.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental rotating wickless heat pipe apparatus {{was designed and}} machined. The apparatus includes a rotating heat pipe assembly, test stand, spray cooling assembly, <b>safety</b> <b>shielding,</b> and instrumentation. A revised condensing limit for {{the operation of the}} rotating heat pipe was obtained by modifying Ballbeck's Nusselt film condensation theory to include the effects of a thermal resistance in the condenser wall and in the condenser outside surface cooling mechanism. Approximate results, obtained for half-cone angles of 1, 2, and 3 degrees, show that less heat can be removed than originally predicted by Ballback, and that the outside heat transfer coefficient can significantly alter the condensing limit. An improved Nusselt theory was developed which applies for all half-cone angles, and which includes the effects of the thermal resistances in the condenser wall and in the condenser outside surface cooling mechanism. This formulation led to a second-order non-linear differential equation for the film thickness which was numerically integrated using a free-overfall boundary condition at the condenser exit. Results obtained for a half-cone angle of 0 degrees are substantially less than the results obtained from the approximate solution for half-cone degrees of 1, 2, and 3 degrees.

The ¿Mirror Oscilloscope¿ uses two voice-coils actuators with mounted mirrors to reflect laser light, such that {{an image of a}} harmonic signal is projected on a projection screen. For tracking of the input signal an encoder is chosen as a position feedback sensor. Using a 20 sim model, 20 sim¿s code-generation tool and the AD VisualDSP++ environment, an uploadable program is made, interpreting both the input from the encoder and from the function-generator and using them in a servo system for tracking the input signal. The results that have been obtained and effects that have been observed are as follows: ¿ For the ¿Mirror Oscilloscope¿ the accuracy obtained with the chosen encoder is sufficient. ¿ Certain modeling issues were not satisfactory solved. This, as well as the time limitations have resulted in a control system that works, however which could have been set up better. ¿ Implementation based on two Analog Devices processors ADSP 21992, was successful. ¿ Light output of a laser-pointer (1 mW) is not sufficient for this application. There is some freedom left within the power supply to increase the accuracy by usage of an efficient transmission.
