5|$|Washington was a {{lover of}} exotic animals, as well as gardening. He {{maintained}} extensive menageries on his country properties, first at Bellport, and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey on his <b>shoulder.</b> <b>At</b> both his menageries, Washington specialized in rare birds, but such animals as deer, sheep, goats, and antelope are also recorded at Bellport, and deer, llamas, and zebras are recorded {{among the hundreds of}} animals in the larger space at Mendham. Socially, he was {{an active member of the}} Lotos Club, a literary gentlemen's club in New York City.|$|E
5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the end of the season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E
5|$|On the November 18 {{episode of}} Impact! James {{defeated}} Angelina Love {{to become the}} number one contender to the championship. At Final Resolution, James was defeated by Tara in a Falls Count Anywhere match, following interference from Madison Rayne after she sprayed a fire extinguisher and hit James with the Knockouts title belt. On the following episode of Impact!, James defeated Tara in a steel cage match. On January 9, 2011 at Genesis, James lost her match against Rayne for the Knockouts Championship due to interference from Tara. The following month at Against All Odds, James once again failed to win the Knockouts Championship, this time losing to Rayne in a Last Knockout Standing match, after another interference by Tara. On the March 17 episode of Impact!, Rayne agreed to give James another title match at Lockdown, with the added stipulation that should James fail to win the title, {{she would have to}} shave her hair off. On March 18, James legitimately separated her <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> a TNA house show in Jacksonville, Florida. James's injury was put into a storyline, where it was caused by Rayne and Tara running over her with Tara's motorcycle.|$|E

25|$|In the War of the Second Coalition, Beaumont {{served in}} Italy again. On 5 April 1799, {{he was shot}} through the right <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Magnano. He {{recovered}} from his wound in time to fight at the Battle of the Mincio on 25 December 1800. He received promotion to general of division sometime in 1802 or 1803. On 11 December 1803 he {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur.|$|E
25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks back over his <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland began on 1 September 1939, and {{marked the beginning}} of World War II in Europe. Tolsdorff led the 14th (anti-tank-gun) Company in the 22. Fusilier Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division in this campaign. He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for actions on 2 September against the Kamienna Góra bunker line. He deployed his 3.7 cm Pak 36 against the bunkers until the Polish forces surrendered. Soon afterwards, he earned the Iron Cross 1st Class for preventing an enemy breakout when he attacked from close range. He was wounded in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the end of the campaign.|$|E

25|$|A {{crowd of}} 11,042, {{the fourth largest}} in Gibbs Stadium history, saw the Terriers end the Mountaineers Division I leading winning streak at 17 games, 42–31. The Terriers outgained the Mountaineers 431 to 320 in total yardage with running back Kevious Johnson {{accounting}} for 104 rushing yards. Armanti Edwards, starting {{in his first game}} since the Michigan win, re-injured his <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the start of the second half. Trey Elder replaced Edwards and threw for 105 and rushed for 33 yards. Senior wide receiver Hans Batichon had a career-high six receptions for 93 yards. The only other bright spot for the Mountaineers was CoCo Hillary's 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|For {{the lower}} basses {{it takes a}} lot more control to turn quickly. Cleaning turns for a bassline can be rather easy. They should lead with the <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the start of the turn and lock the other {{direction}} on a specified count. Setting a check-point can help. For instance, one should be flat front on count two of the turn. However, note that the turn should be smooth and not jerky. A common problem may result from not stopping the weight of the drum {{at the end of the}} turn and letting the momentum get the better of the player. The solution to that problem involves tightening the core (abdominals and back muscles).|$|E
25|$|By 1 August {{the route}} {{had been pushed}} as far as Camp VIII, {{at the base of}} the <b>Shoulder</b> <b>at</b> around 7800m, and the next day the whole team {{assembled}} there to prepare for the final push for the summit. However, the weather had been gradually deteriorating for several days, and soon a severe storm broke. At first it did not dispirit the team, and a secret ballot was held to decide which climbers should make the first summit attempt. However, as the storm continued for day after day their position became more serious. One of the tents collapsed on the fourth night, forcing Houston and Bell to crowd into other, already cramped tents. On August the 6th, with weather forecasts offering little hope of improvement, the party for the first time discussed retreating.|$|E

25|$|The storyline {{leading up}} to the match was that JBL caused Guerrero's mother {{to have a heart attack}} at a house show when he {{threatened}} her and grabbed her by the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>At</b> Judgment Day, JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for the WWE title. A title cannot change hands by disqualification, so Guerrero retained the title. JBL controversially won his sole world championship, the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash. The initial decision of Guerrero's victory was reversed by then-General Manager Kurt Angle, awarding the match and the title to JBL; the replay showed that JBL touched the fourth corner before Guerrero. JBL won a rematch in a steel cage two weeks later, again with Angle's assistance.|$|E
25|$|By 1953, four expeditions had {{attempted}} to climb K2. Oscar Eckenstein and Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi had led expeditions in 1902 and 1909 respectively, neither of which had made substantial progress, and the Duke of the Abruzzi had declared after his attempt that the mountain would never be climbed. However, two American expeditions in 1938 and 1939 had come closer to success. Charles Houston's 1938 expedition had established the feasibility of the Abruzzi Spur as a route to the summit, reaching the <b>Shoulder</b> <b>at</b> 8000m, before retreating due to diminishing supplies {{and the threat of}} bad weather. Fritz Wiessner's attempt the following year went even higher, but ended in disaster when four men disappeared high on the mountain. In spite of the tragedy, the expeditions had shown that climbing K2 was a realistic goal, and further attempts would almost certainly have been made sooner had the Second World War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 not made travel to Kashmir impossible during the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was {{swinging}} his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting his <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} poorest matches in WrestleMania history.|$|E

25|$|In 1183 Balian and Baldwin {{supported}} Raymond against Guy of Lusignan, {{husband of}} Amalric's elder daughter Sibylla {{and by now}} regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of leprosy. The king had his 5-year-old nephew Baldwin of Montferrat crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, {{in an attempt to}} prevent Guy from ascending. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was Balian himself—a notably tall man—who carried the child Baldwin V on his <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the eight-year-old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to Antioch. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch.|$|E
