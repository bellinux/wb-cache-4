50|$|The cartoon shows Luke, Han and Leia's first {{encounter}} with Boba Fett. During {{a search for a}} talisman, the Millennium Falcon crashes on a water planet known as Panna. Upon landing, they run into Fett, who claims to want to help them after saving Luke from a giant monster that attacks him from behind. They all board the Falcon, where Han has been infected by a mysterious <b>sleeping</b> <b>virus</b> caused by the talisman. Luke then contracts the virus as well.|$|E
50|$|During {{a trip to}} Ascot, Freddie {{discovers that}} the villain {{capturing}} the buildings is called El Supremo, and he's working alongside Messina, who spends {{most of the time}} in her cobra form. Freddie also learns that El Supremo is planning to steal Big Ben next. Knowing Daffers and Scotty would not want to be taken, Freddie tells them the next target is Windsor Castle and they hide on Big Ben - and are promptly captured by a giant robotic snake. They go to a secret island in Scotland and discover that El Supremo plans to use the buildings, by shrinking them to a size of a trophy and using them as batteries to a giant crystal, which will send a powerful <b>sleeping</b> <b>virus</b> across the world (starting with the UK), which will put people to sleep, allowing him to invade and enslave them. Scotty then freaks out as the last required building is captured: Edinburgh Castle.|$|E
40|$|The first alphavirus to be {{isolated}} from fish was recorded in 1995 with the isolation of salmon pancreas disease virus from Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in Ireland. Subsequently, the closely related <b>sleeping</b> disease <b>virus</b> was isolated from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), in France. More recently Norwegian salmonid alphavirus (SAV) has been isolated from marine phase pro-duction of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in Norway. These three viruses are closely related and are now considered to represent three subtypes of SAV, a new member of the genus Alphavirus within the family Togaviridae. SAVs are recognized as serious pathogens of farmed Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in Europe. This paper aims to draw together both historical and current knowledge of the diseases caused by SAVs, the viruses, their diagnosis and control, and to discuss the differential diagnosis of similar pathologies seen in cardiomy-opathy syndrome and heart and skeletal muscle inflammation of Atlantic salmon...|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetics of {{the genus}} Alphavirus have {{historically}} been characterized using partial gene, single gene or partial proteomic data. We have mined cDNA and amino acid sequences from GenBank for all fully sequenced and some partially sequenced alphaviruses and generated phylogenomic analyses {{of the genus}} Alphavirus genus, employing capsid encoding structural regions, non-structural coding regions and complete viral genomes. Our studies support {{the presence of the}} previously reported recombination event that produced the Western Equine Encephalitis clade, and confirm many of the patterns of geographic radiation and divergence of the multiple species. Our data suggest that the Salmon Pancreatic Disease <b>Virus</b> and <b>Sleeping</b> Disease <b>Virus</b> are sufficiently divergent to form a separate clade from the other alphaviruses. Also, unlike previously reported studies employing limited sequence data for correlation of phylogeny, our results indicate that the Barmah Forest Virus and Middelburg Virus appear to be members of the Semliki Forest clade. Additionally, our analysis indicates that the Southern Elephant Seal Virus is part of the Semliki Forest clade, although still phylogenetically distant from all known members of the genus Alphavirus. Finally, we demonstrate that the whole Rubella viral genome provides an ideal outgroup for phylogenomic studies of the genus Alphavirus...|$|R
40|$|Partial E 1 {{envelope}} glycoprotein gene sequences and complete structural polyprotein sequences {{were used to}} compare divergence and construct phylogenetic trees for the genus Alphavirus. Tree topologies indicated that the mosquito-borne alphaviruses could have arisen in either the Old or the New World, {{with at least two}} transoceanic introductions to account for their current distribution. The time frame for alphavirus diversifi-cation could not be estimated because maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that the nucleotide substitution rate varies considerably across sites within the genome. While most trees showed evolutionary relationships consistent with current antigenic complexes and species, several changes to the current classification are proposed. The recently identified fish alphaviruses salmon pancreas disease <b>virus</b> and <b>sleeping</b> disease <b>virus</b> appear to be variants or subtypes of a new alphavirus species. Southern elephant seal virus is also a new alphavirus distantly related to all of the others analyzed. Tonate virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus strain 78 V 3531 also appear to be distinct alphavirus species based on genetic, antigenic, and ecological criteria. Trocara virus, isolated from mosquitoes in Brazil and Peru, also represents a new species and probably a new alphavirus complex. The family Togaviridae is comprised of two genera, Alpha-virus and Rubivirus (77). The genus Alphavirus contains at leas...|$|R
50|$|Freddie and Scotty {{are thrown}} into a pool of sea monsters, while Daffers is taken to be brainwashed into a mindless {{follower}} of El Supremo and Messina. El Supremo uses the crystal to send his <b>sleeping</b> <b>virus</b> all across Great Britain and the whole country shuts down. Freddie whistles and Nessie appears to save them both from being devoured, and Scotty is saved from drowning. Nessie shows her family to Freddie, who then asks them to help defeat El Supremo by submerging the patrolling submarines. Freddie and Scotty save Daffers from the snake guards in disguise and the three return to stop El Supremo from conquering the world. They have to battle an army of soldiers, but in the process, Daffers and Scotty come {{too close to the}} crystal's energy and fall unconscious. Freddie manages to infiltrate the crystal's energy with his mind powers and destroys it, but also falls unconscious. El Supremo and Messina (who are preparing to attack their next target - The United States) arrive to kill Freddie, but he, Daffers and Scotty defeat El Supremo by shrinking him down to an ant's size and trapping him in a matchbox.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} species of birds, the yellow-crowned night heron is an {{intermediate}} host and amplifier of the eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) <b>virus</b> (<b>sleeping</b> sickness). This common virus in the Southeast of the United States is lethal to horses and can be to humans as well. It is transmitted by mosquitoes: an infected mosquito will transmit the virus to a yellow-crowned night heron, which will be unaffected by it but will host it (the heron {{is known as a}} “reservoir host” for the virus) until another mosquito picks it up from the heron and transmits it to a horse or a human. Because of the distances that the yellow-crowned night heron travels when it migrates, it carries the virus over larger geographical areas, becoming an amplifier of the EEE. However, EEE remains a rare disease which symptoms can be treated, and only a few cases are declared every year.|$|R
40|$|Cell culture {{isolates}} {{of salmon}} pancreas disease virus (SPDV) of farmed Atlantic salmon and <b>sleeping</b> disease <b>virus</b> (SDV) of rainbow trout were compared. Excluding the poly(A) tracts, the genomic nucleotide sequences of SPDV and SDV RNAs include 11, 919 and 11, 900 nucleotides, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis places SPDV and SDV between the New World viruses of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Eastern equine encephalitis virus and the Old World viruses of Aura virus and Sindbis virus. When compared to each other, SPDV and SDV show 91. 1 % nucleotide sequence identity over their complete genomes, with 95 and 93. 6 % amino acid identities over their nonstructural and structural proteins, respectively. Notable {{differences between the}} two viruses include a 24 -nucleotide insertion in the C terminus of nsP 3 protein of SPDV and amino acid sequence variation at the C termini of the capsid and E 1 proteins. Experimental infections of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout with SPDV and SDV confirmed that the disease lesions induced by SPDV and SDV were similar in nature. Although infections with SPDV and SDV produced similar levels of histopathology in rainbow trout, SDV induced significantly less severe lesions in salmon than did SPDV. Virus neutralization tests performed with sera from experimentally infected salmon indicated that SPDV and SDV belonged to the same serotype; however, antigenic variation was detected among SDV and geographically different SPDV isolates by using monoclonal antibodies. Although SPDV and SDV exhibit minor biological differences, we conclude {{on the basis of the}} close genetic similarity that SPDV and SDV are closely related isolates of the same virus species for which the name Salmonid alphavirus is proposed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractSleeping {{disease in}} rainbow trout is {{characterized}} by an abnormal swimming behaviour of the fish which stay on their side {{at the bottom of}} the tanks. This sign is due to extensive necrosis and atrophy of red skeletal muscle induced by the <b>sleeping</b> disease <b>virus</b> (SDV), also called salmonid alphavirus 2. Infections of humans with arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), are global causes of debilitating musculoskeletal diseases. The mechanisms by which the virus causes these pathologies are poorly understood due to the restrictive availability of animal models capable of reproducing the full spectrum of the disease. Nevertheless, it has been shown that CHIKV exhibits a particular tropism for muscle stem cells also known as satellite cells. Thus, SDV and its host constitute a relevant model to study in details the virus-induced muscle atrophy, the pathophysiological consequences of the infection of a particular cell-type in the skeletal muscle, and the regeneration of the muscle tissue in survivors together with the possible virus persistence. To study a putative SDV tropism for that particular cell type, we established an in vivo and ex vivo rainbow trout model of SDV-induced atrophy of the skeletal muscle. This experimental model allows reproducing the full panel of clinical signs observed during a natural infection since the transmission of the virus is arthropod-borne independent. The virus tropism in the muscle tissue was studied by immunohistochemistry together with the kinetics of the muscle atrophy, and the muscle regeneration post-infection was observed. In parallel, an ex vivo model of SDV infection of rainbow trout satellite cells was developed and virus replication and persistence in that particular cell type was followed up to 73  days post-infection. These results constitute the first observation of a specific SDV tropism for the muscle satellite cells...|$|R
