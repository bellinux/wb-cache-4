For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was <b>still</b> <b>true</b> and considered it to be his career masterpiece.

5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is <b>still</b> <b>true</b> it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is <b>still</b> <b>true</b> that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2008, Eckhart {{portrayed the}} comic book {{character}} Harvey Dent in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, the sequel to the 2005 film Batman Begins. Nolan's decision to cast Eckhart was based on his portrayal of corrupt characters in the films In the Company of Men, The Black Dahlia, and Thank You For Smoking. He noted in his depiction of the character that [...] " [...] is <b>still</b> <b>true</b> to himself. He's a crime fighter, he's not killing good people. He's not a bad guy, not purely", while admitting [...] "I'm interested in good guys gone wrong." [...] The Dark Knight was a big financial and critical success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $1billion worldwide, it became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, and the highest-grossing film of Eckhart's career. Roger Ebert opined that Eckhart did an [...] "especially good job" [...] as his character in the feature, while Premiere magazine also enjoyed his performance, noting that he [...] "makes you believe in his ill-fated ambition... of morphing into the conniving Two-Face." ...|$|E

The character previously dated Andy Dwyer and Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who was written out of the show {{at the end of}} the second season. In both cases, Ann was primarily in control of the relationship due to Andy's immaturity and Mark's lack of experience in long-term romances. Schur said of Ann's relationship with Chris, [...] "This is the first time that Ann just completely loses herself and really falls for a guy super hard. And the relationship goes in a lot of funny, unexpected directions." [...] Intimidated by her inability to find a flaw in the extremely positive and physically perfect Chris, Ann acts more awkwardly and nerdy around him than her character has been in the past. [...] "Flu Season" [...] {{also demonstrated}} deeper levels to Ron Swanson, who adamantly insists [...] "I'm not interested in caring about people", yet reveals he cares about both Andy and April, and tries to help the two reconcile. Schur said Ron takes on a sort of father figure role, [...] "and he ends up revealing in a tiny, tiny, tiny way that's <b>still</b> <b>true</b> to the character that he has genuine feelings of caring for the people who work around him in the Parks office".|$|E

[...] At that time, the Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue intersection (the end of route 66) was known as [...] "route center".

[...] Today, four streets cross Michigan Avenue within the district (in addition to its northern and southern endpoints at crossing streets).

Ingham sent back a contemptuous letter stating that, while he was not the source for the article, the information was <b>still</b> <b>true.</b> On June 18, Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel through his second, a Dr. Randolph, who visited him twice and the second time threatened him with personal harm if he did not comply with Eaton's demands. Randolph was dismissed, and the next morning Ingham sent a note to Eaton declining the invitation. Eaton wrote a letter back to Ingham accusing him of cowardice. Ingham was then informed that Eaton, Randolph, and others were looking to assault him. He gathered together his own bodyguard, and was not immediately molested. However, he reported that for the next two nights Eaton and his men continued to lurk about his dwelling and threaten him. He then left the city, and returned safely to his home. Ingham communicated to Jackson his version of what took place, and Jackson then asked Eaton to answer for the charge.

500|$|Gotham's {{district}} attorney, {{hailed as}} the city's [...] "White Knight" [...] but becomes a psychotic vengeful serial killer after half of his face are disfigured and becomes obsessed with avenging Rachel's death.

[...] Before Eckhart was cast in February 2007, Liev Schreiber, Josh Lucas, and Ryan Phillippe had expressed interest in the role, while Mark Ruffalo auditioned. Matt Damon stated that he was considered for the role, but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts. Hugh Jackman was also considered for the part. Nolan chose Eckhart, whom he had considered for the lead role in Memento, citing his [...] "extraordinary" [...] ability as an actor, his embodiment of [...] "that kind of chiselled, American hero quality" [...] projected by Robert Redford, and his subtextual [...] "edge." [...] Eckhart was [...] "interested in good guys gone wrong," [...] and had played corrupt men in films such as The Black Dahlia, Thank You for Smoking, and In the Company of Men. Whereas Two-Face is depicted as a crime boss in most characterizations, Nolan chose to portray him as a twisted vigilante to emphasize his role as Batman's counterpart. Eckhart explained, [...] " [...] is <b>still</b> <b>true</b> to himself. He's a crime fighter, he's not killing good people. He's not a bad guy, not purely." [...] For Dent, Eckhart [...] "kept on thinking about the Kennedys," [...] particularly Robert F. Kennedy, who was [...] "idealistic, held a grudge and took on the Mob."
