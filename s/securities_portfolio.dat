40|$|This paper {{explores the}} general-equilibrium impact of social <b>security</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversi cation into private securities, either through {{the trust fund}} or private accounts. The {{analysis}} depends critically on heterogeneities in saving, production, assets, and taxes. Limited diversication weakly increases interest rates, reduces the expected return on short-term investment (and the equity premium), decreases safe investment, increases risky investment, and increases a suitably weighted social welfare function. However, the effects on aggregate investment, long-term capital values, and the utility of young savers hinges on assumptions about technology. Aggregate investment and long-term asset values can move in opposite directions. (JEL H 55) Policy discussions of social <b>security</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversi cation into equities have concentrated on the consequences for retirement bene ts and the budget viability of the system, ignoring general-equilibrium repercussions (and some...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{business}} environment {{is full of}} uncertainty. Allocating the wealth among var-ious asset classes may {{lower the risk of}} overall portfolio and increase the potential for more benefit over the long term. In this paper, we propose a mixed single-stage R&D projects and multi-stage <b>securities</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection model. Specifically, we present a bi-objective mixed-integer stochastic programming model. Moreover, we use semi-absolute deviation risk functions to measure the risk of mixed asset portfolio. Based on the idea of moments approx-imation method via linear programming, we propose a scenario generation approach for the mixed single-stage R&D projects and multi-stage <b>securities</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection problem. The bi-objective mixed-integer stochastic programming problem can be solved by transforming it into a single objective mixed-integer stochastic programming problem. A numerical example is given to illustrate the behavior of the proposed mixed single stage R&D projects and multi-stage <b>securities</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection model...|$|E
