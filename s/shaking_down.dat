5|$|HMS Tiger was {{the most}} heavily {{armoured}} battlecruiser of the Royal Navy {{at the start of}} the First World War, although she was still being finished when the war began. The ship was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron for the duration of the war and participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915 even though she was still <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> and did not perform well. She next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 where she was one of the British battlecruisers most often hit by German shells; she was only lightly damaged. She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although she did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight.|$|E
5|$|HMS Tiger was a battlecruiser of the Royal Navy and the {{eleventh}} ship to bear that name. She {{was built by}} John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, and launched in 1913. Tiger was the most heavily armoured battlecruiser of the Royal Navy {{at the start of}} the First World War, but was not yet ready for service. The ship was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) for the duration of the war and participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915, though she was still <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> and did not perform well. Tiger next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, where she was only lightly damaged despite suffering many hits by German shells. Apart from providing distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917, she spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|Also {{much like}} Williams is the {{theological}} and philosophical subtext. Ms. Carl takes {{the ideas of}} good vs. evil quite seriously and probes deeply into the idea of redemption. She does not, however, take her themes lightly, instead giving them a vigorous <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> before she's done, resulting in a gripping spiritual thriller. One could easily call this 'in the tradition of Charles Williams' — which it certainly is — but it more importantly moves beyond that master of the spiritual thriller.|$|E

25|$|On July 19, 2011, Officer Daniel G. Redd {{was arrested}} for drug trafficking. While on trial, Redd has {{admitted}} to {{being involved in the}} process to distribute heroin. Redd {{is believed to be the}} first Baltimore Police officer charged with drug trafficking since William King and Antonio Murray were charged with <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> drug suspects and then selling the drugs themselves. Both those officers received life in federal prison. Redd was sentenced to twenty years in custody in September 2012.|$|E
25|$|All seven {{members of}} the Gun Trace Task Force were accused in a federal {{racketeering}} indictment. The seven officers Daniel Hersl, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Marcus Taylor, Maurice Ward, Momodu Gando, and Wayne Jenkins were accused of <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> citizens for money and pocketing it, lying to investigators, filing false court paperwork, and making fraudulent overtime claims. The amount stolen from citizens ranged from $200 to $200,000. The probe began when the Drug Enforcement Administration started looking into the officers while investigating a drug organization and later involved the FBI. The officers were summoned by internal affairs {{on the morning of}} Wednesday, March 1, 2017 and arrested.|$|E
25|$|Eventually Rico {{allowed his}} brother {{to find out about}} his racketeering. When Joe {{witnessed}} Rico murder an innocent cafe owner who had refused to pay him protection money, Joe arrested him. Rico resisted arrest by opening fire, but the shots went wide. Given Rico's skill with a firearm, Joe would later posit the theory that Rico was trying to commit suicide by cop out of a deep disgust at what he had become, rather than trying to kill him. In The Third Law, Rico reveals the shop owner was a chocolate smuggler he was <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> and claims he had only meant to wound the owner to throw a scare into him. Rather than suicide by cop, Rico claims he just couldn't shoot his brother. Whatever his motive, Rico was sentenced to twenty years hard labour on the prison colony of Titan, where he grew to hate his brother. He was particularly angry that Joe didn't testify in his favour.|$|E

The first few months were spent <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> the ship, calibrating the engines, steering communication, guns, etc. The next month was spent training against American submarines. The first combat mission was in September during which the ship engaged with suspected German submarines. For most of the remainder of the year, the ship screened convoys between Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, berthing primarily at both places. There were several contacts with suspected enemy submarines which were attacked vigorously but no proof of destruction.|$|E

In early 2002, Lucchese capo John Capra worked with Gambino acting boss Arnold Squitieri, acting underboss Anthony Megale, and Bronx-based acting capo Gregory DePalma. The group was involved in illegal gambling and extortion activities in Westchester County, New York. The members were arrested in 2005 leading to the revelation that Gambino acting capo DePalma had allowed an FBI agent Joaquín García (known as Jack Falcone) work undercover with his crew since 2002. In late 2008, Gambino family acting capo Andrew Merola teamed with Lucchese Jersey faction acting boss Martin Taccetta in an illegal gambling ring, <b>shaking</b> <b>down</b> unions, and extorting car dealerships. Merola was indicted in 2008 and Taccetta was returned to prison in 2009.|$|E
