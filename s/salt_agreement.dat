5|$|Nike-X {{had been}} {{defined in the}} early 1960s as a system to defend US cities and {{industrial}} centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the inventories of both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system very expensive. NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the <b>SALT</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
50|$|The R-27K / SS-NX-13 was the world's first Anti Ship Ballistic Missile. However {{it never}} became operational, since every launch tube {{used for the}} R-27K counted as a {{strategic}} missile in the <b>SALT</b> <b>agreement,</b> and they were considered more important.|$|E
5000|$|SALT II {{helped the}} United States to {{discourage}} the Soviets from arming their third-generation ICBMs of SS-17, SS-19 and SS-18 types with many more MIRVs. In the late 1970s the USSR's missile design bureaus had developed experimental versions of these missiles equipped with anywhere from 10 to 38 warheads each. Additionally, the United States debated {{whether or not to}} include the Soviet [...] "Backfire" [...] bomber into the aggregate total of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles. The U.S. panel stated that if there was a failure to include them in the total, it could potentially lead the Soviets, at the rate of their production, to have approximately 400 Backfire bombers by 1988, therefore exceeding the limitations set by the <b>SALT</b> <b>agreement.</b> The Soviets secretly agreed to reduce Tu-22M production to thirty aircraft per year and not to give them an intercontinental range. It was particularly important for the United States to limit Soviet efforts in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) rearmament area.|$|E
50|$|Construction on PAR-1 in North Dakota {{began in}} April 1970, and PAR-2 in Montana in May. Extensive testing {{was carried out}} over the next year at GE's Syracuse offices, while the Army Corps of Engineers {{installed}} the heavy equipment. Work continued until August 1972 when the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (<b>SALT)</b> <b>agreements</b> were signed. As part of SALT, the ABM Treaty limited each country to only two ABM sites, one protecting the nation's capital, and one protecting a missile field. Work on PAR-2 in Montana stopped, and the partially complete building stands to this day.|$|R
5000|$|SANE {{would go}} on to criticize the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and <b>SALT</b> <b>agreements</b> for {{ignoring}} offensive strategic weapons. Following Richard Nixon's re-election, SANE advocated Congressional cut-off of funds for the Vietnam war. After the end of the Vietnam War, SANE lobbied to have Congress end the bombing of Cambodia, and helped lead a successful effort to pass the War Powers Act. SANE would also take on the military budget, and produced the [...] "America Has a Tapeworm" [...] ad. Despite the end of the war, SANE continued actions throughout the 1970s that promoted its purpose.|$|R
40|$|The writer summarises the {{progress}} of the SALT negotiations to date and assesses their impli. cations. Before the SALT I negotiations, the United States was well in the lead in the development of anti ballistic systems, but lapsed into a sense of false security when it was seen that the Soviet Union was willing to negotiate. While the United States made cuts in expenditureand research, the Soviet Union, ignoring preliminary <b>SALT</b> <b>agreements,</b> went a long way towards making up the leeway. When the two sides signed the <b>SALT</b> Interim <b>Agreement</b> it appeared thatthe long. term advantage might lie with the Soviet Union, even though the United States was stillin the stronger position at the time. Whether the Soviet Union had gained a concrete advantagewill depend on the outcome of the Salt II negotiations. The writer points out that, while the Soviet Union has not denied its basic aim of world domination, the SALT negotiations are possibly being used to further this aim - a factor which he feels the West is overlooking. </p...|$|R

50|$|A major {{breakthrough}} for this agreement {{occurred at the}} Vladivostok Summit meeting in November 1974, when President Gerald Ford and General Secretary Leonid Breshnev came to an agreement on the basic framework for the <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement.</b> The elements of this agreement were stated to be in effect through 1985.|$|R
50|$|Vienna has {{frequently}} been {{chosen as the}} venue of key superpower summit meetings, like the Vienna summit in June 1961, with U.S. President John F.

5|$|Although President Jimmy Carter {{tried to}} place another {{limit on the}} arms race with a <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement</b> in 1979, his efforts were {{undermined}} by the other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.|$|R
5000|$|Without the <b>SALT</b> <b>agreements</b> {{providing}} stability {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union arms restraints, {{there would have}} been the scare of yet another strategic arms race between these two countries. The Soviet Union had deployed some 2,250 nuclear delivery vehicles and were capable of producing and deploying many more missiles {{by the middle of the}} 1980's. If this was to occur, the United States would then begin to retain the equipment necessary to build and increase their production of missiles to match that of the Soviet Union. This would increase the costs and security over the United States, nonetheless, making sure that neither side reached ultimate superiority over the other. [...] In addition, the failure of SALT consequently would have led to [...] "increased political insecurity, and the inherent instability of an unrestrained, and more costly, strategic arms competition".|$|R
50|$|During the Vienna Offensive in 1945, the {{building}} suffered damage and was restored during 1947 and 1950. The chancery hosted {{a meeting between}} Nikita Khrushchev and John F.

50|$|These {{aircraft}} {{carried out}} strategic photo reconnaissance missions for NATO and the USAF {{within the framework}} of the <b>SALT</b> I <b>Agreement</b> of 1972.

50|$|The détente {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{culminated in the}} signing of the SALT I (1972) and <b>SALT</b> II (1979) <b>agreements,</b> which placed {{constraints}} on further developments in nuclear capacities.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{objective}} of the two <b>SALT</b> <b>agreements</b> was to permit the United States and the Soviet Union to be essentially equivalent in their arsenal of strategic forces. This was {{to ensure that the}} Soviet Union could not gain advantage over the United States and its allies and that the two countries were equally as strong as the other. Second, they were to maintain and enhance (if possible) stability in this balance in order to prevent future nuclear warfare between the two. This stability meant that both countries had large enough forces so that the other side had no incentive to make the first move. The stability that the two countries had was made clear when the restraint of arms improvement was made. This was included to ensure that neither country could enhance their arsenal, which consequently, could threaten the balance and make one country have the advantage once again. The talks also provided a stable foundation for the political relations between the US and the Soviet Union and kept both their interests in respect.|$|R
50|$|It was privately revived in March 1976 {{to try to}} {{influence}} the presidential candidates and their advisors. After Jimmy Carter won the election, CPD went public again {{and spent the next}} four years lobbying, particularly against détente and the <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement.</b> Its hawkish conclusions influenced the CIA's future reporting on the Soviet threat, but, ultimately, proved to have provided a highly inaccurate worst-case scenario. This iteration of the CPD provided 33 officials to the Ronald Reagan administration.|$|R
5000|$|The goal of both SALT I and SALT II was {{to create}} a set of {{policies}} that would gradually evolve through revisions and adjustments. The initial policies set forth in SALT I would gradually change according to current situations, and policymakers would be able to more easily adjust to new rules and regulations. [...] Additionally, incrementalism in policymaking, and therefore treaty making, allows for there to be similarity and consistency between multiple iterations of the same plan. This consistency helps ensure that both sides of the treaty are on the same page and that their relationships with one another would not become strained. [...] SALT II was therefore intended to act as a step towards SALT III and greater control of the growing Arms Race. The final element of SALT II set up a framework in order to take the step towards SALT III. This third element, the [...] "Joint Statement of Principles" [...] was to accomplish three main goals : further reduction of available strategic arms, further qualitative limitations on these strategic arms, and finally to resolve the issues in the Protocol of the <b>SALT</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreements,</b> no new {{launchers}} {{could be}} built, therefore the Pershing 1a M790 launchers were modified into the Pershing II M1003 launchers. The {{functions of the}} vehicle mounted programmer test station needed for the older systems were consolidated into the Launch Control Assembly (LCA) in the Ground Integrated Electronics Unit (GIEU) {{on the side of}} the launcher. The warhead and radar sections were carried as an assembly on a pallet that rotated to mate with the main missile.|$|R
25|$|Also at Mildenhall, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbirds {{from the}} 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB, California were {{deployed}} {{on a routine}} basis. Besides standard photo reconnaissance flights, the SR-71s at Mildenhall were involved in ELINT missions that were carried out {{within the framework of}} the <b>SALT</b> I <b>Agreement</b> of 1972. Under this agreement, the U.S. and Soviet Union reached agreement on a partial freeze on the number of nuclear weapons and these flights were to verify that the Soviets were adhering to the agreement.|$|R

In 1979, he managed to negotiate in Vienna the opportunity of reporting closely the signing of the <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement</b> which was supposed to be reserved only for American and Soviet TV crews but Jakić managed to squeeze the Yugoslav crew amongst them. Due to his excellent knowledge of the German language, he was a regular reporter from Austria, West Germany and East Germany.|$|R
5000|$|Under President Jimmy Carter he {{was chief}} SALT {{negotiator}} and Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He helped negotiate the unratified <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement</b> with the Soviet Union {{and was a}} tireless advocate of slowing the arms race.

If you try and do it in a single step, you're gonna make one hell of a mess." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{concerted effort}} to {{establish}} the envisioned force was not made until world events in 1979 ended the post-Vietnam malaise in the United States after the Fall of Saigon. The 1979 <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement</b> with the Soviet Union led to a vigorous debate (and subsequent rejection by Congress of the treaty) which illustrated how far the United States military had fallen into disrepair during the 1970s. The 1979 Iranian Revolution; the 1979 energy crisis; the April 1980 failure of Operation Eagle Claw to rescue United States diplomatic personnel from Tehran, and the 1979 acknowledgment of a Soviet Army combat brigade in Cuba reinforced the appearance of weakness.|$|R
5000|$|Carter {{also tried}} to place another cap on the arms race with a <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement</b> in 1979, and faced the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. In 1979, Carter allowed the former Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi into the United States for medical treatment. In {{response}} Iranian militants seized the American embassy in the Iranian hostage crisis, taking 52 Americans hostage and demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. The hostage crisis continued for 444 days and dominated {{the last year of}} Carter's presidency, ruining the President's tattered reputation for competence in foreign affairs. Carter's responses to the crisis, from a [...] "Rose Garden strategy" [...] of staying inside the White House to the failed military attempt to rescue the hostages, did not inspire confidence in the administration by the American people.|$|R

The frequencies of the observed lattice modes were found to increase with Tc in the three &# 954;-phase <b>salts</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the reduced volume of the unit cell, and to have a mixed response in the three &# 946;-phase compounds. Furthermore, the general range and magnitude of the frequencies in the higher-Tc &# 954;-phase compounds were found to be larger than in the lower Tc &# 946;-phase compounds.

50|$|Provisions of the <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement</b> {{prohibited}} {{the deployment of}} more than one new missile (which became RT-23UTTh), it was officially declared by the Soviet Union that the RT-2PM Topol was developed to upgrade the silo based RT-2. The US government disputed this view, contending that the missile was clearly more than 5% larger and had twice the throw-weight as the RT-2 and therefore constituted a new missile system. Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, Soviet Chief of General Staff cancelled the September 1, 1983 test flight of the RT-2PM Topol which was to be launched from Plesetsk (the launch site in northwest Russia used for test firing of solid fuel propellant ICBMs)- 24 minutes later to land in the Klyuchi target area on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The night of the scheduled launch was the night that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down after accidentally intruding Soviet airspace over Kamchatka.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} confirm that the both the United States and the Soviet Union were in {{compliance}} with all provisions set in the <b>SALT</b> II <b>agreement,</b> both countries used NTM, or National Technical Means of verification, which included photo-reconnaissance satellites. Both sides came to an agreement that interference with the opposing side's national technical means would be prohibited and all activity must be easily distinguishable, not concealed, {{to confirm that}} there was no hindrance of verification. Otherwise the provisions would be consider to have been violated. One way that monitoring was done using NTM's was by collecting [...] "telemetry", or electronic signals that are used to transmit information while system tests are being performed. Both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed upon a provision stating that when one country asked about the telemetric signals, the other country could not withhold that information or deliberately deny the allegations.|$|R
40|$|As {{double-stranded}} DNA {{is stretched}} to its B-form contour length, models of polymer elasticity can describe the {{dramatic increase in}} measured force. When the molecule is stretched beyond the contour length, it further shows a highly cooperative overstretching transition. We have developed a theoretical description for this transition by coupling the two-state model and the elasticity theory proposed earlier by others. Furthermore, we have extended this model to account for monovalent salt effects on elastic moduli during the transition. We find that this theoretical description is in very good agreement with recent measurements for the salt dependence of the overstretching transition, allowing us to gain insight into the mechanisms that govern the transition. In double-stranded DNA, the effective length per unit charge varies with <b>salt</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the Manning and Poisson-Boltzmann models for thin polyelectrolyte rods, whereas the other model parameters describing structural features have barely any salt dependence. The results thus suggest that the electrostatic component of force-induced overstretching is mediated mesoscopically via elasticity...|$|R

40|$|The {{deterrent}} {{theory is}} not only obsolete, it has been abandoned by the United States. Deterrence is the threat of severe retaliation against the cities and manufacturing areas {{of a country that}} initiates a nuclear attack. Missiles {{do not have to be}} extremely accurate nor do the warheads require much explosive power to accomplish that mission. This balance of terror has been credited with preventing first-use of nuclear weapons for three decades and it reached its point of highest credibility when the first strategic arms limitation <b>agreement</b> (<b>SALT</b> I) was signed in 1972.

40|$|A {{systematic}} analysis of B-DNA elasticity cross-terms was performed using molecular dynamics simulations {{of three different}} duplexes designed to contain all dinucleotide steps including a 6 -mer A-tract. The influence of ionic strength was also evaluated by several trajectories of each molecule with different NaCl concentrations at physiological rank. Simulations show DNA flexibility is independent of <b>salt,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman model. In addition, our results demonstrate DNA asymmetry at this scale {{is more complex than}} predicted by long-scale DNA models, with the cross-terms relating twist, slide, roll, and twist {{on the one hand and}} tilt and shift on the other being most essential. We find the rest of the coupling terms can be generally discarded due to their lack of correlation, with the exception of purine-purine's rise-tilt and shift-tilt. More specifically, A-tracts do not present any specific features in terms of their flexibility and chirality properties within those expected for purine-purine steps. Finally, some hints about coupling mechanisms are provided; we suggest cup deformation is mostly responsible for the positive twist-rise correlation at step level, whereas roll-rise and tilt-rise correlations can be understood via changes in stagger...|$|R
