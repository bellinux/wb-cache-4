40|$|<b>Sine-beat</b> {{phenomena}} {{have been}} found in the 1994 Northridge earthquake records, and they are capable of producing time-history responses and damaging quasi-resonance effects in structures. Linear, single DOF (degree of freedom) oscillators, in lieu of nonlinear, multiple DOF systems, {{have been found}} adequate to discuss the failures of tall circuit breakers during the 1971 San Fernando and the 1989 Loma Prieta quakes in California. The use of <b>sine-beat</b> excitation for seismic-shaking-table tests of equipment continues to be a conservative simulation of earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|The {{circuit breaker}} with {{friction}} dampers was tested for its resistivity against earthquakes. The tests were performed with <b>sine-beat</b> excitation in the resonance frequencies and time history excitation {{according to the}} required IEC- 1166 response spectrum. The tests were successfully completed without any functional interference in the circuit breaker...|$|E
