The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14inch2 (6 degree2) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin <b>Schmidt</b> <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b> The survey covered the sky from a declination of +90 degrees (celestial north pole) to -27 degrees and all right ascensions and had a sensitivity to +22 magnitudes (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees declination was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.|$|E

5000|$|Unfortunately, {{the only}} large {{aperture}} wide-field telescopes before <b>Schmidt</b> were ordinary <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescopes</b> of short focal ratio (about f/3), and these presented images which while sharp {{at the middle}} of their fields of view, quickly lost their definition away from the field center. Star images became bloated and comet-shaped, {{with the head of the}} [...] "comet" [...] pointing to the middle of the photographic field. This bloating results mainly from the optical aberrations (i.e. errors) called [...] "coma" [...] and [...] "astigmatism". Before Schmidt it was impossible to build a large, fast reflector telescope which was not plagued by these errors.|$|R

40|$|The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST, {{also called}} the Guo Shou Jing Telescope) is a special <b>reflecting</b> <b>Schmidt</b> <b>telescope.</b> LAMOST&# 39;s special design allows both a large {{aperture}} (effective aperture of 3. 6 m- 4. 9 m) and a wide field of view (FOV) (5 degrees). It has an innovative active <b>reflecting</b> <b>Schmidt</b> configuration which continuously changes the mirror&# 39;s surface that adjusts during the observation process and combines thin deformable mirror active optics with segmented active optics. Its primary mirror (6. 67 m x 6. 05 m) and active Schmidt mirror (5. 74 m x 4. 40 m) are both segmented, and composed of 37 and 24 hexagonal sub-mirrors respectively. By using a parallel controllable fiber positioning technique, the focal surface of 1. 75 m in diameter can accommodate 4000 optical fibers. Also, LAMOST has 16 spectrographs with 32 CCD cameras. LAMOST will be the telescope with {{the highest rate of}} spectral acquisition. As a national large scientific project, the LAMOST project was formally proposed in 1996, and approved by the Chinese government in 1997. The construction started in 2001, was completed in 2008 and passed the official acceptance in June 2009. The LAMOST pilot survey was started in October 2011 and the spectroscopic survey will launch in September 2012. Up to now, LAMOST has released more than 480 000 spectra of objects. LAMOST will make an important contribution {{to the study of the}} large-scale structure of the Universe, structure and evolution of the Galaxy, and cross-identification of multi-waveband properties in celestial objects...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>reflecting</b> <b>{{telescope}}</b> (also {{called a}} reflector) is a telescope {{that uses a}} single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> was invented in the 17th century {{as an alternative to}} the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescopes</b> produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. <b>Reflecting</b> <b>telescopes</b> come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescopes</b> use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a [...] "catoptric" [...] telescope.|$|R

Gregory's design was published in 1663 and pre-dates the first practical <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope,</b> the Newtonian telescope, built by Sir Isaac Newton in 1668. However, Gregory's design was only a theoretical description and he never actually constructed the telescope. It was not successfully built until five years after Newton's first <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|R
