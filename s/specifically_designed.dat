5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E
5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, {{head of the}} Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for the sport.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Canon {{invested}} US$100million in NeXT, {{giving it}} a 16.67percent stake, making NeXT worth almost $600million. Canon invested in NeXT with the condition {{that it would be}} able to use the NeXTSTEP environment with its own workstations, which would mean a greatly expanded market for the software. After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a line of PCs, called object.station, including models 31, 41, 50 and 52, <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to run NeXTSTEP/Intel. Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Many Dungeons & Dragons {{elements}} {{appear in}} hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing {{can be seen}} in improvisational theatre. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for gaming could be seen in Glorantha's board games among others. Ultimately, however, Dungeons & Dragons represents a unique blending of these elements.|$|E

Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights are <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> {{to be visible}} when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E

5|$|The Leslie is <b>specifically</b> <b>designed,</b> via {{reproduction}} of the Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
