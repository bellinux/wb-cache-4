50|$|Bidens alba is a {{vascular}} plant. It has {{a similar}} root and <b>stem</b> <b>system</b> {{to others in the}} dicot family Asteraceae. After germinating, the roots progress into a tap root that grows vertically in the ground. The primary tissue of the apical meristems increases the length of the plant and the secondary roots of the lateral meristems give rise to the width. B. alba grows to a height of approximately five feet tall.|$|E
50|$|Equisetum arvense, {{the field}} {{horsetail}} or common horsetail is a herbaceous perennial plant, native throughout the arctic and temperate {{regions of the}} northern hemisphere. It has separate sterile non-reproductive and fertile spore-bearing stems, growing from a perennial underground rhizomatous <b>stem</b> <b>system.</b> The fertile stems are produced in early spring and are non-photosynthetic, while the green sterile stems start to grow after the fertile stems have wilted, and persist through the summer until the first autumn frosts. It is commonly confused with mare's tail, Hippuris vulgaris.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new totally unsupervised and 90 % effective stemming approach for classical Arabic. This stemming {{is meant to}} be a preparatory step to an unsupervised root (i. e., radicals) extraction. As a learning input, our <b>stemming</b> <b>system</b> requires no linguistic knowledge but a plain classical Arabic text. Once the learning input analyzed, our <b>stemming</b> <b>system</b> is able to extract the strongest segment of a given length, namely the stem. We start by a definition of the targeted stem, then, we show how our system performs about 90 % true positives after a leaning of less than 15000 words. Unlike the other unsupervised approaches, ours does not suppose the perfectness of the input text and deals efficiently with the eventual (practically very frequent) misspellings. The test corpus we have used is an ultimate reference in the classical Arabic and its labeling has been rigorously done by a team of experts...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{applicability}} of two femoral <b>stem</b> <b>systems</b> in male and female populations via preoperative templating. The radiographs of 47 consecutive patients (94 hips) were templated using one of two <b>stem</b> <b>systems</b> by first fixing the acetabular center of rotation. Based upon templating, the result categories were: no obvious advantage of either system, System 1 preferred, System 2 preferred, neither system adequate. Preference was determined based upon having a best-fit stem choice and at least one additional length or offset option, and avoiding the extremes of the system as the best-fit choice. Significantly, there were gender differences in applicability of femoral stems. Specifically, more neck length and offset options seem to be required for females. The potential limitations of the implant systems in applicability could be overcome by adjusting the level of neck resection. Therefore, it would appear that there is a limited role for gender specific implants for total hip arthroplasty. Keywords: hip  arthroplasty  modular  stem gende...|$|R

50|$|Egeria densa is an {{aquatic plant}} growing in {{water up to}} 4 m deep, with {{trailing}} stems to 2 m or more long, producing roots at intervals along the stem. The leaves are produced in whorls of four to eight, 1 - 4 cm long and 2 - 5 mm broad, with a pointed leaf tip. The <b>stem</b> <b>system</b> of the plant will grow until it reaches {{the surface of the}} water, where it will begin to spread out, creating a thick flower canopy that blocks light from reaching plants below it. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants; the flowers are 12 - 20 mm diameter, with three broad, rounded, white petals, 8 - 10 mm long on male plants, and 6 - 7 mm long on female plants.|$|E
40|$|Brazilians {{have been}} using the {{underground}} organs of Smilax species in alternative medicine since the 19 th century because of their anti-rheumatic qualities. However, even nowadays, these species are explored only by extractivism. Studies on seed germination and development of these organs could be useful to preserve these plants. After germination, seedling development of Smilax polyantha was analyzed to understand underground stem formation. Furthermore, to analyze the ontogenesis of the underground system, seedlings aged from one to twelve months were sectioned. One {{of the most striking}} features of this species is the presence of two <b>stem</b> branching <b>systems.</b> The plumule gives rise to the first <b>stem</b> branching <b>system</b> with negative geotropism. Its first underground axillary bud sprouted into the other caulinar axis with positive geotropism. The horizontal growth and the subsequent thickening of this underground organ depended on the development of axillary buds from basal nodes of the previous branches. The cotyledonary bud did not {{play a role in the}} underground formation, as previously described in the literature for this genus, but the buds of the basal cataphylls built the second <b>stem</b> branching <b>system.</b> In this study we discuss the terminology and suggest calling this second <b>stem</b> branching <b>system</b> a rhizophore...|$|R

40|$|The neoblast <b>stem</b> cell <b>system</b> of flatworms is {{considered}} to be unique within the animal kingdom. How this <b>stem</b> cell <b>system</b> arises during embryonic development is intriguing. Therefore we performed bromodeoxyuridine labelling on late stage embryos of Macrostomum lignano to assess when the pattern of proliferating cells within the embryo is comparable to that of hatchlings. This pattern can be found in late embryonic stages (stage 8). We also used the freeze cracking method to perform macvasa embryonic labelling. Macvasa is a somatic and germ line stem cell marker. We showed macvasa protein distribution during the whole embryonic development. In the macvasa-positive blastomeres the protein is localized around the nucleus in the putative chromatoid bodies. However, at a specific embryonic stage, it is also ubiquitously present in the cytoplasm of some blastomeres. We compare our data with what is known from Schmidtea polychroa of the expression of the vasa-like gene SpolvlgA and the protein distribution of the chromatoid body component Spoltud- 1. The embryonic origin of the somatic <b>stem</b> cell <b>system</b> and the germ line is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Voles {{prefer to}} live in soils ranging from loam/peat moss mixtures, to gravel or stone soils, but not very dry soils. Alfisol and Ultisol soil types are {{particularly}} favored due to being favorable to the vole’s burrowing system. Voles feed on both the roots and <b>stem</b> <b>system</b> and the vegetation of plants, as well as fruits, seeds, bark, subterranean fungus and insects. Because they feed on roots and tubers, voles {{do not need to}} drink water much. Voles cache food, primarily during the winter. Voles {{spend most of their time}} underground in their burrow systems and seldom venture into the surface. This makes them safe from hawks and owls. [...] Other predators of voles include snakes. They are also susceptible to ectoparasites like lice, fleas, mites, and chiggers.|$|E
5000|$|Edelman's theory {{focuses on}} two nervous system organizations: the {{brainstem}} and limbic systems {{on one side}} and the thalamus and cerebral cortex on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn adaptive behaviors. This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain <b>stem</b> <b>system</b> and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's current perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of conceptual memory to a set of ongoing perceptual categorizations—a [...] "remembered present".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tissue {{plasticity}} and {{a substantial}} regeneration capacity based on {{stem cells are}} the hallmark of several invertebrate groups such as sponges, cnidarians and Platyhelminthes. Traditionally, Acoela were seen as an early branching clade within the Platyhelminthes, but became recently positioned {{at the base of}} the Bilateria. However, little is known on how the <b>stem</b> cell <b>system</b> in this new phylum is organized. In this study, we wanted to examine if Acoela possess a neoblast-like <b>stem</b> cell <b>system</b> that is responsible for development, growth, homeostasis and regeneration. Results We established enduring laboratory cultures of the acoel Isodiametra pulchra (Acoela, Acoelomorpha) and implemented in situ hybridization and RNA interference (RNAi) for this species. We used BrdU labelling, morphology, ultrastructure and molecular tools to illuminate the morphology, distribution and plasticity of acoel stem cells under different developmental conditions. We demonstrate that neoblasts are the only proliferating cells which are solely mesodermally located within the organism. By means of in situ hybridisation and protein localisation we could demonstrate that the piwi -like gene ipiwi 1 is expressed in testes, ovaries as well as in a subpopulation of somatic stem cells. In addition, we show that germ cell progenitors are present in freshly hatched worms, suggesting an embryonic formation of the germline. We identified a potent <b>stem</b> cell <b>system</b> that is responsible for development, homeostasis, regeneration and regrowth upon starvation. Conclusions We introduce the acoel Isodiametra pulchra as potential new model organism, suitable to address developmental questions in this understudied phylum. We show that neoblasts in I. pulchra are crucial for tissue homeostasis, development and regeneration. Notably, epidermal cells were found to be renewed exclusively from parenchymally located stem cells, a situation known only from rhabditophoran flatworms so far. For further comparison, it will be important to analyse the <b>stem</b> cell <b>systems</b> of other key-positioned understudied taxa. </p...|$|R

30|$|Magnetic {{trackers}} are {{devices that}} use magnetic fields {{to find the}} position and orientation of an object. The system consists of one emitter which generates the magnetic field and receivers that collect measurements on about the magnetic field. The data collected by the receiver is then interpreted to determine the position and orientation of the receiver. The receiver can {{be placed on the}} parts of the body that are to be tracked for motion and orientation. Polhemus {{is one of the leading}} motion tracking companies. They produce multiple magnetic trackers including Fastrak, IsoTrak II, Inside Trak, Ultratrak, Patriot, Liberty Latus, and G 4 [119]. These devices have markers that would be strapped on to the user through Velcro or attached to other positioning devices. Polhemus devices use AC electromagnetic pulses for the emitter. The Patriot, Liberty Latus, and the G 4 send the magnetic information wirelessly to the emitter to be interpreted. Flock of Birds by Ascension (Shelburne, VT, USA) is another magnetic tracking system that allows for 6 DOF of motion tracking [120]. Flock of Birds consists of an emitter which uses DC pulses to create a magnetic field. The PC/BIRD and SpacePad both follow the same setup as the Polhemus and Flock of Birds devices. Sixense offers two magnetic trackers for immersive virtual reality [121]. The Sixense Razer Hydra (Sixense, San Francisco, CA, USA) is a ‘nunchuck’ controller that is tracked by a base that emits magnetic waves. The hydra tracks the orientation and position of the hands.
