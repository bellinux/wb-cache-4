This experiment has shown that, in case the tracing concern is implemented using an AOP implementation instead of a procedural language, the development effort is on average 6 % reduced while the impact of errors is reduced by 77 %, for maintaining code related to tracing. For a subset of the scenarios, the results were statistically significant on a confidence interval of 95 %. The so-called aspect interference problem is one of the major concerns in introducing AOP. Aspects can be developed independently and behave correct in isolation. However, due to intended or unintended composition of aspects, undesired behavior can emerge. In this thesis we focus on behavioral conflicts between aspects at shared join points. These are illustrated by a realistic example based on crosscutting concerns from ASML. We present an approach for the detection of behavioral interference that is based on a novel abstraction of the behavior of aspects, using resources and operations. This abstraction enables the expression of behavior in a simple manner that is suitable for automated detection of interference among aspects. The approach employs a set of conflict detection rules that can be used to detect both generic conflicts as well as domain specific conflicts. Our approach is general for AOP languages, its application to one specific AOP language Composition Filters is also illustrated in this thesis. The application to Composition Filters demonstrates how the use of a declarative advice language can be exploited for automated conflict detection. We detail the analysis process and discuss what information is required from the aspect developer to be able perform the analysis. We also discuss when static analysis is insufficient for detecting behavioral conflicts. We present a run time extension aiming at detecting dynamic conflicts. We discuss optimizations for this run time approach, which exploits the static verification results. Finally, we propose three improvements to the Composition Filters model to support automated and manual reasoning even further. The first improvement separates what behavior is executed from when this behavior is executed. Secondly, we introduce atomic filters that can be used to build more complex filters. The semantics of these filters are well defined. Although this approach has clear benefits from an automated reasoning perspective, the introduction of atomic filters results in the definition of numerous filters for specifying more complex behavior. Therefore, we introduce a filter composition language that enables the declarative composition of (atomic) filters, such that composed filter behavior can be reused elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Photocapacitance (PHCAP) and Hall effect {{measurements}} {{are applied to}} liquid—phase epitaxially grown n— Al 0 3 Ga 07 As crystals, followed by an annealing at 900 °C for 1 h under controlled arsenic vapor pressure. Photocapacitance measurements reveal two deep levels in relatively lightly Te-doped samples, the optical activation energy of which are 0. 5 and 1. 1 eV, respectively (E 5 - 0. 5 eV level and E 5 - 1. 1 eV level). The E 5 - 0. 5 eV level density increases with applied arsenic vapor pressure during annealing. The Ee_ 1. 1 eV level density increases with increasing arsenic vapor pressure, but de— creases at the highest arsenic vapor pressures. Hall effect measurements show that activation ratio between carrier con-centration and Te concentration is higher when the epitaxial layers are annealed under lower arsenic vapor pressure (0. 2 Ton) than the samples annealed under higher arsenic pressure (310 Torr), and decreases in the heavily Te-doped samples. From these results, {{the origin of the}} defects detected in n-AlGa 1 As is discussed in view of deviation from the stoichio-metric composition and Te doping in the M,Ga 1 As ternary alloy system. Infroduction The deviation from the stoichiometric composition is the most important factor to be controlled in compound <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>materials.</b> Nishizawa and co-workers have sys...|$|R
40|$|Chemical bath electro {{deposition}} process {{is used in}} many industrial applications to obtain a thin layer material on a target surface. Numerous metal, magnetic or <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>materials,</b> such as oxide, chalcogenure or alloys are obtained in electrochemical cells at laboratory scale. Some of these materials are interesting to be produced at industrial scale, for example for electronics, fuel cells or photovoltaic applications. In industrial electrochemical cells, dimension is larger and many parameters such as hydrodynamics or electro active specie transport are heterogeneous. There are many industrial electrochemical techniques in which the electrode moves {{with respect to the}} solution. These systems, like the rotating electrodes, are called hydrodynamic electrochemical processes. It is also interesting to notice that micronic structure, such as roughness, columnar structure or porosity of material deposit is local flow dependent. Then, it appears, that the material deposit composition and structural quality need integrated information from the micronic scale to the industrial scale, using, of course, the laboratory scale measurements. The aim of the present work is to model and to numerically simulate the hydrodynamics, electrochemical and chemical coupled phenomena, which are occurring during the chemical bath electro {{deposition process}} for laboratory and industrial configurations. Experimental measurements obtained at laboratory scale with zinc oxide thin layer deposit are used to identify transport or kinetic data input which are conserved during the scale-up. Flow and chemical species concentration field properties are calculated in the working electrode surface vicinity taking into account homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. The numerical method used is the finite volume method. In addition, using a Monte Carlo method, micronic information is calculated such as the roughness and the porosity of the thin layer material obtained...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{crystals}} {{occur in}} a variety of chemically relevant problems,including pharmaceuticals and organic <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>materials.</b> Therehas been much interest in developing computational models which canpredict crystal structures and properties accurately and withreasonable computational expense. One such model, hybridmany-body interaction (HMBI), fragments a chemical system intomonomer, dimer, and many-body interactions, each of which may be handledusing a different level of theory. HMBI has been used to predictcrystal structures, lattice energies, and relative polymorphstability, particularly in cases where other methods such as periodicdensity functional theory (DFT) have struggled. This dissertation extends the HMBI model in two important ways. First, the computational cost of these calculations is significantlyreduced by {{the development and implementation of}} an algorithm toexploit space group symmetry. This algorithm reduces the number ofmonomer and dimers calculations that need to be performed byeliminating symmetrically equivalent ones. Exploitation of spacegroup symmetry provides additional computational savings during acrystal geometry optimization by reducing the number of degrees offreedom that need to be optimized, which tends to decrease the numberof optimization steps required to reach convergence. Second, the ability to predict molecular crystal structures andproperties at finite temperature is developed by coupling the HMBImodel with the quasi-harmonic approximation. Traditional approacheseither neglect temperature or approximate it with a harmonicvibrational model. However, molecular crystals expand appreciablywith temperature and this expansion has significant impacts oncrystal properties. Typically, as crystals expand, the lattice energyweakens and the phonon modes soften. Neglecting this expansion causesthermochemical properties such as enthalpy and entropy to beoverestimated near room temperature. The quasi-harmonicHMBI model is demonstrated to predict temperature-dependent molarvolumes, thermochemistry, and mechanical properties in excellentagreement with experiment for several small-molecule crystals [...] -carbondioxide, ice, acetic acid, and imidazole. These developments alsopave the way toward computational prediction of molecular crystalphase diagrams as a function of temperature and pressure.
