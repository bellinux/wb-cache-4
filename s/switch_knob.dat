50|$|A {{fundamental}} {{basis of}} the typical Duesenberg design is its three-step geometry. This is reflected in almost {{every part of the}} instrument, from headstock, pickguard and pickup-ring to knobs, output jack and even the pickup <b>switch</b> <b>knob.</b> The typical Duesenberg D also contains this three-step design in the lower bar.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} is noted for simulations {{of the space}} shuttle in many situations in a 3D environment, from leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building to returning to Earth at the Shuttle Landing Facility and displayed almost every <b>switch,</b> <b>knob</b> and display of the real shuttle control panels while simulating most of their respective functions.|$|E
5000|$|Two LEDs are {{positioned}} {{at the end}} of flexible extensions known as [...] "LEDacles". The layout of <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs</b> and photocells, combined with the tentacle-like LEDacles, give the appearance of a face. Many users decorate their Thingamakits to look like robots, animals, etc.|$|R
50|$|Tivoli Audio is an American audio {{equipment}} company founded in 2001 by Henry Kloss. They {{are known for}} mid-century modern design inspired radios and other {{audio equipment}} that emphasize simple and functional design without redundant <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs</b> or lights. Many types, including the Model One and Model Two, incorporate visual elements similar to Kloss' KLH Model Eight table radio; most prominent is the geared rotary tuning dial, which allows the user to carefully dial in a station without requiring excessively-steady hands.|$|R

50|$|With {{most modern}} {{aircraft}} utilizing “Glass cockpit” displays {{it has become}} easier to create highly realistic panels. The displays on these panels can be driven by multi head graphics cards, or networked PCs running dedicated software that can read from the simulator spreading the processing load. Interfaces for <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs,</b> and other elements needed can be purchased commercially or created by dismantling existing hardware such as keyboards or joysticks. Feedback from the PC to the panel, for example to light warning lamps or move real instrument is more complex and normally completed through a commercial expansion board.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{creation}} of the Guitorgan, Vox quickly produced their own version, known as the Guitar Organ, which was roughly based on their Continental organ voice boards. In the mid-70's, Godwin produced the rare Organ (Guitar) in two versions. The flagship model had 19 <b>switches</b> and 13 <b>knobs,</b> while the lower model had 16 <b>switches</b> and 4 <b>knobs.</b>|$|R
40|$|This poster aims at {{discussing}} {{the potential of}} natural, intuitive hand poses and gestures used for interaction with standard applications in a vehicle while driving. Test drivers liked this natural type of interface and indicated that invehicle function control with intuitive hand gestures is a promising approach, which {{they would like to}} see in real cars in the future. 1. INTERACTION WITH THE VEHICLE Driving, and in particular interaction with and control of information and assistance systems in a car, gets more and more complex because of the increasing number of buttons, <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs,</b> or the multi-stage functionality of controls such as BMW iDrive or Audi MMI. A possible consequence from the excessive information is cognitive overload, affectin...|$|R
50|$|An {{electrical}} enclosure is a cabinet for electrical or electronic equipment to mount <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs</b> and displays {{and to prevent}} electrical shock to equipment users and protect the contents from the environment. The enclosure is {{the only part of}} the equipment which is seen by users; in many cases it is designed not only for its utilitarian requirements, but also to be pleasing to the eye. Regulations may dictate the features and performance of enclosures for electrical equipment in hazardous areas, such as petrochemical plants or coal mines. Electronic packaging may place many demands on an enclosure for heat dissipation, radio frequency interference and electrostatic discharge protection, as well as functional, esthetic and commercial constraints.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{controls}} on bass amps: <b>switches</b> and rotary <b>knobs.</b> The simplest, least expensive practice amps and combo amps may {{only have a few}} <b>switches</b> and <b>knobs,</b> such as an [...] "on/off" [...] <b>switch,</b> a volume <b>knob,</b> and a bass and treble control knob. Mid-priced models may add additional tone controls (e.g., one, two or three [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] knob for very high frequencies) and/or add a second type of volume knob called a [...] "gain", [...] "preamplifier" [...] (or [...] "preamp"/"pre"), or [...] "drive" [...] (short for [...] "overdrive") control. A good selection of equalizer knobs and gain stages is standard on expensive amplifiers. If an amp has one or more preamp or gain knobs, the second volume knob may be called [...] "master", [...] "volume" [...] or [...] "post".|$|R
5000|$|Neill {{invented the}} [...] "mutantrumpet", {{which is a}} trumpet {{equipped}} with extra bells and valves, and electrical modifications that allow him to control computer variables with his playing. The first mutantrumpet had three bells, six valves, a trombone slide and an analog processing system. At the STEIM Studios in Amsterdam, he then developed a MIDI-capable mutantrumpet, which contained more <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs</b> and pressure-sensitive pads so as to allow greater control over the sound and visuals of his sound installations. Robert Moog designed its original electronic processing system and David Behrman designed a computer program to facilitate live performance. In 2008, Neill completed {{a new version of}} his instrument during another residency at STEIM. In 2014, he returned to Amsterdam to design another updated version of the mutantrumpet.|$|R
50|$|Some {{electric}} guitar models feature piezoelectric pickups, which function as transducers {{to provide a}} sound closer to that of an acoustic guitar with the flip of a <b>switch</b> or <b>knob,</b> rather than <b>switching</b> guitars. Those that combine piezoelectric pickups and magnetic pickups are sometimes known as hybrid guitars.|$|R
5000|$|Another method, {{popular with}} gamers, is the manual fan speed controller. They can be mounted in an {{expansion}} slot, a 5.25" [...] or 3.5" [...] drive bay or come {{built into the}} computer's case. Using <b>switches</b> or <b>knobs,</b> attached fans can have their speeds adjusted {{by one of the}} above methods.|$|R
50|$|Lauten Audio, {{based in}} {{northern}} California, United States, is a designer and manufacturer of microphones and related equipment. Lauten Audio {{coined the term}} Multi-voicing™ which is a unique functionality where the sound characteristics of a microphone can be manipulated via <b>switches</b> or <b>knobs</b> to change its timbre {{without the use of}} external hardware.|$|R
50|$|Alzheimer disease {{presents}} specific {{challenges for}} caregivers, {{who need to}} make the home as accessible as possible to the elderly resident, while keeping safety features in mind. Removable stove <b>switch</b> <b>knobs,</b> locks on kitchen cabinets, electric kettles with automatic shut-off, and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person with Alzheimer disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.|$|R

50|$|On guitars {{that have}} them, these {{components}} and the wires that connect them allow the player to control {{some aspects of}} the sound like volume or tone using <b>knobs,</b> <b>switches,</b> or buttons. The most basic electronic control is a volume knob. Some guitars also have a tone-control knob, and some guitars with multiple pickups have pickup selector <b>switches</b> or <b>knobs</b> to determine which pickup(s) are activated. These at their simplest consist of passive components such as potentiometers and capacitors, but may also include specialized integrated circuits or other active components requiring batteries for power, for preamplification and signal processing, or even for electronic tuning. In many cases the electronics have some sort of shielding to prevent pickup of external interference and noise.|$|R
50|$|VST plugins {{generally}} run {{within a}} digital audio workstation (DAW), {{to provide additional}} functionality, though a few standalone plugin hosts exist which support VST. Most VST plugins are either instruments (VSTi) or effects, although other categories exist—for example spectrum analyzers and various meters. VST plugins usually provide a custom graphical user interface that displays controls similar to physical <b>switches</b> and <b>knobs</b> on audio hardware. Some (often older) plugins rely on the host application for their user interface.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} {{traditional}} physical interface components such as <b>switches,</b> levers, <b>knobs</b> and touch screens {{can be easily}} modified to identify who is activating each control. This allows us to change the function performed by the control, and the sensory feedback provided by the control itself, dependent upon the user. An auditing function is also available that logs each user's actions. We describe a number of example usage scenarios for our technique, and present two sample implementations...|$|R
5000|$|There was no {{audio signal}} in an I/O module—rather, each I/O module {{had a single}} 4 MHz Z80 {{microprocessor}} that was responsible for converting user input (<b>switches,</b> <b>knobs,</b> faders) on four channels to control signals for the audio tower, and for returning sample level information for display on the meters and overload information for clipping indicators. The Master module (also powered by a single 4 MHz Z80) handled the master faders, the talkback system, additional meters, etc. and also included a jog wheel and dot-matrix alphanumeric display for configuring the system. Since most controls (e.g. {{the changing of the}} gain of a selected EQ) could be performed with the jog wheel and alphanumeric display and were shown in real time on the Support Computer's display, a mix engineer could do most of his/her work from a central location at the Mix Controller while remaining in the audio [...] "sweet spot" [...] for monitoring purposes, etc. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} conventional mixing consoles of the time, where a particular EQ had to be adjusted via the associated knobs in that particular channel strip, which might be located a considerable distance from the sweet spot. A third Z80-based processor board—the MPU—resided inside the Master module and was responsible for system booting and initialization, system management, inter-module communication and communication with an external PC.|$|R
50|$|As the {{missions}} themselves were fairly complex, the game would optionally provide {{a high level}} of hand-holding. Instructions were passed to the player on a 'teleprinter', and when those instructions required the player to use the shuttle controls, the appropriate <b>switch</b> or <b>knob</b> would be indicated by a flashing box. As such, the normally massive amount of material the player would be required to read through in order to know how to accurately and safely pilot a shuttle were condensed into something the average player could understand, another point of praise for the game by its users.|$|R
5000|$|The dimensions, {{mechanical}} designs, {{and even}} the general appearance of light switches changes slowly with time. They frequently remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when {{a portion of a}} house is rewired. It is not unusual to see century-old light switches still in functional use. Manufacturers introduce various new forms and styles, {{but for the most part}} decoration and fashion concerns are limited to the face-plates or wall-plates. Even the [...] "modern" [...] dimmer <b>switch</b> with <b>knob</b> is at least four decades old, and in even the newest construction the familiar toggle and rocker switch appearances predominate.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design and build a {{portable}} box recreating classic sounds heard in science fiction films. These include sounds ranging from droning hums to bloops and bleeps. Currently no other device is made specifically for generating these sounds. The user controls and manipulates the sounds produced {{using a combination of}} <b>switches</b> and <b>knobs</b> to shape the sound generation. The sounds are generated using analog electronics. The project was successful in meeting the desired goal by designing and building a Randomizer, MIDI controller, VCO, LFO, VCA, Ring Modulator, and Fuzz Section. The resulting device is useful for generating a unique atmosphere of sounds shaped by the user...|$|R

50|$|A park by wire system {{engages the}} parking pawl of a {{transmission}} using electrical means. This {{can also be}} considered as part of a shift by wire system whose objective is to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive modes without the traditional mechanical system which involves linkages between the gear shifter and the transmission. The main components of a park by wire system include the driver interface which could be a lever, <b>switch</b> or <b>knob</b> as designed by the OEM (input), an electronic control unit to host the control system and actuators (one or two motors) which are capable of driving the parking pawl {{into and out of the}} locking position with the parking gear of the transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Patch editors allow {{users to}} program their {{equipment}} through the computer interface. These became essential {{with the appearance}} of complex synthesizers such as the Yamaha FS1R, which contained several thousand programmable parameters, but had an interface that consisted of fifteen tiny buttons, four knobs and a small LCD. Digital instruments typically discourage users from experimentation, due to their lack of the feedback and direct control that <b>switches</b> and <b>knobs</b> would provide, but patch editors give owners of hardware instruments and effects devices the same editing functionality that is available to users of software synthesizers. Some editors are designed for a specific instrument or effects device, while other, [...] "universal" [...] editors support a variety of equipment, and ideally can control the parameters of every device in a setup through the use of System Exclusive commands.|$|R
5000|$|Next {{came the}} SL-Class 230 SL, a new design with a 2.3-litre {{mechanically}} fuel injected six cylinder engine. It featured a low waistline and big curved greenhouse windows, and a Coupe Roadster with detachable hardtop, whose distinctive roofline earned the nickname [...] "pagoda top." [...] The design was by Paul Bracq. Around 1967, the engine received a displacement increase {{and the model}} {{became known as the}} 250 SL. Within a year the engine displacement was increased for the final time and the model designation became 280 SL. Beginning with later versions of the 250 SL changes were made to dashboard padding, <b>switches</b> and <b>knobs,</b> door pockets (US models only) and steering wheel. In addition, on the 230 SL formerly separate centre hub caps and wheel trim rings became full wheel covers.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{a single}} control {{is used to}} control both left and right side mirrors. A mirror is {{selected}} by a <b>switch</b> or a <b>knob.</b> The mirror selector usually has a neutral position with none mirrors selected, to prevent accidental changes of the view. The position of the selected mirror is adjusted by a joystick, a four-way knob, or other type of position control. In luxury designs, power mirror settings may be memorized together with settings of power seats.|$|R
50|$|The two pickups are custom humbuckers {{which both}} sit {{at an angle}} {{opposite}} {{to that of a}} standard Stratocaster or Telecaster bridge pickup. It appears that the coils are offset to keep the magnets in line with the strings, although they are potted in epoxy so the magnets cannot be seen. The guitar features a volume knob, a tone knob, a 3-way pickup selector switch, and a coil splitting <b>switch.</b> The tone <b>knob</b> used stacked 250k and 1M pots with center detent.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Marauders had 4 hidden, {{high powered}} pickups under the pickguard. They were never {{made available to}} the public and the 6 known production models were given away as promotions to shops around the Fullerton, California area. The Type II variation has three pickups, with the bridge pickup slanted as upon a Stratocaster. It also has seven <b>switches</b> and four <b>knobs.</b> The thinking behind the model was to combine the ideas behind the Stratocaster and Jaguar guitars while adding some new features to increase versatility.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{aspects of}} human-computer interaction, from the {{high-level}} concerns of organizational context and system requirements to the conceptual, semantic, and syntactic levels of user interface design, are ultimately funneled through physical {{input and output}} actions and devices. This chapter considers the input half of this physical level of human-computer interaction, the final {{means by which the}} user communicates information to the computer. It is also called the Lexical level of the design of an interactive system, in contrast to the successively higher Syntactic, Semantic, and Conceptual levels [Foley, 1990 a]. Computer input once consisted of such actions as setting <b>switches</b> and <b>knobs</b> and plugging and unplugging jumper wires in patch boards. For many years after that, the primary form of computer input was the punched card. Users or, more often, specialist keypunch operators punched the input information as holes in paper cards, which could then be read by comput...|$|R
50|$|In response, several luxury brands had <b>switched</b> to rotary <b>knob</b> control devices, {{with the}} aim to simplify cabin layout and {{consolidate}} multiple controls with a single device. The BMW iDrive, Audi MMI, and Mercedes-Benz COMAND APS interfaces operated using a circular center knob which can be rotated side to side, and pressed to select items, with the rotary knob scrolling through on-screen menus. Of these systems, some reviewers praised their ability to simplify the dash layout, while others levied criticism for reputed complexity and user difficulty, particularly with iDrive.|$|R
40|$|The {{images of}} the two {{machines}} {{presented in this article}} (pp 14 – 15) were inspired by a slide that has been projected several times over the past year or so, at various women’s health research congresses. The congress speakers invariably explain that the first machine, depicted as a large rectangular box with a single on-off switch and indicator light, represents male sexuality. The second machine, identical in size and shape but almost completely covered with various <b>switches,</b> <b>knobs,</b> levers, buttons, and colored indicator lights, represents female sexuality. It is incidentally revealed that Pfizer Incorporated, the makers of ViagraTM, had distributed the slide to presenters. At each presentation of the slide, the audience laughs knowingly. Everyone gets the joke. The juxtaposition of the two machines is effective as a presentation tool, requiring little explanation, yet speaking volumes about our taken-for-granted ideas about sexuality. The joke, so readily understood by members of the audience, also challenges us to consider how our culturally informed notions about sexuality inform contemporary research on sexual dysfunctions. The cartoon relies on the belief that male sexuality is simple, whereas female sexuality is complicated. But what if we examine assumptions such as this one, laying bare what is usually only tacitly acknowledged, in order to determine how they become part of scientific research and the development of new biomedical technologies? The imagery, after all, is more than just an in-joke among sexual dysfunction researchers. It shows that cultural assumptions about men and women are ingrained even among the professionals who not only develop drugs, but also shape our understanding of sexual dysfunction and its treatment. Comparison of the clinical testing of Viagra on men and women may allow us to examine the ways in which our cultural conceptions about the nature of sexuality play a role in determining the potential success of the drug. In the process of developing and choosing methods and measurements to evaluate sexual arousal, researchers contribute to the very definition of the objects they study. The assumption that male sexuality is simple, and that female sexuality is complicated, becomes incorporated into research hypotheses, and in turn affects the way that men’s and women’s sexual problems are understood, classified, and treated...|$|R
50|$|Achondroplastic {{children}} {{require special}} attention {{as they grow}} up and age. The home setting for an achondroplastic child should be modified {{in a way that}} is fitting for a child with a growth mutation. Toys should be considered and altered to fit the needs of the child, or size of the child, such as tricycles and backyard playground equipment. Other fixtures in the home should be replaced to attainable heights for the children such as light <b>switches</b> or door <b>knobs.</b> Because achondroplastic children tend to have weaker posture, supporting cushions should be considered in use as well as stools for their feet when they are sitting down.|$|R
5000|$|Audio moogerfoogers {{consist of}} a black {{wedge-shaped}} box, approximately 5 by 9 in, with walnut edges. The face contains an array of <b>knobs,</b> <b>switches</b> and LEDs. All moogerfoogers have a knob that allows the user to fade the effect from a completely dry (100% original input) to a completely wet (100% processed) signal. There is also a stomp switch that allows the user to toggle the effect on and off and a knob that controls the gain. True {{to the nature of}} modular synthesizers, all parameters on the pedals are variable using control voltages which may be plugged into the rear of the pedal using 1/4" [...] jacks.|$|R
5000|$|The body {{is made of}} arched, {{laminated}} wood, {{with the}} exterior and interior laminations being made of maple. There is a maple central core in the body, to which the top and bottom, and neck are attached. The neck is one baulk of mahogany, with a rosewood fingerboard and pearloid dot markers. The hardware is nickel-plated. As delivered by Gibson, the ES-333 had no pickup covers, nor pickguard, and came with black [...] "speed" [...] <b>knobs.</b> <b>Switch</b> tip color was alternately black or creme. The truss rod cover is unadorned, and the headstock overlay is the fibre material used on many contemporary Gibson models.|$|R
