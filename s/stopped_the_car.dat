5|$|Jack Brabham used BT19 {{again at}} the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, another high speed circuit. A second BT20 was {{completed}} at the Italian track and Brabham tried it in practice for the race, but decided to race his Old Nail, which he felt was fitted with a stronger engine. As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early on, but an oil leakage <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> but Doggett {{points out that}} it would have required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing a similar problem with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E

Offord placed them on-top of his car in order to find his car keys, and proceeded to drive away, forgetting about the tapes. They <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to find the tapes had slid off and fell on the road, causing Anderson to rush back and stop an oncoming bus to save them.|$|E
25|$|After a short while, Nyfløt <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and {{informed}} {{her that he}} was being paid by a third-person to have her taken and that he was to be paid NOK 100.000 for the crime. He also promised not to harm her, before continuing the drive. Ashraf then passed that information, along with a short description of her kidnapper, to the police, who were trying to trace the call. She also provided the police with the identity of Khan, whom she deduced had ordered her kidnapping. Khan had {{for the past five years}} been obsessed with marrying her, and according to Ashraf, harassed and tormented her during this period.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian Building {{featured}} {{innovations in}} both design and technology. The building's designer, Wirt Rowland, specified Monel metal {{in place of}} the commonly used brass and bronze for all exposed metalwork on the building, an innovation which was widely adopted, most notably on New York's Chrysler Building. Rowland dispensed with traditional forms of decoration, using instead colored materials (brick, stone, and terra cotta) set in geometric patterns on both the interior and exterior of the structure. The building's elevator system represented the first use of technology which automatically <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> level with the floor and opened the doors, tasks formerly handled by the operator.|$|E

25|$|At the Rally d'Italia Sardegna, Loeb had a {{puncture}} {{after going}} {{off the road}} and dropped from third to fourth. Although he passed Petter Solberg for the final podium spot, he still finished fourth due to a time penalty for a safety rule violation; co-driver Daniel Elena had unfastened his safety belts before the crew <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> for a tyre change. At the Acropolis Rally, Loeb crashed out from third place. On Rally Poland's return to the WRC, Loeb had another crash but he continued in the event under superally rules. After team orders issued for the Citroën Junior Team drivers and a late mistake by Ford's Jari-Matti Latvala, Loeb found himself seventh but had lost the championship lead to Hirvonen by one point.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Glasgow Airport {{attack was}} a {{terrorist}} ramming attack which occurred on 30 June 2007, at 15:11 BST, when a dark green Jeep Cherokee loaded with propane canisters was driven at the glass doors of the Glasgow Airport terminal and set ablaze. It was the first terrorist attack {{to take place in}} Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. The attack took place three days after the appointment of Scottish MP Gordon Brown as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A close link was quickly established to the 2007 London car bombs the previous day. Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.|$|E
500|$|Although {{regarded}} by its designer as a [...] "lash-up", BT19 {{had a very}} successful Formula One racing career, almost entirely {{in the hands of}} Jack Brabham. BT19 was entered in several non-championship Formula One races before the beginning of the 1966 world championship season. At the non-championship South African Grand Prix at East London on 1 January, BT19 was the only new 3-litre car present. It recorded the fastest time in the qualifying session before the race – therefore taking pole position {{for the start of the}} race – and led the majority of the event before the fuel injection pump seized. Similar problems <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on the second lap of the Syracuse Grand Prix in Sicily, but at the International Trophy at the Silverstone circuit, Brabham set pole position, a new lap record, and led the whole race to win ahead of 1964 champion John Surtees in a 3-litre works Ferrari.|$|E

500|$|Martin {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fifth win of the season, and his first at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, in front of 101,000 who attended the race. Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on the apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed {{him out of the}} way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you need to make sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack. I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} {{that the first}} assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and {{decided to move to}} a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the Latin Bridge. At this point the Archdukes' motorcade turned off the Appel Quay, mistakenly following the original route which would have taken them to the National Museum. Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the second vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to reverse and take the Quay to the hospital. Driver Lojka <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> close to where Princip was standing, prior to backing up. The latter stepped forward and fired two shots from a distance of about one and a half metres (5 feet) using a Belgian-made 9×17mm (.380 ACP) Fabrique Nationale model 1910 semi-automatic pistol. Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074. According to Albertini, [...] "the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the jugular vein, the second inflicted an abdominal wound on the Duchess." [...] Princip was immediately arrested. [...] At his sentencing, Princip stated that his intention had been to kill Governor Potiorek, rather than Sophie.|$|E

Burcombe led McIlwaine away from the vehicle; as they were walking downhill, Burcombe informed McIlwaine that the other two men were going to [...] "give Andrew Robb a beating for slabbering about Richard Jameson. Don't worry about it, it's {{nothing to do with}} you". Brown and Dillon proceeded to attack Robb with a series of savage kicks. He was then stabbed deeply in the abdomen and throat, and died instantly. He also sustained wounds and gashes to his face and head.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, Rose {{began to}} fondle the girl, as Fred {{questioned}} {{as to whether}} she had engaged in sex with her boyfriend that evening. When Owens began to protest, Fred <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> referred to Owens as a [...] "bitch", and punched her into unconsciousness before he and Rose bound and gagged the girl with a scarf and duct tape. In her subsequent statement to police, Owens stated that, at Cromwell Street, she was given a drugged cup of tea to drink, then again gagged and subjected to a prolonged sexual assault from both individuals. At one stage, Fred remarked that Owens' clitoris was unusual before proceeding to lash her genitals with a leather belt. When Owens screamed, Rose again smothered her with a pillow and further restrained her about the neck, before proceeding to perform cunnilingus upon the girl. Quickly realising the gravity of her situation, Owens ceased resisting their sexual assaults.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, 1978, Washington, D.C. police detectives {{received}} {{a tip from}} a reliable source describing a man known as [...] "Bandit" [...] who was selling illegal narcotics stored {{in the trunk of}} his car. The informant gave the location of the car and a description of both car and driver. The detectives discovered the parked car, and called for a computer check on the car, which confirmed that the car's owner matched the description and used the alias [...] "Bandit". Shortly thereafter they observed the car being driven by a man matching the description. They <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and ordered the driver out. After noticing a bullet on the front seat, they searched the glove compartment and discovered a pistol, at which point they arrested the driver, identified as Albert Ross. A detective then opened the trunk and discovered a closed brown paper bag. He opened the bag and found numerous bags containing white powder, which were later identified as heroin. During a later search, they also found and opened a zippered red leather pouch, which contained $3,200 in cash. No warrant was obtained for these searches.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2003, Vikernes was {{transferred}} from a maximum-security prison in Bergen to the low-security prison in Tønsberg. On 15 October, the local paper, Tønsbergs Blad, {{published an article}} that criticised Vikernes. On 26 October, Vikernes went on the run after being granted a short leave. He stopped a car in Numedal. Inside it was a family of three, {{who said that he}} hijacked the car at gunpoint. About 19 hours later, police <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in Romerike and arrested him. The car contained knives, a gas mask, camouflage clothing, a portable GPS navigator, maps, a compass, a laptop and a mobile phone. Police also found a handgun and an AG3 automatic rifle in a cabin in Rollag, where Vikernes had hidden during his escape. They concluded that his escape [...] "was well planned and involved assistance from several people on the outside". Before the escape, Vikernes gave his mother a letter. In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published. For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes' sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004 he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in Tromsø Prison.|$|E
