If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> and cause the formation of deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
25|$|The <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> (also {{hypodermis}} and subcutis) is {{not part}} of the skin, and lies below the dermis of the cutis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes (<b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture is the {{insertion}} of needles into superficial structures of the body (skin, <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue,</b> muscles) – usually at acupuncture points (acupoints) – and their subsequent manipulation; this aims at influencing the flow of qi.

25|$|Antibiotic {{prophylaxis}} is {{used before}} an incision. The uterus is incised, and this incision is extended with blunt pressure along a cephalad-caudad axis. The infant is delivered, and the placenta is then removed. The surgeon then {{makes a decision}} about uterine exteriorization. Single-layer uterine closure is used when the mother does not want a future pregnancy. When <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> is 2cm thick or more, surgical suture is used. Discouraged practices include manual cervical dilation, any subcutaneous drain, or supplemental oxygen therapy with intent to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|Stage III: Full {{thickness}} tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may {{be visible}} but bone, tendon or muscle are not exposed. Slough {{may be present}} but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a stage III pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> and stage III ulcers can be shallow. In contrast, areas of significant adiposity can develop extremely deep stage III pressure ulcers. Bone/tendon is not visible or directly palpable.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, when a {{blood vessel}} is {{punctured}} during the tattooing procedure a hematoma (bruise) may appear. Bruises generally heal within one week. Bruises can appear as halos around a tattoo, or, if blood pools, as one larger bruise. This bluish or dark blurry halo that surrounds a tattoo {{can also be}} attributed to ink diffusion or 'blow-out'. Commonly mistaken for a hematoma, this discolouration occurs when tattoo pigments spread out into the <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> beneath the dermal skin layer, and {{may be caused by}} ink being deposited too deep in the skin.|$|E
25|$|Stage IV: Full {{thickness}} tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may {{be present}} on {{some parts of the}} wound bed. Often include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a stage IV pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> and these ulcers can be shallow. Stage IV ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g., fascia, tendon or joint capsule) making osteomyelitis likely to occur. Exposed bone/tendon is visible or directly palpable. In 2012, the NPUAP stated that pressure ulcers with exposed cartilage are also classified as a stage IV.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with HGPS {{typically}} appear normal at birth, {{but their}} growth is severely retarded, resulting in short stature, {{a very low}} body weight and delayed tooth eruption. Their facial/cranial proportions and facial features are abnormal, characterized by larger-than-normal eyes, a thin, beaked nose, thin lips, small chin and jaw (micrognathia), protruding ears, scalp hair, eyebrows, and lashes, hair loss, large head, large fontanelle and generally appearing aged. Other features include skeletal alterations (osteolysis, osteoporosis), amyotrophy (wasting of muscle), lipodystrophy and skin atrophy (loss of <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> and fat) with sclerodermatous focal lesions, severe atherosclerosis and prominent scalp veins. However, the level of cognitive function, motor skills, and risk of developing cancer is not affected significantly.|$|E

25|$|Case Study: One {{veterinarian}} {{reported that}} a dog was presented with a severe edema of the muzzle and several maxillary fractures of unknown cause. The maxilla was wired and the dog sent home. Four days later the owner noticed that skin and <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> appeared to be sloughing, so the veterinarian was again consulted. On closer examination, some of the teeth {{were found to be}} fractured and rotting and therefore, extracted. At this point, maggots were observed throughout the injured area, and the veterinarian took several radiographs. The radiographs indicated that almost 100 pieces of lead buckshot were present throughout the area. In this case, the presence of the maggots alerted the veterinarian to the more serious nature of the injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of infection in definitive host {{is divided into}} two phases: the parenchymal (migratory) phase and the biliary phase. The parenchymal phase begins when excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the intestinal wall. After the penetration of the intestine, flukes migrate within the abdominal cavity and penetrate the liver or other organs. F. hepatica has a strong predilection for the tissues of the liver. Occasionally, ectopic locations of flukes such as the lungs, diaphragm, intestinal wall, kidneys, and <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue</b> can occur. During the migration of flukes, tissues are mechanically destroyed and inflammation appears around migratory tracks of flukes. The second phase (the biliary phase) begins when parasites enter the biliary ducts of the liver. In biliary ducts, flukes mature, feed on blood, and produce eggs. Hypertrophy of biliar ducts associated with obstruction of the lumen occurs as a result of tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|A contusion, {{commonly}} known as a bruise, {{is a type of}} hematoma of tissue in which capillaries and sometimes venules are damaged by trauma, allowing blood to seep, hemorrhage, or extravasate into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Bruises, which do not blanch under pressure, can involve capillaries at the level of skin, <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue,</b> muscle, or bone. Bruises are {{not to be confused with}} other similar-looking lesions primarily distinguished by their diameter or causation. These lesions include petechia (< 3nbsp&mm result from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus), purpura (3nbsp&mm to 1nbsp&cm, classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia), and ecchymosis (>1nbsp&cm caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as periorbital ecchymosis, e.g.,"raccoon eyes", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The null {{hypothesis}} for {{this investigation was}} that {{there was no difference in}} the frequency ofwound disruption between women who had their <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissues</b> approximated with suture and those who did not during cesarean section. Methods: During alternating months, consecutive women delivered by cesarean section either did (N 716) or did not (N 693) have their <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissues</b> closed with suture. All data were analyzed using chi square, Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact probability test, analysis of variance, or logistic regression. Results: A 32 % decrease in the frequency of wound disruption was observed when <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissues</b> were brought into apposition with suture at cesarean section (P 0. 03). Conclusions: Closure of Scarpa’s and Camper’s fascia with suture during cesarean section significantly decreased the frequency of wound disruption in this population. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>tissue.</b> As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E

It is shown that parameters such as time and the characteristic relaxation time of self-oxygen content in the intercellular fluid, characterize the functional state of the body.
