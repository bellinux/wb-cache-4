5|$|When 1925 arrived – {{five years}} after the ACLU was formed – the {{organization}} had virtually no success to show for its efforts. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded John T. <b>Scopes</b> to defy Tennessee's anti-evolution law in The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas <b>Scopes.</b> Clarence Darrow, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by William Jennings Bryan, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school. The ACLU lost the case and <b>Scopes</b> was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{after the}} <b>Scopes</b> and Dennett victories, Baldwin {{perceived}} {{that there was}} vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States. Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, African American rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties. The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.|$|E

5000|$|Local {{variables}} {{may have}} a lexical or dynamic <b>scope,</b> though lexical (static) <b>scoping</b> is far more common. In lexical <b>scoping</b> (or lexical scope; also called static <b>scoping</b> or static <b>scope),</b> if a variable name's <b>scope</b> is a certain block, then its <b>scope</b> is the program text of the block definition: within that block's text, the variable name exists, and is bound to the variable's value, but outside that block's text, the variable name does not exist. By contrast, in dynamic <b>scoping</b> (or dynamic <b>scope),</b> if a variable name's <b>scope</b> is a certain block, then its <b>scope</b> is that block and all functions transitively called by that block (except when overridden again by another declaration); after the block ends, the variable name does not exist. Some languages, like Perl and Common Lisp, allow the programmer to choose static or dynamic <b>scoping</b> when defining or redefining a variable. Examples of languages that use dynamic <b>scoping</b> include Logo, Emacs lisp, and the shell languages bash, dash, and the MirBSD Korn shell (mksh)'s [...] "local" [...] declaration. Most other languages provide lexically <b>scoped</b> local variables.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Scopes</b> {{trial was}} a phenomenal public {{relations}} {{success for the}} ACLU. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major U.S. newspaper.

5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as <b>scopes</b> and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E

50|$|In project management, {{the term}} <b>scope</b> has two {{distinct}} uses: Project <b>Scope</b> and Product <b>Scope.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another very {{important}} concept within {{this method is}} <b>scope</b> management. The <b>scope</b> needs to be managed throughout the project to prevent <b>scope</b> creeping which results in delays. The <b>scope</b> will be determined early and changes to the <b>scope</b> (like adding additional features which were at first considered beyond the <b>scope</b> of the project) will be evaluated and either accepted or rejected. Changes in the <b>scope</b> can be made but this will always be affected by trade offs between features, resources and time.|$|R
5|$|Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging {{quantities}} to tiny <b>scopes.</b> For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which {{sound pressure}} {{is a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithm}} in seventeenth century Europe is {{the discovery of}} a new function that extended the realm of analysis beyond the scope of algebraic methods. The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms). Prior to Napier's invention, there had been other techniques of similar <b>scopes,</b> such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with <b>Scopes</b> Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow {{on whether or not}} {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E
5000|$|In dynamic <b>scoping,</b> if a {{programmer}} declares a variable within the <b>scope</b> of a function, {{it is available}} to subroutines called from within that function. Originally, this was intended as an optimization; lexical <b>scoping</b> was still uncommon and of uncertain performance. [...] "I asked RMS when he was implementing emacs lisp why it was dynamically <b>scoped</b> and his exact reply was that lexical <b>scope</b> was too inefficient." [...] Dynamic <b>scoping</b> was also meant to provide greater flexibility for user customizations. However, dynamic <b>scoping</b> has several disadvantages. Firstly, it can easily lead to bugs in large programs, due to unintended interactions between variables in different functions. Secondly, accessing variables under dynamic <b>scoping</b> is generally slower than under lexical <b>scoping.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{three of}} these {{categories}} {{can be related to}} cognition when considering the construct of cognitive <b>scope.</b> Initially, it was thought that positive affects broadened cognitive <b>scope</b> whereas negative affects narrowed cognitive <b>scope.</b> However, evidence now suggests that affects high in motivational intensity narrow cognitive <b>scope</b> whereas affects low in motivational intensity broaden cognitive <b>scope.</b> The cognitive <b>scope</b> has indeed proven to be a valuable construct in cognitive psychology.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scope</b> is an {{important}} component of name resolution, which is in turn fundamental to language semantics. Name resolution (including <b>scope)</b> varies between programming languages, and within a programming language, varies by type of entity; the rules for <b>scope</b> are called <b>scope</b> rules or <b>scoping</b> rules. Together with namespaces, <b>scoping</b> rules are crucial in modular programming, so a change {{in one part of the}} program does not break an unrelated part.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s <b>Scopes</b> Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues of {{separation of church and state}} and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man. When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon {{in most of}} the first half of the 20th century. The <b>Scopes</b> Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's <b>scopes</b> and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic <b>scopes</b> than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited <b>scopes</b> of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range <b>scopes.</b> Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Scoping</b> reviews {{are used}} to {{identify}} knowledge gaps, set research agendas, and identify implications for decision-making. The conduct and reporting of <b>scoping</b> reviews is inconsistent in the literature. We conducted a <b>scoping</b> review to identify: papers that utilized and/or described <b>scoping</b> review methods; guidelines for reporting <b>scoping</b> reviews; and studies that assessed the quality of reporting of <b>scoping</b> reviews. Methods We searched nine electronic databases for published and unpublished literature <b>scoping</b> review papers, <b>scoping</b> review methodology, and reporting guidance for <b>scoping</b> reviews. Two independent reviewers screened citations for inclusion. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Quantitative (e. g. frequencies of methods) and qualitative (i. e. content analysis of the methods) syntheses were conducted. Results After searching 1525 citations and 874 full-text papers, 516 articles were included, of which 494 were <b>scoping</b> reviews. The 494 <b>scoping</b> reviews were disseminated between 1999 and 2014, with 45  % published after 2012. Most of the <b>scoping</b> reviews were conducted in North America (53  %) or Europe (38  %), and reported a public source of funding (64  %). The number of studies included in the <b>scoping</b> reviews ranged from 1 to 2600 (mean of 118). Using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology guidance for <b>scoping</b> reviews, only 13  % of the <b>scoping</b> reviews reported {{the use of a}} protocol, 36  % used two reviewers for selecting citations for inclusion, 29  % used two reviewers for full-text screening, 30  % used two reviewers for data charting, and 43  % used a pre-defined charting form. In most cases, the results of the <b>scoping</b> review were used to identify evidence gaps (85  %), provide recommendations for future research (84  %), or identify strengths and limitations (69  %). We did not identify any guidelines for reporting <b>scoping</b> reviews or studies that assessed the quality of <b>scoping</b> review reporting. Conclusion The number of <b>scoping</b> reviews conducted per year has steadily increased since 2012. <b>Scoping</b> reviews {{are used to}} inform research agendas and identify implications for policy or practice. As such, improvements in reporting and conduct are imperative. Further research on <b>scoping</b> review methodology is warranted, and in particular, there is need for a guideline to standardize reporting...|$|R
5000|$|JavaScript has lexical <b>scoping</b> nested at the {{function}} level, {{with the global}} <b>scope</b> being the outermost <b>scope.</b> This <b>scoping</b> is used for both variables and for functions (meaning function declarations, as opposed to variables of function type).

50|$|In lexical <b>scoping</b> (or lexical scope; {{also called}} static <b>scoping</b> or static <b>scope),</b> if a {{variable}} name's <b>scope</b> {{is a certain}} function, then its <b>scope</b> is the program text of the function definition: within that text, the variable name exists, and is bound to the variable's value, but outside that text, the variable name does not exist.
