40|$|Pain {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem {{affecting}} 1. 5 billion people. More Americans suffer from chronic pain than from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined (Institute on Medicine Report, 2011). Opioid analgesics that target the μ-Opioid Receptor (MOR), such as morphine or oxycodone, are the primary treatment options for chronic pain. These MOR agonists are initially effective, but have extreme adverse effects, lose their efficacy over time, and lead to dependence and addiction. Therefore, identifying alternative targets for pain remediation is of extreme significance. The δ-Opioid Receptor (DOR) is a highly attractive alternate target. DOR activates similar cellular pathways as MOR, and can mediate attenuation of pain under specific experimental conditions. However, in the clinical context, DOR agonists have been minimally effective as an analgesic target, and the precise {{reason for this is}} not clear. I hypothesize that DOR agonists have limited analgesic efficacy because of the decreased delivery of DOR to the plasma membrane in neurons. In neurons, newly synthesized DOR is retained in intracellular compartments, and may require specific signals for release from intracellular stores and insertion into the cell membrane. Recent data have localized DOR within subsets of neurons that mediate modalities of pain similarly to MOR, increasing the potential impact of targeting DOR agonists. However, the clinical inefficacy of DOR agonists, and the significance of DOR’s regulated <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking,</b> are topics of debate. This thesis will investigate the mechanism controlling the regulated <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of DOR in neuronal cells {{in order to determine the}} mechanism of DOR retention, and subsequently reverse the retention to induce DOR <b>trafficking</b> to the <b>surface.</b> Chapter 2 studies the mechanism controlling <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of DOR, and shows that a phosphoinositide-regulated Golgi checkpoint regulates the bioavailability of δ-opioid receptors. Chapter 3 elaborates on the phosphoinositide-regulated Golgi checkpoint controlling DOR trafficking, and demonstrates that optogenetic recruitment of PI 3 K C 2 α to the trans-Golgi network is sufficient to promote <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of the δ-opioid receptor. Chapter 4 explores the amino acid sequence required for Golgi retention of DOR, and reveals that NGF-induced golgi retention of δ-Opioid receptors requires dual RXR retention/retrieval motifs. Chapter 5 investigates the role of the Rho-associated GTPase TC 10 in DOR <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking,</b> and shows that TC 10 GTP is sufficient to drive constitutive <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of the δ-Opioid receptor. Together, the data presented in this thesis reveal a novel mechanism for the regulated delivery of δ-opioid receptors to the cell surface, and demonstrate a proof of principle for induced trafficking of DOR to provide analgesic benefits under circumstances of chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe most {{prevalent}} disease-causing mutation of CFTR is the deletion of Phe 508 (ΔF 508), {{which leads to}} defects in conventional Golgi-mediated exocytosis and cell surface expression. We report that ΔF 508 -CFTR surface expression can be rescued in vitro and in vivo by directing it to an unconventional GRASP-dependent secretion pathway. An integrated molecular and physiological analysis indicates that mechanisms associated with ER stress induce cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of the ER core-glycosylated wild-type and ΔF 508 -CFTR via the GRASP-dependent pathway. Phosphorylation of a specific site of GRASP and the PDZ-based interaction between GRASP and CFTR are critical for this unconventional <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Remarkably, transgenic expression of GRASP in ΔF 508 -CFTR mice restores CFTR function and rescues mouse survival without apparent toxicity.

However, {{little is known about}} the relative abundance of different ASIC subunits in the brain. Such data are fundamental for interpreting the relative contribution of ASIC 1 a homomers and 1 a/ 2 heteromers to acid signaling, and essential for designing therapeutic interventions to target these channels. We used a simple biochemical approach and semi-quantitatively determined the molar ratio of ASIC 1 a and 2 subunits in mouse brain. Further, we investigated differential <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of ASIC 1 a, ASIC 2 a, and ASIC 2 b. Results and conclusions: ASIC 1 a subunits outnumber the sum of ASIC 2 a and ASIC 2 b. There is a region-specific variation in ASIC 2 a and 2 b expression, with cerebellum and striatum expressing predominantly 2 b and 2 a, respectively. Further, we performed surface biotinylation and found that surface ASIC 1 a and ASIC 2 a ratio correlates with their total expression. In contrast, ASIC 2 b exhibits little surface presence in the brain. This result is consistent with increased co-localization of ASIC 2 b with an ER marker in 3 T 3 cells. Our data are the first semi-quantitative determination of relative subunit ratio of various ASICs in the brain. The differential <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of ASICs suggests that the main functional ASICs in the brain are ASIC 1 a homomers and 1 a/ 2 a heteromers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{activity}} of potassium (K+) channels critically {{depends on their}} density on the cell surface membrane, which is regulated by dynamic protein–protein interactions that often involve distinct trafficking signals on the cargo proteins. In this paper we explored the possibility of utilizing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain B 31 for identification of the signal motifs that regulate surface expression of membrane proteins and for studying structure–function relationships of K+ channels. B 31 cells lack the K+ efflux system and were reported to show overloaded K+-mediated growth inhibition in high K+ media upon heterologous expression of a mammalian inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir 2. 1). We show that while the expression of wild-type Kir 2. 1 channel inhibits the growth of B 31 cells in high K+ media, the human disease-causing mutations of Kir 2. 1 that abolish K+ conduction (V 302 M) or <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> (Δ 314 / 315) fully restores the growth. The expression of two-pore-domain K+ channel KCNK 3 or KCNK 9 also inhibited the growth of B 31 in high K+ media while C-terminal mutations that reduce their 14 - 3 - 3 protein-dependent cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> restored the growth of B 31. Finally, the expression of Kir 2. 1 channels that were C-terminally fused with known sequence motifs including ER retention/retrieval signals and an endocytosis signal allowed the growth of B 31 in high K+ media. These results demonstrate the potential of B 31 yeast strain as a unique biological tool to screen the random peptide libraries for novel sequence signals that down-regulate surface expression of membrane proteins, {{as well as to}} systematically identify the structural determinants for cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> and/or ion conductance of K+ channels...|$|R

To elucidate how different steps of GPCR biosynthesis work together, we investigated {{the process of}} membrane topology determination and how {{it relates to the}} acquisition of cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> competence in human GPR 34. By monitoring a fused FLAG-tag and a conformation-sensitive native epitope during the expression of GPR 34 mutant panel, a tri-basic motif in the first intracellular loop was identified as the key topogenic signal that dictates the orientation of transmembrane domain- 1 (TM 1). Charge disruption of the motif perturbed topogenic processes and resulted in the conformational epitope loss, post-translational processing alteration, and trafficking arrest in the Golgi. The placement of a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence as a surrogate topogenic determinant overcame the effects of tri-basic motif mutations and rectified the TM 1 orientation; thereby restored the conformational epitope, post-translational modifications, and cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> altogether. Progressive N-tail truncation and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a proline-rich segment of the N-tail and all four cysteines individually located in the four separate extracellular regions must simultaneously reside in the ER lumen to muster the conformational epitope. Oxidation of all four cysteines was necessary for the epitope formation, but the cysteine residues themselves were not required for the trafficking event. The underlying biochemical properties of the conformational epitope was therefore the key to understand mechanistic processes propelled by positive-inside rule that simultaneously regulate the topogenesis and intracellular trafficking of GPR 34...|$|R

NIS is expressed in the lactating mammary gland and in many human breast tumors, raising interest in similar use for diagnosis and treatment. However, few human breast tumors have clinically evident iodide uptake ability. We previously identified PI 3 K signaling as important in NIS upregulation in transgenic mouse models of breast cancer, and the PI 3 K pathway is commonly activated in human breast cancer. Methods NIS expression, subcellular localization, and function were analyzed in MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells and MCF- 7 cells stably or transiently expressing PI 3 K p 110 alpha subunit using Western blot of whole cell lysate, cell surface biotinylation Western blot and immunofluorescence, and radioiodide uptake assay, respectively. NIS localization was determined in a human breast cancer tissue microarray using immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and was correlated with pre-existing pAkt IHC data. Statistical analysis consisted of Student's t-test (in vitro studies) or Fisher's Exact Test (in vivo correlational studies). Results In this study, we demonstrate that PI 3 K activation in MCF- 7 human mammary carcinoma cells leads to expression of underglycosylated NIS lacking cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> necessary for iodide uptake ability. PI 3 K activation also appears to interfere with cell <b>surface</b> <b>trafficking</b> of exogenous NIS as well as all-trans retinoic acid-induced endogenous NIS.

Conclusion Thus, the PI 3 K pathway likely {{plays a major role in}} the discordance between NIS expression and iodide uptake in breast cancer patients.
