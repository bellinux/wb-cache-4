40|$|Many, if not most, student trombonists have perhaps {{had little}} or no {{previous}} experience with "extended techniques"-novel or unconventional modes of sound production. To address this deficiency of experience, this document sets forth a progressive sequence of descriptive explanations and <b>supplementary</b> <b>studies,</b> which are specifically designed to assist trombonists in mastering the particular extended techniques that will prepare them to perform three of the most popular late Twentieth-Century pieces for trombone that include extended techniques-Luciano Berio's Sequenza V, Folke Rabe's Basta, and Mark Phillips' T. Rex. Following the introductory chapter, the body of the document consists of three chapters, each of which deals with one of the three solos, presenting descriptive explanations of relevant extended techniques interspersed with performance commentary (solicited from prominent trombonists) and <b>supplementary</b> <b>studies</b> (composed by the author). The studies presented in each chapter are specifically geared toward mastering the extended techniques as they relate to the music of each particular solo. They are also especially focused toward learning the more difficult passages of music in each solo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{estimate}} {{the usefulness of}} bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of new fracture in osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Overview of Literature: The diagnosis of new fractrure in osteoporotic vertebral fractures requires simple X-ray and <b>supplementary</b> <b>studies.</b> Methods: We analyzed 87 vertebrae in 44 patients, who diagnosed with osteoporotic vertebral fractures using bone scan and MRI within 2 months interval between August 2001 and July 2008. We compared hot uptakes in bone scan with MRI findings such as new fractures, old fractures and degenerative lesions. Results: Hot uptakes in bone scan was matched to 48 new fractures, 26 old fractures and 13 degenerative lesions in MRI findings. It was 55 % of concordance between hot uptakes in bone scan and new fractures in MRI. The rate of new vertebral fractures confirmed by MRI according to 1 level hot uptakes in bone scan was 96 %, 2 levels was 50 % and 3 more levels was 36 %. Conclusions: The diagnosis of new fracture in osteoporotic vertebral fractures requires simple X-ray and <b>supplementary</b> <b>studies</b> such as bone scan and MRI.

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the federal {{transport}} infrastructure masterplan is to invest a predefined (projected) amount of money into the most beneficial projects. Based on project suggestions from the 16 states, railroad operators, and other stakeholders a cost benefit analysis (CBA) is conducted for potential projects, following a uniform approach for all modes of transport. Usually, the masterplan’s timeframe is 15  years. Therefore, a 15  year traffic forecast serves {{as a basis for}} conducting the CBA. In addition to the CBA, in some areas <b>supplementary</b> <b>studies</b> have to be prepared, analyzing effects which are difficult to valuate (e.g. some environmental aspects).|$|R
5000|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that under-reporting is an inherent problem with IPV irrespective of gender. For example, in England and Wales, the 1995 [...] "Home Office Research Study 191", carried {{out as a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>study</b> to the British Crime Survey, reported 6.6 million incidents of IPV in the previous twelve months, compared with the 987,000 incidents found by the Crime Survey. The difference in the two reports was that Study 191 was a questionnaire of a random representative sample of people, while the Crime Survey attained its figures from crime records, i.e. actual reported cases of IPV. Supplementary studies carried out in 2001 and from 2004 onwards have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of IPV (committed against both men and women) than the standard crime surveys. The 2010-2011 report found that whilst 27% of women who experienced IPV reported it to the police, only 10% of men did so, and whilst 44% of women reported to some professional organization, only 19% of men did so. In a 2005 report {{carried out by the}} National Crime Council in the Republic of Ireland, it was estimated that 5% of men who had experienced IPV had reported it to the authorities, compared to 29% of women.|$|E
