30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} {{ground pressure}} period, {{the relationship between}} the coal wall <b>spalling</b> ratio and face advance speed presented randomness. However, in general, the <b>spalling</b> ratio reduced with the increase of face advance speed. There were some differences in the <b>spalling</b> ratio at different face positions. The statistical analysis of the <b>spalling</b> ratio showed: the <b>spalling</b> ratio in the middle part of the face > the <b>spalling</b> ratio at {{the upper part of the}} face > the <b>spalling</b> ratio at the lower part of the face.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>spalling</b> {{is a major}} factor in determining the fire resistance of concrete constructions. The apparently random {{occurrence of}} <b>spalling</b> has limited the development and application of fire resistance modelling for concrete structures. This Thesis describes an experimental investigation into the <b>spalling</b> of concrete on exposure to elevated temperatures. It has been shown that <b>spalling</b> may be categorised into four distinct types, aggregate <b>spalling,</b> corner <b>spalling,</b> surface <b>spalling</b> and explosive <b>spalling.</b> Aggregate <b>spalling</b> {{has been found to be}} a form of shear failure of aggregates local to the heated surface. The susceptibility of any particular concrete to aggregate <b>spalling</b> can be quantified from parameters which include the coefficients of thermal expansion of both the aggregate and the surrounding mortar, the size and thermal diffusivity of the aggregate and the rate of heating. Corner <b>spalling,</b> which is particularly significant for the fire resistance of concrete columns, is a result of concrete losing its tensile strength at elevated temperatures. Surface <b>spalling</b> is the result of excessive pore pressures within heated concrete. An empirical model has been developed to allow quantification of the pore pressures and a material failure model proposed. The dominant parameters are rate of heating, pore saturation and concrete permeability. Surface <b>spalling</b> may be alleviated by limiting pore pressure development and a number of methods to this end have been evaluated. Explosive <b>spalling</b> involves the catastrophic failure of a concrete element and may be caused by either of two distinct mechanisms. In the first instance, excessive pore pressures can cause explosive <b>spalling,</b> although the effect is limited principally to unloaded or relatively small specimens. A second cause of explosive <b>spalling</b> is where the superimposition of thermally induced stresses on applied load stresses exceed the concrete's strength...|$|R
30|$|During {{the period}} of {{periodical}} ground pressure, the <b>spalling</b> depth presented a trend of decrease early on, and increasing later {{with the increase of}} face advance speed. The <b>spalling</b> length and ratio presented a trend of gradual reduction with the face advance speed. In the middle part of the face, the <b>spalling</b> depth was 0.6  m, maximum <b>spalling</b> ratio was 49.15  % and maximum <b>spalling</b> length was 50.75  %.|$|R

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{paper is}} {{a progress report}} on an analytical investigation into the implications of explosive <b>spalling</b> on the fire performance of reinforced concrete structural elements and whole structures. This study does not attempt to predict whether <b>spalling</b> will occur. For accurate prediction of the occurrence of <b>spalling</b> a complete and fully coupled hygro-thermal-mechanical (HTM) analysis is required, as described by {{a comprehensive review of}} current research into the parameters and mechanisms that influence <b>spalling,</b> including a review of physical <b>spalling</b> criteria. This paper describes the structural performance of <b>spalled</b> concrete elements, using finite element analysis where <b>spalling</b> is modelled by removing layers of concrete when a set of <b>spalling</b> criteria are met. The method is presented using a case study of a simply supported reinforced concrete beam, where the analytical results indicate that <b>spalling</b> invariably triggers an early failure (well short of the required FRR rating) of a beam exposed to the standard fire...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEffects of {{the fiber}} type, dosage and length on the {{explosive}} <b>spalling</b> of ultra-high-strength concrete under rapid heating and rapid cooling were experimentally investigated. The mechanism of <b>spalling</b> resistance was examined by comprehensive thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and mercury porosimetry. The burst time is extended but the <b>spalling</b> is unaffected {{by the addition of}} steel fiber. The <b>spalling</b> resistance is improved with the addition of polypropylene (PP) fiber or PP and steel fibers. Ultra-high-strength concrete with 0. 20 % (vol.) PP fiber has excellent <b>spalling</b> resistance. The resistance to explosive <b>spalling</b> is enhanced with 12 - or 19 -mm-long PP fibers. PP fiber improves the <b>spalling</b> resistance mainly through the formation of tubular channels...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  34, the {{periodical}} ground pressure has limited influence upon the coal wall <b>spalling</b> ratio at the No. 8105 face.

5|$|Millburn (Rafe <b>Spall)</b> is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still in his throat.|$|E

30|$|During {{the period}} of ground pressure, the <b>spalling</b> depth, <b>spalling</b> length and <b>spalling</b> ratio at {{the upper part of}} the face had a similar {{variation}} trendency with the increase of face advance speed, i.e., increase early and decrease later. When the face advance speed reached 5.50  m/d, the <b>spalling</b> ratio was the largest at {{the upper part of the}} face at 63.33  %.|$|R
30|$|Through the {{comparison}} of coal wall <b>spalling</b> with the neighbouring No. 8104 face, it was found that: {{during the period of}} non-periodical ground pressure occurring, the average coal wall <b>spalling</b> ratio was 33.08  % and the <b>spalling</b> depth varied from 0.2 to 0.3  m at the No. 8104 face; the average <b>spalling</b> ratio was 22.06  % and the <b>spalling</b> depth varied from 0.18 to 0.25  m at the No. 8105 face. During the period of periodical ground pressure, the <b>spalling</b> ratio was 36.18  % at the No. 8104 face, and 29.16  % at the No. 8105 face. Based on the statistical analysis, the <b>spalling</b> depth and length were the largest in the middle parts of the No. 8104 and No. 8105 faces. In comparison with the No. 8104 face, the <b>spalling</b> ratio at the No. 8105 face was 33.4  % less than that at the No. 8104 face, and the <b>spalling</b> depth was also 50  mm less than that at the No. 8104 face. Therefore, it can be concluded that the coal wall <b>spalling</b> was significantly reduced and the face achieved a fast advance speed due to the application of proposed comprehensive control technology at the No. 8105 face in Tashan coal mine in Datong, China, including controlling face advance speed, increasing support initial abutment force and increasing the wall protection capacity of support.|$|R
30|$|The {{face advance}} speed also {{significantly}} affected wall <b>spalling.</b> The observations at the No. 8105 coal face demonstrated {{that with the}} increase of face advance speed, there was a reduction of damage area around the coal wall, and a reduction of wall horizontal displacement. In other words, the <b>spalling</b> of coal wall was suppressed. It is therefore suggested that the face advance speed should be rationally increased to reduce the exposure time and <b>spalling</b> of coal wall. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of controlling coal wall <b>spalling</b> was limited through the increase of face advance speed. With a large amount of observations on site, the effect of increasing face advance speed on coal wall <b>spalling</b> was found. If the advance speed is too high, the coal <b>spalling</b> might increase.|$|R
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert <b>Spall.</b>|$|E

30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} pressure period, at {{the lower}} part of the face, the relationship between coal wall <b>spalling</b> and face advance speed showed a certain degree of randomness. When the face advance speed reached 2.4, 3.05, 5, 5.5 and 5.75  m/d, there was no <b>spalling</b> occurring. In general, the depth of coal wall <b>spalling</b> showed less variation with face advance speed {{at the lower}} part of the face, the average <b>spalling</b> depth concentrated within 0.3 – 0.4  m. With the increase of face advance speed, the <b>spalling</b> length and ratio showed a trend of decrease early, to increase at a later time.|$|R

40|$|<b>Spalling</b> {{in contact}} surface of rail {{is a typical}} form of rolling contact fatigue, which is a {{difficult}} problem to solve in railway. Once the <b>spalling</b> occurs in the rail, the wheel-rail dynamic interaction will become more severe. The wheel-rail dynamic interaction is investigated based on the theory of vehicle-track coupled dynamics in this paper, where the excitation modes of the rail <b>spalling</b> failure are taken into consideration for high-speed wheel-rail system. A modified excitation model of rail <b>spalling</b> failure is proposed. It can enable the investigations on two kinds of excitation modes in wheel-rail system due to the rail <b>spalling,</b> including the pulse and the harmonic excitation modes. The excitation mode can {{be determined by the}} ratio of the <b>spalling</b> length to its critical length. Thus, the characteristics of wheel-rail dynamic vibration excited by two kinds of excitation are simulated in detail. Consequently, the limited value of the <b>spalling</b> length is suggested for high-speed railway...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Spalling</b> {{phenomenon}} in concrete exposed to high temperatures, e. g. during a fire, can seriously jeopardize {{the integrity of}} a whole structure. <b>Spalling</b> risk analysis and evaluation has become the hot topic of research on fire-resistance behavior of concrete structures at present.

Good agreements between the results of <b>spalling</b> risk prediction and the fire test show the capability of the proposed model in assessing the <b>spalling</b> risk of concrete structures at high temperature, which will provide important reference for the fire resistance design of concrete structures...|$|R
