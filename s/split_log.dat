25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the <b>split</b> <b>log</b> rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|E

50|$|As better tools became {{available}} the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber {{of the native}} hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> rather than sawn timber. The technique employed {{for the construction of}} a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. <b>Split</b> <b>logs</b> that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.|$|R

50|$|The Heritage Tea Rooms are {{situated}} inside North Queensland's oldest building - a <b>split</b> <b>log</b> construction built circa 1865. Formerly {{known as the}} Eureka Hotel, the building has been restored to its former glory and remains standing {{as one of the}} countries few slab sided inn's. In the 1860s the inn provided a welcome respite for early travelers ascending the range via Thorntons Gap.|$|E
50|$|The church {{founded by}} Johns was Presbyterian {{and came to}} be called Big Caney Presbyterian Church. It was the only church in the valley. Johns built it out of <b>logs,</b> and <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> formed its pews.|$|R
50|$|A {{palisade}} {{church is}} a church building that is constructed with palisade walls, standing <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> of timber, rammed into the ground, set in gravel or resting on a sill. The palisade walls form {{an integral part of}} the load-bearing system.|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{appeared}} to be around the camp-fire, which was burning brightly {{in spite of the}} rain and wind. It was a well-sheltered spot, and in the rocks was a hollowed-out place, against which leaned some <b>split</b> <b>logs,</b> forming a rude shack.|$|R
5000|$|The King road drag (also {{known as}} the Missouri road drag and the <b>split</b> <b>log</b> road drag) was a road grader {{implement}} for grading dirt roads that revolutionized {{the maintenance of the}} dirt roads in the early 1900s. It was invented by David Ward King, who went by [...] "D. Ward King" [...] and who was a farmer whose farm was in Holt Township, near Maitland, Missouri.|$|E
50|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Pacific Northwest of North America also built a form of longhouse. Theirs were built with logs or split-log frame, and covered with <b>split</b> <b>log</b> planks, and sometimes an additional bark cover. Cedar is the preferred lumber. The length of these longhouses is usually 60 - 100 ft. The wealthy built extraordinarily large longhouses. The Suquamish Old Man House, at what became the Port Madison Indian Reservation, was 500 * 40 - 60 ft, c. 1850.|$|E
5000|$|The ferry {{was built}} by the family of Alphonso Boone (grandson of Daniel Boone) who, in 1846, claimed 1000 acreon and around present day Charbonneau which was {{on the main road}} between Oregon City and present day Butteville.The family cleared a path and laid a <b>split</b> <b>log</b> roadway north to Portland and south toward Salem. The ferry was {{propelled}} by oarsmen from the nearby Tuality Indian tribe. [...] Alphonso was adamant about operating the ferry 24 hours a day, which might have been related to a widespread illicit moonshine industry along the new road.|$|E

50|$|A simple log {{splitter}} may be powered by {{an electric motor}} driving a hydraulic pump or by gasoline or diesel engine {{with or without a}} tractor. The non-electric versions can be used remotely where the splitter can be moved to the location of the cut wood source. <b>Split</b> <b>logs</b> can then be loaded into trucks, trailers or bulk bags.|$|R
50|$|The one-story {{building}} {{is made of}} peeled logs and has a T-shaped plan with a shallow cross-gable roof. The logs are milled on two sides to provide level surfaces for stacking them. The logs retain round ends that extend a foot past the corners. A butt joint is used to join the logs at the corners. The gable ends have <b>split</b> <b>log</b> vertical siding applied over milled wood framing. The building's main section measures 20 by 36 feet. The kitchen and storeroom section, added {{on the back of}} the building in 1950, measure 10 by 24 feet.|$|E
50|$|The Little Pigeon Primitive Baptist Church, a Regular Baptists congregation, was {{established}} June 8, 1816 with 15 charter members. Thomas Lincoln, Abraham's father, {{helped build the}} cabin for the church in 1819, located south of present-day Lincoln City, Indiana {{and in the center}} of the community near a spring. The land was donated by Samuel Howell. The log meetinghouse, completed in 1822, had <b>split</b> <b>log</b> benches for its congregation. Attending church was a social event where the settlers could discuss family life events, farming, the weather, land titles, and other current events. The church building was also used as a school. A second church building was erected in 1879. The current church building, which has continued to conduct services, was erected in 1948. The church's cemetery, built in 1825, is the grave site of the communities settlers, including Abraham's sister, Sarah Lincoln Grigsby.|$|E
5000|$|The Esta Cabin encapsulates {{the history}} of the Loomhouse, and is the cabin where the song [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] was first sung. The cabin was first built by a Beoni Figg in 1870 as a {{business}} office for his charcoal, lumber, and quarries interests. It has been enlarged since then from a two-room cabin. One of these enhancements replaced the vertical <b>split</b> <b>log</b> siding with board and batten. In 1939 Lou Tate acquired the cabin and based her weaving business there, living on the property until her death in 1979. On a visit in the 1940s while still the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt crushed a floorboard, which she later signed; it is now lost. While visiting the Loomhouse, Mrs. Roosevelt bought woven mats that would see use in the White House. Displays of weaving decorate the interior.|$|E
50|$|When Reinhardt Academy {{opened in}} January 1884, student's convened {{in an old}} cabinet and wood shop located at the {{southern}} edge of Waleska. This original one-room frame structure had a huge fireplace at one end to keep the 30 or 40 original students warm as they sat on benches made of <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> supported by pine legs.|$|R
50|$|A shake {{is a basic}} wooden shingle {{made from}} <b>split</b> <b>logs.</b> Shakes have {{traditionally}} been used for roofing and siding applications around the world. Higher-grade shakes are typically used for roofing purposes, while the lower grades are used for siding. In either situation, properly installed shakes provide long-lasting weather protection and a rustic aesthetic, though they require more maintenance than some other more modern weatherproofing systems.|$|R
50|$|The bark is laid inside up {{directly}} onto the roof boards without any nails or other means of fastening. On roughly hewn or sawn roof boards, the friction alone will hold the layers of birch bark in place. They must, however, be weighted down with a heavier material {{to prevent them from}} curling or blowing away. Planks of <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> have been used, but sod has an additional advantage because it is a far better insulator.|$|R
5000|$|The early Scotch Irish {{settlers}} {{subscribed to}} raise the money to build a church at the settlement in 1786-87 for the Presbyterian congregation. The result was a log worship house, the Old Hartslog Church, erected upon the hill one mile north of the present site of the town of Alexandria, Pennsylvania. The surrounding church yard was used for a burial ground. The Rev. John Johnston was installed as pastor in November, 1787, and continued in that role until 1823. The first building was a primitive structure, without floor, with <b>split</b> <b>log</b> benches for the worshipers, and without heating facilities. In 1787 a floor was laid, six large windows set in, a large door constructed, and a pulpit and a communion table made. In 1794 it was laid off into four sections, and fitted with pews; which were rented. Each section was 120 square feet, from which we judge that the building was not more than 40 feet square.|$|E
50|$|The Hotel’s dining room, which {{included}} a <b>split</b> <b>log</b> mantled fireplace, became renowned for excellent food in an extraordinary setting. Up to the day it closed, it was known for serving {{some of the best}} home cooked meals in or near the park. It was decorated in a country style with ruffled curtains, red and white checkerboard tablecloths and split bottomed chairs. After dinner, many guests and visitors enjoyed a bowl of ice cream or home made cobbler on the porch for dessert. In {{the early days of the}} hotel, meals were included with your room which could be rented by the day, week, month, or 3-month season at a price of seventy-five cents per meal for adults or fifty cents for children. Three meals were offered per day, served family style. A number of the area residents would from time to time provide local wild game meat they would catch themselves to the hotel for meals. This included deer, bear, rabbit, wild turkey, quail, ruffled grouse and rattlesnake. Fresh fish caught from the river was found on the menu quite often.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1813 {{as part of the}} War of 1812, the Battle of Frenchtown {{occurred}} near the river. British and Native American troops under the command of British General Henry Procter and Native American chiefs Roundhead, Walks in Water, and <b>Split</b> <b>Log</b> were allied against a division of ill-trained Kentucky infantry and militia under command of General James Winchester. Cut off and surrounded and facing total slaughter, Winchester surrendered with British assurances of safety of the prisoners. The British marched those who could walk to Detroit. But the next day, many of the severely wounded prisoners left in Frenchtown were killed by the Native Americans allies of the British. The Massacre of the River Raisin became a rallying cry ("Remember the Raisin") particularly for Kentuckians. United States troops returned in the spring to drive the British from Michigan forever. The original battlefield was preserved for years as a county park in Monroe, Michigan and it has several monuments to the Kentucky soldiers who died there. On October 12, 2010, the land was transferred to the federal government. By Congressional authorization, it is now the only National Battlefield Park devoted to a battlefield of the War of 1812 - the River Raisin National Battlefield Park.|$|E

40|$|An oak timber was {{discovered}} in 2013 within intertidal peats at the Bay of Ireland, Stenness, Orkney, representing a unique archaeological find. Subsequent excavation and rescue of the timber took place in 2014 to investigate its stratigraphical relationship before further eroding. Dendrochronological and morphological study identified the timber as a possible radially <b>split</b> <b>log,</b> c. 150 years of age when felled. No dendrochronological match was possible, and a wiggle-match date obtained provided a Later Mesolithic felling date of 4410 – 4325 cal BC. This timber is {{the first and only}} evidence so far for the use of oak in Mesolithic Orkney. The timber is significant palaeoecologically, suggesting oak may have been indigenous to Orkney. This adds to a growing argument for the existence of areas of “true woodland”. Pollen evidence shows the timber was deposited within reedswamp, fringed by willow-birch carr-woodland, with oak unlikely to have been growing in the immediate location. High microscopic and macroscopic charcoal values indicate Later Mesolithic communities' exerted influence on this wetland using burning as a tool for landscape modification. It is unknown what the timber represents; it may have been for construction purposes or as a marker/possible landing place showing the path to the Loch of Stenness...|$|E
30|$|The daily MC loss {{decreased}} at decreasing {{rates as}} the log MC dropped. For instance, logs of E. globulus with bark would take 22, 26 and 35  days {{in order to}} reduce 20  % moisture content starting with and initial wood moisture content of 60, 55 and 50  % on a green basis, respectively (provided they are stacked in January). Log diameter also showed to have a strong influence on drying times, e.g. 20  % reductions in moisture content in 18  cm logs would take 22  days if stacked in January, and that time would almost double for 30  cm logs. A similar pattern was observed for E. nitens. This was also observed by Visser et al. (2014), for P. radiata logs, arguing that smaller diameter <b>logs</b> and <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> exhibit a larger surface area to mass ratio and a smaller distance water must move from the inner log to the surface in order to evaporate. Since wood-free water flows primarily along the stem evaporating form the log ends (Walker 2006), there must be a secondary movement across the stem if small diameter <b>logs,</b> large <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> and debarked logs dry faster than large whole logs (Abbot et al. 1997, Visser et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|In turn, {{the faster}} drying of debarked logs may {{illustrate}} {{the significance of}} radial water movements. While absorbed free water flows primarily along the stem and is expelled mainly from the log ends (Walker 2006), {{there must be a}} secondary movement across the stem if small diameter <b>logs</b> and large <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> dry better than large whole logs, as also reported by Abbot et al. (1997). Compared to large diameter whole logs, both small diameter <b>logs</b> and <b>split</b> <b>logs</b> offer a larger surface area to mass ratio and a smaller distance between the log centre and its surface, which water must reach in order to evaporate. Splitting may also accrue a possible benefit from exposing core wood and shortening the average path length that water has to move. For the same reasons, splitting may prove to be especially beneficial with long logs as the relative proportion of radial versus longitudinal drying increases. However, it is still uncertain whether the cost of splitting is offset by the benefit obtained through it. This is difficult to determine, because the cost of splitting may vary according to equipment and technique, and the benefits should include the higher heating value of the end product, as well as the different performance of the chipper when negotiating <b>split</b> or whole <b>logs.</b> A tentative calculation conducted for the actual trial would indicate a splitting cost of NZ$ 15 per tonne and a value increase at the end of storage equal to NZ$ 2.50 per tonne (Scion 2010), thus demonstrating the poor financial viability of <b>log</b> <b>splitting.</b> However, this calculation is based on a rather inefficient splitting technique, and does not account for the potentially superior performance obtained when chipping even-sized split material.|$|R
