He mastered this {{by the age of}} 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series.

40|$|This study explores whether social {{sensitivity}} influences children’s problem <b>solving</b> {{skills or}} learning after collaboration with a peer. Most {{research into the}} impact of collaborative problem <b>solving</b> on individual skills demonstrates that the problem <b>solving</b> skills an individual brings to the collaborative process are {{a key factor in}} predicting the presencelabsence of cognitive change. Only recently have other attributes and/or skills, such as social or interpersonal sensitivity, been considered within this framework. This study investigates whether interpersonal sensitivity contributes to differential outcomes in learning after collaborative problem <b>solving.</b> One hundred 8 -year-old children participated in a pre-test/collaboration/post-test design study where four groups based on pre-test problem <b>solving</b> ability (high/low) and pre-test social sensitivity scores (high/low) were constructed for the collaborative problem <b>solving</b> task. Low ability/high sensitivity children showed pre- to post-test improvement in their problem <b>solving</b> when paired with high ability children. Social sensitivity only predicted final problem <b>solving</b> in high sensitivity children.

5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to <b>solve</b> the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to <b>solve</b> the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or <b>solve</b> the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
