60|$|The Roberta, lying nearest to {{the wind}} at <b>slack</b> <b>chains,</b> was swept off {{broadside}} like a straw. Then her chains brought her up, bow on {{to the wind}}, with an astonishing jerk.

40|$|In a chain canveyor system, {{tensile force}} and <b>chain</b> <b>slack</b> have a {{significant}} effect on a material's vibration and transferring efficiency. Therefore it becomes an important problem for the chain conveyor to control tensile force and <b>chain</b> <b>slack,</b> Nowadays, most <b>chain</b> conveyor drive sprockets are driven by a motor, and the driven sprocket is controlled by a brake to give a moderate tensile force. However, it is difficult to adequately control the tensile force, because the brake has a tendency to influence the torque and revolution of the driving motor. We then developed a new driving system which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials and the other is an auxiliary motor which is used to control tensile force and <b>chain</b> <b>slack</b> without influencing torque and revolution of the main motor. In this report, we describe the performance of this system...|$|R
50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up <b>chain</b> <b>slack</b> caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, <b>slack</b> portion of <b>chain.</b> Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as chain tensioners for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust chain tension by a different method.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{different}} mooring configurations with <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> {{mooring lines}} of a floating point absorber are analyzed, with or without additional sinkers or floaters. The slack mooring cables are approximately modelled as catenary lines in a quasi-static analysis in a time-domain model {{that takes into account}} the non-linearities of the system introduced by the non linear mooring forces and that affect the motions of the converter. Numerical results for the motions, mooring demands and also absorbed power by the converter, are presented for the different mooring configurations, for a system consisting of a hemispherical buoy in regular waves and assuming a liner power take-off system...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have shown a}} link between oxidation and strength changes in single crystal silicon nanostructures but provided no clues as to the mechanisms leading to this relationship. Through a mix of atomic force microscope based fracture strength experiments, molecular dynamics modeling, and comparisons to past experiments we have show that the previously described strength decrease {{is a result of}} oxidation induced roughening of an initially flat silicon (1 1 1) surface and that this effect is transient. In a fully developed native oxide the Si-SiO 2 interface flattens. As a result the strength recovers with some indication that it becomes slightly stronger than in its initially hydrogen terminated state. Experimental results are corroborated by Brad Boyce at Sandia National Laboratories using a completely separate line of testing involving micro-scale, polysilicon devices and the <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> method. In addition, we demonstrate improvements to the calibration of the strength testing procedure, justify constitutive assumptions, and reduce overall uncertainty. Finally, we make an effort to extend the previous study of the effect of methyl monolayers on strength evolution of Si nanostructures by looking at more coating materials and longer time scales...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The report {{presents}} and analyses allocation methods for assigning limited resources to project tasks. The report is partitioned into five chapters beginning with an introductory chapter. Chapter 1 summarises {{the problem and}} describes the process followed in addressing the problem. A literature chapter covers the literature for the development {{and analysis of the}} methods presented in the report. Chapter three presents the allocation methods and discusses the role of the methods in single and multi-project resource allocation. Two commercial methods (Hu’s Algorithm; and Coffman’s and Munt’s Algorithm) along with a recipe for implementation are discussed. It is followed by the introduction and formulation of two additional methods that base their resource allocation on critical and least <b>slack</b> <b>chains</b> (Least <b>Slack</b> and Least Slack Ancestors First methods). A final method, based on locating the best possible solution, is presented and formulated (Best Fit method). A case study is presented in chapter four which is applied to each of the formulated methods in chapter three. Key metrics are derived and necessary compassions among the methods are performed. Chapter 4 concludes with an analysis of the comparisons. Finally Chapter five presents a conclusion to the report summarising the results of chapters three and four. Future recommendations are also discussed with the main emphasis on a possible investigation of a hybrid method stemming from the application and analysis in chapter four...|$|R
40|$|Most {{floating}} oscillating-body {{wave energy}} converters {{that have been}} proposed and developed so far are two-body systems where the power is extracted from the relative translational motion between the two bodies. As any floating device, floating point absorbers are subject to drift forces due to waves, currents and wind, and therefore need {{to be kept in}} place by a proper mooring system. The mooring cables can be approximately modelled as catenary lines in a quasi-static analysis. The use of a time-domain analysis allows for nonlinear mooring forces of <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> cables to be considered. Numerical results for motion, mooring tensions and absorbed power are presented for a two body system consisting of a hemispherical floater and a submerged body and slack bottom moorings, for regular and irregular waves. Comparisons are given with the unmoored two-body heaving system, the moored heaving twobody system and with the simplified one body linear PTO model. Results show the possibility of occurrence of low-frequency horizontal oscillations of large amplitude, and non linear motions, even for regular waves. Some differences are seen in comparison with the simplified one body model and with the heave two-body system. The moorings were found not to affect very significantly the power absorbed...|$|E

60|$|Under the engine, going {{full speed}} ahead, the Malahini behaved better. While she {{continued}} to ship seas over her bow, she was not jerked down so fiercely by her anchors.

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce <b>chain</b> <b>slack,</b> which {{would interfere with}} braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|R

50|$|All for One: The {{players were}} taken to an {{abandoned}} train station, and were chained together {{to the outside of}} a barred cell by their ankles. Across from them was another cell which held the key to their chains, and would open once every ten minutes. By leaning against the bars they were chained to, the players could allow enough <b>slack</b> in the <b>chain</b> for one of them to reach the key.|$|R
50|$|Some systems combine {{internally}} geared hubs {{with external}} derailleurs. A freewheeling hub with a sprocket suitable for narrow chain {{can be combined}} with a double or triple crankset and front derailleur, {{in order to provide}} a wider range and closer gear ratio spacing. A chain tensioner or a rear derailleur is needed to take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack,</b> and care is needed not to over-torque the hub by using too small a chainring/sprocket ratio.|$|R

50|$|Another method uses an {{eccentric}} mechanism {{either in the}} bottom bracket or in the rear hub. If neither of these are an option, when working with an existing frame not originally designed for single-speed use for example, some kind of idler pulley, such as the Surly Singleatoror simply a short cage rear derailleur {{can be used to}} take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> As well, finetuning the combination of chainring, cog, and chain length may suffice until the chain develops significant wear.|$|R

40|$|We {{described}} in the previous report a new transfer mechanism which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials {{and the other is}} an auxiliary motor for controlling tensile force and <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> But, when we use generally conveying system it can be foreseen that vibration often occures by the outer load and the performances decrease. So to decrease the vibration, we investigate the controlling method to hold constant the tensile force of chain and improve the efficiency. In this report, we use modern control theory for the hybrid type transfer mechanism and discuss the performance of controlling system...|$|R
60|$|A breeze was coming. The {{ship that}} had been lying tide-rode swung to a heavier puff; and {{suddenly}} the <b>slack</b> of the <b>chain</b> cable between the windlass and the hawse-pipe clinked, slipped forward an inch, and rose gently off the deck with a startling suggestion as of unsuspected life {{that had been}} lurking stealthily in the iron. In the hawse-pipe the grinding links sent through the ship {{a sound like a}} low groan of a man sighing under a burden. The strain came on the windlass, the chain tautened like a string, vibrated--and the handle of the screw-brake moved in slight jerks. Singleton stepped forward.|$|R

Afire with indignation as I was at the outrage that had been perpetrated on me and my forefathers, I was nevertheless too prosaically practical to lose my head over it. This was all new to me. Thirty days of mystery were before me, and I looked about me to find somebody who knew the ropes. For I had already learned that I was not bound for a petty jail with {{a hundred or so}} prisoners in it, but for a full-grown penitentiary with a couple of thousand prisoners in it, doing anywhere from ten days to ten years.|$|R
50|$|The Rowbike brand uses a {{standard}} bicycle chain, rear gears, and derailleur. The chain does not travel in a loop, {{as is the}} case with {{a standard}} bicycle. It moves back and forth over the rear cog in a reciprocating motion. The chain is connected at one end to the frame of the rowbike and to a bungee cord on the other. As the rower pulls back the chain engages the rear cog and the bungee cord is extended, and when the rower returns forward the bungee cord contracts, pulling the chain back and ensuring there is no <b>slack</b> in the <b>chain.</b> All Rowbikes have a rear derailleur, even single speeds, due to the need to keep proper tension in the chain.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between {{the upper and lower}} pulleys of a rear derailleur is known as the cage length. Cage length, when combined with the pulley size, determines the capacity of a derailleur to take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> Cage length determines the total capacity of the derailleur, that is the size difference between the largest and smallest chainrings, and the size difference between the largest and smallest sprockets on the cogset added together. A larger sum requires a longer cage length. Typical cross country mountain bikes with three front chainrings will use a long cage rear derailleur. A road bike with only two front chainrings and close ratio sprockets can operate with either a short or long cage derailleur, but will work better with a short cage.|$|R
50|$|Toyota swapped the dual-row {{timing chain}} used in older engines for a single-row chain with plastic guides in 1983. The new system reduced {{drag on the}} engine but {{introduced}} a new maintenance problem. After about 100,000 miles of operation, the chain may stretch {{to the point that}} the hydraulic-operated chain tensioner cannot take up any more <b>slack.</b> The timing <b>chain</b> then impacts the plastic driver's side chain guide, breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the guide restraint, the chain will vibrate excessively on the driver's side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} in which the oscillations, and the forces thus produced, in a chain drive, working at moderate and high speed, can be calculated. Since the outer system affects the result it has been necessary to include this in the model. The mass of the chain {{is included in the}} model and both the gravitational forces and the inertia forces in the chain are taken into account. The elasticity in the links is included. The sprockets are connected by two spans, both of which have {{to be included in the}} model to fulfill the equilibrium equations for the rollers in contact with the sprockets. The position of the chain is given by the geometric conditions as well as the equilibrium condition. On the <b>slack</b> side a <b>chain</b> tensioner is used to reduce the tansverse oscillation, which occur at higher speeds...|$|R
2500|$|External gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The rear derailleur also has spring-mounted jockey wheels which take up any <b>slack</b> in the <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey pulley or guide pulley (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{development}} programs, including water resource projects, depends on two key factors: {{the role of}} underlying institutions and the impact synergies from other closely related programs. Existing methodologies have limitations in accounting for these critical factors. This paper fills this gap by developing a methodology, which quantifies both the roles that institutions play in impact generation {{and the extent of}} impact synergies that flows from closely related programs within a unified framework. The methodology is applied to the Kala Oya Basin in Sri Lanka in order to evaluate the impacts of three water-related programs and the roles of 11 institutions in the context of food security. The results provide considerable insights on the relative role of institutions and the flow of development synergies both within and across different impact pathways. The methodology {{can also be used to}} locate <b>slack</b> in impact <b>chains</b> and identify policy options to enhance the impact flows.

50|$|RowBikes {{transmit}} {{power from the}} rider to the wheels using a standard bicycle chain, rear gears, and derailleur. Both wheels are standard bicycle wheels, the rear wheel is fitted out with a standard freewheel. The chain on a Rowbike does not travel in a loop, {{as is the case}} with a standard bicycle. It moves back and forth over the rear cog in a sawing motion. The chain is connected at one end to the frame of the rowbike and to the shock cord (bungee cord) on the other. As the rower pulls back the chain engages the rear cog and the bungee cord, which is concealed in the power lever, is extended, and when the rower returns forward the bungee cord contracts, pulling the chain back and ensuring there is no <b>slack</b> in the <b>chain.</b> All Rowbikes have a rear derailleur, even single speeds, due to the need to keep proper tension in the chain.|$|R
5000|$|Used {{for very}} short {{distances}} where a rope, chain, or {{a length of}} webbing {{is attached to the}} casualty, which must have a working braking system as it will be used to slow both vehicles. This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a [...] "flat tow", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles. As typically a car is being flat towed because the engine won't run, and without a running engine the power brakes don't work, it could be dangerous as well as difficult to slow and stop two vehicles using only the brakes that only half function. Instead, it is typical for the towing vehicle to drive normally, but avoiding sharp acceleration or braking. All the person driving the rear vehicle has to do is gently apply the brakes whenever the tow chain begins to slacken, and anticipate stops so he or she can drag the brakes and come to a halt without excessive <b>slack</b> in the <b>chain.</b> This still requires a relatively skilled driver, as neither the power brakes or power steering will function, and you must take care to steer wide in sharp corners and never allow the chain to slacken, or it may get jerked and broken, or worse, drag underneath the vehicle and possibly cause damage or even loss of control.|$|R
