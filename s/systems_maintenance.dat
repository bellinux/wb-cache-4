40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to descibe (1) the correlation between the students’ motiation  toward the learning achievement of fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> motorcycle, (2) the correlation and parents’ attention toward the learning achievement of fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> motorcycle, and (3) the correlation between students’ learning motivation and parents’ attention toward the learning achievement of fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> motorcycle of tenth grade students of SMK Cokroaminoto Wanadadi. The study reports that (1) there was positive and significance correlation between the students’ motiation toward the learning achievement of fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> motorcycle, (2) there was positive and significance correlation between parents’ attention toward the learning achievement of fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> motorcycle, and (3) there was positive and significance correlation between students’ learning motivation and parents’ attention toward the learning achievement of fuel <b>system</b> <b>maintenance</b> motorcycle of tenth grade students of SMK Cokroaminoto Wanadadi. It could be interpreted that to improve students’ achievement, it was needed motivation and parents’ attention. The learning motivation was need by the students to support their learning activities because motivation was the main factor in increasing their learning achievement. The parents’ attention was also important to improve the students’ learning achievement because parents or family was the first education place for the students...|$|R

30|$|But {{there are}} several {{situations}} in some organizations where other criteria like reliability, availability, downtime, etc., play critical roles in systems.

Sometimes, when the maintenance cost rate is minimized, the system reliability measures are also so low {{that they are not}} acceptable in practice (Sharma and Yadava 2011).|$|R
