5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E
5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was its own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. Those {{who argue that}} the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was a subspecies often {{refer to it as}} Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> {{was first}} {{described}} as Lutreola macrodon, {{distinct from the}} American mink, by , a medical doctor and ornithologist, in 1903 after it became extinct. Prentiss based his description on skull fragments recovered from Native American shell middens in New England. Most <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> remains, {{nearly all of them}} skull fragments, have come from shell middens, but a complete specimen has never been found.|$|E
5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} {{sagittal}} crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male <b>sea</b> <b>minks</b> were probably larger than female <b>sea</b> <b>minks.</b> The <b>sea</b> <b>mink's</b> wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|R
50|$|The South Fork McKenzie River is a tributary, about 31 mi long, of the McKenzie River in the U.S. {{state of}} Oregon. It begins at about 4500 ft above <b>sea</b> level near <b>Mink</b> Lake in the Three Sisters Wilderness of the Cascade Range. Flowing {{northwest}} within Lane County, it meets the McKenzie River about 60 mi {{from the larger}} river's confluence with the Willamette River.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a closed}} town because the Russian Pacific Fleet is based there. Foreigners {{must have a}} special permit to visit the town. However, the Islands of Putyatin and Askold, which {{are a part of}} the {{territory}} administered by the town, are open for visits by tourists. Up to two thousand tourists visit Putyatin every year. They are attracted by the unique flora and fauna in the waters surrounding this island and its underwater landscape. Approximately 2,400 people inhabit Putyatin Island. Their main occupation is catching and processing <b>sea</b> products, breeding <b>mink</b> and spotted deer.|$|R
5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink's range may have {{extended}} {{south of the}} Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this {{could be due to}} the rising sea levels—older <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> remains may be submerged underwater. Alternately, the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> may have evolved after the last glacial period and filled a new ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of three}} species {{that have been}} extirpated in Canada in written history, two have since been reintroduced. It {{is not clear whether}} a fourth species, the {{aforementioned}} <b>sea</b> <b>mink,</b> was ever a resident of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} American mink (Neovison vison), with debate {{about whether or not the}} <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The only Canadian, {{and also}} last known {{specimen}} of the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> (Mustela macrodon) was captured on Campobello Island, New Brunswick in 1894. It is unknown whether the species was ever {{native to the}} country, but an unidentified animal reported in 1785 suggest {{it might have been}} more common in the Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E
25|$|Excavations of old Indian {{sites in}} the Mount Desert Island region have yielded remains of the native mammals. Bones of wolf, North American beaver (Castor canadensis), deer, elk, gray seal (Halichoerus grypus), the Indian dog, and <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> (Neovison macrodon) have been uncovered, as well as large numbers of raccoon, lynx, wolf, muskrat, and deer. Although beaver were trapped to {{extinction}} on the island, two pairs of beaver that were released in 1920 by George B. Dorr at the brook between Bubble Pond and Eagle Lake have repopulated it. A large fire in 1947 cleared {{the eastern half of}} the island of its coniferous trees and permitted the growth of aspen, birch, alder, maple and other deciduous trees which enabled the beaver to thrive.|$|E
500|$|The {{taxonomy}} of minks was revised in 2000, {{resulting in the}} formation of a new genus, Neovison, which includes only the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> and the American mink. Formerly, both minks were classified in the genus Mustela. The species name macrodon translates to [...] "large teeth". According to Richard Manville, a naturalist who claims that the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> is not its own species, its closest relative is the common mink (N. v. mink), which also inhabits the New England area.|$|E
500|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was {{pursued by}} fur traders {{due to its}} large size; this made it more {{desirable}} than other mink species further inland. The unregulated trade eventually led to its extinction, which {{is thought to have}} occurred between 1860 and 1920. The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was seldom sighted after 1860. The last two recorded kills of a <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> were made in Maine in 1880 near Jonesport, Maine, and Campobello Island in New Brunswick in 1894, although the 1894 kill is speculated to be of large American minks. Fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs, although they were rarely trapped. If a <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> escaped into a small hole on the rocky ledges, it was dug out by hunters using shovels and crowbars. If it was out of reach of the hunters, it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a screw on the far end. If it was hiding, it was smoked out and suffocated. The minks' nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight.|$|E
500|$|Since the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> {{has only}} been {{described}} by fragmentary remains, its appearance and behaviors are not well-documented. Its relatives, as well as descriptions by fur traders and Native Americans, give a general idea of this animal's appearance and its ecological roles. Accounts from Native Americans in the New England/Atlantic Canadian regions reported that the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> had a fatter body than the American mink. The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> produced a distinctive fishy odor, and had fur that {{was said to be}} coarser and redder than that of the American mink. It is thought that naturalist Joseph Banks encountered this animal in 1776 in the Strait of Belle Isle, and he described it as being slightly larger than a fox, having long legs, and a tail that was long and tapered towards the end, similar to a greyhound.|$|E
500|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was {{a marine}} mammal that {{probably}} lived around the rocky coasts of New England and Maritime Provinces until hunted to extinction {{in the late}} 19th century. Most <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> remains are unearthed {{on the coast of}} Maine. Though it is speculated that they at one point inhabited Connecticut and Rhode Island, they were commonly trapped along the coast of the Bay of Fundy (in the Gulf of Maine), and it is said that they formerly existed on the southwestern coast of Nova Scotia. There were reports of unusually large mink furs being collected from Nova Scotia regularly. The bones of a specimen unearthed in Middleboro, Massachusetts, were dated to be around 4,300±300 years old, [...] from salt water. The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> may have reached that area by traveling up rivers, or may have been brought there by Native Americans. The latter is most likely as no other mink remains have been discovered between Casco Bay in Maine and southeast Massachusetts. <b>Sea</b> <b>mink</b> bones have been unearthed in Canada, although these may have been carried there by Native Americans from the Gulf of Maine; sea minks may never have inhabited Canada. The rugged shorelines of the Down East region of Maine may have represented a northernmost barrier in their range. Mead concluded that only American minks inhabited the mainland and that sea minks were restricted to islands off the coast. If this is the case, then all remains found on the mainland were carried there. Graham challenged that hypothesis, stating that it is unlikely that all <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> specimens originate from one population.|$|E
500|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> was {{the largest}} of the minks. As only fragmentary {{skeletal}} remains of the <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> exist, most of its external measurements are speculative and rely only on dental measurements. In 1929, Ernest Seton, a wildlife artist, concluded that the probable dimensions for this animal are [...] from head to tail, with the tail being [...] long. [...] A possible mounted <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> specimen collected in 1894 in Connecticut measured [...] from head to tail and the tail was [...] in length; a 1996 study found this to be either a large American mink or possibly a hybrid. The specimen was described as having coarse fur that was reddish-tan in color, though much of it was likely faded from age. It was darkest at the tail and the hind limbs, with a [...] white patch between the forearms. There were also white spots on the left forearm and the groin region.|$|E
500|$|Fur traders who hunted it {{gave the}} <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> various names, {{including}} water marten, red otter, and fisher cat. Possibly the first description of this species was made by Sir Humphrey Gilbert ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sea otter}} was {{formerly}} {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "sea beaver", being the marine fur-bearer similar in commercial value to the terrestrial beaver. [...] Rodents (of which the beaver is one) are not closely related to otters, which are carnivores. It is {{not to be confused with}} the marine otter, a rare otter species native to the southern west coast of South America. A number of other otter species, while predominantly living in fresh water, are commonly found in marine coastal habitats. The extinct <b>sea</b> <b>mink</b> of northeast North America is another mustelid that had adapted to a marine environment.|$|E
