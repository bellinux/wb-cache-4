5|$|In {{junior high}} school, they meet a tall, {{eccentric}} girl who befriends everyone named Chizuru Sarashina and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, {{who does not}} get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much {{to the surprise of}} their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing. The group of friends <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{his works}} also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what {{else is going on}} in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E
500|$|Some {{evidence}} shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute. Hillenburg indicated that children's television series such as [...] (19871988) and Pee-wee's Playhouse (19861991) [...] "sparked something in [...]" [...] He continued, [...] "I don't {{know if this is}} true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I'll <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [...] together." ...|$|E

500|$|Of the film's {{success with}} Western audiences, Miike {{states that he}} was not surprised, but that he had [...] "no idea {{what goes on in the}} minds of people in the West and I don't pretend to know what their tastes are. And I don't want to <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> that. It's nice that they liked my movie, but I'm not going to start {{deliberately}} worrying about why or what I can do to make it happen again". Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E
500|$|The series {{sought out}} {{a bowling alley}} for the opening scenes, but many were {{reluctant}} to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen. The series was allowed to film at the location {{under the condition that}} the bowling surfaces were preserved. Due to this, the production staff was forced to either wear bowling shoes or wear makeshift [...] "paper booties" [...] on their feet. In between camera set ups, Duchovny and director Charleston bowled several games. Duchovny later joked that after the episode, he [...] "realized how old" [...] he was because he felt sore from all the bowling. He joked, [...] "when you get sore from bowling, it's time to <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> your life and where it's going." ...|$|E
500|$|Ted Williams said, [...] "Three {{days before}} he pitched I would <b>start</b> <b>{{thinking}}</b> <b>about</b> Robert Feller, Bob Feller. I'd sit in my room thinking about him all the time. God I loved it... Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd think about him for three days." [...] Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's [...] "greatest pitcher of his time" [...] {{as well as a}} finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Each year, American Legion Baseball presents the [...] "Bob Feller Pitching Award" [...] to the pitcher [...] "with the most strikeouts in regional and national competition." ...|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} his work, Kraft found it {{increasingly}} stressful, {{especially since he}} did not consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a change of career.|$|R

500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{shooting}} the film totally in live action until I saw it really start {{to work so}} well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.|$|E

500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: <b>Start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the bugs." ...|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

Oh, I'm evil, really? So that makes you <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> evil... What is evil? Half of it, I don't know how much people think of Mick as the devil or as just a good rock performer or what? There are black magicians who think we are acting as unknown agents of Lucifer and others who think we are Lucifer. Everybody's Lucifer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding a {{forthcoming}} fifth studio album, Hutchison noted in October 2013: [...] "We're {{going to have}} to <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the next record after this tour.

Lincoln's law partner and biographer, William H. Herndon, also reports an additional incident at the time: a boat Lincoln was on got stranded on a shoal; the boat gradually swung clear and was dislodged after much manual exertion. This event, along with the Offutt's boat/milldam incident, prompted Lincoln to <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to lift vessels over river obstructions and shoals. He eventually came up with an idea for inflatable flotation. Patent 6469 was awarded to Abraham Lincoln on May 22, 1849.|$|E

Depp explained in further detail during the interview: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but I would say it's probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue that you say per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had a chance to say your own words, you <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> that as an insane option for a human being." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Saves the Day {{signed to}} major label DreamWorks Records and {{released}} In Reverie in September of that year.
