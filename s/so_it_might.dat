5|$|Recent {{scholars}} have emphasised, {{in the words}} of Ármann Jakobsson, that:the time has come to resist reviewing information about álfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{several of}} the indoor arenas would be {{assembled}} elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be more accurate to call them legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing needs, {{some of them would}} be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will have paid for an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium.|$|E
25|$|The same {{applies to}} other more complex biosignatures. Searching for {{biological}} {{remains of the}} precursors to life, whether ancient or currently existing, would be far easier on an uncontaminated planet. This would similarly apply to searches for DNA sequences on Mars. Life on other planets could have a common origin with Earth life, since in the early Solar System there was much exchange of material between the planets which could have transferred life as well. If <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be based on DNA too.|$|E

25|$|Some years later, after Easton became President of the American Political Science Association, he led {{the charge}} of a new post-behavioralist revolution, arguing that {{political}} science research should be both relevant and action-oriented, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> better {{serve the needs of}} society by solving social and political problems revealed during the 1960s. This new revolution was not a change in the methods of inquiry but a change in orientation that grew out of a deep discontent with the direction of contemporary political research and which advocated more attention to the public responsibilities of the discipline and to relevant research on contemporary political problems and issues. According to John Gunnell, this was the official birth announcement of the public policy enterprise in political science which became the basis of the self-image of orthodox political science in the 1970s. With this shift came a distinct de-emphasis of concern for establishing a general unified theory as the core of the discipline, and a retreat from any pointed confrontation with the history of political theory.|$|E
500|$|Bennett was {{interested}} in Petermann's theories, and in 1877 traveled to Gotha to discuss [...] possible Arctic routes with the geographer. Petermann thought {{that as well as}} providing the best path to the pole, [...] passage through the Bering Strait using the Kuro Siwo would enable investigation of the unexplored, barely glimpsed land mass known since 1867 as [...] "Wrangel's Land". He theorized that this land might form part of a transpolar continent, connected to Greenland; if <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> provide an alternative, land-based route to the pole should the expedition fail to find a portal to the polar sea. [...] "My idea", he told Bennett, [...] "is that if one door will not open, try another". He offered Bennett full use of his maps and charts.|$|E
500|$|The monks were in {{residence}} for scarcely twenty years. Llanbadarn {{would have been}} a simple or obedientiary priory, a dependency of the abbey. The superior of such a priory, who was subject to the abbot in everything, was called a [...] "prior." [...] These monasteries were satellites of the mother abbey. In light of earlier activities at Llanbadarn, {{it is worth noting that}} the forty-eighth rule of Saint Benedict prescribes extensive and habitual holy reading for the brethren. However, Benedictine monks were disallowed worldly possessions, thus necessitating the preservation and collection of sacred texts in monastic libraries for communal use. One of the key Benedictine practices was copying sacred texts, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be expected that the monks created a scriptorium, if indeed one hadn't survived from the time of Sulien and his sons and grandsons.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been a little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being {{in the same room with}} each other." ...|$|E

The second frame (the [...] ) appears to be spinning in our chart, {{but in fact it}} is gyrostabilized, and of course a nonspinning inertial observer riding on a dust grain will indeed see the other dust grains rotating clockwise with angular velocity [...] about his axis of symmetry. It turns out that in addition, optical images are expanded and sheared in the direction of rotation.|$|E
2500|$|Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (Harold Peary) – the pompous next-door {{neighbor}} with whom Fibber enjoyed twitting and arguing. Introduced in 1939. Harold Peary actually portrayed several Gildersleeve characters before {{the appearance of}} Throckmorton. On March21, 1939 (episode #197), he portrayed Frank, the barber. In the 25 April 1939 episode (#202), Fibber visits an optometrist ("oculist") named Dr. Donald Gildersleeve. In the 20 June 1939 episode, Fibber Has a Toothache, their dentist is Dr. Gildersleeve; although Molly calls him Wilbur, McGee calls him [...] "Wilberforce", and he once had a [...] "thing" [...] for Molly, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be a relative to Throckmorton? In the episode [...] "Gildersleeve's Diary" [...] (10/22/40), it is revealed that his middle name is Philharmonic. Many of his interactions with Fibber include the catchphrase [...] "You're a hard man, McGee", {{in response to a}} harsh or critical statement from Fibber. Throckmortons's wife is frequently mentioned, never heard, and dropped when Peary moved on to his own show. However, the wife of Homer Gildersleeve (again played by Peary) was briefly heard from in one episode.|$|E
