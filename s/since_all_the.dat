5|$|For several decades, {{no natural}} {{reproduction}} of pallid sturgeon was observed, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fish {{that had been}} captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E

At the same time the sale of lots increased, especially around Ferstad, and a new station was opened at Søndre Hoem. During the 1930s, the company annually lost NOK 64–80,000. The municipal power company threatened to cut the power, and Graakalbanen offered the municipality to take over the line. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> municipal lines were profitable, the municipality declined.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, the reborn Polish state {{began the}} process of {{economic}} recovery and some Poles tried to return. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ills of life in Poland could be blamed on foreign occupation, the migrants did not resent the Polish upper classes. Their relation with the mother country was generally more positive than among migrants of other European countries. It is estimated that 30% of the Polish emigrants from lands occupied by the Russian Empire returned home. The return rate for non-Jews was closer to 50–60%. More than two-thirds of emigrants from Polish Galicia (freed from under the Austrian occupation) also returned.|$|E

25|$|Uniting the Church of Byzantium {{with that}} of Rome was a simple matter, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{bargaining}} chips were {{in the hands of}} the Roman Catholic West. John VIII, as the de facto head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the Filioque dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in Ferrara and Florence, not only at the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{completed}} in 2008 and the experiment detected its first single beam events on 10 September of that year. Data taking was then interrupted {{for over a year}} due to an LHC magnet quench incident. On 23 November 2009, the first proton-proton collisions occurred at the LHC, at a relatively low injection energy of 450GeV per beam. These collisions were successfully registered in ATLAS, which has been logging data ever <b>since.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> while LHC energy has been increasing: 900GeV per beam at the end of 2009, 3,500GeV for the whole of 2010 and 2011, then 4,000GeV per beam in 2012. After a Long Shutdown in 2013 and 2014, in 2015 ATLAS saw 6,500 GeV per beam.|$|E
25|$|The term clone {{is used in}} {{horticulture}} {{to refer}} to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or apomixis. Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potato and banana. Grafting {{can be regarded as}} cloning, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of copy-on-write is that, when ZFS writes new data, the blocks containing the old {{data can be}} retained, allowing a snapshot version of the file system to be maintained. ZFS snapshots are consistent (they reflect the entire data as it existed at a single point in time), and can be created extremely quickly, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> data composing the snapshot is already stored, with the entire storage pool often snapshotted several times per hour. They are also space efficient, since any unchanged data is shared among the file system and its snapshots. snapshots are inherently read-only, ensuring {{they will not be}} modified after creation, although they should not be relied on as a sole means of backup. Entire snapshots can be restored and also files and directories within snapshots.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other French armies {{had been}} {{successful}} {{by the end}} of 1793, the National Convention issued a decree criticizing the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. Aoust, who became the army commander just as the disaster struck, was recalled and later executed. He went to the guillotine on 2 July 1794. Delattre was executed the same day. January 1794 brought huge changes. The new French commander Jacques François Dugommier came with 10,500 troops after successfully concluding the Siege of Toulon in December. Ricardos died on 13 March 1794, allegedly from a cup of poisoned chocolate. His freshly appointed replacement Alejandro O'Reilly died of a stomach ailment ten days later. Finally, Luis Firmín de Carvajal, Conde de la Unión was named the new leader of the Army of Catalonia.|$|E
25|$|Much {{debate and}} {{controversy}} {{exist in the}} scientific literature about the dynamics and apparent benefit of the combined forms of reproduction in honey bees and other social insects, known as the haplodiploid sex-determination system. The drones have two reproductive functions. They convert and extend the queen's single unfertilized egg into about 10million genetically identical male sperm cells. They {{also serve as a}} vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. Female worker bees develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16chromosomes for a total of 32one set from each parent. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sperm cells produced by a particular drone are genetically identical, full sisters are more closely related than full sisters of other animals where the sperm is not genetically identical.|$|E
