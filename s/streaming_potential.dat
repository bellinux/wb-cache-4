50|$|Streaming {{currents}} in well-defined geometries are a sensitive method {{to characterize the}} zeta potential of surfaces, which {{is important in the}} fields of colloid and interface science. In geology, measurements of related spontaneous potential are used for evaluations of formations. <b>Streaming</b> <b>potential</b> has to be considered in design for flow of poorly conductive fluids (e.g., gasoline lines) because of the danger of buildup of high voltages. The streaming current monitor (SCM) is a fundamental tool for monitoring coagulation in wastewater treatment plants. The degree of coagulation of raw water may be monitored by the use of an SCM to provide a positive feedback control of coagulant injection. As the streaming current of the wastewater increases, more coagulant agent is injected into the stream. The higher levels of coagulant agent cause the small colloidal particles to coagulate and sediment out of the stream. Since less colloid particles are in the wastewater stream, the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> decreases. The SCM recognizes this and subsequently reduces the amount of coagulant agent injected into the wastewater stream. The implementation of SCM feedback control has led to a significant materials cost reduction, one that was not realized until the early 1980s. In addition to monitoring capabilities, the streaming current could, in theory, generate usable electrical power. This process, however, has yet to be applied as typical <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> mechanical to electrical efficiencies are around 1%.|$|E

Laboratory and field data suggest that these so-called <b>streaming</b> <b>potentials</b> may be several orders of magnitudes larger than theoretical predictions that only consider the influence of the relative permeability and electrical conductivity on the self potential (SP) data. Recent work has partly improved predictions by considering how the volumetric excess charge in the pore space scales with the inverse of water saturation.

Electrokinetic effects are initiated by sound waves (typically P-waves) passing through a porous rock inducing relative motion of the rock matrix and fluid. Motion of the ionic fluid through the capillaries in the rock occurs with cations (or less commonly, anions) preferentially adhering to the capillary walls, so that applied pressure and resulting fluid flow relative to the rock matrix produces an electric dipole. In a non-homogeneous formation, the seismic wave generates an oscillating flow of fluid and a corresponding oscillating electrical and EM field. The resulting EM wave can be detected by electrode pairs placed on the ground surface.|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{importance}} {{in the evaluation of}} petroleum and gas reservoirs, measurements of self-potential data under borehole conditions (well-logging) have found only minor applications in aquifer and waste-site characterization.

Proportionally higher signals arise from <b>streaming</b> <b>potentials</b> that prevent using simple interpretation models that assume signals from diffusion only. Our laboratory experiments found that dual-source self-potential signals can be described by a simple linear model, and that contributions (from diffusion and <b>streaming</b> <b>potentials)</b> can be isolated by slightly perturbing the borehole conditions. Perturbations are applied either by changing the concentration of the borehole-filling solution or its column height.

40|$|Movement {{of water}} and solutes in clay is {{important}} in groundwater and waste management, e. g. in seawater intrusion in near costal areas, in clay liners at disposal sites, in emissions from contaminated clayey sediments and sludges and in radioactive waste storage in clay formations. Dense clays act as semipermeable membranes. Water transport in dense clays is driven not only by hydraulic potential and solution density but also by differences in chemical potential and electrical potential. These processes are known as chemical osmosis and electroosmosis, respectively. In addition to active application, electrical potential differences can be induced by hydraulic pressure differences, called <b>streaming</b> <b>potentials,</b> and by differences in salt concentration, called membrane potentials. They counteract hydraulic or osmotic water flow and salt diffusion. Chemical osmosis and electroosmosis are absent in transport models for soil and groundwater. Neglecting these transport phenomena is not justified in the situations mentioned. The objective {{of this research is}} to substantiate this statement by quantifying the effect of induced electrical potentials on the transport {{of water and}} solutes in clay layers in laboratory experiments. Permeameters are constructed for transport experiments on Wyoming bentonite, Boom Clay from Mol, Belgium, and Calais Clay from the polder Groot Mijdrecht, The Netherlands. The permeameters are equipped with cylindrical walls, both flexible and rigid, to contain a clay slab of 2 - 3 mm thick. <b>Streaming</b> <b>potentials</b> and membrane potentials induced by hydraulic or chemical osmotic flow are measured. Their effect on water and solute transport is quantified by performing experiments under both electrically shorted and non-shorted conditions. Chemical osmosis and electroosmosis, being coupled flow phenomena, are described by irreversible thermodynamics. The semipermeability of clay is explained by diffuse double layer theory. However, a clay membrane is not ideal, i. e. part of the salt will pass the membrane by diffusion. The ideality is expressed by the reflection coefficient.

Recently, <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> measurement in smart wells has been proposed to monitor water encroachment. However, there are still significant uncertainties associated with {{the interpretation of the}} measurements, particularly concerning the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coupling coefficient. This is a key petrophysical property that dictates the magnitude of the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> for a given fluid potential. <b>Streaming</b> <b>potential</b> magnitude is basically related to the fluid flow rate, fluid properties (particularly salinity), and the rock matrix properties. The coupling coefficient has been measured experimentally in sandstone cores saturated with different brine salinities, but very little works have been published on carbonate rocks. The huge number of carbonate reservoirs around the world suggests that measurement of <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> in carbonate rocks is also important. In this study, we present value of <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coupling coefficient in a carbonate rock saturated with various salinities of brine. As we expected, <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> in such core is small but measurable and higher salinity gives smaller <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coupling coefficient. Consistent results are obtained using specially designed electrodes and paired pumping experiments to eliminate spurious electrical potentials. We noticed that <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coupling coefficient in carbonate rock is lower compared to the one in sandstone cores saturated with the same salinity of brine. This observation could be explained by comparing the difference in Point of zero charges (pzc) between those two types of rock.

40|$|<b>Streaming</b> <b>potential</b> and {{resistivity}} measurements {{have been performed}} on Fontainebleau sandstone and Villejust quartzite samples in a triaxial device during compaction, uniaxial compression, and rupture. Measurements on individual samples do not show any clear intrinsic dependence of the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coefficient with permeability. An apparent dependence of the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coefficient with permeability is, however, observed during deformation. The effect of surface conductivity is taken into account and is small compared with the observed changes in the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coefficient. The observed dependence is therefore interpreted {{in terms of a}} difference {{in the evolution of the}} electrical and hydraulic connectivity patterns during deformation. This effect causes the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coefficient, and consequently the inferred ξ potential, to be reduced by a geometrical factor R_G representing the electrical efficiency of the hydraulic network. Estimates of the R_G factor varying between 0. 2 and 0. 8 for electrolyte resistivity larger than 100 Ωm are obtained by comparing the values of the ξ potential inferred from intact rock samples with the values obtained from crushed rock samples, where the geometrical effects are assumed to be negligible. The reduction of the <b>streaming</b> <b>potential</b> coefficient observed during compaction or uniaxial compression suggests that the tortuosity of the hydraulic network increases faster than the tortuosity of the electrical network.

By using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation into which flow was reintegrated, the numbers yield zeta potentials approximating 0. 1 to 0. 4 v in both aorta and vena cava. This number approaches the apparent upper limit for zeta (actually “interfacial potentials”) potentials in biological systems. The measured “i. f. ” potential is considered as the interreaction of several physical and metabolic factors operating at the blood intimal interface.
