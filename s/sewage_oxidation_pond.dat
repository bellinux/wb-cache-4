[...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1988 Population trends, habitat use, and {{behavioral}} ecology of American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) wintering at Humboldt Bay, California were studied from 1 October 1982 to 15 May 1983, from 3 October 1983 to 8 May 1984 and from 19 December 1984 to 29 April 1985. Between November and February populations of American Avocets at Humboldt Bay averaged 706 ?? 35. 6 and 567 ?? 67. 0 birds in 1982 - 83 and 1983 - 84 respectively. Fall migrants began {{to arrive at}} Humboldt Bay in late August and by mid-November most of the wintering population was present. Spring migration began in February and ended in late April or early May. American Avocets used only 23. 6 percent (868 ha.) of North Humboldt Bay. Within {{the northeast corner of}} Humboldt Bay 4 major habitats were used: (1) Intertidal mudflats, used mainly for feeding and resting, (2) <b>Sewage</b> <b>Oxidation</b> <b>Pond,</b> used mainly for feeding and secondarily as a source of fresh water, (3) Islands in Klopp Lake, used as principle high tide roosts and (4) a section of high elevation mudflat north of Jacoby Creek, used as an alternate high tide roost. American Avocets usually roosted in shallow water. Islands adjacent to deep, non-tidal ponds were important componets of roosting habitat. Use of roosts was tidally controlled. An average of 87. 3 percent of all birds observed rested when tide levels were between 5. 0 and 7. 5 feet. American Avocets were the only common wintering shorebird to feed on the high concentrations of Daphne magna at the Oxidation Ponds. This food source was used mainly in October. Intertidal mudflats within 3 km. of the roost were the principle feeding areas during most of the winter. American Avocets used tactile feeding methods primarily and fed most often on the wettest substrates. Avocets usually concentrated near the tide edge when feeding. Greatest proportions of the flock was observed feeding when tide levels were between 1. 6 and 4. 0 feet. Most other shorebirds avoided American Avocets that were feeding. Interspecific and intraspecific competition probably was not ecologically important. Avocets foraged an average of 45 - 60 percent of the daylight hours in March and April and 84 percent between November and February. Avocets fed at night from November to March but not during October, April or May. American Avocets rested more on the intertidal mudflats and at the roosts during strong winds, during heavy rains, and when temperatures were less than 11 ??C than under other conditions. A greater proportion of Avocets fed on invertebrates found on exposed mudflats with visible surface water when temperatures were greater than 10 ??C than below 10 ??C. During light rains and under overcast skies American Avocets fed primarily on invertebrates found on flooded mudflats where the water covered their feet or on exposed mudflats with visible surface water...|$|E

40|$|Ammonia, at {{concentrations}} over 2. 0 mM and at pH values over 8. 0, inhibits photosynthesis {{and growth}} of Scenedesmus obliquus, a dominant species in high-rate <b>sewage</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds.</b> Photosynthesis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Anacystis nidulans, and Plectonema boryanum is also susceptible to ammonia inhibition. Dark respiration and cell morphology were unaffected by any combination of pH and ammonia concentrations tested, thus limiting the apparent effect to inhibition of the normal function of the chloroplasts. Methylamine had the same effect as ammonia, and its penetration into the cells {{was found to be}} pH dependent. Therefore, the dependence of toxicity of amines to algae on pH apparently results from the inability to penetrate the cell membrane in the ionized form. When operated at 120 -h detention time of raw wastewater, the high-rate <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> maintained a steady state with respect to algal growth and oxygen concentration, and the concentration of ammonia did not exceed 1. 0 mM. Shifting the pond to 48 -h detention time caused an increase in ammonia concentration in the pond water to 2. 5 mM, and the pond gradually turned anaerobic. Photosynthesis, which usually elevates the pH of the pond water to 9. 0 to 10. 0, could not proceed beyond pH 7. 9 because of the high concentration of ammonia, and the algal population was washed out and reduced to a concentration that could maintain a doubling time of 48 h without photosynthesis bringing the pH to inhibitory levels. Under these conditions, the pH of the bond becomes a factor that limits the operational efficiency of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to field-test the 2 ̆ 2 microenvironment concept 2 ̆ 2 of avian botulism epizootiology. The 2 ̆ 2 microenvironment concept 2 ̆ 2 hypothesizes that aquatic invertebrate carcasses may serve both as a substrate for toxin production by Clostridium botulinum type C in nature and as a vehicle for toxin transmission to waterbirds. This concept has become the generally accepted, but inadequately tested, working hypothesis of type C botulism epizootiology. This study attempted to experimentally induce type C botulism in sentinel flocks of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) on <b>sewage</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> in northern Utah. The three experimental <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> were inoculated with Cl. botulinum type C (strain X 220 B 2) endospores in June,l 974. Aquatic invertebrate populations were monitored throughout the summer. Rotenone was used in August in two of the experimental ponds (one pond served as a control) to kill aquatic invertebrates and thereby provide a large amount of substrate for clostridial growth and toxin production. No botulism was detected among the sentinel birds even though they routinely ingested invertebrate carcasses. None of the samples of dead invertebrates collected from the experimental ponds contained detectable (in white mice) botulinum toxin. It was concluded that the 2 ̆ 2 microenvironment concept, 2 ̆ 2 as it now stands, cannot always be a sufficient explanation of how type C botulism epizootics are initiated in nature. Microbiological experiments designed to determine why the invertebrate carcasses collected from the study ponds contained no botulinum toxin were started and are now ongoing. Early results indicate that Cl. botulinum (X 220 B 2) cells may not normally be able to effectively compete (at least in terms of toxin production) with other microorganisms present in the sewage ponds. It is suggested that the initiation of a type C botulism epizootic in nature may require the alleviation of the inhibitory effects of other putrefactive microorganisms upon clostridial metabolism and/ or toxin. This hypothesis is highly speculative and requires much further experimentation...|$|R

40|$|The sand {{flounder}} Rhombosolea plebeia (Richardson) (Pleuronectidae) inhabits shallow coastal marine and brackish water regions throughout New Zealand, Auckland Islands and possibly Australia. Relatively {{little research has}} been carried out on this important commercial species. The principal investigation up to the present time is an unpublished Ph. D. thesis by Mundy (1968), who carried out a population study involving tagging of adult fish off the Canterbury coast. Some data were provided as part of a study on the fish population of the Avon-Heathcote Estuary by Webb (1966, 1972, 1973 a, 1973 b). A Ph. D. study on osmoregulation of {{sand flounder}} from Otago Harbour has been completed by Raj (1973), and a study of flounder spawning in the Hauraki Gulf has also been recently published by Colman (1973). The shallow water inlets and estuaries around the Canterbury coast act as a nursery for young stages of sand flounder. While some population and feeding studies have been carried out on the older age classes, little is known of its early development, natural history and physiology. The Avon-Heathcote Estuary (latitude 43 ° 32 'S., longitude 172 ° 43 'E.), the study area in the present investigation (Fig. 1), is one of these nursery areas for the young stages. It is probably the principal area for producing fish to restock the offshore grounds which provide the commercial catches on the east coast of the South Island (Mundy, 1968). Sand flounder is an important commercial species, both in terms of public demand and in the volume of landings. The annual landings of' flounder of all species in New Zealand from 1944 - 1970 was about 907, 730 kg, and of this total sand flounder formed about 50 percent (New Zealand Marine Department, Reports on Fisheries, 1944 - 1970). Hence the study of its biology in a major nursery area and of the effects of man-made environmental changes and pollution is important. The Christchurch Drainage Board proposes to control flooding in the City of Christchurch and have had several flood control schemes tested by the Hydraulics Research Station, Wallingford, England. They have also commissioned an intensive biological research programme on the Avon-Heathcote Estuary headed by Professor G. A. Knox, Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury to assess the effects of' these flood control schemes. The present study forms part of this biological research programme. The flood control schemes include proposals to erect a barrier near the Estuary mouth. If spring tides coincide with heavy rainfall, surface flooding in parts of Christchurch becomes a problem. When flooding is imminent it is proposed that the barrier gates will be closed at low water to prevent tidal penetration so that flood water can drain into the Estuary without being retarded by the incoming tide. Any such scheme affecting the biology of the Estuary must be carefully considered as undesirable effects may result. The first general study of the biology of the Estuary was made by Thompson (1930), whose work forms a useful basis with which to compare changes that have occurred since then. More specific studies have been made on polychaetes (Estcourt, 1962), fish populations (Webb, 1966), sand flounder (Mundy, 1968) and benthic macrofauna (Voller, 1973), and a number of surveys directed at the effect of pollution in the Estuary have been carried out by Bruce (1953), Williams (1959), Rosenburg (1963), Webb (1965) and Cameron (1969). Pollution studies of the Avon and Heathcote Rivers have been published by Hogan and Wilkinson (1959) and Cameron (1970). Other studies including Estuary populations as part of more extensive research have also been carried out (for a complete bibliography see Knox and Kilner, 1973). Research currently in progress, in addition to the O+ sand flounder study, include studies on the algal communities, a water chemical analysis programme and an investigation of the biology of the Christchurch Drainage Board’s <b>Sewage</b> <b>Oxidation</b> <b>Ponds.</b> A report on the general ecology of the Estuary has been prepared recently (Knox and Kilner, 1973), and this summarizes much of the above material and includes other relevant information...|$|R

Moreover, the polynomial correlation was studied {{in order to determine the}} relationship between net radiation and DO and found very high correlation coefficients in both sedimentation <b>pond</b> 1 and <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3. For the quantity of H 2 O 2, it was obtained the relationship between net radiation and H 2 O 2 in higher correlation coefficient in sedimentation <b>pond</b> 1 than <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 because of smaller amount of dissolved organic and inorganic matters in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3. It would be the reason that oxygen which occurred from phytoplankton and algae photosynthesis were not employed by organic digestion and respiration of bacteria. Therefore, it had to exist DO and accumulation only in water instead of producing H 2 O 2 in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 during daylight time. This is why H 2 O 2 in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 was not varied directly to net radiation, and also causing an indication on the relationship between net radiation and H 2 O 2 in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 lower than sedimentation pond 1. Summarily speaking, the nature of solar radiation plays vital role in encouraging producing DO and H 2 O 2 which are the important factors in bacterial organic digestion for community wastewater treatment with high efficiency. </p...|$|R

However, there are still other parameters that can be considered, but the previously mentioned have been surveyed as having the most effect on the overall treatment of wastewater within <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> or waste {{stabilization}} ponds are a {{very effective}} treatment option not only as tertiary treatment, but also {{in areas that are}} not capable of having conventional domestic wastewater treatment or other technologically advanced methods, as seen in Pena et al. (2002) in Columbia. Yet, the design of an <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> is congruent to the location of the pond, as loading rates will vary based on temperature and climate (Mara and Pearson 1998; Gloyna 1971).|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} analysis results referred {{that some of}} pollutants in the <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> exceeded the standard limit such as Al 3 +, Fe 2 +, Sr 2 +, Cr 2 +, and Ni 2 + which were attributed to both industrial effluents and domestic sewage. Therefore, {{the water of the}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> was not suitable for irrigation of plants purpose since it reflects critical environmental risks. Also the results show that the groundwater samples contain high concentrations of Al 3 +, Fe 2 +, Sr 2 + than the Who (2011) acceptable limit. The results of the groundwater flow and transport simulation reveal the expansion of pollution plume. It travelled 18, 20.4 and 22.8  km due NE direction after 30  years of simulation for Al 3 +, Fe 2 +, Sr 2 + pollutants, respectively. The results explained that the water of <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> must not use for irrigation purpose without treatment process to eliminate the high concentration of the predicted pollutants. The study gave a sound alarm to make new drilled wells far away from pollution sources and several observation wells should be installed around <b>oxidation</b> <b>ponds</b> for periodic monitoring.|$|R
