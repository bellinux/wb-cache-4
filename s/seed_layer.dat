40|$|The {{selection}} of capacitor electrode {{materials for the}} nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory {{is one of the}} most important issues because capacitor electrical characteristics are strongly influenced by the electrode materials. The lower Pt electrode was electrodeposited on the Ti seed/Pt <b>seed</b> <b>layer.</b> Two different thicknesses of Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> (5 and 15 nm) were adopted, and lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) was deposited on the electrodeposited Pt. The Pt crystal orientation with a 5 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> is much better than that with a 15 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> and the deposited PZT shows much better crystal orientation. Due to better crystal orientation of the PZT layer in the case of a 5 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> a Pt/PZT/Pt capacitor well-saturated D-V hysteresis loop was obtained whereas little current was observed in the large electric field. With the 15 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> numerous several-mu m-sized voids formed on the lower Pt electrode surface. With the 5 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> fewer voids formed on the lower Pt electrode surface. Glow discharge spectrometry measurement with a 15 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> shows much higher H intensity than that with a 5 nm Ti <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> and the H peak coincides with the Ti peak.

30|$|We {{demonstrate}} that {{the growth of the}} ZnO NWs on ultra-thin <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> is strongly influenced by the substrates and thickness of the seed films. NWs could be obtained on the smooth substrates covered with <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> whose thickness is larger than 4 [*]nm and have good alignment when roughness of the <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> is also suitable. Besides, it is found that the thickness of the <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> affects fluctuation amplitude and frequency of the roughness, which affects the alignment of the resulting NWs in succession.

40|$|Performance of {{polycrystalline}} silicon thin film solar cells {{is limited by}} high defect density solid-phase crystallised material. A common approach to obtaining {{polycrystalline silicon}} films with fewer defects is epitaxy on a high crystal quality <b>seed</b> <b>layer.</b> Such a <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> can be produced by aluminium-induced crystallisation but it results in films with heavy metal contamination. This work investigates an alternative <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> prepared by solid-phase crystallisation of heavily phosphorous doped (≥ 1 × 1020 cm- 3) ultra-thin (≤ 200 nm) silicon films which then can serve as the cell emitter. The effects of the a-Si precursor thickness and phosphorous concentration on the solid-phase crystallisation kinetics, structural and electronic qualities of the crystallised <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> are analysed. By increasing the film thickness from 50 nm to 200 nm or increasing the phosphorous concentration up to 3 × 1020 cm- 3, the time needed for complete crystallisation decreases and the structural and electronic quality of the <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> improves. Polycrystalline silicon thin film solar cells on glass are successfully fabricated by solid-phase epitaxy and vapour-phase epitaxy on the solid-phase crystallised P-doped polycrystalline silicon <b>seed</b> <b>layer.</b> Solid-phase epitaxial layers achieve much better structural quality, longer minority diffusion length and thus better solar cell performance than the vapour-phase epitaxial layers. Therefore, solid-phase epitaxy on the randomly oriented solid-phase crystallised polycrystalline silicon <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> is more suitable than the vapour-phase epitaxy. <b>Seed</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and phosphorous concentration can influence its crystal quality and thus affect the epitaxial solar cell performance. Transmission electron microscopy analysis proves that the intragrain defects (stacking faults, twins, and dislocations) originate from the <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> thus limiting the solar cell performance. In order to eliminate the intragrain defects in the <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> two different approaches are attempted: rapid thermal and diode laser annealing. Increasing peak temperature of rapid thermal annealing can effectively lower the intragrain defect density and thus improve the structural and electronic qualities of the <b>seed</b> <b>layer.</b> Consequently, both solid-phase and vapour-phase epitaxial polycrystalline solar cells on the rapid thermal processed <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> show better performance with higher cell efficiency, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and spectral response than the cells on the <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> without rapid thermal annealing. Therefore, epitaxially grown solar cell performance is directly determined {{by the quality of}} the <b>seed</b> <b>layer.</b> Line-focus diode laser annealing allows achieving a higher Si film temperature without overheating the glass substrate. Due to efficient defect elimination by laser annealing, a higher dopant activation efficiency, carrier mobility and lower sheet resistance are achieved. However, after epitaxial growth on the diode laser annealed <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> the interface between <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> and epi-layer contains a large density of planar defects. These interface defects strongly limit the quality improvement by the diode laser annealing. Finally, comparison between the solid-phase crystallisation and solid-phase epitaxy on the <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> are made. The <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> approach does not result in better solar cell performance than the solid-phase crystallisation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis proves that the defects located at the interface between <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> and epi-layer can limit the solar cell performance of the epitaxial grown polycrystalline silicon...|$|E

This surface complex decreases pure ZnO nucleation on the <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> surface. Additionally, a thin amorphous Al 2 O 3 layer disrupts the crystalline continuity of the subsequent ALD ZnO, thereby effectively screening the inherent surface polarity of the ZnO and finally inducing a 2 -D zinc hydroxyl compound nanosheet formation on the <b>seed</b> <b>layer.</b> With increasing ALD cycles of ZnO in the <b>seed</b> <b>layer,</b> the morphology of the nanostructure changes from a 2 -D nanosheet to 1 -D nanorods by recovering the natural crystallinity and polarity of ZnO. Thus, the nanorod morphology greatly depends on {{the property of the}} substrate surface or <b>seed</b> <b>layer</b> surface, which is considered a key factor. The thin ALD ZnO nucleation layer conformally covered the knotty nanosheet to produce the nanorod.

The AIC <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> themselves were found to be major sources of intragrain defects. Moreover, AIC <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> prepared under different conditions can lead to different intragrain defect densitie...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, hot wire {{chemical}} vapor deposition HWCVD has been explored as a low temperature process for epitaxially thickening c Si <b>seeds</b> <b>layers</b> on low cost substrates. Here, we demonstrate HWCVD epitaxy on thin polycrystalline silicon <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> on borosilicate glass substrates. The crystal Si seeds are large grained 10 amp; 956;m polycrystalline silicon that were fabricated by Al induced crystallization of a Si. We report the growth of 0. 5 amp; 956;m of epitaxy at 670...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMastering the {{structural}} ordering of ZnO <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> by sol–gel process {{in terms of}} ultrathin thickness (i. e, < 10 nm), strong c-axis texture, low mosaicity, low porosity, and low roughness is a critical challenge {{for the formation of}} well-ordered ZnO nanowires in solution. The effects of the solution concentration, of the withdrawal speed, and of the annealing process on the formation mechanisms of ZnO <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> deposited by single dip process are revealed. The size and density of primary clusters in the sol are found to govern the evolution of the film thickness and nanoparticle average diameter through the solution concentration. The Landau–Levich theory modeling the dragging process accounts for the evolution of the film thickness only before annealing and over a reduced range of withdrawal speeds. The texture mechanisms along the c-axis are driven by particle/particle interactions during annealing and explained in the light of thermodynamic considerations. They are further determined locally by electron backscattered diffraction. Importantly, an alternative annealing process under argon flux is specifically developed for sol–gel process and is shown to form remarkably well-textured, compact ZnO <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> with a very low mosaicity and porosity as well as a thin thickness as small as 10 nm. These ZnO <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> lead to the growth of well-ordered ZnO nanowires by chemical bath deposition with a remarkable mean tilt angle smaller than 6 ° as deduced by X-ray pole figures. These findings represent a significant step toward the more efficient integration of ZnO <b>seed</b> <b>layers</b> grown by sol–gel process into ZnO nanowire-based devices...|$|R
