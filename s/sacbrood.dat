40|$|<b>Sacbrood</b> disease, an affliction {{of honey}} bees (Apis mellifera) {{characterized}} by brood {{that fails to}} pupate and subsequently dies, is an important threat to honey bee health. The disease {{is caused by the}} <b>sacbrood</b> virus (SBV), a positive-, single-stranded RNA virus in the order Picornavirales. Because of the economic importance of honey bees for both pollination and honey production, it is vital to understand and monitor the spread of viruses such as SBV. This virus has been found in many places across the globe, including recently in some South American countries, and it is likely that it will continue to spread. We performed a preliminary study to search for SBV in two apiaries of Africanized honey bees in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and found the first evidence of SBV in honey bee colonies in Brazil.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the occurrence of honeybee diseases in Incheon area, {{at the point of}} great wide-spread of <b>sacbrood</b> disease in the country. Sixteen resident beekeeping apiaries; 3 native honeybee and 13 European honeybee apiaries were selected for this research. Over 20 adult bees were evenly collected from the most colonies of each apiary three times (March, June, November) within a year. In this work, 13 honeybee diseases including 7 viral diseases, 2 bacterial diseases, 2 fungal diseases, and 2 parasitic diseases were detected by preliminary inspections and PCR. As a result, viral infections were confirmed at 34 among 48 apiaries (70. 8 %) over the entire examination period. Parasitic diseases showed the high-est detection rate of 45. 8 %, which are detected in 44 among 96 cases. In the seasonal prevalence, 30 cases (15. 6 %) of 7 pathogens were detected from 14 apiaries in March, 50 cases (24. 0 %) of 9 pathogens and 56 cases (26. 9 %) of 9 pathogens were detected from all apiaries in June and November, respectively. Nosema was shown to be the most prevalent pathogen from March to November, followed by <b>sacbrood</b> virus (SBV) and stonebrood.

In Belgium, programmes on the restocking of honey bee hives have run for many years. Overall, the success ratio of this queen breeding programme has been only around 50 %. To tackle this low efficacy, we organized sanitary controls of the breeding queens in 2012 and 2014. Results: We found a high quantity of viruses, with more than 75 % of the egg samples being infected {{with at least one}} virus. The most abundant viruses were Deformed Wing Virus and <b>Sacbrood</b> Virus (>= 40 %), although Lake Sinai Virus and Acute Bee Paralysis Virus were also occasionally detected (between 10 - 30 %). In addition, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus strain Brookings, Black Queen Cell Virus, Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus occurred at very low prevalences (<= 5 %). Remarkably, we found Apis mellifera carnica bees to be less infected with Deformed Wing Virus than Buckfast bees (p < 0. 01), and also found them to have a lower average total number of infecting viruses (p < 0. 001). This is a significant finding, given that Deformed Wing Virus has earlier been shown to be a contributory factor to winter mortality and Colony Collapse Disorder. Moreover, negative-strand detection of <b>Sacbrood</b> Virus in eggs was demonstrated for the first time. Conclusions: High pathogen loads were observed in this sanitary control program.

40|$|<b>Sacbrood</b> virus (SBV) is {{the causal}} agent {{of a disease}} of honey bee larvae, {{resulting}} in failure to pupate and causing death. The typical clinical symptom of SBV is an accumulation of SBV-rich fluid in swollen subcuticular pouches, forming the characteristic fluid-filled sac that gives {{its name to the}} disease. Outbreaks of the disease have been reported in different countries, affecting the development of the brood and causing losses in honey bee colonies. Today, few data are available on the SBV viral load in the case of overt disease in larvae, or for the behavioural changes of SBV-infected adult bees. A two-step real-time RT-PCR assay, based on TaqMan (R) technology using a fluorescent probe (FAM-TAMRA) was therefore developed to quantify <b>Sacbrood</b> virus in larvae, pupae and adult bees from symptomatic apiaries. This assay was first validated according to the recent XP-U 47 - 600 standard issued by the French Standards Institute, where the reliability and the repeatability of the results and the performance of the assay were confirmed. The performance of the qPCR assay was validated over the 6 log range of the standard curve (i. e. from 10 (2) to 10 (8) copies per well) with a measurement uncertainty evaluated at 0. 11 log(10). The detection and quantitation limits were established respectively at 50 copies and 100 copies of SBV genome, for a template volume of 5 mu l of cDNA. The RT-qPCR assay was applied during a French SBV outbreak in 2012 where larvae with typical SBV signs were collected, along with individuals without clinical signs. The SBV quantitation revealed that, in symptomatic larvae, the virus load was significantly higher than in samples without clinical signs. Combining quantitation with clinical data, a threshold of SBV viral load related to an overt disease was proposed (10 (10) SBV genome copies per individual) ...|$|E

While laboratory data repeatedly show significant propolis effects, field data are scarce, especially at the colony level. Here, we investigated whether propolis, as naturally deposited in the nests, can protect honeybees against ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and associated viruses, which are currently considered the most serious biological threat to European honeybee subspecies, Apis mellifera, globally. Propolis intake of 10 field colonies was manipulated by either reducing or adding freshly collected propolis. Mite infestations, titers of deformed wing virus (DWV) and <b>sacbrood</b> virus (SBV), resin intake, as well as colony strength were recorded monthly from July to September 2013. We additionally examined the effect of raw propolis volatiles on mite survival in laboratory assays. Our results showed no significant effects of adding or removing propolis on mite survival and infestation levels. However, in relation to V. destructor, DWV titers increased significantly less in colonies with added propolis than in propolis-removed colonies, whereas SBV titers were similar. Colonies with added propolis were also significantly stronger than propolis-removed colonies. These findings indicate that propolis may interfere with the dynamics of V. destructor-transmitted viruses, thereby further emphasizing the importance of propolis for honeybee health...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sacbrood</b> virus (SBV) is a picorna-like {{virus that}} affects honey bees (Apis mellifera) {{and results in}} the death of the larvae. Several {{procedures}} are available to detect Chinese SBV (CSBV) in clinical samples, but not to estimate the level of CSBV infection. The aim of this study was develop an assay for rapid detection and quantification of this virus. Primers and probes were designed that were specific for CSBV structural protein genes. A TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probe-based, fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR was established. The specificity, sensitivity and stability of the assay were assessed; specificity was high and there were no cross-reactivity with healthy larvae or other bee viruses. The assay was applied to detect CSBV in 37 clinical samples and its efficiency was compared with clinical diagnosis, electron microscopy observation, and conventional RT-PCR. The TaqMan MGB-based probe fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR for CSBV was more sensitive than other methods tested. This assay was a reliable, fast, and sensitive method that was used successfully to detect CSBV in clinical samples. The technology can provide a useful tool for rapid detection of CSBV. This study has established a useful protocol for CSBV testing, epidemiological investigation, and development of animal models...|$|E
40|$|Viruses seem {{to play a}} {{key role}} in European honey bee, Apis mellifera health, and have a much broader host {{spectrum}} than previously thought. Few studies have investigated interspecific virus transfer within the genus Apis. The introduction of A. mellifera into Asia exposed endemic Apis species to the risk of obtaining new viruses or viral strains and vice versa. To investigate the potential for host shifts, virus prevalence and sequences were monitored over three years in single and mixed-species apiaries hosting introduced A. mellifera and endemic Apis cerana. Deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and <b>sacbrood</b> virus (SBV) were found, but not KBV, VDV- 1, ABPV, or CBPV. Virus infections and prevalence were generally lower in A. cerana compared to A. mellifera, and varied over the years. The sequence data provided evidence for interspecific transfer of IAPV, BQCV, and DWV, but SBV strains seem to be species specific. Prevalence and sequence results taken together indicate that interspecific transfers of viruses are rare, even if honey bees are kept in close proximity. We discuss the pattern observed in the context host specificity and resistance. Our understanding of the extent of these exchanges is limited by a lack of knowledge on the mechanisms of adaptation of viruses to different hosts...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} {{of the association of}} honeybee viruses with other honeybee parasites, primarily the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, and their implication in the mass mortality of honeybee colonies has resulted in increasing awareness and interest in honeybee viruses. In addition the identification, monitoring and prevention of spread of bee viruses is of considerable importance, particularly when considering the lack of information on the natural incidence of virus infections in honeybee populations worldwide. A total of eighteen honeybee viruses have been identified and physically characterized. Most of them have physical features resembling picornaviruses, and are referred to as picorna-like viruses. The complete genome sequences of four picorna-like honeybee viruses, namely Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), <b>Sacbrood</b> Virus (SBV) and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) have been determined. The availability of this sequence data has lead to great advances in the studies on honeybee viruses. In particular, the development of a reverse genetics system for BQCV, will open new opportunities for studies directed at understanding the molecular biology, persistence, pathogenesis, and interaction of these bee viruses with other parasites. This review focuses on the contribution of the Honeybee Virus Research Group (HBVRG), from the University of the Western Cape of South Africa, in the development of molecular tools for the study of molecular biology and pathology of these viruses...|$|E
40|$|Chinese <b>sacbrood</b> virus (CSBV) was {{purified}} from diseased insects, and its genome was cloned and sequenced. The genomic RNA of CSBV is 8863 nucleotides {{in length}} and contains a single large open reading frame encoding a 319. 614 [*]kDa polyprotein. The coding sequence is flanked by a 178 -nucleotide 5 ′ nontranslated leader sequence and a 142 -nucleotide 3 ′ nontranslated region, followed a poly(A) tail. Four major structural proteins, VP 1,VP 2, VP 3 and VP 4, were predicted in the N-teminal of the polyprotein. The C-terminal part of the polyprotein contains sequence motifs which is a typical and well-characterized picornavirus nonstructural proteins: an RNA helicase, a chymotrypsin-like 3 C protease, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Genetic analysis shows that the CSBV-LN had a 13 -amino-acid deletion at amino acid positions 710 – 719 and 727 – 729 in comparison with CSBV-GZ and SBV-UK, and the SBV-UK had a 7 -amino-acid deletion at amino acid positions 2124 – 2132 in comparison with CSBV-GZ and CSBV-LN, and the CSBV-GZ and CSBV-LN had a 6 -amino-acid deletion at amino acid positions 2143 – 2150 in comparison with SBV-UK. Phylogenetic analysis using RdRp of selected picorna-like viruses shows that CSBV/SBV and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) tend to group together, which possesses an RNA of similar size and gene order...|$|E
40|$|Honey bee virus {{prevalence}} {{data are}} an essential prerequisite for managing epidemic {{events in a}} population. A survey study was carried out for seven viruses in colonies repre-senting a healthy Danish honey bee population. In addition, colonies from apiaries with high level Varroa infestation or high level of winter mortality were also surveyed. Results from RT-qPCR showed a considerable difference of virus levels between healthy and sick colo-nies. In the group of healthy colonies, no virus was detected in 36 % of cases, while at least one virus was found {{in each of the}} sick colonies. Virus titers varied among the samples, and multiple virus infections were common in both groups with a high prevalence of <b>Sacbrood</b> virus (SBV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV). Based on the distribution of virus titers, we established four categories of infection: samples free of virus (C = 0), samples with low virus titer (estimated number of virus copies 0 < C < 103), samples with medium virus titer (103 C < 107) and samples with high virus titer (C 107). This allowed us to statistically compare virus levels in healthy and sick colonies. Using catego-ries to communicate virus diagnosis results to beekeepers may help them to reach an informed decision on management strategies to prevent further spread of viruses among colonies...|$|E
