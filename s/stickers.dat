5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity <b>stickers.</b> The children place <b>stickers</b> on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of <b>stickers</b> is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for <b>stickers,</b> which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the <b>stickers</b> he is wearing. Fung removes the <b>stickers</b> from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the <b>stickers</b> and runs off.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sticker</b> {{systems were}} {{introduced}} in 1998 {{as one of the}} DNA computing models by using the recombination behavior of DNA molecules. The Watson-Crick complementary principle of DNA molecules is abstractly used in the <b>sticker</b> systems to perform the computation of <b>sticker</b> systems. In this paper, the generative power of weighted one-sided <b>sticker</b> systems and weighted regular <b>sticker</b> systems are investigated. Moreover, the relationship of the families of languages generated by these two variants of <b>sticker</b> systems to the Chomsky hierarchy is also presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sticker</b> {{system has}} been {{introduced}} in 1994 {{as a model for}} DNA computing using the re-combination behaviour of DNA molecules. A <b>sticker</b> model is an abstract computational model which uses the Watson-Crick complementarity principle of DNA molecules. Starting from the incomplete double-stranded sequences, and by iterative sticking operations, complete double-stranded sequences are obtained. It is known that <b>sticker</b> systems with finite sets of axioms and <b>sticker</b> rules generate only regular languages. Hence, different types of restrictions have been considered to increase the computational power of <b>sticker</b> systems. In a special type of <b>sticker</b> system known as bidirectional <b>sticker</b> system, the sticking operation occurs at both left and right hand side of the axioms simultaneously. Recently, probabilistic <b>sticker</b> systems have been introduced where the probabilities are initially associated with the axioms or strings, and the probability of the generated string is computed by multiplying the probabilities of all occurrences of the initial strings. In this paper, some properties of probabilistic bidirectional <b>sticker</b> system are investigated. We prove that probabilistic bidirectional <b>sticker</b> system can also increase the computational power of the languages generated...|$|R

5|$|Brawl {{allows the}} player to select from 39 characters. Some are new, but others return from Melee—in some cases updated or refined, either in appearance, {{fighting}} capabilities, or both. For example, Link and Fox have adopted designs from more recent titles, while Samus has gained {{the ability to}} change into a new form, Zero Suit Samus. Dr. Mario, Roy, Young Link, Mewtwo, and Pichu are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as <b>stickers</b> or trophies.|$|E

Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted with soft, padded over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design.

5000|$|University of California, Santa Barbara: In summer 2009, about 200 vinyl were {{installed}} on the exterior sidewall of fume hoods in seven buildings at UC Santa Barbara. The <b>sticker</b> uses a traffic light color scheme, with a red zone above 18 inches, and a large arrow pointing down with the words, “More Safe, Less Energy” changing from yellow at the midpoint to green at the bottom when the sash is closed completely. Surveys were conducted by collecting real-time sash position data provided by the campus’ building monitoring system (BMS). Data were collected for 10-day periods prior to <b>sticker</b> installation for select fume hoods, and one, two, and three months following <b>sticker</b> installation. The average sash height for each hood was calculated for each 10-day period. In the Engineering Science Building, average sash opening was ~15 inches prior to <b>sticker</b> installation, ~6.5 inches 3 months after <b>sticker</b> installation, and ~9.5 inches 23 months after <b>sticker</b> installation. In the California NansoSystems Institute building, average sash opening was ~7.5 inches prior to <b>sticker</b> installation, ~6 inches 3 months after <b>sticker</b> installation, and ~5 inches 23 months after <b>sticker</b> installation.|$|R

5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers.
