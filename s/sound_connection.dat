From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries". The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, called the causal action principle. In addition to the basics, the book provides all the necessary mathematical background and explains how the causal action principle gives rise to the interactions of the standard model plus gravity on the level of second-quantized fermionic fields coupled to classical bosonic fields. The focus is on getting a mathematically <b>sound</b> <b>connection</b> between causal fermion systems and physical systems in Minkowski space.

40|$|Weight reduction, {{achieved}} {{through the use}} of materials with high mechanical strength and, in terms of shape, by adopting visually light structures, gave rise to the design of constructions with low self-weight, which were therefore sensitive to the effects of live loads. This sensitivity is particularly acute in the case of footbridges, where pedestrian traffic translates into dynamic forces that can lead to resonance, since pacing frequencies would be similar to the natural frequencies of the structure itself. In general, the problem is one of serviceability. The footbridge over the River Adige at Legnago (Northern Italy), designed by some of the authors(1) of this paper, showed a marked sensitivity to repeated horizontal forces that tended to cause transversal and torsional vibration around its longitudinal axis. This paper examines how an analysis of Natural Frequencies (NF) and modal response revealed the excessive deformability of the piers to be the key reason for the structure to behave in this way. As a result, a design solution was adopted that involved a more <b>sound</b> <b>connection</b> between the heads of the new and existing piers. In regard to the serviceability behaviour with respect to vibrations caused by human-induced dynamic loads, the NF analysis showed that the added links improved the behaviour of the structure. However, some natural frequencies remained close to the range of typical human pacing frequencies (walking, running or jumping). A dynamic analysis was therefore performed, the results of which are presented {{in the second part of}} the work - with the aim of ensuring that comfort conditions are verified. Finally, the experimental frequency determination enabled the design solution to be checked, demonstrating the excellent ability of the Finite Element Model used to predict dynamic structural behaviour.

40|$|The contourite {{paradigm}} {{was conceived}} {{a few decades}} ago, yet there remains a need to establish a <b>sound</b> <b>connection</b> between contourite deposits, basin evolution and oceanographic processes. Significant recent advances have been enabled by various factors, including the establishment of two IGCP projects and the realisation of several IODP expeditions. Contourites were first described in the Northern and Southern Atlantic Ocean, and since then, have been discovered in every major ocean basin and even in lakes. The 120 major contourite areas presently known are associated to myriad oceanographic processes in surface, intermediate and deep-water masses. The increasing recognition of these deposits is influencing palaeoclimatology & palaeoceanography, slope-stability/geological hazard assessment, and hydrocarbon exploration. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need for {{a better understanding of}} the sedimentological and oceanographic processes governing contourites, which involve dense bottom currents, tides, eddies, deep-sea storms, internal waves and tsunamis. Furthermore, in light of the latest knowledge on oceanographic processes and other governing factors (e. g. sediment supply and sea-level), existing facies models must now be revised. Persistent oceanographic processes significantly affect the seafloor, resulting in large-scale depositional and erosional features. Various classifications have been proposed to subdivide a continuous spectrum of partly overlapping features. Although much progress has been made in the large-scale, geophysically based recognition of these deposits, there remains a lack of unambiguous and commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for deciphering the small-scaled contourite facies and for distinguishing them from turbidite ones. Similarly, the study of sandy deposits generated or affected by bottom currents, which is still in its infancy, offers great research potential: these deposits might prove invaluable as future reservoir targets. Expectations for the forthcoming analysis of data from the IODP Expedition 339 are high, as this work promises to tackle much of the aforementioned lack of knowledge. In the near future, geologists, oceanographers and benthic biologists will have to work in concert to achieve synergy in contourite research to demonstrate the importance of bottom currents in continental margin sedimentation and evolution.

40|$|As {{stated in}} the {{preamble}} of the founding Treaty of the European Economic Community (EEC) of 1957, the essential goal of European integration, {{is to improve the}} living and employment situation (usually measured in terms of per-capita GDP and unemployment rate) of EU citizens. From an economic perspective, this depends on the optimal allocation of scarce resources and production factors, as well as the distribution of the income earned with and through them. According to the neoclassical economic theory, allocative efficiency and thus an achievement of a welfare maximum, and an income convergence can only succeed in a common European Single Market without barriers to production factors, goods and services. The European economic policy obviously does not belief that the European Single Market is able to achieve these goals alone. The existing economic gap between the 27 member states of the EU with its 271 regions should be actively shaped by a European regional policy (notably the Structural Funds). In comparison to other domestic markets, e. g. the U. S., where regional policy plays a subordinate role, the EU is going a different way. It is noticeable in this context, that the internal mobility of U. S. citizens, who simply leave economically weak or declining regions, is significantly higher. Therefore, this paper attempts from a purely economic point of view to answer the question in which way the allocative and distributive objectives of European integration can be better achieved by the current European regional policy or by (more) internal mobility of EU citizens like in the USA? That is why {{at the beginning of the}} paper, the effects of migration on allocation and distribution in an integrated market are studied within the context of various economic theories. At the same time these theories are the general theoretical basis for regional policy, so that we can elaborate their implications for the European Single market, too. Subsequently, the current situation concerning European internal migration and the EU Structural Funds is presented. By comparing theory, the present situation and empirical findings regarding internal migration and European regional policy, the last chapter is analyzing if there is an empirically <b>sound</b> <b>connection</b> between the European regional policies on the one hand and internal migration on the other hand in terms of achieving the allocative and distributive goals of European integration. In the end we try to answer the question whether intra-European migration is either a threat, as in the context of all previous enlargements of the EU it was often considered, or even a precondition for an improved living and employment situation of the EU-citizens facing the European integration process. The answers to this question can deliver important implications for necessary changes in the EU's regional policy and its structural funds. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{stress of}} {{democracy}} {{which is the}} ideal administrative method of modern societies can briefly be defined as theruling of those elected by the people under their own will, the equality and equal rights for the citizens. The functioning ofdemocracy is possible with the existence of institutions organized with certain rules. Bureaucracy covers this definition and is themain agent for the execution of democracy in an unproblematic way. Furthermore, bureaucracy which implies a form oforganization determined by rules and laws in {{all levels of the}} state embodies also structures required by the political organizationlegally holding the power to rule the people. Thought within this context, the harmonious functioning of the structures created bythe elected and the bureaucratic institutions consisting of appointees appears to be a vital necessity for the execution ofdemocracy. However, it is possible to state that these institutions bear some structural and functional problems in practice. In general the term bureaucracy which refers to the execution of procedures and actions, valid in a certain administrativesystem, by authorized and specialized persons, was first used in France in the mid-seventeenth century. The term was derivedfrom the French word “bureau” meaning “office” in English. The other word completing the term “cratie” has its roots in oldGreek and means power and domination (Şahin, 1998 : 2). The various approaches to describing the features of bureaucracy diversify the definition of the concept. The first approachdefines bureaucracy by stressing the structural features of an organization. In this context we are confronted with a bureaucracycarrying certain characteristics as division of labour, hierarchy and procedure systems. The second approach, which pays moreattention to behavioural features, refers to positive organizational aspects such as objectivity, certainty, accuracy, file info andconsistency as well as to negative aspects like avoidance of responsibility, paperwork, rigidity, excessive secrecy, unwillingness inthe exercise and delegation of authorization (Heady’den akt. Eryılmaz, 2008 : 6, 7). Parallel to the definitions related to bureaucracy,a variety in bureaucratic theories can be observed. Hegel, Marx and Weber can be named as prominent figures contributingtheoretically to the bureaucratic literature. Another theory contributing to the theories is the elitist theory. In understanding the relationship between politics and bureaucracy and especially between the bureaucrat and the politician,three different approaches come to the forefront. The first and accepted approach is that the political system determines thepolicy to be applied and the bureaucracy applies the determined policy as demanded. The aspect putting this approach forth is theinspection of the politicians on bureaucracy and bureaucrats. The mechanism is realized with the inspection of bureaucracy bypoliticians and the obedience of bureaucrats to politicians (Durgun, 2002 : 84) and bureaucrats are ideally seen as a ruling staffwithout political choices, a staff approaching facts impartially and applying every decision made by the politicians (Bayır, 2007 : 45). The second approach, on the other hand, denies the political-ruling distinction, bureaucracy has both an administrative andpolitical role, and bureaucrats are in general an intrinsic aspect of governance and the policy process. The advocates of this viewthink that the relationship of politicians and bureaucrats is rational, complementing, interactive and interlocked rather thanhierarchic. The fact that bureaucrats play an active role in society and politics contributes to justice, equality and public good(Eryılmaz, 2008 : 96). The development of a strong democratic administration within society requires above all the existence of sophisticated,conscious and productive citizens and also a rational, participatory and responsible political construction. The public in a societywhere democracy is existent as a ruling method refers to right, appropriate and equal treatment in the actions and also to thesupport of the usage of citizenship rights in terms of democratic rights like liberty, justice, freedom, equality and impartiality(Yıldırım, 2009 : 103, 4). In this context it can be spoken of an existence of a positive and meaningful relationship in the frameworkof equality and equal rights between democracy and bureaucracy. The fact that bureaucracy has not individual but universalcriteria in modern state administrations, that is bureaucratic rules and authority are based on non-personal principles, is inharmony with democracy, which has a claim of considering everyone equal before the law. However, this situation does notalways bear the same results. (Mouzelis, 2003 : 25 - 6). On the other hand, the values of democracy are meaningful in terms ofpreventing the bureaucracy to create a closed group of officials and the decrease of authority of the official staff consisting ofappointees. Therefore, democracy which is in favour of an order created by the majority presents a contrast with the thought ofcreating an elite administrative structure (Öztürk, 2003 : 36). The sources transforming bureaucracy to an important power centre are the same sources that make the bureaucracy of whatit is and lead to its consideration within society as a legitimate institution in terms of its functions. At this point the knowledgeand expertise of the bureaucrats come first into foreground. Bureaucracy as an institution collecting, archiving and managinginformation holds the information the government needs and the technical expertise needed for the understanding andinterpretation of this information (Eryılmaz, 2008 : 98). Besides the knowledge and expertise of the bureaucrats being effective inthe determination of the policies to be applied, this makes them also professionals in applying the policies. Characteristics such asprofessionalism, a permanent and stable status, possessing a certain institutional ideology and quick decision making, the power ofplanning and budgeting render the bureaucrat an important actor in the state administration. When considering the power sourcesof political institutions and especially politicians, we first think of the legitimacy of political institutions. In this context, politiciansrepresenting legitimate authority have the right to allocate the financing required in the functioning of public bureaucracy in thebudget process. Moreover, they can mobilize and enhance their representative power through their relations with political partiesand pressure groups because they stand on a certain voter base. Furthermore, political leaders can produce alternative informationsources by creating their own expert staff other than the present bureaucratic structure (Eryılmaz, 2008 : 98 - 108 / Öztürk, 2003 : 119 - 125). However, the power sources of politics are abstract against the power sources of bureaucracy especially because ofits discontinuity. In bureaucracy, on the other hand, a daily functioning process makes its existence stronger. The incompatibility of interests between the bureaucrat and politician can also be seen as one of the sources for conflictbetween bureaucracy and politics. While the politician aims to get more votes, the bureaucrat aims to obtain a greater budget andto protect the institutional benefit and struggles for it. Therefore, although they seem to pursuit common values like servingsociety, the difference in benefits maximized by politicians and bureaucrats lead to tension. Problems experienced within bureaucracy and present political structures can negatively affect the realization ofresponsibilities towards society in the implementation of democracy. The most important of all is related to trust. We areconfronted with the reality, observable in the social structure, that individuals expecting to make use of equal rights and servicesby authorizing their initiatives to these institutions do not really trust these institutions. In addition, this situation can be one ofthe main reasons for the differentiation between state and society by harming the trust felt for institutional structures. At thispoint it is important to adopt a view putting priority to individuals expecting service in the state administration. Furthermore,non-governmental organizations setting a bridge for a <b>sound</b> <b>connection</b> between state and society are also one of the structuresplaying {{an important role in the}} functioning of bureaucracy and politics. In this context, non-governmental organizationsobtaining their power from civil will hold to some extend the power to contribute to the creation of a democratic order bymonitoring these institutions. But the existence of such a civil society requires the existence of citizens aware of their rights andresponsibilities. To put it briefly, the appropriate functioning of democracy, which is the ideal administrative method of today’ssocieties, seems to be dependent on the relationship of an order where institutions guarding the benefits of society exist and areinspected by non-governmental organizations created by responsible individual...|$|E

In Amsterdam {{and in a few}} places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is also <b>sounded</b> in <b>connection</b> with the processions. The latter practice reflects the idea that Hoshana Rabbah {{is the end of the}} High Holy Day season, when the world is judged for the coming year. Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being a joy filled day some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Birchat Cohanim/Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service. Some communities such as Bobov will only do this if it is on Friday. However this practice is not generally done.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Horticultural Show 2011 (Bundesgartenschau 2011) {{was held}} from 15 April to 16 October 2011 in Koblenz, Germany. It {{was the first}} Federal Horticultural Show {{in the state of}} Rhineland-Palatinate. Venues had been the plateau in front of the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress, the square in front of the Electoral Palace and flower beds in the area around the Deutsches Eck. One of its attractions was the cable car over the Rhine, which was {{established}} as an ecologically <b>sound</b> transport <b>connection.</b> It connects the Rhine shores near the Basilica of St. Kastor with the plateau in front of the fortress. Unlike previous garden shows, the staging area in Koblenz was mainly in the centre of the city and directly affected the local population. In addition to the prestige of hosting a Federal Horticultural Show, Koblenz benefited to a much greater extent from the associated urban development.|$|R
