5000|$|<b>Spinosad</b> {{is a novel}} mode-of-action {{insecticide}} {{derived from}} a family of natural products obtained by fermentation of S. spinosa. Spinosyns occur in over 20 natural forms, and over 200 synthetic forms (spinosoids) have been produced in the lab. [...] <b>Spinosad</b> contains a mix of two spinosoids, spinosyn A, the major component, and spinosyn D (the minor component), in a roughly 17:3 ratio.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spinosad</b> is an {{insecticide}} {{based on}} chemical compounds {{found in the}} bacterial species Saccharopolyspora spinosa. The genus Saccharopolyspora was discovered in 1985 in isolates from crushed sugarcane which produce yellowish-pink aerial hyphae, with bead-like chains of spores enclosed in a characteristic hairy sheath. [...] This genus is defined as aerobic, Gram-positive, nonacid-fast actinomycetes with fragmenting substrate mycelium. S. spinosa was isolated from soil collected inside a nonoperational sugar mill rum still in the Virgin Islands. <b>Spinosad</b> {{is a mixture of}} chemical compounds in the spinosyn family that has a generalized structure consisting of a unique tetracyclic ring system attached to an amino sugar (D-forosamine) and a neutral sugar (tri-Ο-methyl-L-rhamnose). [...] <b>Spinosad</b> is relatively nonpolar and not easily dissolved in water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spinosad</b> {{has high}} efficacy, a broad insect pest spectrum, low {{mammalian}} toxicity, {{and a good}} environmental profile, a unique feature of the insecticide compared to others currently used {{for the protection of}} grain products. It is regarded as natural product-based, and approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous national and international certifications. <b>Spinosad</b> residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years.|$|E
50|$|Leaf miners are {{regarded}} as pests by many farmers and gardeners as they can cause damage to agricultural crops and garden plants, and {{can be difficult to}} control with insecticide sprays as they are protected inside the plant's leaves. Spraying the infected plants with <b>Spinosad,</b> an organic insecticide, will control the leaf miner. <b>Spinosad</b> does not kill on contact but must be ingested by the leaf miner. Two or three applications may be needed in a season, being careful not to spray when bees are around.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spinosad</b> {{has been}} used {{around the world for}} the control of a variety of insect pests, {{including}} Lepidoptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Hymenoptera, and many others. [...] It was first registered as a pesticide in the United States for use on crops in 1997. [...] Its labeled use rate is set at 1 ppm (1 mg a.i./kg of grain) and its maximum residue limit (MRL) or tolerance is set at 1.5 ppm. Spinosad’s widespread commercial launch was deferred, awaiting final MRL or tolerance approvals in a few remaining grain-importing countries. It is considered a natural product, thus is approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous nations. Two other uses for <b>spinosad</b> are for pets and humans. <b>Spinosad</b> has recently been used in oral preparations to treat C. felis, the cat flea, in canines and felines; the optimal dose set for canines is reported to be 30 mg/kg.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{insecticides}} {{used for}} the treatment of head lice include organochlorines (lindane), organophosphates (malathion), carbamates (carbaryl), pyrethrins (pyrethrum), pyrethroids (permethrin, phenothrin, bioallethrin), and <b>spinosad</b> (spinosyn A and spinosyn D).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spinosad</b> {{is highly}} active, by both contact and ingestion, in {{numerous}} insect species. [...] Its overall protective effect varies with insect species and life stage. It affects certain species {{only in the}} adult stage, but can affect other species at more than one life stage. The species subject to very high rates of mortality as larvae, but not as adults, may gradually be controlled through sustained larval mortality. [...] The mode of action of spinosoid insecticides is by a neural mechanism. [...] The spinosyns and spinosoids have a novel mode of action, primarily targeting binding sites on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the insect nervous system that are distinct from those at which other insecticides have their activity. Spinosoid binding leads to disruption of acetylcholine neurotransmission. <b>Spinosad</b> also has secondary effects as a Ɣ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter agonist. It kills insects by hyperexcitation of the insect nervous system. <b>Spinosad</b> so far has proven not to cause cross-resistance to any other known insecticide.|$|E
50|$|Some {{populations of}} T. absoluta have {{developed}} resistance to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides. Newer compounds such as <b>spinosad,</b> imidacloprid, and Bacillus thuringiensis have demonstrated some efficacy in controlling European outbreaks of this moth.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{insecticides}} such as cypermethrin and deltamethrin are efficient, {{but must}} be thoroughly applied inside the bush and under leaves. Natural pyrethrin insecticides, extracted from Chrysanthemum and mixed with colza oil, can also be used. <b>Spinosad,</b> based on chemical compounds found in a bacterium, is also efficient.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe, {{the blue}} willow beetle is the most severe {{herbivore}} on Willows. For plantations of common osier (Salix viminalis), herbivory reducing biomass production by up to 40% has been estimated [...] It is susceptible to Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis and also <b>Spinosad</b> when treatment is applied to affected plants.|$|E
50|$|Pyriprole applied as a spot-on {{is highly}} {{effective}} against fleas and several ticks species. Efficacy against fleas {{is comparable to}} that of other modern insecticidal active ingredients such as fipronil, imidacloprid, spinetoram or <b>spinosad.</b> As most flea spot-ons it controls existing flea and tick infestations in about 1 to 2 days, and provides about 4 weeks protection against re-infestations.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} {{can also}} be chemically removed through use of pesticides. Pesticides like the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis can be sprayed to control young larvae. Larger populations of older larvae can be controlled with a residual insecticide, but damage is rarely sufficient to warrant treatment that may endanger {{the rest of the}} local environment. Biorational pesticides like insecticidal soap, pyrethins, <b>spinosad,</b> and tenbufenozide {{can also be}} used.|$|E
50|$|Biopesticides are {{perceived}} as environmentally safe due to their natural origins. However, {{recent studies have shown}} lethal and sublethal risks to local pollinators as unintended consequences of biopesticide usage. M. quadrifasciata is an important native pollinator in Brazil, and was therefore used to study the effects of biopesticides on pollinators. It was found that the pesticides <b>spinosad</b> and imidacloprid—commonly used against crop pests—greatly impaired worker respiration, group activity, and flight in M. quadrifasciata.|$|E
5000|$|An {{unblinded}} study {{performed on}} groups of 10 rats per dose level run using direct oral doses of commercially prepared insectide found some effects at higher doses, but confirmed that <b>spinosad</b> had much less negative effects than malathion. Chronic exposure studies failed to induce tumor formation in rats and mice; mice given up to 51 mg/kg/day for 18 months resulted in no tumor formation. Similarly, administration of 25 mg/kg/day to rats for 24 months {{did not result}} in tumor formation.|$|E
50|$|The aim of {{treatment}} is {{to relieve the}} allergy-induced itch, and to remove the fleas from the pet and its home environment. In some cases secondary bacterial or yeast infections will also need treatment before the itching subsides. Environmental flea control includes using flea foggers or bombs, vacuuming and treating pet bedding by washing on a hot cycle (over 60 degrees Celsius) in the washing machine. The current on-pet treatment recommended by veterinary dermatologists is <b>spinosad</b> (Comfortis) monthly and nitenpyram (Capstar or generics) every 48 hours until improvement.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is a {{bacterial}} disease that affects Lepidopterans {{and some other}} insects. Toxins produced by strains of this bacterium are used as a larvicide against caterpillars, beetles, and mosquitoes. Toxins from Saccharopolyspora spinosa are isolated from fermentations and sold as <b>Spinosad.</b> Because these toxins have little effect on other organisms, they are considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. The toxin from B. thuringiensis (Bt toxin) has been incorporated directly into plants {{through the use of}} genetic engineering. Other biological insecticides include products based on entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae), nematodes (e.g., Steinernema feltiae) and viruses (e.g., Cydia pomonella granulovirus).|$|E
50|$|Imidacloprid {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{insecticides}} to the western honeybee, Apis mellifera. The toxicity of imidacloprid to Apis mellifera differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 µg a.i./bee (micrograms of active ingredient per bee). The acute oral LD50 ranges from 0.005 µg a.i./bee to 0.07 µg a.i./bee, which makes imidacloprid more toxic to the bees than the organophosphate dimethoate (oral LD50 0.152 µg/bee) or the pyrethroid cypermethrin (oral LD50 0.160 µg/bee). Other insecticides that are equally or more toxic than imidacloprid include <b>spinosad,</b> emamectin benzoate, fipronil, and the neonicotinoids clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinotefuran.|$|E
50|$|Naturally derived {{insecticides}} {{allowed for}} use on organic farms use include Bacillus thuringiensis (a bacterial toxin), pyrethrum (a chrysanthemum extract), <b>spinosad</b> (a bacterial metabolite), neem (a tree extract) and rotenone (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; one survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use rotenone while 1.7% use pyrethrum. These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm. The main criterion for organic pesticides {{is that they are}} naturally derived, and some naturally derived substances have been controversial. Controversial natural pesticides include rotenone, copper, nicotine sulfate, and pyrethrums Rotenone and pyrethrum are particularly controversial because they work by attacking the nervous system, like most conventional insecticides. Rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and can induce symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease in mammals. Although pyrethrum (natural pyrethrins) is more effective against insects when used with piperonyl butoxide (which retards degradation of the pyrethrins), organic standards generally do not permit use of the latter substance.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>spinosad</b> {{exposure}} on the susceptibility of pyrethroid- and organophosphate-resistant populations of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to insecticides {{was investigated in}} broiler house farm and laboratory studies. A field pyrethroid- and organophosphate-resistant population showed a 3. 6 -fold increase in susceptibility to γ-cyhalothrin following <b>spinosad</b> treatment. Overall, cyfluthrin- and fenitrothion-resistant field populations were more susceptible to these insecticides following <b>spinosad</b> treatments, but populations that were not resistant showed no change in susceptibility following <b>spinosad</b> treatment. In a related study, three broiler farm beetle populations with very similar levels of cyfluthrin and γ-cyhalothrin resistance and similar susceptibilities to <b>spinosad</b> were used to investigate temporal effects of <b>spinosad</b> field treatments on the susceptibility to pyrethroids. Farm insecticide regimes applied {{at the start of}} each flock differed: the control broiler house received no insecticide applications, another house was systematically treated with cyfluthrin at the start of each study flock, and the third house was systematically treated with <b>spinosad</b> at the start of five flocks. Afterwards, treatments reverted to cyfluthrin on all farms. At the end of flocks, beetles were tested with cyfluthrin, γ-cyhalothrin, and <b>spinosad.</b> The control and cyfluthrin house beetles did not change susceptibility to pyrethroids over the period of the study. In the <b>spinosad</b> house, <b>spinosad</b> had no effect on <b>spinosad</b> susceptibility but dramatically increased cyfluthrin and γ-cyhalothrin susceptibilities. These new susceptibilities were maintained while <b>spinosad</b> applications continued, but pyrethroid susceptibility declined once <b>spinosad</b> applications ceased. This study provides evidence of a synergistic interaction between <b>spinosad</b> and pyrethroids in pyrethroid-resistant beetles. This evidence has significant implications for management of insecticide-resistant populations through an integrated spinosad-pyrethroid strategy that aims to minimize insecticide use while enhancing control...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spinosad</b> was {{proposed}} {{as a potential}} chemical for control of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), in Australian broiler houses after the detection of strong cyfluthrin resistance in many beetle populations. In 2004 - 2006, <b>spinosad</b> susceptibility of 13 beetle populations from eastern and southern Australian broiler houses and a cyfluthrin/fenitrothion-resistant reference population was determined using topical application, and was compared with the susceptibility of an insecticide-susceptible reference population. Comparisons of dose-response curves and baseline data showed that all populations, including the insecticide-susceptible population, were roughly equivalent in their response to <b>spinosad,</b> indicating no preexisting <b>spinosad</b> resistance. Two field populations, including the resistant reference population, which had confirmed cyfluthrin/fenitrothion- resistance, showed no cross-resistance to <b>spinosad.</b> There was no significant correlation between beetle weight and LC 99. 9. A discriminating concentration of 3 % <b>spinosad</b> was set to separate resistant and susceptible individuals. Considering the levels of <b>spinosad</b> resistance that have been recorded in other insect pests, the sustained future usefulness of <b>spinosad</b> as a broiler house treatment will rely on effective integrated beetle management programs combined with carefully planned chemical use strategies...|$|E

The present research reveals the toxicity effect of <b>spinosad</b> and neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) against different larval stages of Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi) and Chironomus circumdatus (Ch. circumdatus). MethodsThe neem seeds were collected from Marudamalai hills, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, India. Neem seed kernels were powdered, extracted and diluted for different concentrations (2 ppm to 10 ppm). <b>Spinosad</b> was purchased from Kalpatharu pesticide Limited, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India and thoroughly mixed with distilled water to prepare various concentrations (0. 01 to 0. 08 ppm) and used for bioassay. ResultsThe results depict that <b>spinosad</b> is more toxic in lower concentrations when compared to NSKE and mosquitoes are more susceptible than chironomids. Lethal concentrations were evaluated using the observed mortality. The lowest LC 50 value obtained from <b>spinosad</b> against An. stephensi and Ch. circumdatus were 0. 002 05 ppm and 0. 008 91 ppm. This study investigated on effect of <b>Spinosad</b> and NSKE on the biology of mosquito. The immature stages of both species were susceptible to <b>Spinosad</b> and NSKE. <b>Spinosad</b> and NSKE in individual as well as combined treatment provided additional days in development for mosquitoes.

40|$|The use of malathion in {{fruit fly}} protein bait sprays has raised serious {{concerns}} {{due to its}} adverse effects on non-target organisms. This has necessitated the evaluation of novel reduced-risk compounds. This study evaluated the effects of <b>spinosad,</b> fipronil, malathion and chlorpyrifos mixed with fruit fly protein bait (Mauri Pinnacle protein®) on attraction, feeding and mortality of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt). The effects of outdoor weathering of these mixtures on fly mortality were also determined. In field-cage experiment, protein-starved flies showed {{the same level of}} attraction to baits containing <b>spinosad,</b> fipronil, malathion, chlorpyrifos and protein alone used as control. Female protein-starved flies were deterred from feeding on baits containing malathion and chlorpyrifos compared to baits containing <b>spinosad,</b> fipronil and protein alone. Baits containing malathion and chlorpyrifos caused higher fly mortality and rapid fly knock down than <b>spinosad</b> and fipronil. However, <b>spinosad</b> acted slowly and caused an increase in fly mortality over time, causing up to 90 % fly mortality after 72 -h. Baits containing malathion and chlorpyrifos, applied on citrus leaves and weathered outdoors, had longer residual effectiveness in killing flies than <b>spinosad</b> and fipronil.

In the first group of bioassays, <b>spinosad</b> or deltamethrin were applied alone at the tested wheat varieties at the doses of 0. 01, 0. 1 and 0. 5 ppm for <b>spinosad</b> and 0. 125 ppm for deltamethrin. In the second group of bioassays, the tested wheat varieties were treated with the combination of the above <b>spinosad</b> rates with 0. 125 of deltamethrin. In both series of bioassays, mortality of the tested species was evaluated after 7 d of exposure on the treated wheat varieties at 25 °C and 65 % r. h. Mortality for all species was always significantly higher in Athos than Sifnos. The highest mortality of S. oryzae (73 and 40 % for Athos and Sifnos respectively) or S. granarius (88 % and 58 % for Athos and Sifnos respectively) was recorded in the cases that <b>spinosad</b> was applied alone at 0. 5 ppm.
