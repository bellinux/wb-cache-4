40|$|ABSTRACT—Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{evidence-based}} practice in psychology has {{become synonymous with}} a particular operationalization of it aimed at developing a list of em-pirically <b>supported</b> <b>therapies.</b> Although much has been learned since {{the emergence of the}} empirically <b>supported</b> <b>therapies</b> movement, its restrictive definition of evidence (excluding, for example, basic science as a source of evi-dence to be used by clinicians) is problematic, and the as-sumptions inherent in its nearly exclusive focus on brief, focal treatments for specific disorders are themselves not generally supported by the available data. Recent meta-analytic data support a more nuanced view of treatment efficacy than one that makes dichotomous judgments of empirically supported or unsupported, suggesting the need for a more refined concept of evidence-based practice i...|$|R

50|$|Intradialytic {{parenteral}} nutrition (IDPN) is a nutritional <b>support</b> <b>therapy</b> (medical nutrition therapy) for people on hemodialysis {{who have a}} difficult time maintaining adequate nutrition. It is administered directly into the bloodstream of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an effort to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality experienced in patients with renal failure. IDPN contains protein (amino acids), carbohydrates (dextrose), and fats (lipids) in an attempt to meet a patient's weekly nutritional needs. Solutions can be individualized for each patient based on weight, needs, medical history and enteral intake.|$|E

40|$|End-of-life {{decision}} making frequently {{occurs in the}} intensive care unit (ICU). There is a lack of information on how a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order affects treatments received by critically ill patients in ICUs. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the use of life <b>support</b> <b>therapies</b> between patients with a DNR order and those without; (2) to examine life <b>support</b> <b>therapies</b> prior to and after the issuance of a DNR order; and (3) to determine the clinical factors that influence the initiation of a DNR order in ICUs in Taiwan. A prospective, descriptive, and correlational study was conducted. A total of 202 patients comprising 133 (65. 8 %) who had a DNR order, and 69 (34. 1 %) who did not, participated in this study. In the last 48 hours of their lives, patients who had a DNR order were less likely to receive life <b>support</b> <b>therapies</b> than those who did not have a DNR order. Older age, being unmarried, the presence of an adult child as a surrogate decision maker, a perceived inability to survive ultimate discharge from the ICU, and longer hospitalization in the ICU were significant predictors of issuing a DNR order for critically ill patients. This study will draw attention to how, when, and by whom, critically ill patients' preferences about DNR are elicited and honored. © The Author(s) 2010. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

However, certain types of mushrooms, such as the Amanitas, contain very potent toxins and are very poisonous; so even if symptoms are treated promptly mortality is high. With some toxins, death can occur {{in a week or}} a few days. Although a liver or kidney transplant may save some patients with complete organ failure, in many cases there are no organs available. Patients hospitalized and given aggressive <b>support</b> <b>therapy</b> almost immediately after ingestion of amanitin-containing mushrooms have a mortality rate of only 10%, whereas those admitted 60 or more hours after ingestion have a 50-90% mortality rate.|$|E

A cohort study intended to measure the effects of positive mental imagery on breast cancer survival rates found no significant impact. Earlier indications of strong beneficial effects in the study were found to be a statistical error due to selection bias.

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to patients and}} their families, doctors also are confronted with ethical questions. In {{addition to}} patient life, doctors have to consider medical resource allocations. They {{have to decide whether}} one patient is a worthwhile investment of limited resources versus another. Current ethical guidelines are vague since they center on moral issues of ending medical care but disregard discrepancies between those who understand possible treatments and how the patient's wishes are understood and integrated into the final decision. Physicians often ignore treatments they deem ineffective, causing them to make more decisions without consulting the patient or representatives. However, when they decide against medical treatment, they must keep the patient or representatives informed even if they discourage continued life support. Whether the physician decides to continue to terminate life <b>support</b> <b>therapy</b> depends on their own ethical beliefs. These beliefs concern the patient's independence, consent, and the efficacy and value of continued life support. In a prospective study conducted by T J Predergast and J M Luce from 1987 to 1993, when physicians recommended withholding or withdrawing life support, 90% of the patients agreed to the suggestion and only 4% refused. When the patient disagreed with the physician, the doctor complied and continued support with one exception. If the doctor believed the patient was hopelessly ill, they did not fulfill the surrogate's request for resuscitation. In a survey conducted by Jean-Louis Vincent MD, PhD in 1999, it was found that of European intensivists working in the Intensive Care Unit, 93% of physicians occasionally withhold treatment from those they considered hopeless. Withdrawal of treatment was less common. For these patients, 40% of the physicians gave large doses of drugs until the patient died. All of the physicians were members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.|$|E

40|$|Intensive therapy {{of blood}} cancer {{patients}} {{is a new}} area of hematology.

Effective <b>supporting</b> <b>therapy</b> enables a patient to go through severe, but potentially reversible disturbances of vital organs at all stages of therapy. This also applies in full to drug-induced hepatotoxicity that frequently leads to hepatic failure (HF). Hepatic medicinal damages of varying severity develop in 2 — 10 % of inpatients. The pathogenetic mechanisms of hepatic damage are very diverse; however, they are all characterized by the cell damage accompanied by an inflammatory reaction, cytolysis, and evolving fibrosis.
