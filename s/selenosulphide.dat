40|$|A novel {{free radical}} {{addition}} of Se-phenyl (selenothioperoxy) benzoate (1) {{to a variety}} of olefins is described. The addition of <b>selenosulphide</b> (1) to terminal olefins proceeds regiospecifically to give the anti-Markownikoff benzeneselenenylated adducts. The addition to cycloalkenes gives a mixture of cis and trans isomers. These reactions provide a useful method for simultaneous introduction of phenylseleno and thiobenzoyloxy groups into a molecule. Oxidation-elimination of the phenylseleno group of the adducts gives vinyl thiobenzoates and/or allyl thiobenzoates...|$|E
40|$|Potassium benzyl {{selenosulphate}} {{and potassium}} p-nitrobenzyl selenosulphate {{were shown to}} be powerful inhibitors of the thiol-dependent enzymes glutathione reductase and papain, but to {{have no effect on}} the serine-dependent proteinase trypsin. By contrast, potassium benzyl thiosulphate and potassium p-nitrobenzyl thiosulphate, at much higher concentrations, have virtually no effect on any of the enzymes. The selenosulphates show characteristics of both reversible non-competitive and irreversible inhibition. On the basis of model reactions in which the selenosulphates react instantly with cysteine, it is suggested that they form labile <b>selenosulphide</b> derivatives with the enzymes, but that these derivatives may be broken down either by the normal functioning of the enzyme (in the case of glutathione reductase) or by the approaching substrate (in the case of papain). Continued inhibition of the enzymes requires a stoicheiometric excess of inhibitor over enzyme...|$|E
