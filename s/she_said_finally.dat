6000|$|Mrs. Bowen {{looked from}} him to Imogene. [...] "I don't either," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> and they {{understood}} that she meant the harm which he had not seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{old enough}} to pray for yourself, Anne," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "Just thank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to do something, give me a glass of water," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> for she wished a drink badly, the cabin was so hot and stuffy.|$|E
50|$|Murphy {{has been}} married three times and {{revealed}} that during her first marriage, which lasted nine years, she {{was a victim of}} domestic abuse. In October 2010, on Larry King Live, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was <b>finally</b> speaking out so that other victims could learn how she endured, but escaped, domestic violence. Her first husband denies physically or mentally abusing her.|$|R
6000|$|... "If thou desirest {{to speak}} with me again," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> as he <b>finally</b> took his leave, [...] "give four raps on the door at marked intervals. I would fly to open it then." ...|$|R
50|$|Before Jack and Carly left {{to pursue}} the kidnappers, Jack {{proposed}} to Katie and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> yes. <b>Finally,</b> an injured, disgruntled Jack and ex-wife Carly were able to work off of a lead and tracked the kidnappers down to Idaho. In an action packed chain of events, Carly saved the day, then Jack saved Carly, J.J. was finally freed, Ava ran off with the ransom money, and Silas was arrested.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} that you're right, Mr. Jeff," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> as they faced the hill, {{and began the}} ascent together. [...] "This place is a little queer, and bleak, and--unattractive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} do! I don't {{think they}} could be better." [...] She looked at the three poses presented critically. [...] "If it's {{all the same to}} you, I'll keep this one," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Madame de Bellegarde {{listened in}} silence. [...] "You are very frank," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "I {{will be the}} same. I would rather favor you, on the whole, than suffer you. It will be easier." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{waiting for}} what seemed like forever, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> the call <b>finally</b> came through and she earned for herself a role in Scorned only to be {{followed}} with a bigger one in The Perfect Picture. She has since starred in Double (2009), Checkmate (2010), Adams Apples (2010-2013) and Poisoned Bait (2014).|$|R
5000|$|Sometime in the mid-1930s Reece's {{eyesight}} {{began to}} fail, and, {{coupled with the}} decline in the popularity of pictorialism, she began to produce less and less. In 1944, at the age of 76, <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was giving up photography altogether due to [...] "my silent ears and my dimming vision".|$|R
6000|$|She slowly {{came back}} to me. [...] "Miss Jessel--WAS infamous." [...] She once more took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me against the {{increase}} of alarm I might draw from this disclosure. [...] "They were both infamous," [...] <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I can let {{you have}} dinner for twenty-five cent," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "I won't charge you {{anything}} for cleaning up," [...] she added, with something like a smile. [...] "Will you mind paying in advance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It sounds {{perfectly}} crazy," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "But it mayn't be. The {{only thing}} I didn't like about Mr. Fulkerson was his always wanting to chance things. But {{what have you}} got to do with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be rough," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "On second thought," [...] {{here she}} looked at his detaining hand, [...] "I've {{decided not to go}} to bed yet a while. Do sit down and be {{comfortable}} instead of ridiculous. Any questions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When he had {{finished}} {{she looked at him}} for a long while. [...] "Yes, Daren," [...] <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "you understand, and you have made me understand. I always felt"--and her hand went to her heart--"but my mind did not grasp.... Oh, Daren, how I thank you!" [...] and she held her hands out to him.|$|R
2500|$|On April 2, Carroll {{returned}} to Boston, {{where she was}} greeted at the airport by her editor Richard Bergenheim and whisked off to a reunion with her family. On the flight, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I <b>finally</b> feel like I am alive again. I feel so good. To be able to step outside anytime, to feel the sun directly on your faceâ€”to see the whole sky. These are luxuries that we just don't appreciate every day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{turned a}} little paler and just sat {{still for a}} minute or two. You know she isn't much of a talker. Then <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'Was he at church to-day?' I <b>said</b> 'Yes'; then <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'I think I saw him. I saw a {{stranger}} and was attracted by his face, but of course I never thought it could be Harold.' She was completely helpless for a while, but as I talked she began to see her way. <b>She</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> 'He {{has come a long way}} and I must see him. I must talk with him, but people must not know who he is.' I told her we were going to be very careful for her sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} bad for me--to tell me, but tell me, anyhow," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>finally,</b> {{answering}} as some one older than she had been an hour ago--to something feminine that leaped up. She did not understand this impulse, {{but it was in}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are two reasons," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "One of them it is {{that keeps}} the count from doing that very thing. The other, my real reason for fearing to expose them, I have never told--only Rokoff and I know it. I wonder," [...] and then she paused, looking intently {{at him for a}} long time.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{no friends}} of the Fort," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> [...] "but I don't reckon for that reason my brother will cotton to YOU. Stay out thar where ye are, till I come to ye. If you hear me singin' again, you'll know he's come back, and ye'd better scoot with what you've already got, and be thankful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{at first}} <b>she</b> <b>said</b> the Professor {{had gone to}} Chicago on business, and so she couldn't do {{anything}} for us," [...] replied Edna; [...] "but I insisted that we needed goods right now, so <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> we could go up in the attic, and rummage around, and take whatever we could find. My, {{what a lot of}} useless stuff there was! That attic has more smashed and battered and broken-legged furniture in it than would furnish six houses--provided it was in shape. The accumulation of ages. But {{a lot of it is}} antique, girls, and worth fixing up. I've made the best haul of our career, I verily believe." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] Good Morning America, Robertson talked about his wife. He said, [...] "One woman has already got my heart, we've been married for 43 years and her name is Miss Christine Robertson". He has talked about how after he had asked for her hand in marriage about 70 times, <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> yes. The two married in 1971, {{and they had a}} daughter, Trasa, and a son, Scott. They also have eight grandsons.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} confess something," [...] <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> {{with a little}} laugh. [...] "I hate to keep house. I hate to sew, and I can't marry a man who {{wants me to do}} the way other women do. I must be {{intended}} for something else than a housewife, because I never do a bit of cooking or sewing without groaning. I like to paint fences and paper walls; but I'm not in the least domestic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} the child, I suppose you must have him," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "I wish he had a civilized name, though. Hezekiah is bad, and Lionel is worse; but the two in combination, and tacked on to Smith at that, is {{something}} that only Martha Smith could have invented. Her judgment was the same clear through, from selecting husbands to names." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you realize}} that you are buying me, Mr. Canler?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> and in a cold, level voice. [...] "Buying me for a few paltry dollars? Of course you do, Robert Canler, and the hope of just such a {{contingency}} was in your mind when you loaned papa the money for that hair-brained escapade, which but for a most mysterious circumstance would have been surprisingly successful.|$|E
6000|$|This {{time it was}} she that debated. [...] "No, don't tell them," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "They wouldn't understand. I don't understand, {{for that}} matter, but I have faith in you, and {{in the nature of}} things they are not capable of this same {{implicit}} faith. You raise up before me a mystery that prevents our marriage, and I believe you; but they could not believe you without doubts arising as to the wrong and ill-nature of the mystery. Besides, it would but make their anxieties greater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] he replied, with an {{assumption}} of carelessness. [...] "I imagine Lawson will {{appear before the}} committee, and I hope to call on Miss Brisbane--I {{want to see her}} paintings." [...] He did not meet his sister's eyes as squarely as was his wont, and her keen glance detected a bit more color in his face than was usual to him. [...] "You must certainly call," [...] <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I want to know all about how they live." ...|$|R
6000|$|One figures {{his face}} almost aged. He {{appears to have}} hovered about {{the house on the}} Sandgate Riviera to a scandalous extent, failing always to get a {{sufficiently}} long and intimate tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with the Sea Lady to settle once for all his doubts as to what really had been said and what he had dreamed or fancied in their talk. Never had he been so exceedingly disturbed as he was by the twist this talk had taken. Never had his habitual pose of humorous acquiescence in life been quite so difficult to keep up. He became positively absent-minded. [...] "You know if it's like that, it's serious," [...] was the burden of his private mutterings. His condition was palpable even to Mrs. Bunting. But she misunderstood his nature. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> something. <b>Finally,</b> and quite abruptly, he set off to London in a state of frantic determination {{to get out of it}} all. The Sea Lady wished him good-bye in Mrs. Bunting's presence as if there had never been anything unusual between them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Diane Warren, who {{produced}} the song along with Guy Roche. While the soft rock track was not specifically written for Cher, the singer initially disliked the song upon hearing a demo and turned it down. Speaking of its recording, Warren elaborated in 1991: [...] "I got {{on my knees and}} pleaded. I told her I wasn't going to leave the room until <b>she</b> <b>said</b> yes, and <b>finally,</b> just to get rid of me, she did." [...] In 2014, she further added: [...] "She really hated it, but I held her leg down during a session and said, 'You have to record it!'." [...] According to Warren, Cher reportedly responded: [...] "'Fuck you, bitch! You're hurting my leg! OK, I'll try it.' She gave me this look like, 'You were right'." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} he emptied his mind of care {{concerning}} the matter; but husband and wife are never both quite free of care on the same point of common interest, and Mrs. Claxon assumed {{more and more of}} the anxieties which he had abandoned. She fretted under the load, and expressed an exasperated tenderness for Clementina when the girl seemed forgetful of any of the little steps to be taken before the great one in getting her clothes ready for leaving home. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally</b> that she presumed they were doing a wild thing, and that it looked crazier and crazier the more she thought of it; but all was, if Clem didn't like, she could come home. By this time her husband was in something of that insensate eagerness to have the affair over that people feel in a house where there is a funeral.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{laughing}} at me!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "But inhuman and selfish as these stories may seem, and sometimes are, I {{believe that these}} curious estrangements and separations often come from some fatal weakness of temperament that might be strengthened, or some trivial misunderstanding that could be explained. It is separation that makes them seem irrevocable only because they are inexplicable, and a vague memory always seems more terrible than a definite one. Facts may be forgiven and forgotten, but mysteries haunt one always. I believe there are weak, sensitive people who dread to put their wrongs into shape; {{those are the kind}} who sulk, and when you add separation to sulking, reconciliation becomes impossible. I knew a very singular case of that kind once. If you like, I'll tell it to you. May be you will be able, some day, to weave it into one of your writings. And it's quite true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, my lord," [...] rejoined Mary Tudor earnestly, for he {{had turned}} to the Queen, {{prepared}} to proffer his request on his knees, [...] "meseems a grievous wrong {{has been done to}} you--if unwittingly--by your Queen and country. Let the wench be free to pray to the Holy Virgin for her great sin. I myself will care for her, and she shall enter any convent she may choose, and be honoured there as if she had brought with her the richest dowry in the land. But," [...] she added, turning to Lord Chandois, [...] "I desire her to make full confession once more before you, my lord, in writing, and to swear to it and sign it with her name. You may go, wench," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> turning to Mirrab, [...] "your Queen has pardoned you. May you be happy in the peace of the convent. We will never forget you, and ever see that joy shall always be in your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl became {{thoughtful}} for a time. [...] "I can't understand," [...] <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "why Gran'pa Jim acts {{the way he}} does. Often he {{has told}} me, when I deserved censure, to 'face the music' and have it over with. Once he said that those who sin must suffer the penalty, {{because it is the}} law of both God and man, and he who seeks to escape a just penalty is a coward. Gran'pa knows he is innocent, but the government thinks he is guilty; so why doesn't he face the music and prove his innocence, instead of running away as a coward might do and so allow his good name to suffer reproach?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{commercialization of}} the American holiday began very early, and only nine {{years after the}} first {{official}} Mother's Day it had become so rampant that Anna Jarvis herself became a major opponent of what the holiday had become, spending all her inheritance and {{the rest of her life}} fighting what she saw as an abuse of the celebration. She decried the practice of purchasing greeting cards, which she saw as a sign of being too lazy to write a personal letter. She was arrested in 1948 for disturbing the peace while protesting against the commercialization of Mother's Day, and <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> [...] "...wished she would have never started the day because it became so out of control ..." [...] She died later that year.|$|R
50|$|She is the {{daughter}} of Fred and Anne Langbein and is married to Ted Hewetson, with whom she has two children, Sean and Rose. Her father worked in a city office but was a keen vegetable gardener and beekeeper, while her mother was a cook and home science university graduate. She credits her mother as the inspiration for her cooking. Annabel first met husband Ted while working as a possum trapper on his family's farm on the East Cape of New Zealand. By chance she later shared a flat with her future sister-in-law Debbie, who helped orchestrate their relationship. She claims to have attracted Ted {{with the help of a}} bacon and egg pie. He proposed three times before <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> yes and they married in Wellington.|$|R
