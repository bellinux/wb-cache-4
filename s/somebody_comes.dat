The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association.... hen <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> in from the Orient with a new {{religion}} which hasn't got any of these [...] associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, {{and we can get}} with that, you see, and we can dig that! Ginsberg agreed {{to take part in the}} Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.|$|E
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{speaks of}} a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad {{point in your life}} and <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, {{stronger}} than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patterson and Liston had {{a rematch}} clause in their contract. Patterson wanted {{a chance to}} redeem himself, so they had a rematch on July 22, 1963, in Las Vegas. Patterson, a 4-1 betting underdog, was knocked down three times and counted out at 2:10 of the first round. The fight lasted four seconds longer than the first one. Liston's victory was loudly booed. [...] "The public is not with me. I know it", Liston said afterward. [...] "But they'll have to swing along until <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> to beat me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eddie Izzard {{notes that}} the Goons and Milligan in {{particular}} [...] "influenced {{a new generation of}} comedians who {{came to be known as}} 'alternative'."

The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N F Simpson's play One Way Pendulum... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time. They were just light years ahead of everyone else." ...|$|E

60|$|But, {{he caught}} {{his feet in}} the newspaper, which had fallen on the hearth; and <b>somebody</b> <b>came</b> rushing in between them.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Porter {{pressed the}} button a second time. <b>Somebody</b> <b>came</b> at a leisurely pace down the passage, {{whistling}} cheerfully. The door opened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} out of this," [...] thought Tom, [...] "or I shall stay here till <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> to help me--which is just what I don't want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you {{can stay}} there until <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> to release you," [...] said Nat, mockingly. [...] "I reckon that will teach you a lesson not to send me off on freight trains!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{take you}} up," [...] shouted Pearson. [...] "But oh, it's just like horse-stealing for me! I {{can use that}} sorrel for a lady's animal when--when <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> over to Mucho Calor, and--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I haven't got {{the grit}} {{to go there}} and look at a paper in cold blood," [...] he told Anne. [...] "I'm just going to wait until <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> and tells me {{suddenly}} whether I've passed or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That you, Rilla?" [...] "Yeth--yeth." [...] Oh, why couldn't Jims stop howling {{for just}} one little minute? Why didn't <b>somebody</b> <b>come</b> in and choke him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How did you {{get hold}} of him?" [...] demanded Mr. Clodd. [...] "Have much trouble in finding him, or did <b>somebody</b> <b>come</b> and tell you about him?" ...|$|R

60|$|Tom {{sat down}} to study, {{but he could not}} fix his mind on his lessons. Then he heard <b>somebody</b> <b>come</b> along the hallway and turn into the next room.|$|R
60|$|<b>Somebody</b> <b>came</b> {{into the}} light, and I {{saw it was}} the boss. He was looking very anxious and scared, and he scooped Peter {{up off the ground}} and hugged him tight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, there's <b>somebody</b> <b>come!</b> I {{wonder who}} 'tis? Why, I do believe it's a stranger. Jimmy" [...] (that's {{one of the}} children) [...] "run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Teeter chuckled softly. [...] "It's {{the safest}} place in the world, Peter," [...] said she. [...] "They look so much like these pebbles around here that no one sees them.

6000|$|... "Do {{you ever}} get moods when life seems {{absolutely}} meaningless? It's like a badly-constructed story, {{with all sorts of}} characters moving in and out who {{have nothing to do with}} the plot. And when <b>somebody</b> <b>comes</b> along that you think really has something to do with the plot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you begin to wonder what the story is about, and you feel that it's about nothing--just a jumble." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{entered her}} bedroom and sat by the window, and thought and thought till night enveloped her, and the extreme lines only of her shape were visible. <b>Somebody</b> <b>came</b> to the door, knocked, and opened it.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{would not}} return from town much before six, I felt sure. He always loitered when he got down to Hilo. Unless <b>somebody</b> <b>came</b> to relieve me soon I must surely be killed by slow torture.|$|R
