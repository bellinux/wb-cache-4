50|$|For several years, Corel allowed Mac {{users to}} {{download}} version 3.5e from their website free of charge, and some Mac users still use this version. The download is still {{available at the}} Mac Yahoo group along with the necessary OS 8/9/Classic Updater that <b>slows</b> <b>scroll</b> speed and restores functionality to the Style and Window menus. Like other Mac OS applications of its age, it requires the Classic environment on PowerPC Macs. While Intel Macs do not support Classic, emulators such as SheepShaver, Basilisk II and vMac allow users to run WordPerfect on any Macintosh computer. Users wishing to use a current release of WordPerfect can run the Windows version through Boot Camp or a Windows emulator, and through Darwine or CrossOver Mac with mixed results.|$|R
5000|$|BYTE in 1981 {{reviewed}} EasyWriter and EasyWriter Professional for the Apple II, {{stating that}} [...] "editing {{is a pleasure}} with either version", and approving of their features, user interface, and documentation. In an early review of the IBM PC, however, the magazine in 1982 stated that EasyWriter for it or the Apple II [...] "didn't seem {{to be of the}} same caliber as, say, VisiCalc or the Peachtree business packages", citing the lack of ease of use and <b>slow</b> <b>scrolling</b> as flaws, and advised those who planned to use the IBM PC primarily for word processing to buy another computer until alternative software became available. Andrew Fluegelman wrote in PC Magazine that although EasyWriter 1.0 appeared to be an easy-to-use word processor for casual users, it [...] "contains a few very annoying inconveniences and some very serious traps". He cited several bugs, slow performance, and user-interface issues, and later called it [...] "pretty much a lemon".|$|R
5000|$|Famitsu magazine's Reader Cross Review {{gave the}} Super Famicom {{version of the}} game a 6 out of 10. Ed Lomas of Sega Saturn Magazine criticized the <b>slow</b> <b>scrolling</b> in the Saturn port but applauded the game itself for its depth, realism, and addictiveness, calling it [...] "one of the few games that appeals to just about everyone. It ... has the strange ability to convert {{full-time}} arcade shooter fans into around the clock urban planners {{with a sense of}} civic duty." [...] A reviewer for Maximum commented that the Saturn port contains all the considerable content of the PC version and is good fun to play, but has worse graphics and more slowdown than the PC version does, even when running on computers which are much less powerful than the Saturn. A reviewer for Next Generation said that the Saturn version [...] "is a carbon copy of the latest installment of this city-planning simulation game, and, as such, it carries with it the monstrously addictive quality and absorbing challenge of all SimCity games." [...] He said that the one major problem is the Saturn version's lack of mouse support. GamePros brief review said that the expanded menu [...] "bogs [...] 2000 down a little" [...] but that the game would still be enjoyable for fans of the series.|$|R
50|$|Folder Size is a {{freemium}} {{disk space}} analyzer for Windows written by MindGems. The product uses a Windows Explorer-like interface that can show data {{as either a}} pie chart or bar graph. According to PCWorld.com, as at Sep 2, 2010, the product {{is a little more}} cumbersome than necessary to shift views and can be <b>slow</b> in <b>scrolling</b> for refreshing but overall was considered to have an edge over SpaceSniffer (freeware alternative) because it had additional functionality and provided more information. CNET observed that the program is basic, however noted that this is generally what is required of such program.|$|R
50|$|OmniWeb {{originally}} employed its own proprietary HTML {{layout engine}} that used standard API NSText components. However, this engine was very <b>slow,</b> particularly when <b>scrolling,</b> {{and was not}} fully compatible with the most recent web standards, such as Cascading Style Sheets. In OmniWeb version 4.5, the Omni Group adopted Apple's KHTML-based WebCore rendering engine, which was created by Apple for its Safari browser.|$|R
5000|$|Rob Griffiths {{wrote in}} April 2002 for MAC OS X HINTS {{saying he was}} [...] "very impressed" [...] and naming it [...] "pick of the week". He cited its file memory upon reopening, its ability to notice if an open file was changed on disk by another program, syntax coloring, {{including}} that users can create their own colour schemes, split windows feature, show line number feature, convertible tabs to soft-tabs and view sidebars. He also praised its customization possibilities using the extensive preferences panel and the [...] "on the fly" [...] search engine, which searches while typing. Griffiths noted that the application has a few drawbacks, such as that it is [...] "a bit <b>slow</b> at <b>scrolling</b> a line at a time" [...] and that {{because it is a}} Java application it doesn't have the full Aqua interface.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Scramble was {{the first}} side-scroller with multiple, {{distinct}} levels. The art of the side-scrolling format was then greatly enhanced by parallax scrolling, {{which is used to}} give an illusion of depth. The background images are presented in multiple layers that scroll at different rates, thus objects closer to the horizon <b>scroll</b> <b>slower</b> than objects closer to the viewer. Moon Patrol is usually credited with introducing this feature in 1982, though Taito's Jungle Hunt also features parallax scrolling and was released the same year.|$|R
5000|$|These games {{retain the}} Song Wheel {{interface}} introduced in 5thMix, but add an easier method to enter modifiers. In previous versions, modifiers like [...] "Sudden" [...] or [...] "Shuffle" [...] required {{a combination of}} dance steps. Beginning in 6thMix, a player only needs to hold the Start button when they select a song to bring up a full menu of available modifiers, including the ability to speed up or <b>slow</b> down the <b>scrolling</b> of arrows, and a final chance to select the song difficulty they wish to play.|$|R
500|$|Sega's Space Harrier, a rail shooter {{released}} in 1985, broke new ground graphically and its {{wide variety of}} settings across multiple levels gave players more to aim for than high scores. 1985 also saw the release of Konami's Gradius, which gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry, thus introducing another element of strategy. The game also introduced {{the need for the}} player to memorise levels in order to achieve any measure of success. Gradius, with its iconic protagonist, defined the side-scrolling shoot 'em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels. The following year saw the emergence of one of Sega's forefront series with its game Fantasy Zone. The game received acclaim for its surreal graphics and setting and the protagonist, Opa-Opa, was for a time considered Sega's mascot. The game borrowed Defender's device of allowing the player to control the direction of flight and along with the earlier TwinBee (1985), is an early archetype of the [...] "cute 'em up" [...] subgenre. R-Type, an acclaimed side-scrolling shoot 'em up, was {{released in}} 1987 by Irem, employing <b>slower</b> paced <b>scrolling</b> than usual, with difficult levels calling for methodical strategies. 1990's Raiden was the beginning of another acclaimed and enduring series to emerge from this period.|$|R
40|$|Flick {{scrolling}} is {{a natural}} scrolling method for mobile touch devices such as the iPhoneTM. It is useful {{not only for its}} performance but perhaps even more so for its ease of use and user experience. Tilt scrolling instead uses the device’s tilt to determine the rate of scrolling, which offers several potential interaction advantages over touch sensitive alterna-tives: scrolling can be achieved without occluding {{a large proportion of the}} screen with a hand, finger, or thumb; it frees drag input events for other important actions such as text selection and drag-and-drop; and it works regardless of the hand’s state (e. g. moist or gloved). Although previously described, the performance of tilt scrolling has not been com-pared to flick scrolling, which is now the state of the art. Furthermore, it is unclear how such an empirical compari-son should be conducted. To better understand interaction with mobile scrolling, we propose a new method of evaluat-ing scrolling interfaces in the context of reading or analysis tasks. These activities typically involve <b>slow</b> subtle <b>scroll</b> movements rather than large movements typical investigated in most scrolling evaluations. We use this method to thor-oughly compare flick scrolling and tilt scrolling. We show that tilt scrolling results in better performance for tasks per-formed while stationary while there is no significant differ-ence while moving. However, we find that participants prefer flick scrolling and walk faster when completing moving tasks with flick scrolling than tilt scrolling.

40|$|Scrolling is the {{standard}} way to navigate through many types of digital documents. However, moving {{more than a few}} pages can be <b>slow</b> because all <b>scrolling</b> techniques constrain visual search to only a small document region. To improve document navigation, we developed Space-Filling Thumbnails (SFT), an overview display that eliminates most scrolling. SFT provides two views: a standard page view for reading, and a thumbnail view that shows all pages. We tested SFT in three experiments that involved finding pages in documents. The first study (n= 13) compared seven current scrolling techniques, and showed that SFT is significantly faster than the other methods. The second and third studies (n= 32 and n= 14) were detailed comparisons of SFT with thumbnail-enhanced scrollbars (TES), which performed well in the first experiment. SFT was faster than TES across all document types and lengths, particularly when tasks involved revisitation. In addition, SFT was strongly preferred by participants...|$|R
40|$|The {{passage from}} orality to written texts, the <b>slow</b> {{transition}} from <b>scroll</b> to codex, the Gutenberg revolution, are three key {{moments in the}} history of literacy culture. And today we {{are on the verge of}} a new, fourth revolution: e-books, and their use on reading devices such as Amazon’s Kindle, Barnes & Noble’s Nook, Apple’s iPad, might change our interaction with written texts – and the very nature of such texts – in an unprecedented and radical way. In ‘The Fourth Revolution – Six Lessons on the Future of the Book’, Gino Roncaglia deals with the future of the book and with the new and fascinating perspectives of e-books, merging scholarly competence with a clear and captivating narrative. From ancient Roman inscriptions to e-books in Science Fiction, from a discussion of Google’s mammoth digitization project to hypertexts and interactive fiction, from the curious history of the first digital reading devices to the latest development in fields such as electronic paper and smartphone screens, from a discussion of disintermediation and self-publishing to the complex world of Digital Rights Management, from Umberto Eco’s idea that books are as perfect for reading as spoons are for eating soup, to the Magical Book described by E. T. Hoffman in one of his classic tales, this book offers an original and encompassing presentation of the new frontiers of digital reading. With a clear standpoint: the point of view of the reader. I libri: siamo abituati a vederli, toccarli, annusarli. Sono compagni di vita, un piacere e insieme una necessità. Ma oggi, fra e-book e libri in rete, il mondo dei testi e della lettura sta vivendo una rivoluzione. La quarta, dopo il passaggio da oralità a scrittura, da rotolo a libro paginato, da manoscritto a libro a stampa. Una rivoluzione non inattesa, ma dalle caratteristiche per molti versi ancora incerte. Sei lezioni alla scoperta del futuro del libro nel mondo digitale, delle nuove frontiere di questa ‘quarta rivoluzione’, e dei sorprendenti strumenti che ci aiuteranno a continuare a leggere. Il file PDF inserito in open archive (con l'autorizzazione dell'editore) comprende l'introduzione e parte del primo capitolo del libr...|$|R
