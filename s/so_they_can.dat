5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
