40|$|The {{numerical}} modelling of casting processes {{is based on}} complex software packages, which most often use the finite element method. But the degree of complexity of the applied model may cause an occurrence of numerical errors. These errors may be generated both by an incorrect finite element mesh and {{by the use of}} incorrect material characteristics. The ProCAST numerical software package was used for numerical calculations. A 3 D model was developed {{on the basis of the}} process parameters of an actual continuous steel casting process. The temperature distribution of a <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand,</b> with dimensions of 220 × 1100 mm, was analysed for two steel grades: F 320 and S 235. A series of numerical simulations were performed where the influence of the applied viscosity values on the <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand</b> temperature distribution was presented. Viscosity values from rheological examinations that were performed with an FRS 1600 high-temperature rheometer were used in the numerical simulations of the CC process. The aforementioned rotational measurements were carried out for the F 320 and S 235 steels in the liquid and in the semi-solid statesto examine the influence of temperature on the viscosity value changes obtained. A concentric cylinder systems working in accordance with Searle’s method was used for the measurements. Numerical calculations that were based on the viscosity values from the CompuTherm LLC, thermodynamic database were compared with one other in the project.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to compute the thermomechanical state of the shell of continuously cast steels in a round billet casting mold.

Comparisons with available xperimental observations verify the predictions of the model. The model demonstrates that the thermal shrinkage associated with the phase change from delta-ferrite to austenite in 0. 1 pct C steel accounts for the decreased heat transfer observed in that alloy, as well as its susceptibility to cracking.

However, the phenomena occurring during plastic {{deformation of}} a solidifying mush are poorly understood, have not been observed directly, and have not been modeled in detail. A mathematical model that predicts the temperature and solid fraction profiles, liquid concentration evolution, and solid phase displacement during the deformation of a solidifying mush is presented. This model is derived considering a two-dimensional case, the volume averaging method, the enthalpy technique, and a coordinate transformation to avoid a changing mesh in a numerical solution.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of steels to transverse cracking during {{continuous casting}} depends, in part, {{on the hot}} ductility of the steel. In the past, hot ductility has been measured in the laboratory by tensile testing specimens reheated to a high temperature (preferably melted), and then cooled down to the desired test temperature before isothermally testing to fracture. More recently, isothermal tensile testing has been performed after imposing different thermal histories prior to reaching the test temperature. The most relevant thermal history {{is that of the}} <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand</b> surface. Such thermal histories {{have been found to be}} quite complex, and invariably involve rapid cooling and heating cycles. This will therefore lead to high thermal gradients, which, in turn, can generate strains in the surface of the <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand.</b> Thus, the purpose of this thesis was to consider the effect of the thermomechanical history on the hot ductility of steel. A Nb-Ti microalloyed steel was chosen to be studied, since microalloying often increases susceptibility to transverse cracking. After in-situ melting and solidification, tensile test specimens were subjected to the thermal history typical of a continuously cast billet. Different amounts of prior deformations in various schedules were imposed on the specimens at selected stages during the thermal history, before tensile testing to fracture at the time and temperature corresponding to the unbending stage of the billet casting. It was found that the hot ductility varied from 1 % to 98 %, depending on the stage in the thermal history at which prior deformation was executed. Microstructural studies showed remarkable changes in the precipitation pattern occurred due to the employed prior deformation. Similar hot ductility measurements executed on a low carbon steel, that was free from microalloy elements, exhibited an effect of prior hot deformation which was quite different to the Nb-Ti microalloyed steel. In particular, the effect on the hot ductility was not as dramatic. The effects were also postulated to be due to precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{thermomechanical}} processing schedules to control microstructures requires {{the knowledge of}} the austenite-to-ferrite transformation start temperature (Ar$ sb 3 $). Further, in curved mold continuous casting, transverse cracking occurs during the unbending procedure to straighten the <b>solidified</b> curved <b>strand,</b> and this can also strongly depend on the austenite-to-ferrite transformation. In both of these industrial processes, during deformation, the temperature usually decreases continuously. Thus, two new methods to determine the Ar$ sb 3 $, based on continuous cooling compression (CCC) and continuous cooling torsion (CCT), have been developed. While the latter is applicable for low and high strains, the former can be only used for low strains. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of deformation in the single phase austenite and two phase austenite plus ferrite region on the transformation and dynamic transformation behaviour of austenite-to-ferrite. CCC tests were carried out on a low carbon steel and the influence of strain, strain rate, cooling rate and austenite grain size, was examined. During the application of strain, the generated dislocations cause an increase in stored strain energy. This energy adds to the driving force for austenite-to-ferrite transformation, increasing the kinetics of this transformation, raising the Ar$ sb 3 $ in this way. The faster kinetics leads to a finer polygonal ferrite grain size after transformation. In contrast to the effect of increasing strain, accelerated cooling rates decrease the transformation start temperature, but can still lead to grain refinement via high nucleation rates. By increasing the cooling rate, fine acicular ferrite with a high aspect ratio could be obtained. Since, the ferrite grain size is directly related to austenite grain size, by varying austenite grain size, a wide range of ferrite grain sizes could be obtained. Finally, deforming close to the Ar$ sb 3 $ maximizes the strain effect on dynamically transformed ferrite...|$|R
40|$|Modification of {{polypropylene}} (PP) is important as it aims at changing the molecular structure of PP and synthesizing different grades of PP for different processing applications. These changes include narrowing of the PP’s {{molecular weight distribution}} (MWD) by degradation via β-scission (controlled rheology PP) or formation of long chain branches (LCBs) in the PP backbone (via the formation of macroradicals). However, β-scission should be controlled to prevent severe degradation in the polymer. In addition to β-scission reactions, bimolecular chain combination reactions are necessary to form long chain branched PP (LCBPP). Thus, by adjusting reaction conditions, PP with different molecular structures can be generated. In order to initiate any PP modification reaction, PP macroradicals should be formed first by abstracting hydrogens from the PP backbone. In this thesis, UV radiation was used along with photoinitiator (hence, UV photomodification) to abstract hydrogens from PP backbones and initiate their modification. The reaction was conducted in the solid state. It {{was found that the}} final PP molecular structure is affected by photoinitiator concentration, radiation time, UV lamp intensity, radiation temperature and type of photoinitiator used. Combinations of these variables that result in LCBPP with improved melt strength were identified. In order to characterize the molecular structure of PP, rheological measurements were found to be versatile and reliable tools. Rheological techniques, along with GPC and gel content determination, were utilized in this thesis to characterize the molecular properties of the samples. Number of long chain branches (LCBs), crosslinked structures and strain hardening behavior of LCBPP and degraded PP were compared using these techniques. After detailed analysis of the effects of different radiation variables on PP modification, high benzophenone (BPH) concentration and low lamp intensity were found to be necessary to form LCBs in PP in the solid state. It was also found that more than 5 min radiation time is required to form LCBPP rather than degraded PP, when the thickness of the samples is 1 mm. One of the drawbacks in using UV radiation in polymer modification is its limited penetration depth. In order to investigate the effect of UV penetration depth along with UV radiation time, discs with thickness of 1, 2 and 3 mm were radiated for 5, 10 and 15 minutes. It was shown in this thesis that as sample thickness decreased and/or radiation time increased, more LCBs were formed. The limited UV penetration depth in PP solid samples was found to be below 1 mm. Long radiation time (above 5 min), which is necessary to form LCBPP decreases the potential of this technique for commercialization. Thus, an attempt was made to decrease the required radiation time by using a coagent. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) is a trifunctional acrylic monomer, which was used as a coagent to reduce degradation by stabilizing the radical center. The effects of coagent concentration, BPH concentration and radiation time on formation of LCBs were studied via rheological measurements and relaxation spectra analysis. Formation of LCBs in the runs was also confirmed by GPC. It was found that an increase in coagent concentration, BPH concentration and radiation time, led to formation of more branches; however, gel content of the samples also increased. Low gel content is required for certain applications, such as packaging; thus, it is important to optimize the conditions to minimize crosslinking in PP. Conditions that result in maximum long chain branching (LCB) in PP while gel content of the runs remained relatively low were found using a central composite design of experiments. Mechanisms were suggested to explain formation of LCBs or crosslinked structures under different processing conditions. Finally, in order to assist in the commercialization and scale up of the PP photomodification, a method was developed to continuously radiate PP. The modification was carried out on the <b>solidified</b> <b>strand</b> after extrusion from a twin screw extruder. The strand was stretched and folded several times over two parallel rollers. UV radiation was carried out on stretched strands between rollers and radiated PP strands were then collected on a winder. Continuous photomodification was carried out both with and without coagent. By manipulating BPH concentration and radiation time, LCBPP was successfully produced both with and without coagent. In the continuous photomodification of PP, the radiation time required for formation of LCBPP was significantly lower than in batch reactions due to low thickness of the strands. Moreover, post-extrusion stretching of the strands limits chain mobility and restricts β-scission reactions. In general, the results obtained in this thesis show that UV radiation can easily be used to modify PP and form different PP grades, ranging from controlled rheology to long chain branched and crosslinked PP...|$|R
40|$|Continuous casting is the {{dominating}} {{process to}} cast steel. Liquid steel is continuously fed from a tundish {{to a mould}} through a casting nozzle. The flow conditions in the mould {{are influenced by the}} flow pattern inside the casting nozzle as well as the level of steel in the tundish. The flow into the mould is regulated by a stopper rod or a slide gate. The surface of the <b>strand</b> <b>solidifies</b> quickly in the mould and it is important to maintain a constant level of steel to avoid surface defects. A new physical model that simulates continuous casting has been developed. A physical model of this type is unique. The scale of the model is a commonly used full-scale casting machine at slab casters, except the dimension of the tundish. It is possible to generate different types of flow conditions at simulation in the model. Water and liquid steel has similar kinematic viscosity and water is therefore often used for simulation of the continuous casting process. This simulation has been performed using an alloy with a low melting point. The alloy has besides the low melting point, similar physical properties as steel. Measurements with a compact laser vibrometer have been performed to examine the possibility to quantify the volumetric flow of alloy in the model. The compact laser vibrometer measures the vibrations {{on the surface of the}} casting nozzle as the alloy flows through during simulation. The flow of alloy in the model is determined by the velocity of the pump. A calibration of the pump was done to specify the volumetric flow at a specific pumping velocity. This provides the possibility to examine the signal from the sensor during controlled circumstances. The investigation was performed during simulation at specific single phase flows. It was found that the compact laser vibrometer shows a trend of increasing frequency at higher flow rates. A background noise was created by the engine of the pump and measurements were done to be able to exclude this type of disturbance. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Avoiding {{particle}} entrapment {{into the}} solidifying {{shell of a}} steel continuous caster is important {{to improve the quality}} of the continuous cast product. Therefore, the fluid flow dynamics in the steel melt and mushy zone, heat transfer and solidification of the steel shell, as well as the motion and entrapment of inclusion particles during the casting process were investigated using computational models. Solidification of the strand shell is modelled with an enthalpy-formulation by assuming a columnar morphology in the mushy zone. The motion of particles is tracked with a Lagrangian approach. When the particles reach the solidification front they can be entrapped/engulfed into the solid shell or pushed away from the solidification front, depending on the mushy zone morphology and the forces acting on them. The current paper focuses on the mould region at a steel continuous caster, including the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) and 1. 2 m length of the strand. The results are validated with plant measurements and demonstrate the potential of the model to predict fluid flow, shell growth and the posi-tions and the amount of entrapped/engulfed particles in the <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Continuous casting is {{a process}} in which liquid steel is cooled in a {{bottomless}} mould into semi-finished steel products called billets, blooms or slabs depending on their cross section. In the process of continuous casting, two of the major problems encountered are cracks and breakouts. Breakouts usually result in temporary shutdown of the caster and huge amounts of downtime. Primary cracks which form before the <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand</b> exits the mould, are invariably linked to breakouts. Controlling primary cracks results in reduced chances of breakouts. This work aims at designing a breakout prediction neural network model. In this paper, a two-layer feed forward backpropagation neural network model is developed for predicting the existence of primary cracks that might lead to a breakout. The network obtains its inputs in form of temperature values from rows of thermocouples attached to the mould tube. Based on solidification characteristics of steel, the neural network is supplied with various inputs (of temperature values) and targets and is trained to predict the crack status in the mould. Training is performed using the Levernberg-Marquardt (trainlm) training algorithm, and the log sigmoid transfer function was used for both the hidden and output layer. The output from this neural network was a logical 1 (if a primary crack is present) and a logical 0 (if no primary crack is present). The neural network model is validated by simulating i...|$|E
40|$|During {{continuous}} casting of steel, the delta-ferrite to austenite phase transition occurs following solidification in the meniscus {{region of the}} <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand.</b> It is of great industrial significance {{to gain a better}} understanding of the nature and mechanism of this reaction because product quality is in large measure determined by events occurring during and shortly following solidification. Moreover, the exact way in which delta-ferrite transforms to austenite may influence the subsequent transformation of austenite to ferrite, by which much of the mechanical properties of the steel is determined. Relatively little attention has been devoted to the delta-ferrite to austenite phase transition in the past, in part because of the difficulty of making in-situ observations at the high temperature at which this phase transition occurs. The recent development of high-temperature laser-scanning confocal microscopy has provided new opportunities to observe in-situ high temperature phase transformations and this technique has been employed in the present study. In order to limit grain boundary pinning by alloying elements and alloy compounds during growth of delta-ferrite grains and their influence on the δ-to-γ phase transition, the solid-state phase transformation was studied in low-carbon iron-carbon alloys. Experimental observations of the effect of cooling rate on the δ/γ phase transformation are discussed in terms of three different morphologies that have been observed. At low cooling rates the newly formed austenite phase that nucleated at triple points grow by an advancing planar interface but at higher cooling rates the transformation occurs by a massive kind of transformation. The mechanisms of grain boundary movement also been investigated. Two types of grain boundary movement, continuous motion and staggered motion have been observed. Quantitative analysis of grain boundary movement show that at low cooling rates grain boundaries are stationary for a few seconds after the initiation of the phase transformation and then they progress exponentially. Computer simulations have been used in an attempt to better explain the experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{peritectic}} reactions and transformations that occur during the solidification of many alloys. Peritectics {{are believed to}} be a major cause of crack-formation in many steels, thus, good knowledge of the mechanisms by which these phenomena occur is essential for preventing such defects. The thesis also handles the behaviour of metals, in particular cast structures, during hot forming. Grain size and microstructure are of most importance in determining the strength, toughness and performance of a steel. For achieving enhanced mechanical and microstructural properties, good understanding of the phenomena occurring during hot forming is required. Peritectic reactions and transformations were studied in Fe-base and steel alloys through differential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments and micrographic investigation of quenched DTA samples. The effect of the ferrite/austenite interface strain during the peritectic reaction on equilibrium conditions was thermodynamically analysed, and the results were related to temperature observations from DTA experiments conducted on Fe-base alloys and low-alloy steels. Massive transformations from ferrite to austenite were observed in the micrographs of a number of quenched low-alloy steel samples and it was proposed that these transformations are uncontrolled by diffusion, and occur in the solid state as a visco-plastic stress relief process. DTA study of an austenitic stainless steel indicated that the alloy can exhibit primary precipitations to either ferrite or austenite. A continuously-cast breakout shell of the steel was analyzed and it was suggested that the observed irregularities in growth were due to alternating precipitations of ferrite and austenite; parts of the shell with higher ratios of primary-precipitated ferrite shrink in volume at the peritectic temperature and experience reduced growths. An experimental method for studying the behaviour of metals during hot forming developed, and hot compression tests were conducted on cast copper and ball-bearing steel samples. Flow stress curves were obtained at varying temperatures and strain rates, and the results showed good agreement with earlier observations reported in literature. Micrographic analysis of quenched samples revealed variations in grain size and a model was fitted to describe the grain size as a function of deformation temperature and strain. Solidification growth during continuous casting of stainless steel and copper was numerically modelled. A varying heat transfer coefficient was proposed to approximate the experimentally measured growth irregularities in the continuously-cast stainless steel breakout shell. Solidification growth of pure copper was also modelled in the Southwire continuous casting process. Temperature measurements from the chill mould were used to approximate the temperature gradient and the heat extraction from the <b>solidifying</b> <b>strand,</b> and the results were used in a two-dimensional model of solidification.    QC 2010080...|$|E
