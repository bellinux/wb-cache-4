These types of nozzles exist outside the current experience database, therefore, the application of efficient design methods for these propulsion concepts {{is critical to the}} success of launch vehicle programs. The objective of this work is to optimize several different nozzle configurations, including two- and three-dimensional geometries. Methodology includes coupling computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis to genetic algorithms and Taguchi methods as well as implementation of a streamline tracing technique. Results of applications are shown for several geometeries including: three dimensional thruster nozzles with round or super elliptic throats and rectangualar exits, two- and three-dimensional thrusters installed within a bell nozzle, and three dimensional thrusters with round throats and <b>sector</b> <b>shaped</b> exits. Due to the novel designs considered for this study, there is little experience which can be used to guide the effort and limit the design space. With a nearly infinite parameter space to explore, simple parametric design studies cannot possibly search the entire design space within the time frame required to impact the design cycle. For this reason, robust and efficient optimization methods are required to explore and exploit the design space to achieve high performance engine designs.

It is shown that the first term of the expansion at ε= 0 contains an error function. This term characterizes the effect of the discontinuity on the ε-behaviour of the solution and its derivatives in the boundary or internal layers.

40|$|A new pole {{configuration}} for multi-pole homopolar bearings {{proposed in}} this invention reduces rotational losses caused by eddy-currents generated when non-uniform flux distributions exist along the rotor surfaces. The new homopolar magnetic bearing includes a stator with reduced pole-to-pole and exhibits {{a much more}} uniform rotor flux than with large pole-to-pole gaps. A pole feature called a pole-link is incorporated into the low-loss poles to provide a uniform pole-to-pole gap and a controlled path for pole-to-pole flux. In order to implement the low-loss pole configuration of magnetic bearings with small pole-to-pole gaps, a new stator configuration was developed to facilitate installation of coil windings. The stator was divided into <b>sector</b> <b>shaped</b> pieces, as many pieces as there are poles. Each sector-shaped pole-piece can be wound on a standard coil winding machine, and it is practical to wind precision layer wound coils. To achieve maximum actuation efficiency, it is desirable to use all the available space for the coil formed by the natural geometric configuration. Then, the coils can be wound in a tapered shape.

40|$|Abstract: Given an {{initially}} uncovered field, and as {{more and}} more directional sensors (sensors with <b>sector</b> <b>shape</b> sensing area) are continuously added to the sensor network, the size of partial covered areas increases. At some point, the situation abruptly changes from small fragmented covered areas to a single large covered area. This abrupt change is called the sensing-coverage phase transition (SCPT). Likewise, given an originally disconnected sensor network, {{as more and}} more sensors are added, the number of connected components changes such that the sensor network suddenly becomes connected. This sudden change is called the network connectivity phase transition (NCPT). Such phase transitions occur in a certain density which is called critical density and finding it is a central topic of Percolation Theory. In this paper, we introduce fixed-orientation directional sensor networks (FIODSNs) and analytically compute critical density of nodes for both SCPT and NCPT in FIODSNs, for all field-of-view angles betwee...|$|R

We consider countries’ rules and regulations across four dimensions: (1) the demonstration of therapeutic equivalence, (2) pharmaceutical packaging and labelling, (3) drug prescription, and (4) drug substitution. We maintain that to be able to understand and compare national approaches toward generic drug promotion, it is crucial to carefully distinguish among these four dimensions. Furthermore, we suggest that analysis must also consider how the diverse interests of actors in public and private <b>sectors</b> <b>shape</b> the design and implementation of generic drugs policies.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper makes use of the theory of integral equations to obtain solutions for certain prescribed boundary value problems from the theory of thin elastic plates. The deflection functions obtained satisfy both the partial differential equation of Lagrange throughout the region defined by the plate and the given boundary conditions and therefore are exact solutions to boundary value problems;In Chapter II the deflection functions for rectangular plates with mixed boundary conditions have been obtained by superposing line loads of unknown intensity onto a pinned rectangular plate. The intensity of these line loads is determined so that the plate will satisfy the clamped boundary conditions along the unknown load lines. In order to obtain the desired line load distribution it is necessary to solve a system of linear integral equations. The deflection functions obtained are general in that they hold for any load distribution which can be represented by a double Fourier series over the region of the original plate satisfying the mixed boundary conditions;In Chapter III the deflection functions for clamped <b>sector</b> <b>shaped</b> plates are determined by superposing unknown line load distributions along diametral lines of a clamped circular plate. The intensity distribution functions for the unknown line loads are determined by solving systems of linear integral equations which are the result of satisfying the prescribed boundary conditions along the unknown load lines.

It is assumed that the loading, plate and subgrade, possess axial symmetry and that the plate maintains continuous contact with the subgrade. The solution to this problem requires the solution of an integro-differential equation for the deflection function.

40|$|In 2009, Horrell, Meredith and Oxley used {{trends in}} body mass {{to argue that}} poor London women in the later 19 th century {{suffered}} declining access to household resources over their lifetimes. � The authors evaluated competing models of household behaviour, rejected the unitary model of equal distribution throughout the household, saw some support for a safety-first model, {{but on the whole}} concluded that resources were allocated in accordance with bargaining power linked to the economic worth of family members. � As (particularly married) women's labour-force participation fell, so too did their share of the food diminish, and with this they lost weight. � This unequal distribution was supported by a moral economy of the family: a set of shared values about obligations and entitlements which protected earners and prioritized the needs of children secured by maternal sacrifice. � The current paper explores further the role of power in the family. � The contention of a bargaining household is supported through a very different but contemporaneous case study: the modern industrial town�of Paisley. � The paper juxtaposes a service economy (Wandsworth near London) with a modern manufacturing sector (Paisley near Glasgow) in order to contrast how economic form and opportunities in the market <b>sector</b> <b>shaped</b> relations and outcomes in the household sector. � Again, our measure is lifetime nutrition and our data are drawn from prisons. � We find that families bargained over the allocation of resources; that bargaining position was heavily influenced by economic value, mediated by maternal sacrifice; that this was an earner bias rather than a gender bias; and that new industrial work for women and children supported a more egalitarian distribution that improved everyone's health status via superior heights and heavier weights. � It is a tale of two cities, of blood and bone, of flesh and families. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is divided}} into three parts. Part A, {{discusses}} some of the focusing properties of magnetic fields used for the deflection and analysia of ion beams; part B describes the design and construction of magnets employing these theoretical principles; and Part C is an account of some experimental work done using focussed beams of deuterons. The work was all alone at the Clarendon Laboratory, between Michaelmas Term 1948 and Michaelmas Term 1953, and the three parts form a roughly chronological sequence. Part A: The Focusing Properties of Magnetic Analysers. The 1 M. V. and 500 KV. acaelerators of the Clarendon Laboratory provide relatively high current beams of positive ions which are very homogeneous in energy. For separating the ions of different masses a magnetic analyser is clearly necessary, since it can be shown that the alternative, an electrostatic analyser, gives energy dispersion only. The simple magnetic analyser which was customarily used until recently, being a <b>sector</b> <b>shaped</b> uniform field, has strong focussing properties in the plane containing the beam and perpendicular to the field lines (the "perpendicular" plane), but none in a plane containing the emergent beam and parallel to the field lines (the "parallel" plane). This focussing becomes stronger as the sector angle Φ is increased, until at 90 Â°, which is frequently a convenient angle, an incident collimated beam of circular cross-section converges to a line focus at the exit boundary. This is a great inconvenience in mnny cases where care has been taken with the accelerator to provide an intense ion beam for nuclear bombardment studies. The properties of such uniform sector fields are discussed briefly, since they serve to demonstrate the formal analogy between ion trajectories in magnetic fields (ion optics) and light optics. The power of the lens in the two planes can be changed by using a field which in non-uniform, varying with radial distance as H α r -n. Such a field focusses in both planess but it is shown that coincident foci can only be obtained at image distances too close to the magnet for practical convenience in many cases. The inherent non-uniformity of the "fringe" field at the pole boundaries can be used to change the power of the lens in both planes if the boundaries make an angle with the beam at entrance or exits. Expressions are derived for the image distances in both planes and the conditions for equality are then discussed. The equation has a variety of possible solutions which are to some extent limited by practical considerations. In particular, the magnification of the systme will in general increase with the increase of image distance and this proves to be the principal limiting factor, since the object for the ion-optical system has a finite size (initially the ion source canal). The theoretical results for a 90 ° analyser are compared with experiment and reasonable agreement is found. However it is found that there is a great loss of intensity in the analysed beam. the whole question of abberations is discussed and it is found that the loss of intensity is likely to be due to spherical abberation in the electron lens system, a circumstance that can probably not be improved in the existing type of accelerator column, and which makes 90 ° analyser of the type discussed of no great advantage over the uniform-sectpr field for many purposes. For an accelerator with large spherical aberration the only way out of this difficulty is to sacrifice the large dispersion and mechanical convenience of 90 ° deflection and use deflection through small angles. this is seperately considered as a special case of a field with oblique non-uniform boundaries, and the optical properties of such a magnet as is used in Part C are discussed. Part B: The Design of Magnets for Ion Analysers. The general considerations which guide the design of an analysing electromagnetic are presented, and details are given of the construction of a magnet and pole-pieces designed to give 90 ° deflection of l M. V. deutrons in either of the two opposite directions. The pole-pieces have faces which give the beam a 19 cm. radius path in the field, and freedom to choose the boundary angle (in accordance with the principles of Part A) is provided by the adjustable segments at the pole tips. The limitations on operation imposed by heating of the windings, non-uniformity of the field due to magnetic saturation and the proximity of the coils, and the effect of the hysteresis on field stabilisation are mentioned The vacuum box the carries the beam between the magnet poles is made of brass wave guide with a rigid supporting structure of Yorkshire tubing which also serves as a high speed pumping by-pass. The field is stabalised by referring the voltage developed by the magnet current across a resistance to that of a standard cell. The unbalance current is amplified by means of a galvanometer, modulated light beam, photocell and AC amplifier, and corrects the magnet current by a moter driven variac in the power supply before rectification. It is shown that a satisfactory magnet design can be based on triangular cores and windings. The dimensions of a magnet to deflect 1. 4 M. V. tritons through 90 ° in either of the two opposite directions are given, and also details of the tests, on a &frac 14; scale model, to find the temperature rise in the windings and the expected uniformity of the field in the full-size magnet. The field at various points in space near a triangular winding has been worked out. Part C: A Further Study of the D- D Reactors The angular distribution of the products of the two reactions: (a) D + D → He 3 + n (b) D + D → H 3 + p has been investigated in the energy range 150 KV. to 450 KV. (deuteron bombarding energy). Although other workers have made measurements of (a) in this region, the technique used was different, and the present work partly bridges the gap between the work of Eliot (0 to 50 KV.) and that of Blair (1 to 315 MV.), both of whom used similar methods. The apparatus consisted of a cylindrical target chamber filled with deuterium at a pressure of about 0. 1 mm. Hg., and attached {{to the end of the}} accelerator column of a 500 KV Phillips generator. the beam was carefully collimated by a canal system, and the charged reaction products from a small volume at the centre of the target box were counted by ion counters operated in the proportional region. Two counters were arranged to swivel about an axis through the centre of the reaction volume, and a third, which was used to monitor conditions, was fixed to the lid of the box. The counter windows were of very thin (about 0. 5 μ) quartz. The counter gas was heptane vapour at a pressure (about 1 cm.) determined by a fixed temperature bath. Counts were made of the number of He 3 and H,sup> 3 particles penetrating the counter window at various angles. These particles were distinguished by a careful choice of bias applied to a phase height disoriminato, and by the use of absorbing mica screens in front of the window. The principle is that the three charged particles from the reaction, as well as scattered deuterons, give in general different amounts of ionization in the counter materials and absorbers, because of their difference of energy and charge. the results to be expected are discussed in detail. The results are conveniently expressed in terms of the 'asymmetry' coefficients A and B in the expression for the angular distribution of the yields: Y α 1 + Acos 4 Ρ + Bcos 4 Ρ There is a significant difference in the values of A and B for reactions (a) and (b), which is in agreement with the results of other workers. The values are: He 3 H 3 E(KV) A B A B 150   1. 334 ± 0. 267    - 0. 087 ± 0. 294     0. 773 ± 0. 117     0. 031 ± 0. 130   200   1. 355 ± 0. 169     0. 155 ± 0. 183     0. 687 ± 0. 161     0. 297 ± 0. 130   260   1. 718 ± 0. 212     0. 186 ± 0. 245     0. 978 ± 0. 122     0. 149 ± 0. 150   350   1. 427 ± 0. 126     0. 711 ± 0. 145     0. 637 ± 0. 116     0. 839 ± 0. 130   450   1. 342 ± 0. 138     1. 371 ± 0. 157     0. 949 ± 0. 110     0. 506 ± 0. 130   The difficulties of interpretation of these results on the basis of the only published theoretical treatment of the D - D reaction is briefly discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|My {{appreciation}} to two {{anonymous reviewers for}} their helpful comments and suggestions. This By focusing on the interface governance–public policy–democracy in Brazil, this piece seeks to further our understanding of how governance works in contexts where private <b>sectors</b> <b>shape</b> and dictate public policies in specific policy areas. It argues that governance with nondemocratic characteristics favors an environment in which, instead of executing “collective goals, ” public policies are produced to respond to particular demands of dominant actors. This point is illustrated by an examination of the Vocational Education and Training (VET) policy in Brazil. The paper concludes that the Brazilian VET policy designed and adopted by Getúlio Vargas administration in the 1940 s did indeed increase the capacity of the country to compete in a globalized world, but it did not contribute to improving political accountability or democratic governance. RESUMO Ao focalizar a interface governança–políticas públicas–democracia no Brasil, este texto busca aprofundar o conhecimento sobre o funcionamento da governança em contexto...|$|R
50|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a <b>sector</b> <b>shape</b> frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|R
