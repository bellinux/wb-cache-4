The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>occulta.</b> Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

25|$|Spina bifida is a {{birth defect}} {{where there is}} {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>occulta,</b> meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy. Learning problems are relatively uncommon.|$|E

He was born with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>occulta,</b> a birth defect, {{centered}} on the spinal column, which gave him lifelong pain – a factor in his later abuse of alcohol and drugs. Williams' father was frequently relocated by the lumber company railway for which he worked, and the family lived in many southern Alabama towns. In 1930, when Williams was seven years old, his father began suffering from facial paralysis.

2500|$|Determining {{the cause}} of death was inconclusive, as the severe {{decomposition}} on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as suicide was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities. Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had been in her system, yet the results were never released. Although the body was found in autumn, she had died in the summer, two to four months previously. This was established by examining traces from insects that were found on the remains. She had an overbite, and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The overbite was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her facial reconstruction. The estimated height was between 4'10" [...] and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an [...] "average frame". Examiners believe she was either white or Hispanic, although Native American and Asian races cannot be ruled out. She also may have been biracial. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being pigeon toed or knock-kneed, which may have been noticeable when she walked, as her feet were slanted inward. She also suffered from <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>occulta,</b> but may have been unaware of the condition. To obtain DNA information, her femur was transported to the University of Texas.|$|E

We constructed a 5 : 1 comparison group of patients with end stage renal disease without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> matched by age at first end stage renal disease service, gender and race/ethnicity. We assessed the risk of mortality and of renal transplantation while on dialysis using multivariate cause specific proportional hazards survival analysis.

Updated estimates are essential for calculations of lifetime costs and for economic evaluations of prevention and management strategies for <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2001 – 2003 MarketScan database on paid medical and pre-scription drug claims of persons covered by employer-sponsored health insurance in the United States. Med-ical care utilization and expenditures during 2003 were analyzed for persons with a diagnosis of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> recorded during 2001 – 2003 who had 12 months of coverage in a fee-for-service health plan. To calculate expenditures during infancy, a separate analysis was performed for those born during 2002 with claims and expenditures data during the first 12 months of life. We compared medical expenditures for persons with and without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> by age groups. RESULTS: Average incremental medical expenditures comparing patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and those without were $ 41, 460 per year at age 0, $ 14, 070 at ages 1 – 17, $ 13, 339 at ages 18 – 44, and $ 10, 134 at ages 45 – 64.
