25|$|The DROWN {{attack is}} an exploit that attacks servers {{supporting}} contemporary SSL/TLS protocol suites by exploiting {{their support for}} the obsolete, insecure, SSLv2 protocol to leverage an attack on connections using up-to-date protocols that would otherwise be secure.

Full details of DROWN were announced in March 2016, together with a patch for the exploit. As of March 2016, more than 81,000 of the top 1 million most popular Web sites are among the TLS protected web <b>sites</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable to the DROWN attack.|$|E
25|$|Loons mate on land, {{often on}} the future nest site, and build their nests close to the water, preferring <b>sites</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{completely}} surrounded by water such as islands or emergent vegetation. Loons {{use a variety of}} materials to build their nests including aquatic vegetation, pine needles, leaves, grass, moss and mud. Sometimes, nest material is almost lacking. Both male and female build the nest and incubate jointly for 28 days. If the eggs are lost, the pair may re-nest, usually in a different location. Since the nest is very close to the water, rising water may induce the birds to slowly move the nest upwards, over a meter.|$|E
