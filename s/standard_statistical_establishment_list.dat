40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction and}} assessment of a new matched employer-employee data set, the 1990 Decennial Employer-Employee Dataset (1990 DEED). By using place of work name and address, we link workers from the 1990 Long Form Sample to their place {{of work in the}} 1990 <b>Standard</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Establishment</b> <b>List.</b> The resulting data set is much larger and more representative across regional and industry dimensions than previous matched data sets for the United States.

In Italy since 1994 an active business statistic register has been created through the integration of those information received from administrative sources run by other private and public societies...|$|E

40|$|In 1992 a {{match was}} {{performed}} between the IRS Form 1040, Schedule C file and the <b>Standard</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Establishment</b> <b>List</b> (SSEL). The match supplemented existing linkages already established {{between the two}} files. Though no matching operation has been performed on subsequent 1040 files, the links established on the 1992 data continue {{to be used in}} the processing of these files. We are now in a position to analyze the long term effectiveness of the procedure and how frequently it should be applied. As a by product of the matching operation we obtained a measure of the fit between two records. We explore the possibility of utilizing this measure to link records or select records to be subjected to a matching procedure. The measure of fit derived from the 1992 processing can also be applied to test the validity of existing linkages derived from other procedures...|$|E

40|$|Neutron {{multiplicity}} {{measurements are}} carried out for the 19 F + 194, 196, 198 Pt systems at excitation energy range of 48 to 67. 5 MeV. Out of these three compound nuclei (CN) 217 Fr, 215 Fr and 213 Fr, one of the CN (213 Fr) has neutron shell closure (NC= 126). Experimentally obtained neutron multiplicities are compared with the <b>standard</b> <b>statistical</b> model predictions. It has been observed that the <b>standard</b> <b>statistical</b> model under-predicts the experimental pre-scission neutron multiplicities values. Also the comparison of pre-scission neutron multiplicities for different compound nuclei (CN) indicates the signature of shell effects on nuclear dissipation, which results in the lowering of the pre-scission neutron multiplicities...|$|R
