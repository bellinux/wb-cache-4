5|$|Emperor Aurangzeb, {{built the}} Alamgiri Gate, whose <b>semi-circular</b> towers and domed pavilions are a widely {{recognised}} symbol of Lahore {{that was once}} featured on Pakistani currency.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>semi-circular</b> granite {{memorials}} {{list the}} names of the Hoosiers killed in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|As {{the size}} of the city and numbers of {{visitors}} grew new facilities opened. Cleveland Pools in Hampton Row, is a <b>semi-circular</b> lido built, by John Pinch the elder, around 1814. It {{is believed to be the}} oldest surviving public outdoor swimming pools in England.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Pools {{located in}} Hampton Row, Bath, Somerset, England is a <b>semi-circular</b> lido built to designs by John Pinch the elder in 1815. It is {{believed}} to be the oldest public outdoor swimming pool in England. It is a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Sambusak is a <b>semi-circular</b> {{pocket of}} dough filled with mashed chickpeas, fried onions and spices. There is another variety filled with meat, fried onions, parsley, spices and pine nuts, which is {{sometimes}} mixed with mashed chickpeas and breakfast version with feta or tzfat cheese and za'atar.|$|E
5|$|The Sydney Hotel {{was built}} within the gardens. It {{later became the}} Holburne Museum. The {{original}} design for the hotel, prepared by Thomas Baldwin in 1794, was a two-storey building which would serve the pleasure gardens. After Baldwin was bankrupted his design for the hotel was not implemented. Instead a three-storey building was designed by Charles Harcourt Masters. The foundation stone was laid in 1796 and the building was ready by 1799. Visitors entered the gardens through the Hotel. Projecting {{from the rear of}} the building at first floor level was a conservatory and a <b>semi-circular</b> orchestra with a wide covered loggia below. Two <b>semi-circular</b> rows of supper boxes projected from the sides of the building.|$|E
5|$|Use of <b>semi-circular</b> and {{horizontal}} arches, {{and lack of}} pointed arches, represented a departure from normal Fatimid architecture, probably taken from Syrian examples, and were never widely used during the Fatimid period. The use of stone also reflects Syrian tastes.|$|E
5|$|Although central Leeds has few {{buildings}} {{from the}} Middle Ages, there are examples within the City of Leeds boundaries, including two at Wetherby. Wetherby Bridge {{dates from the}} Medieval period, but has been considerably altered, the pointed Gothic arches of different heights being replaced by <b>semi-circular</b> arches. It is said that the Bishop of York granted absolution of sins to local residents in return for building the bridge.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, <b>semi-circular</b> or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are <b>semi-circular</b> or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn {{lies within}} a {{geological}} structure which is interpreted {{as evidence of}} a volcanic caldera. This is a <b>semi-circular</b> series of faults which sweep eastwards to encompass Helvellyn, Patterdale, Deepdale and Fairfield, and which abut against a major north-south fault to the west (along {{the line of the}} A591 road).|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that a <b>semi-circular</b> structure or barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower. Records from 1335 indicate {{the purchase of a}} lock and key for the lions and leopards, also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the Tower. By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie.|$|E
5|$|Located at {{the western}} end of the fort, the Alamgiri Gate is the {{entrance}} of the Lahore Fort. It was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1674. It has two <b>semi-circular</b> bastions where lotus petal design adorns its base. It opens to the Hazuri Bagh and faces the Badshahi Mosque. The gate is one of Lahore's most iconic monuments, and once featured on Pakistani currency.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, <b>semi-circular</b> apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the <b>semi-circular</b> sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E
5|$|The towers are <b>semi-circular.</b> Their inner flanks have lobed arches as decorations, a North African motif {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Fatimids. The vestibule {{to the right}} contains a half-domed recess with elegantly carved arches at each corner. The gates were massive, weighing four tons. The gates today have two minarets, open to visitors, from which the area may be viewed. Additions were made during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ornate}} <b>semi-circular</b> wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished cornice each side above {{a row of}} little fan-vaults {{separating}} seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The ceiling is finely finished with bosses {{at the intersection of}} the moulded principals and purlins. It was inserted in 1882–84.|$|E
5|$|Tunnelling {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide <b>semi-circular</b> windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual bag-like {{structures}} were present on each pitcher, one {{on either side}} of the central wing. Similar but <b>semi-circular</b> {{structures were}} found on the margin of the lid. These structures exhibited strong yellow-green intrinsic fluorescence when exposed to visible light with a wavelength of 500 nm (blue-green).|$|E
5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a <b>semi-circular</b> auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his <b>semi-circular</b> nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
5|$|Open-spandrel {{segmental}} arch bridge: The earliest known fully stone open-spandrel {{segmental arch}} bridge is the Zhaozhou Bridge in southern Hebei province, China, completed in 605 by the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineer Li Chun. The bridge span is 37.5m (123ft) {{and the structure}} relatively light in weight due to the four <b>semi-circular</b> arch spandrels which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, and the simple segmental arch Lugou Bridge built in 1698 (originally in 1189). The latter, located just west of Beijing and features eleven segmental arches.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide <b>semi-circular</b> windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide <b>semi-circular</b> windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single <b>semi-circular</b> window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Harlech has close links to {{that found in}} the kingdom of Savoy in the same period. These include <b>semi-circular</b> door arches, window styles, corbelled towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. The links between the Harlech and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Harlech project.|$|E
5|$|The arrow-head {{design of}} the castle's bastion {{reflected}} new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of <b>semi-circular</b> bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework, but an arrow-headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth {{was among the first}} fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to adopt this design.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral stands atop a hill in {{the center}} of what was the {{original}} settlement of the city of Qingdao, at 15 Zhejiang Road (formerly Bremen Strasse) {{on the east side of}} Zhongshan Road in Shinan District. The church is built in the historic style of German Romanesque. It is cruciform in plan, having a nave flanked by a lower single aisle on either side, crossed by a transept, and with a <b>semi-circular</b> apse projecting at the east end.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built on a flat terrace near the south west of corner of the estate. The two storey {{building}} is constructed of brick in a classical style, dressed with ham stone features and a hipped tile roof. The garden frontage {{of the house is}} symmetrical with a pediment at the centre above a cupola. It includes a porched door with some <b>semi-circular</b> stone steps toward the garden. The entrance facade is asymmetrical, with a tall arcaded entrance projecting out from the house on the south-west corner.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and <b>semi-circular</b> front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown molding around the room on the walls from the ceiling {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Helgoland {{received}} four twin gun turrets between 1909–12, although their exact type is unknown. Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II {{was built to}} protect the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders during World War I. It consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on Bettungsschiessgerüst (BSG) (firing platforms). These manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount and the rear was supported by rollers resting on a <b>semi-circular</b> rail. They were equipped with a gun shield and capable of all-around fire. They were manned by sailors from Naval Artillery Regiment (Matrosen Artillerie Regiment) 1.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied {{structure}} is rectangular in plan. The portico has four Ionic columns with fluted stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables {{of the building}} have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The {{lower part of the}} exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have <b>semi-circular</b> French windows, with pilasters on both sides. In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of foreign architects, namely the German C. Sandreczki, the Boromphiman Throne Hall became the most modern building within the Grand Palace; {{it was also the}} first to be designed to accommodate carriages and motorcars. The exterior walls are embellished with pilasters and elaborate plaster designs. The triangular and <b>semi-circular</b> pediments are decorated with stuccoed floral motifs. The palace's distinctive Mansard roof is covered in dark grey slate tiles. On the façade of the building, the main and central pediment show the emblem of the crown prince.|$|E
5|$|WS-110 was {{redesigned}} as {{an aircraft}} flying Mach3 {{for the entire}} mission. Zip fuel was retained for the engine's afterburner to increase range. Both North American and Boeing returned new designs with very long fuselages and large delta wings. They differed primarily in engine layout; the NAA design arranged its six engines in a <b>semi-circular</b> duct under the rear fuselage, while the Boeing design used separate podded engines located individually on pylons below the wing, like the Hustler.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two <b>semi-circular</b> flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of <b>semi-circular</b> arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays {{parallel}} to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the <b>semi-circular</b> wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a <b>semi-circular</b> staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the doorway to The Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wear.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a <b>semi-circular</b> layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E
