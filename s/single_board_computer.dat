In November 2005, the AFRL XSS-11 satellite demonstrator received Popular Science's [...] "Best of What's New" [...] award in the Aviation and Space category. The Space Vehicles Directorate is also a leading collaborator in the Department of Defense Operationally Responsive Space Office's Tactical Satellite Program and served as program manager {{for the development of}} TacSat-2, TacSat-3, and is current program manager for the development of TacSat-5. They also have contributed experimental sensors to TacSat-4 which is managed by the NRL's Center for Space Technology.|$|E
