5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a <b>scabbard.</b> A fully mounted <b>scabbard</b> (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the <b>scabbard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the <b>scabbard</b> between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the <b>scabbard</b> typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
5|$|During the Kamakura and Muromachi period, samurai wore a short sword {{known as}} koshigatana in {{addition}} to the long tachi. Koshigatana were stuck directly into the belt {{in the same way as}} later the katana and uchigatana. They had a mounting without a guard (tsuba). The corresponding style is known as aikuchi ("fitting mouth") as the mouth of the <b>scabbard</b> meets the hilt directly without intervening guard.|$|E
50|$|Older barong <b>scabbards</b> tended {{only to be}} {{partially}} wrapped with large rattan lashings, while newer barong <b>scabbards</b> feature a full wrap of thin rattan. Also, the <b>scabbards</b> of older barong featured thinner flat boards, whereas post World War II barong <b>scabbards</b> are of much thicker stock, and feature a central ridge line. The terminus on modern-made <b>scabbards</b> tends to turn upward to a more dramatic degree, often at a near 90-degree angle and feature squared tips. As with kris <b>scabbards</b> of the post World War II era, mother of pearl inlays begin to appear at the throat and tips of barong <b>scabbards</b> as well.|$|R
5000|$|U.S.-contracted Mark I knives are {{stamped on}} the right side of the brass grip [...] "U.S. 1918", with the contractor's {{initials}} located just below. The U.S. knives utilized a six-sided pommel cap. Like the French-made version, U.S. Mark I knives came with proprietary <b>scabbards</b> designed to accommodate the Mark I knife with its oversized grip, but fabricated of steel instead of iron. Both blades and <b>scabbards</b> were issued with a blackened finish to prevent reflection. However, many soldiers (and later, civilian owners) attempted to polish the blades and/or <b>scabbards,</b> believing the blackened finish to be tarnish. As a result, many original Mark I knives and <b>scabbards</b> have lost their original finish. American-made steel <b>scabbards</b> for the Mark I trench knife were marked [...] "L.F.&C. 1918".|$|R
50|$|Panabas <b>scabbards</b> {{were made}} of plain wood and are now {{extremely}} rare - according to accounts, largely because warriors would frequently discard them prior to a battle. Such <b>scabbards</b> invariably consist of two pieces of wood which are taken apart to remove the sword, {{as opposed to the}} sheath-type <b>scabbards</b> used by most other swords. The weapons are also said to have been carried into battle wrapped in cloth and slung across the back.|$|R
5|$|Baldrics {{are worn}} {{from the right}} {{shoulder}} to left hip and are color specific by nation. In the United States, Panama, and the Philippines, baldrics are red, white, and blue. Red and white baldrics are used in Canada and Poland; red, white, and green in Mexico; and blue and white in Guatemala. Service baldrics include a <b>scabbard</b> for a sword and are worn over the coat while social baldrics are worn under the coat.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hy≈çgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the <b>scabbard</b> and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E
5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its <b>scabbard.</b> The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scabbards</b> were {{generally}} made from two plates of iron, and suspended from a belt made of iron links. Some <b>scabbards</b> had front plates of bronze rather than iron. This was more common on Insular examples than elsewhere; {{only a very}} few Continental examples are known.|$|R

5|$|There {{are also}} {{elaborate}} carved stone battle-axes found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, {{rather than being}} practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power. Similarly, the site at Forteviot, in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather <b>scabbard</b> and a carved wooden bowl.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the <b>scabbard</b> under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his <b>scabbard,</b> as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword <b>scabbard</b> decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|Lobanov-Rostovsky {{ultimately}} sold Szczerbiec to Prince Anatole Demidov {{who kept}} it {{together with the}} rest of the Demidov collection in his Villa San Donato near Florence. In 1870, the sword was bought for 20,000 French francs by Alexander Basilevsky, Russian ambassador to France and great art collector. In 1878, he displayed Szczerbiec at the World's Fair in Paris. By that time, the <b>scabbard</b> had been lost and the sword itself was presented as of Teutonic origin. It was seen by several Polish visitors who speculated whether it could be the Polish coronation sword. In 1884, the entire Basilevsky collection was purchased by Emperor Alexander III of Russia for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Both Polish and other experts at the time expressed doubts as to the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in Russia's largest museum (see Historical replicas below). An international museum congress held in Saint Petersburg in 1913 pronounced the sword a 17th-century replica.|$|E
5|$|Six medieval coins were recovered, the {{earliest}} {{of which was}} a silver penny of John from the early 13thcentury. Coins from later periods were a silver threepence from the reign of Elizabeth I and a silver penny from Charles I. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18thcentury and later, including a 10-pfennig piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from copper alloy were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (<b>scabbard</b> tip), and part of a skimmer that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel spurs (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12horseshoes.|$|E

5|$|While at a <b>Scabbard</b> and Blade honors society {{conference in}} New Orleans, Louisiana, Shoup heard {{a speech by}} Major General John A. Lejeune, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, {{offering}} commissions in the U.S. Marine Corps to interested officer candidates. Shortly after being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve in May 1926, Shoup applied, and was offered a commission in the Marine Corps. In August 1926 he resigned his commission in the Army and traveled from Camp Knox, Kentucky, to Chicago, Illinois, for physical exams. On 25 August 1926, {{he arrived at the}} Marine Corps barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and commenced Marine Officers Basic School. Shoup maintained that he had never previously considered a military career and had only chosen to become a military officer for the pay. Throughout his service, he excelled in athletics and marksmanship, and during his early career he would coach recreational athletic teams in addition to his regular assignments. He quickly established himself as an assertive and demanding leader, impressing both his commanders and his subordinates. Despite his no-nonsense demeanor, those he commanded later recalled his ability to keep morale with his sense of humor. He often sported a clenched cigar, which became something of a trademark during his front-line service.|$|E
25|$|Excalibur's <b>scabbard</b> {{was said}} to have powers of its own. Loss of blood from injuries, for example, would not kill the bearer. In some tellings, wounds {{received}} by one wearing the <b>scabbard</b> did not bleed at all. In the later romance tradition, including Le Morte d'Arthur, the <b>scabbard</b> is stolen from Arthur by his half-sister Morgan le Fay in revenge for the death of her beloved Accolon and thrown into a lake, never to be found again. This act later enables the death of Arthur at the Battle of Camlann.|$|E
