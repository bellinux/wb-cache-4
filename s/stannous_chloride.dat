40|$|An {{electron}} microscopic {{investigation has}} revealed that the electroless deposition of copper occurs by repeated three-dimensional nucleation at cata-lytic sites on a substrate. The nature of the catalytic sites formed by im-mersion in the standard <b>stannous</b> and palladium <b>chloride</b> solutions was ob-served and found to influence {{the structure of the}} subsequently deposited metal. Initially, copper nuclei about 25 A in diameter form aggregates an order of magnitude larger. As the autocatalytic reduction reaction continues the aggregates increase in size unti l they become energetically unstable; then recrystallization occurs. The resulting continuous copper films exhibit a heterogeneous microstructure with grain size variations of more than an order of magnitude and also numerous twin faults. There exists at present a considerable and rapidly growing interest in the electroless deposition of metallic films onto nonconducting substrates. Althoug...|$|R
30|$|In {{a recent}} {{publication}} concerning the RB 5 dyed silk we {{observed that the}} Raman signals are mainly due to the dye [41]. In the case of some historic samples of dyed silks analyzed, the ATR spectrum {{of one of them}} dated the beginning of the 20 th century, displays bands easily ascribed to silk fibroin and two intense bands at 2073 and 492  cm− 1. In another sample black weft and pink warp fibers were identified. The Raman spectrum of the black warp fiber displays bands at 2166, 530 and 273  cm− 1, corresponding to Prussian blue; then, the warp fiber was stained with Prussian blue. According to Hacke [76] the <b>stannous</b> and iron <b>chloride</b> solutions were used as mordant of the Napoleon blue a modification of the Prussian blue pigments. The SEM-EDS data indicate the presence of tin and iron confirming that these mordant were used in this sample. The spectral analysis of the pink warp allows identifying silk bands. In the case of the Manila mantle dated to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century showing a black to brown fading, no Raman spectra of the silk were obtained; the laser excitation probably induced the sample degradation. To avoid the degradation we used the SERS methodology and the 785  nm laser line for the study. The SERS signals correspond to the dye Sudan Black B following Geiman et al. [77] and the Raman data [see Additional file 1].|$|R
25|$|PbCl2 {{is used in}} {{production}} of infrared transmitting glass, and ornamental glass called aurene glass.

25|$|The two {{principal}} forms of cochineal dye are cochineal extract, a colouring {{made from the}} raw dried and pulverised bodies of insects, and carmine, a more purified colouring made from the cochineal. To prepare carmine, the powdered insect bodies are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum {{is added to the}} clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt. Purity of colour is ensured by the absence of iron. <b>Stannous</b> <b>chloride,</b> citric acid, borax, or gelatin may be added to regulate the formation of the precipitate. For shades of purple, lime is added to the alum.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical {{study of the}} stability of the gas-phase diatomic dications SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + using ab initio computer calculations. The ground states of SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + are thermodynamically stable, respectively, with dissociation energies of 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 42 eV. Whereas SnF 2 + dissociates into Sn 2 + + F, the long range behaviour of the potential energy curves of SnCl 2 + and SnO 2 + is repulsive and wide barrier heights due to avoided crossing act as a kind of effective dissociation energy. Their equilibrium internuclear distances are 4. 855, 5. 201, and 4. 852 a(0), respectively. The double ionisation energies (T-e) to form SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + from their respective neutral parents are 25. 87, 23. 71, and 25. 97 eV. We combine our theoretical work with the experimental results of a search for these doubly positively charged diatomic molecules in the gas phase. SnO 2 + and SnF 2 + have been observed for prolonged oxygen (O- 16 (-)) ion beam sputtering of a tin metal foil and of tin (II) fluoride (SnF 2) powder, respectively, for ion flight times of about 10 (- 5) s through a magnetic-sector mass spectrometer. In addition, SnCl 2 + has been detected for O- 16 (-) ion surface bombardment of <b>stannous</b> (tin (II)) <b>chloride</b> (SnCl 2) powder. To our knowledge, SnF 2 + is a novel gas-phase molecule, whereas SnCl 2 + had been detected previously by electron-impact ionization mass spectrometry, and SnO 2 + had been observed before by spark source mass spectrometry as well as by atom probe mass spectrometry. We are not aware of any previous theoretical studies of these molecular systems. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

50|$|A Quantitative {{method to}} {{determine}} the amount of phosphate present in samples such as boiler feedwater is as follows. A measured amount of boiler water is poured into a mixing tube and ammonium heptamolybdate reagent is added. The tube is then stoppered and vigorously shaken. The next step is to add dilute <b>stannous</b> <b>chloride</b> reagent, which has been freshly prepared from concentrated <b>stannous</b> <b>chloride</b> reagent and distilled water, to the mixture in the tube. This will produce a blue color (due to the formation of molybdenum blue) and the depth of the blue color indicates the amount of phosphate in the boiler water. The absorbance of the blue solution can be measured with a colorimeter and the concentration of phosphate in the original solution can be calculated. Alternatively, a direct (but approximate) reading of phosphate concentration can be obtained by using a Lovibond comparator. This method for phosphate determination is known as Deniges' method.|$|E
