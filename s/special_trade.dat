5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed key {{positions}} in the public service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, suggested that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society {{could be attributed to}} the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> agreements with Japan.|$|E
5|$|Tang dynasty (618–907) {{emperors}} gave princesses {{in marriage}} to {{rulers of the}} Uyghur Khaganate to consolidate the <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> and military relationship that developed after the Khaganate supported the Chinese during the An Lushan Rebellion. At least three Tang imperial princesses {{are known to have}} married khagans between 758 and 821. These unions temporarily stopped in 788, which is believed in part to be because stability within the Chinese empire meant that they were politically unnecessary; however, threats from Tibet in the west, and a renewed need for Uyghur support, precipitated the marriage of Princess Taihe to Bilge Khagan.|$|E

Hull believed that the fundamental causes of {{the two world wars}} lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare.

2500|$|On 21 June, {{immediately}} following the conclusion of signatory and ceremonial developments surrounding the end of hostilities, Milner published the Letters Patent establishing the system of crown colony government in the Transvaal and Orange River colonies, and changing his title of administrator to that of governor.

He provided a steady revenue by the levying of a 10% tax on the annual net produce of the gold mines, and devoted special attention to the repatriation of the Boers, land settlement by British colonists, education, justice, the constabulary, and the development of railways. At Milner's suggestion the British government sent Henry Birchenough a businessman and old friend of Milners as <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> commissioner to South Africa with the task of preparing a Blue Book on trade prospects {{in the aftermath of the}} war.

2500|$|The {{eldest son}} of Sarhat, named Zachariah, {{functioned as a}} royal {{merchant}} on behalf of king Suleiman I (r. 1666–1694). Zachariah {{played a pivotal role}} in the ratification of Tsar Alexis's (r. 1645–1676) decree to grant the merchants from New Julfa <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> privileges to use the Russian route for the Safavid silk export to Europe. During the same era, the Scerimans started to search for more expansion of their influence. In the early 17th century, in 1613, the Scerimans already owned property (a house) in Venice. They used it for their family members and agents whenever needed. Passing the mid-17th century, other sons of Sarhat started to increase the family's holdings in Italy. In the 1650s/60s, his fourth son named Gaspar, would already spend long periods of time in various Italian cities, including Venice, Livorno as well as Rome. In the 1660s, it is suggested that Sarhat's son Marcara was the district head (kadkhodah) of the neighborhood in New Julfa where the Scerimans resided. Approaching the 18th century, in the 1690s, two sons of Morad di Sceriman (also written as Murat), the latter who was another son of Sarhat, would invest roughly 720,000 Ducats into various banks in Venice. They did so by establishing numerous [...] "interest-bearing accounts" [...] and by offering [...] "substantial" [...] loans to the Venetian Republic, who needed it for its wars against the Ottoman Empire. These investments would gain them significant profit later on. From the same time, a certain [...] "cultural component" [...] is noted as well in the Scerimans' fixation on the Italian city-states.|$|E

60|$|About this time, too, {{the rising}} young mason {{began to feel}} that he must {{get a little more}} {{accurate}} scientific knowledge. The period for general study had now passed by, and the period for <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> reading had set in. This was well. A lad cannot do better than lay a good foundation of general knowledge and general literature during the period when he is engaged in forming his mind: a young man once fairly launched in life may safely confine himself for a time to the studies that bear directly upon his own special chosen subject. The thing that Telford began closely to investigate was--lime. Now, lime makes mortar; and without lime, accordingly, you can have no mason. But to know anything really about lime, Telford found he must read some chemistry; and to know anything really about chemistry he must work at it hard and unremittingly. A strict attention to one's own business, understood in this very broad and liberal manner, is certainly no bad thing for any struggling handicraftsman, whatever his trade or profession may happen to be.|$|E

60|$|I am {{disposed}} {{to believe that}} no novel reader in England has seen {{the little town of}} Bullhampton, in Wiltshire, except such novel readers as live there, and those others, very few in number, who visit it perhaps four times a year for the purposes of trade, and who are known as commercial gentlemen. Bullhampton is seventeen miles from Salisbury, eleven from Marlborough, nine from Westbury, seven from Haylesbury, and five from the nearest railroad station, which is called Bullhampton Road, and lies on the line from Salisbury to Ycovil. It is not quite on Salisbury Plain, but probably was so once, when Salisbury Plain was wider than it is now. Whether it should be called a small town or a large village I cannot say. It has no mayor, and no market, but it has a fair. There rages a feud in Bullhampton touching this want of a market, as there are certain Bullhamptonites who aver that the charter giving all rights of a market to Bullhampton does exist; and that at one period in its history the market existed also,--for a year or two; but the three bakers and two butchers are opposed to change; and the patriots of the place, though they declaim on the matter over their evening pipes and gin-and-water, have not enough of matutinal zeal to carry out their purpose. Bullhampton is situated on a little river, which meanders through the chalky ground, and has a quiet, slow, dreamy prettiness of its own. A mile above the town,--for we will call it a town,--the stream divides itself into many streamlets, and there is a district called the Water Meads, in which bridges are more frequent than trustworthy, in which there are hundreds of little sluice-gates for regulating the irrigation, and a growth of grass which is a source of much anxiety and considerable trouble to the farmers. There is a water-mill here, too, very low, with ever a floury, mealy look, with a pasty look often, as the flour becomes damp with the spray of the water as it is thrown by the mill-wheel. It seems to be a tattered, shattered, ramshackle concern, but {{it has been in the}} same family for many years; and as the family has not hitherto been in distress, it may be supposed that the mill still affords a fair means of livelihood. The Brattles,--for Jacob Brattle is the miller's name,--have ever been known as men who paid their way, and were able to hold up their heads. But nevertheless Jacob Brattle is ever at war with his landlord in regard to repairs wanted for his mill, and Mr. Gilmore, the landlord in question, declares that he wishes that the Avon would some night run so high as to carry off the mill altogether. Bullhampton is very quiet. There is no <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> in the place. Its interests are altogether agricultural. It has no newspaper. Its tendencies are altogether conservative. It is a good deal given to religion; and the Primitive Methodists have a very strong holding there, although in all Wiltshire there is not a clergyman more popular in his own parish than the Rev. Frank Fenwick. He himself, in his inner heart, rather likes his rival, Mr. Puddleham, the dissenting minister; because Mr. Puddleham is an earnest man, who, in spite of the intensity of his ignorance, is efficacious among the poor. But Mr. Fenwick is bound to keep up the fight; and Mr. Puddleham considers it to be his duty to put down Mr. Fenwick and the Church Establishment altogether.|$|E
