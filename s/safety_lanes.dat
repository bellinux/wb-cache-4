The bridges overpass the railway (which {{runs in a}} cutting, at a lower level) linking the Malpensa Airport {{to the city of}} Milan, Italy; and are part of a U-shaped path called the H (Hotel) Ring which connects the southern ends of the two existing taxiways. Such a crossing had to: (a) intersect the railway track twice with a skew angle of about 45 °; (b) carry the maximum aeronautical loads, corresponding to the gears of an Airbus 380 aircraft and; (c) host a 60 m wide taxiway strip, plus a lateral <b>safety</b> <b>lane</b> and a service road, for a total width of 105 m.

50|$|An autovía {{is one of}} {{two classes}} of major highway in the Spanish road system similar to a British {{motorway}} or an American freeway. It is akin to the autopista, the other major highway class, but has fewer features and is never a toll road. Some distinguishing features of an autovía are that it must be divided by a median, it must have restricted access, and it cannot be crossed by other roads. While autopistas are generally new routes, autovías are normally improvements to existing roads, so they may have tighter curves and less safe accesses, often with shorter acceleration lanes. However, both have nominal speed limits of 120 km/h. Rest areas are usually 300 km or 2 hours apart. There is usually a <b>safety</b> <b>lane</b> along the median.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{steering}} assistance {{system is designed}} and experimentally tested on a prototype passenger vehicle. Its main goal is to avoid lane departures when the driver has a lapse of attention. Based on a concept linking Lyapunov theory with Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) optimization, the following important features are ensured during the assistance intervention: the vehicle remains within the lane borders while converging towards the centerline, and the torque control input and the vehicle dynamics are limited to safe values to ensure the passengers' comfort. Because the {{steering assistance}} takes action only if necessary, two activation strategies have been proposed. Both activation strategies were tested on the prototype vehicle and were assessed as appropriate.

50|$|From its {{designation}} in 1957 until 1972, I-95 in Portsmouth did not {{connect to}} I-95 in Kittery, Maine. Instead, the expressway ended at the Portsmouth Circle. From there motorists {{had to use}} US 1 Bypass and go over the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge to the junction near the Kittery Circle with US 1. This bridge was what connected the New Hampshire and Maine Turnpikes. It is a drawbridge over the Piscataqua waterway, which would create an obvious problem. Not only would this be an obstacle to traffic, but the bridge was a narrow three-lane undivided roadway where the center lane could either {{be used in the}} direction of the greatest traffic flow or left closed for greater <b>safety.</b> <b>Lane</b> identification was accomplished via repeated banks of three traffic lights, one over each lane, and is the reason for the third (center) traffic light that is no longer used on the now two-lane bridge.|$|R
5000|$|When invading Marja, {{the invading}} troops confiscated caches {{of weapons and}} ammunition. The {{greatest}} obstacle was the extensive network of mines and booby traps. The assault troops were reported to run into [...] "a huge number" [...] of improvised explosive devices when crossing a canal into the town's northern entrance. Marines and Army used portable aluminium bridges to span the irrigation channels. Mobile bridges enabled the safe crossing of the main canal into Marja, since the existing bridge {{was expected to be}} rigged with explosives. Marine engineers moved forward in special mine-clearing Assault Breacher Vehicles. These 72-ton, 40-foot (12-meter)-long vehicles, fitted with a 15-foot (4.5-meter)-wide plow supported by metallic skis that glide on the dirt, and nearly 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of explosives, ploughed a path through fields and dug a <b>safety</b> <b>lane</b> through the numerous minefields laid by the Taliban.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} an NP-hard lane {{reservation}} problem on transportation network. By selecting lanes to be reserved {{on the existing}} transportation network under some special situations, the transportation tasks can be accomplished on the reserved lanes with satisfying the condition of time or <b>safety.</b> <b>Lane</b> reservation strategy is a flexible and economic method for traffic management. However, reserving lanes has impact on the normal traffic because the reserved lanes can only be passed by the special tasks. It should be well considered choosing reserved lanes to minimize the total traffic impact when applying the lane reservation strategy for the transportation tasks. In this paper, an integer linear program model is formulated for the considered problem and an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solve method is proposed. Some new techniques are developed for the cut-and-solve method to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical computation results of 125 randomly generated instances show that the proposed algorithm is much faster than a MIP solver of commercial software CPLEX 12. 1 to find optimal solutions on average computing time...|$|R

On 4 October, Seawolf again was directed to report her position, and again she failed to do so.

Richard M.

Richard M. Rowell established sonar contact on the submarine, which then sent a series of dashes and dots which Richard M. Rowell stated bore no resemblance to the existing recognition signals. Believing this an attempt to jam her sonar, Richard M. Rowell attacked with Hedgehogs. The second attack was followed by underwater explosions, and debris rose to the surface.|$|R

50|$|There are a {{total of}} 32 firing lanes and targets can be set as far as 75 ft from the shooter. For <b>safety,</b> each <b>lane</b> is {{separated}} from the adjacent lanes by bullet-resistant glass. The range's backstop can handle most calibers of rifle and handgun; anything that produces less than 8100 pound/feet of force. Each lane has an advanced system that controls that lane's respective target, increasing safety. This system is also more time efficient because it removes the need to walk down range to check or change targets. The range utilizes 180 air filters to keep the air fresh and clean by moving gasses away from shooters immediately.|$|R

40|$|In this study, two bridges {{recently}} completed at the Malpensa Airport are presented. The bridges overpass the trench where the railway track from Malpensa Airport {{runs to the}} city of Milan. They are part of a U-shaped path, called the hotel (H) ring, which connects the southern ends of the two existing taxiways. Such a crossing had to: (a) intersect the railway track twice with a high skew angle, (b) carry the maximum aeronautical loads, corresponding to the gears of an AIRBUS 380 aircraft and (c) host a 60 -m wide taxiway strip, plus a lateral <b>safety</b> <b>lane</b> and a service road, for a total width of 96 m. For a bridge operating in such an environment, it was imperative to reduce inspections and maintenance activities to a minimum. Therefore, the designers excluded any detail arrangements or auxiliary devices having life-cycle performances much shorter than that of the main structure. In particular, expansion joints and movable or deformable bearing supports were excluded. Such constraints led to design two structures having the peculiar features that characterise them as integral bridges. This paper will firstly recall the aeronautical and railway specifications and the other operating constraints that characterised the design. In the second part, the criteria followed in designing the foundations, the abutments and the deck are presented. The structural analyses were set out in accordance to the sequence of the construction stages. For the bridge in its service configuration, self-weight and permanent loads give rise to a set of internal forces typical of a portal frame, while the localised loads, due to the aircraft gears, induce bubble deformed shapes characterised by particular transversal load distribution mechanisms. Details of completions and finishing works are finally given...|$|R
