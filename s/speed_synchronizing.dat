40|$|The {{fact that}} {{requirements}} for shift quality in automatic transmissions have been increasing rapidly necessitates {{the establishment of}} a suitable shifting control strategy in order to facilitate smoothness of different processes. For this very purpose, this paper introduces a simulation model of an 8 -speed automatic transmission for front-drive vehicles with respect to detailed shifting strategies and relative parameters. An impact function can be used to reduce the transmitted torque of the oncoming shift elements before synchronization point in order to damp the impact and thus make the gear shifting process more smooth. This paper makes a systematic introduction of the structure of 8 AT, theoretical basis of control strategy, the establishment of the simulation model and the comparison between test results and simulation results. The conclusion shows that with parameters well calibrated, engine torque transferring and <b>speed</b> <b>synchronizing</b> process will be smoother, which helps realizing the ultimate goal of better shift quality with higher efficiency, lower shift loads and improved shifting comfort. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the work carried out aiming towardsdistributed control of electric drives through a networkcommunication medium with temporal constraints, i. e, Ethernet. A general analysis on time delayed systems is carried out,using {{state space representation}} of systems in the discretetime domain. The effect of input time delays is identified andis used in the preceding controller designs. The main hardwareapplication focused {{in this study is}} a Brushless DC servomotor, whose speed control loop is closed via a 10 MbpsSwitched Ethernet network. The speed control loop, which isapproximately a decade slower than the current control loop, isopened and interfaced to the network at the sensor/actuatornode. It is closed at the speed controller end at another nodein the same local area network (LAN) forming a distributedcontrol system (DCS). The Proportional Integral (PI) classical controller designtechnique with ample changes in parameter tuning suitable fortime delayed systems is used. Then the standard Smith Predictoris tested, modified with the algebraic design techniqueCoefficient Diagram Method (CDM), which increases the systemdegrees of freedom. Constant control delay is assumed in thelatter designs despite the slight stochastic nature in thetiming data observations. Hence the poor transient performanceof the system is the price for the robustness inherited to thespeed controllers at the design stage. The controllability andobservability of the DCS may be lost, depending on the range inwhich the control delay is varying. However a state feedbackcontroller deploying on-line delay data, obtained by means ofsynchronizing the sensor node and controller node systemclocks, results in an effective compensation scheme for thenetwork induced delays. Hence the full state feedbackcontroller makes he distributed system transient performanceacceptable for servo applications with the help of poleplacement controller design. Further, <b>speed</b> <b>synchronizing</b> controllers have been designedsuch that a speed fluctuation caused by a mechanical loadtorque disturbance on one motor is followed effectively by anyother specified motor in the distributed control network with aminimum tracking or synchronizing error. This type ofperformance is often demanded in many industrial applicationssuch as printing, paper, bagging, pick and place and materialcutting.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{importance of}} pulsatility is a recurring topic of debate in mechanical circulatory support. Lack of pulsatility {{has been identified}} as a possible factor responsible for adverse events and has also demonstrated a role in myocardial perfusion and cardiac recovery. A commonly used method for restoring pulsatility with rotodynamic blood pumps (RBPs) is to modulate the <b>speed</b> profile, <b>synchronized</b> to the cardiac cycle. This introduces additional parameters that influence the (un) loading of the heart, including the timing (phase shift) between the native cardiac cycle and the pump pulses, and the amplitude of speed modulation. In this study, the impact of these parameters upon the heart-RBP interaction was examined in terms of the pressure head-flow (HQ) diagram. The measurements were conducted using a rotodynamic Deltastream DP 2 pump in a validated hybrid mock circulation with baroreflex function. The pump was operated with a sinusoidal <b>speed</b> profile, <b>synchronized</b> to the native cardiac cycle. The simulated ventriculo-aortic cannulation showed that the level of (un) loading and the shape of the HQ loops strongly depend on the phase shift. The HQ loops displayed characteristic shapes depending on the phase shift. Increased contribution of native contraction (increased ventricular stroke work [WS]) resulted in a broadening of the loops. It was found that the previously described linear relationship between WS and the area of the HQ loop for constant pump speeds becomes a family of linear relationships, whose slope depends on the phase shift...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{previously}} {{developed a}} native heart load control {{system for a}} continuous-flow left ventricular assist device and demonstrated that the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>synchronized</b> with the cardiac cycle can alter left ventricular preload and myocardial oxygen consumption. In the present study, we assessed this system in a conscious goat model of chronic heart failure. MethodsChronic heart failure was induced by coronary microsphere embolization of the left ascending artery and subsequent rapid ventricular pacing in 6 goats. After 4 to 6 weeks of rapid pacing, the goats showed a decreased ejection fraction (from 89. 7 % ± 3. 1 % to 53. 3 % ± 5. 4 %) measured during sinus rhythm. The assist device was implanted {{by way of a}} left thoracotomy, and we examined the effects of the continuous, co-pulse, and counterpulse mode on the end-diastolic volume and stroke work, determined from the left ventricular pressure–volume loops. ResultsSignificant decreases were found in the end-diastolic volume and stroke work in the counterpulse mode relative to the values observed with 0 % bypass (63. 4 % ± 15. 2 % and 39. 1 % ± 18. 2 %, respectively; P < . 01). Furthermore, both increased in the co-pulse mode (82. 1 % ± 17. 6 % and 68. 3 % ± 22. 2 %; P < . 01) compared with those in the continuous mode (69. 6 % ± 15. 4 % and 54. 6 % ± 21. 6 %) with 100 % bypass. ConclusionsThe system offers the possibility to control the left ventricular load by changing the rotational speed of a continuous-flow assist device in synchronization with the cardiac cycle.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) {{running at}} a {{constant}} speed are routinely used for the mechanical support of the heart in various clinical applications, from short-term use in heart-lung machines to long-term support of a failing heart. Their operating range is delineated by suction and regurgitation events, leaving limited control on the cardiac workload. This study investigates whether different ratios of systolic/diastolic support are advantageous over a constant-speed operation. METHODS In order to effectively control the load on the heart, this study aimed at developing a pulsatile control algorithm for rotary pumps to investigate the impact of pump speed modulation during systole and diastole on the left ventricle unloading. The CentriMagTM RBP with a modified controller was implanted in four sheep via a left thoracotomy and cannulated from the ventricular apex to the descending aorta. To modulate the pump <b>speed</b> <b>synchronized</b> with the heartbeat, custom-made real-time software detected the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram and controlled the pump speed during systole and diastole. Four different speed modulations with the same average speed but different systolic and diastolic speeds were compared with the baseline and the constant speed support. Left ventricular (LV) pressure and volume, coronary flow and pump flow were analysed to examine {{the influence of the}} pump speed modulation. RESULTS Pulsatile setting reduces the cardiac workload to 64 % of the baseline and 72 % of the constant speed value. Maximum unloading is obtained with the highest speed during diastole and high-pulse amplitude. End-diastolic volume in the pulsatile modes varied from 85 to 94 % of the baseline and 96 to 107 % of the constant speed value. Consequently, the mechanical load on the heart can be adjusted to provide assuagement, which may lead to myocardial recovery. The higher pump speed during systole results in an increase in the pulse pressure up to 140 % compared with the constant speed. CONCLUSIONS The present study is an initial step to more accurate speed modulation of RBPs to optimize the cardiac load control. To develop future control algorithms, the concept of high speed during diastole having a maximal unloading effect on the LV and high speed during systole increasing the pulse pressure is worth considerin...|$|R

Cosimulation performance is in inverse proportion {{to the number of}} processor simulators in conventional cosimulation frameworks with lock-step synchronization schemes. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel time synchronization technique called trace-driven virtual synchronization. Having separate phases of event generation and event alignment in the cosimulation, time synchronization overhead is reduced to almost zero, boosting cosimulation speed while accuracy is almost preserved. In addition, this technique enables (1) a fast mixed level cosimulation where different abstraction level simulators are easily integrated communicating with traces and (2) a distributed parallel cosimulation where each simulator can run at its full <b>speed</b> without <b>synchronizing</b> with other simulator too frequently.
