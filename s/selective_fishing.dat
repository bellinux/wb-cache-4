40|$|A key {{objective}} of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy reforms is the elimination of discards {{and a reduction in}} unwanted catches. Combining a discard ban with catch quotas, where all fish, independent of size, count towards quotas could create economic incentives for more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing,</b> reducing unwanted catches. We use fishing activities data from English North Sea otter trawlers to examine the impact of these measures on this fleet. Initial impacts depend on the scale of increase and distribution of quotas and are unevenly distributed, depending on catch and discard characteristics of vessels. <b>Selective</b> <b>fishing</b> will be rewarded as vessels that currently have low discards could increase catches and profits. Fishing by less selective vessels will be curtailed, reducing profits by 1 – 14 %. This could be partially mitigated through reducing regulated catches but will require changes to fishing patterns as using currently available <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> gears may impact on profitability. So, catch quotas and a discard ban create strong incentives for more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> practices, but also for non-compliance with full documentation of catches. A high level of monitoring and enforcement will be required to ensure that fishers improve profitability through more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> practices rather than illegal discarding...|$|E

40|$|Globally, {{many fish}} species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with {{increasing}} concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, {{has caused a}} reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> is widely encouraged {{in the belief that}} nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. <b>Selective</b> <b>fishing</b> applies {{one or more of the}} " 6 -S" selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a "balanced exploitation" approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem.

40|$|Abstract: Barriers {{interfere}} with aquatic connectivity by preventing or limiting migratory fishes from spawning and other life history processes, {{and there is}} increasing pressure to restore connectivity. However, conflicting management objectives exist in many jurisdictions where barriers to fish movement inhibit the restoration of native fishes but protect native fish communities above barriers from undesirable invasive species. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, barriers are an important management tool in the control of invasive Sea Lampreys. Sea Lampreys remain highly destructive in the Great Lakes, and are a constant threat to a 7 billion dollar fishery. Developing <b>selective,</b> effective bi-directional <b>fish</b> passage to remove Sea Lampreys while allowing the passage of native fishes has become an issue of great importance for Great Lakes fisheries managers. To date, efforts have included a variety of approaches including velocity barriers, seasonal barriers, trap-and-sort fishways, and eel ladders. The integration of emerging technologies, such as push-pull and electrical and pheromone guidance and advances in engineering, such as eel-style ladder traps are providing hope that better <b>selective,</b> effective bi-directional <b>fish</b> passage solutions are possible.

40|$|Discarding, or {{returning}} {{unwanted catch}} to the sea, {{is a common}} feature of European fisheries, and is widely acknowledged as morally wrong. It wastes food and economic resources, and has contributed to overfishing in EU stocks. However, under the current Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), catch that is below minimum landings sizes, exceeds quota, or does not match catch composition regulations must be discarded. The high profile of discarding {{in recent years has}} put pressure on the European Commission (EC) to reform the CFP. A key objective is to eliminate discards and reduce unwanted catches. A discard ban and catch quotas for regulated species will be implemented. The EC argues that this will create strong incentives for more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing,</b> but little supporting evidence from EC fisheries is available. This thesis aims to present such evidence. A desk based analysis of a number of global fisheries found that a discard ban in isolation created little or no incentive to avoid unwanted catches; supporting measures were required to encourage more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> practices. Analysis of the potential impact of introducing a discard ban on English North Sea otter trawlers supported this finding. Models using economic, logbook and observer data showed that the cost of capturing unwanted catch is minimal unless a cap is placed on total catches. Catch quotas cap fishing mortality, creating a strong incentive to reduce catches of limiting species. This incentive is unequally distributed between and within fleets, and is strongest for the least selective vessels. If catch compositions are not adjusted to match available quota, substantial reductions in revenue could occur. So under the reformed CFP discards of regulated species could be eliminated, the cost of catching unwanted fish will be passed onto the fishers, and strong incentives for more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> practices will be generated...|$|E

40|$|Fetal {{nucleated}} {{cells in}} the maternal circulation constitute a potential source of cells for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic abnormalities. We have investigated {{the use of the}} Magnetic Activated Cell Sorter (MACS) for enriching fetal nucleated erythrocytes. Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for CD 45 and CD 32 were used to deplete leucocytes from maternal blood using MACS sorting, thus enriching for fetal nucleated erythrocytes which do not express either of these antigens. However, significant maternal contamination was present even after MACS enrichment preventing the accurate analysis of fetal cells by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). To overcome this problem, we used simultaneous immunophenotyping of cells with the mouse antifetal haemoglobin antibody, UCH gamma, combined with FISH analysis using chromosome X and Y specific DNA probes. This approach enables <b>selective</b> <b>FISH</b> analysis of fetal cells within an excess of maternal cells.

40|$|We studied skewed adult copepod sex ratios in two ponds in {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of this life-history phenomenon. In ponds containing populations of zooplanktivorous sunfish, female copepods suffered higher mortal-ity rates than males, while in ponds lacking these predators, male and female mortality rates were similar. Field and laboratory experiments showed that females, especially those carrying eggs, were more visible than males and that added visibility accounted for higher predation by fish on these individuals. We calculated the cost of carrying eggs in terms of the decreased population growth rate it produces, and then estimated the magnitude of egg mortality necessary to select for the egg-carrying strategy. Eggs not carried would have to suffer at. least 58 % mortality for egg carrying to evolve in the presence of <b>selective</b> <b>fish</b> predation.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of discards in European fisheries {{has been identified}} as a specific objective of the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. To reduce the uncertainty in catch data and the socially unacceptable waste of resources that results from the disposal of catch at sea, a policy to ban discards has been proposed. Discard bans are currently implemented in Alaska, British Columbia, New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. Experience from these countries highlights that a policy of mandatory landings can result in a reduction in discards, but relies upon a high level of surveillance or economic incentives to encourage fishers to land more of their catch. Discard bans will also not result in long term benefits to stocks unless total removals are reduced, through the avoidance of undersized, non-commercial or over quota catch. Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing.</b> Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur...|$|E

The resulting cost-effectiveness ratio gives the cost of achieving a certain objective and can be compared with the willingnessto- pay for the policy, often expressed by the politicians.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the results of <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> on {{demersal}} fishes in the East China and Yellow Seas, the effectiveness of effort was calculated from the catch and effort statistics by species and boat sizes. The yearly variation in the effectiveness of effort from 1952 to 1975 showed that yellow croaker and cuttlefishes had a decreasing and increasing tendency respectively, after 1965. In 1977, the material for subsidiary articles of diet (flatfishes, korai prawn, cuttlefishes and yellow sea bream) had a high value in the effectiveness of effort. The raw material for fish paste products (yellow croaker, hairtail, white croaker and lizardfishes) had a low value. The former {{was chosen as the}} target for the <b>selective</b> <b>fishing.</b> The seasonal change in the effectiveness of effort for a large sized boat was greater than that of other size categories, and was quite variable by species.

40|$|A major {{attribute}} of the Earth’s climate {{that may be}} affected by global warming is the amplitude of variability in teleconnections. These global-scale processes involve links between oceanic conditions in one locale and weather in another, often distant, locale. An example is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which can affect rainfall and then the properties of lakes in Europe, Africa, North and South America. It affects rainfall, droughts {{and the depth of}} lakes in Florida, USA. It is predicted that the amplitude of variation in the ENSO will increase with global warming and, therefore, droughts will become more severe and periods of rain more intense. We investigated possible effects of climate on the zooplankton in shallow subtropical lakes by studying 16 years of monthly data from six shallow eutrophic lakes located north of Orlando, Florida. Results indicate that water depth and lake volume are tightly coupled with rainfall, as expected. During droughts, when lake depth and volume were greatly reduced, there were intensified cyanobacterial blooms, and the zooplankton shifted towards greater relative biomass of copepods compared to cladocerans. The change of zooplankton was likely due to the intensified <b>selective</b> <b>fish</b> predation in the reduced water volume, and/or selective adverse effects of cyanobacteria on cladocerans. The greatly reduced volume might lead to a ‘perfect storm’ of top-down and bottom-up factors that favor copepods over cladocerans. The mechanism needs further study.

40|$|Introduction : The Utilization of {{fisheries}} resource in Indonesia waters has just achieved about half (56. 06 %) {{of the maximum}} sustainable yield. In the north coast of Central Java, which has a coastal line of about 450 kilometers, 20 types of fishing gear are owned by fishermen. Experiment : Data were collected from Annual Report 1993 – 1997 issued by Central Java Fisheries Agency. Twenty types of fishing gear were classified into 6 groups, i. e. seine nets, purse seine, gillnets and trammel nets, lift nets, lines, and traps. Two of them were categorized as unselective fishing gear, i. e. seine nets and purse seine, whereas the other 4 were classified as selective ones. The number of each group was expressed in means and percentages and the development/changes thereof was presented in percentage. Results and discussion : The number of unselective fishing gears grew rapidly from 1996 to 1997, i. e. seine nets 17. 31 % and purse seine 12. 07 %. on the country the number of <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> gear increased slightly or even decreased, for example traps (5. 98 %), line (4. 13 %), liftnets (- 3. 21 %), and gill nets & trammel nets (- 2. 45 %).

40|$|Understanding how {{combinations}} of fishing effort and selectivity affect productivity {{is central to}} fisheries research. We investigate the roles of fishing regulation in comparison with ecosystem status for Baltic Sea cod stock productivity, growth performance, and population stability. This case study is interesting because three cod populations with different exploitation patterns and stock status are located in three adjacent but partially, ecologically different areas. In assessing stock status, growth, and productivity, we use survey information and rather basic stock parameters without relying on age readings. Because there is an urgent interest of {{better understanding of the}} current development of the Eastern Baltic cod stock, we argue that our approach represents partly a novel way of interpreting monitoring information together with catch data in a simplified yet more informative way. Our study reports how the Eastern and Western Baltic cod have gone toward more truncated size structures between 1991 and 2016, in particular for the Eastern Baltic cod, whereas the Öresund cod show no trend. We suggest that <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> may disrupt fish population dynamic stability and that lower natural productivity might amplify the effects of <b>selective</b> <b>fishing.</b> In support of earlier findings on a density-dependent growth of Eastern Baltic cod, management is advised to acknowledge that sustainable exploitation levels for Eastern Baltic cod are much more limited than perceived in regular assessments. Of more general importance, our results emphasize the need to embrace a more realistic view on what ecosystems can produce regarding tractable fish biomass to facilitate a more ecosystem-based fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|Reforms of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will {{implement}} an EU wide ban on discarding {{phased in}} from 2015, requiring the landing of unwanted small and unmarketable fish. The Commission argues {{that this will}} create strong incentives for more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> practices; however, there is little information {{to allow us to}} predict likely changes in fishing behaviour. Using detailed historic observer and logbook data from English North Sea otter trawlers and information on fish prices and landing costs, we examine the potential impact of a discard ban combined with either effort controls or catch quotas on the landings of an average trip. We calculate fishing incomes {{based on the assumption that}} existing fishing behaviour and catch compositions are maintained and compare this with incomes calculated on the assumption that all unwanted catch can be avoided. The difference provides an estimate of the maximum possible financial incentive for fishers to adopt more <b>selective</b> <b>fishing</b> practices. The calculations suggest that a discard ban in isolation will generate little economic incentive to operate more selectively. When combined with effort controls, a reduction in fishing effort may result in a proportional reduction in unwanted catches, but an incentive to actively avoid this catch is unlikely to be generated. Catch quotas would generate much stronger economic incentives, but only for the avoidance of the five quota species. So, contrary to the aims of the reformed CFP, a discard ban may not result in a dramatic reduction in unmarketable catches of all species...|$|E
40|$|The Strait of Gibraltar and the Bay of Cadiz {{are areas}} of high {{productivity}} and rich ecosystems. Large <b>selective</b> and non-selective <b>fishing</b> fleets {{as well as}} numerous sports-fishing vessels operate in the area. Incidental captures worldwide have increased by nearly 130 % in the 21 st century. This study aims at determining which lesions observed on cetaceans {{can be attributed to}} interactions with fisheries. Observations were carried out from opportunisti...|$|R
50|$|Solutions {{that people}} can do: fish less today so we can harvest more fish in the future, eat less fish that is {{wasteful}}ly caught, become educated about fish {{so that we can}} reject fish caught unsustainably, and favour the most <b>selective,</b> least wasteful <b>fishing</b> methods. Laws that should be implemented in the future: give fisherman tradable rights to fish, create marine reserves, give regional fisheries bodies real power as they are preserving the populations in their local area, and let citizens take ownership of the sea.|$|R
2500|$|... "Shoaling {{behaviour}} {{is generally}} {{described as a}} trade-off between the anti-predator benefits of living in groups {{and the costs of}} increased foraging competition." [...] Landa (1998) argues that the cumulative advantages of shoaling, as elaborated below, are strong <b>selective</b> inducements for <b>fish</b> to join shoals. Parrish et al. (2002) argue similarly that schooling {{is a classic example of}} emergence, where there are properties that are possessed by the school but not by the individual fish. Emergent properties give an evolutionary advantage to members of the school which non members do not receive.|$|R
