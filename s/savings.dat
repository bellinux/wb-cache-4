40|$|This paper {{examines}} the recent <b>saving</b> {{performance of the}} Chilean economy {{in the light of}} its long-run (1940 - 96) trends. The first conclusion that can be derived from the data {{is that most of the}} increase in private <b>saving</b> since the mid- 1980 s is due to business <b>saving.</b> Household <b>saving</b> turns out to be a stationary variable with zero mean. Since business <b>saving</b> has a unit root, households do not seem to take the <b>saving</b> of firms into account when making their own <b>saving</b> decisions. Within the theoretical framework of a model of business investment with liquidity constraints, we estimate a VAR for business <b>saving,</b> private investment, public <b>saving</b> and foreign <b>saving</b> (the current account deficit). We are able to determine that business <b>saving</b> is unaffected by public <b>saving,</b> but that, in the long run, foreign <b>saving</b> and business <b>saving</b> are perfect substitutes. Private investment, business <b>saving</b> and foreign <b>saving</b> are jointly determined. The policy conclusions are that policies that stimulate investment are likely to lead to an increase in private <b>saving,</b> that policies aimed at raising household <b>saving</b> will be ineffective, and that increases in public <b>saving</b> are very powerful for increasing domestic <b>saving</b> in the long ru...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore <b>saving</b> motives and <b>saving</b> horizon using a large, nationally representative dataset, the Survey of Consumer Finances. The framework is based on prospect theory, in which consumption and <b>saving</b> decisions are based on a reference point rather than on lifetime income. Prospect theory also posits that individuals construct various mental accounts, thereby allowing for households to have multiple <b>saving</b> motives. Since prospect theory does not assume that <b>saving</b> decisions are based on lifetime income, <b>saving</b> horizons are allowed to vary. The emergency and retirement <b>saving</b> motives are found to significantly increase the likelihood of <b>saving</b> regularly. Longer <b>saving</b> horizons are also found to have a highly significant effect on the likelihood of <b>saving,</b> while poor health is shown to have a significantly negative effect on the likelihood of <b>saving.</b> The results show that the <b>saving</b> motives held by households differ by <b>saving</b> horizon, but the exact relationships are unclear.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{research}} examining {{the effects of}} tax-based <b>saving</b> incentives on private and national <b>saving.</b> Several" factors make this an unusually difficult problem. First, households that participate in, or are eligible for, <b>saving</b> incentive plans have systematically stronger tastes for <b>saving</b> than other households. Second, the data indicate that households with <b>saving</b> incentives have taken on more debt than other households. Third, {{significant changes in the}} 1980 s in financial markets, pensions, social security, and nonfinancial assets interacted with the expansion of <b>saving</b> incentives. Fourth, <b>saving</b> incentive accounts represent pre-tax balances, whereas conventional taxable accounts represent post-tax balances.

A major theme of this paper is that analyses that ignore these issues overstate the impact of <b>saving</b> incentives on <b>saving.</b> We show that accounting for these factors largely or completely eliminates the estimated positive impact of <b>saving</b> incentives on <b>saving</b> found in the literature.
