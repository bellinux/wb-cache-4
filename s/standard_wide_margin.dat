[...] Furthermore, with {{an absence of}} local standards, in a local test of 7 supermarket vegetables sent to laboratories, European Union standards regarding pesticides were used, with coriander and chili in particular exceeding <b>standards</b> by a <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b> Thailand mangoes are also subject to methomyl contamination, a banned substance in all developed nations, nevertheless includes exported mangoes to developed countries.|$|R
40|$|The latest {{generation}} of neural networks has made major per-formance advances in object categorization from raw images. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks currently outperform alternative approaches on <b>standard</b> benchmarks by <b>wide</b> <b>margins</b> and achieve human-like accuracy on some tasks. These engineering successes present {{an opportunity to}} ex-plore long-standing questions {{about the nature of}} human con-cepts by putting psychological theories to test at an unprece-dented scale. This paper evaluates deep convolutional net-works trained for classification on their ability to predict cat-egory typicality – a variable of paramount importance in the psychology of concepts – from the raw pixels of naturalistic images of objects. We find that these models have substantial predictive power, unlike simpler features computed from the same massive dataset, showing how typicality might emerge as a byproduct of a complex model trained to maximize clas-sification performance...|$|R
25|$|Caledonian {{sought to}} {{differentiate}} {{itself from the}} other UK independent airlines and US supplemental carriers with which it competed in the transatlantic closed group charter market by providing a personalised, high quality full-scheduled-service style inflight service that exceeded most contemporary scheduled transatlantic operators' economy class service <b>standards</b> by a <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b> On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The inflight service began with tartan-clad cabin staff serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row {{as soon as the}} seat belt signs were turned off. This was followed by the main meal, starting with a separately served hors d'œuvre before serving a main course of fillet of beef, Tournedos, lamb or a chicken dish, accompanied by a selection of complimentary wines. Thereafter, a dessert course was served, followed by a choice from a cheese tray and a basket of fresh fruit. The inflight service concluded with tea or coffee being served with complimentary brandies and liqueurs, as well as free cigarettes for those who smoked.|$|R
