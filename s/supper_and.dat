5|$|Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty and Evans {{passed over}} the Simplon Pass and on to Milan, where they viewed Leonardo's The Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> visited the Brera Gallery. After a sixteen-day {{cabriolet}} ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached Florence, where they stayed for two days visiting the city's galleries. On 10August, the two men finally reached Rome.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last <b>Supper,</b> <b>and</b> the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Captain Napoleon Bonaparte, an {{artillery}} officer, was {{placed under the}} command of General Jean-Baptiste Carteaux to deal with rebels from Marseille situated in Avignon, where army munitions required by the French Army of Italy were being stored. On 24 July, Carteaux's National Guardsmen assaulted Avignon which was held by rebellious Guardsmen. They killed thirty citizens in cold blood during the attack before capturing the town and army supplies. Afterwards, Napoleon travelled to nearby Tarascon to find wagons with which to transport the munition. He visited Beaucaire, across the river from Tarascon, which had been holding an annual fair. Napoleon arrived on 28 July, {{the last day of the}} fair, and went to a tavern where he shared <b>supper</b> <b>and</b> conversation with four merchants– two from Marseille, one from Montpellier and another from Nîmes.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good! Hee-haw! Excellent!" [...] cried Kik-a-bray, much pleased. [...] "You shall {{all have}} fine <b>suppers</b> <b>and</b> good beds. What food would you prefer, a bran mash or ripe oats in the shell?" ...|$|R

25|$|Two wall {{painting}} in Kikinda show even more intentions for Venetian painting. They are The Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> Christ in Eclat, masterpieces of Serbian baroque painting.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also not}} {{uncommon}} to find an icon of the Mystical Supper, which depicts the Last <b>Supper,</b> <b>and</b> by extension the Communion of Saints in the Kingdom of God, somewhere above the Beautiful Gates.|$|E

60|$|Spike and the Señor Montefalderon {{were under}} the coach-house, no one else {{appearing}} on {{any part of the}} quarter-deck. The people were eating their <b>suppers,</b> <b>and</b> Josh and Simon were busy in the galley. As for the females, they chose to remain in their own cabin, where Spike was well pleased to leave them.|$|R

25|$|The Crypto-Calvinists were {{confident}} {{that they would be}} able to bring Augustus over to their Calvinizing positions by convincing Augustus that they were in fact merely loyal Lutherans, when in fact they were working to introduce Calvinist views of the Lord's <b>Supper,</b> <b>and</b> the doctrine of predestination at the University of Wittenberg.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the lateral}} nave, there is the access to the belfry and old high-choir, which are surmounted by tiles {{representing}} the Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> the Holy Trinity. The old high-choir, which is over the entrance windbreak, is the location of the pipe organ, installed in 1994 by the Micaelense, Dinarte Machado.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Leaven {{serves as}} a {{connection}} between the Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> each Eucharist. This has special importance in the Liturgy of Addai and Mari used by the Assyrian Church, which does not recount the Words of Institution that echo the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper. As such, the Holy Leaven serves as material link in lieu of words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Ed, I don't {{know what}} you're driving at. I haven't been extravagant, ever. Why, I've asked you {{any number of}} times not to spend so much money for <b>suppers</b> <b>and</b> so forth--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{old lady}} is worth cultivating,--gives good <b>suppers,</b> <b>and</b> thanks you for eating them. The girl is well got up, {{but has no}} style, and blushes like a milkmaid. Better fight shy of her, Joe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{quite the}} other way, I hear. I know {{a man who}} has been to three or four of his <b>suppers,</b> <b>and</b> he told me that Carthew had lost every time, once or twice pretty heavily." ...|$|R
25|$|The final {{ministry}} in Jerusalem is traditionally called the Passion and begins with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem {{early in the}} week that includes the Last <b>Supper,</b> <b>and</b> liturgically marked by Holy Week. The gospels pay special attention to the account of the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, and the narrative amounts to about one third of the text of the four gospels, showing its theological significance in Christian thought in the Early Church.|$|E
25|$|This incident, {{traditionally}} {{known as}} the Last Supper, is also described by the gospel writers, Mark and Luke, and by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians. With the preceding description of the breaking of bread, it is {{the foundation for the}} tradition of the Eucharist or Holy Communion, celebrated regularly in many Christian churches. The Bible makes no mention of the cup except {{within the context of the}} Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> gives no significance whatsoever to the object itself.|$|E
25|$|John has no baptism of Jesus, no temptation, no transfiguration of Jesus, {{it lacks}} the {{institution}} of the Lord's <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> stories of Jesus' ancestry, birth, and childhood. Jesus's career in the synoptics takes up a single year while in John it takes three, in John the cleansing of the Temple takes place {{at the beginning of his}} ministry while in the synoptics it happens at the end, and in the synoptics the Last Supper takes place as a Passover meal, while in John it happens on the day before Passover.|$|E

25|$|The {{singular}} nave {{consists of}} a high-choir over stone pillars, a sillar of marble azulejo tile and stucco vaulted-ceiling. In addition, there is a baptistery, {{to the left of}} the altar, six lateral chapels and raised pulpit {{to the left of the}} altar. The concave chapels are designed within a Roman arch, and include gilded retables, are all covered in vegetal elements. The last altar, deeper than the rest, includes imagery from the Last <b>Supper</b> <b>and</b> a ceiling painting of the Holy Spirit. A fence of wood separates the chapels from the rest of the nave.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer, the ACNA has authorized the use of later versions, including the 1928 and 1979 editions produced by the Episcopal Church and the 1962 edition produced by the Anglican Church of Canada. In 2013, the College of Bishops approved on a trial basis Texts for Common Prayer, a collection of liturgies made specifically for the Anglican Church in North America. Texts for Common Prayer includes morning prayer, evening prayer, the Eucharist or Lord's <b>Supper,</b> <b>and</b> an ordinal. In 2014, the ACNA also approved a catechism for trial use, To Be a Christian: An Anglican Catechism.|$|E
25|$|In {{favor of}} the {{historical}} and eyewitness character of the Gospel, a few passages are cited. John's chronology {{for the death of}} Jesus seems more realistic, because the Synoptic Gospels would have the trial before the Sanhedrin occurring {{on the first day of}} the Passover, which was a day of rest. Schonfield agrees that the Gospel was the product of the Apostle's great age, but further identifies him as the Beloved Disciple of the Last <b>Supper,</b> <b>and</b> so believes that the Gospel is based on first hand witness, though decades later and perhaps through the assistance of a younger follower and writer, which may account for the mixture of Hebraicisms (from the Disciple) and Greek idiom (from the assistant).|$|E
