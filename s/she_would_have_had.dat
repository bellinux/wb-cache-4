On the night before the debate, she phoned Verdonk to tell her that she had lied when she applied for asylum in the Netherlands, just as Pasic had. She said that Verdonk responded that if she had been minister at that time, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Hirsi Ali deported.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found that, while {{the bus driver}} was not aware that {{a portion of the}} bus was on the tracks as she should have been, the timing of signals was so insufficient that, even if she had identified the hazard as the train approached, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to proceed against a red traffic signal into the highway intersection to have moved out of the train's path.|$|E
25|$|Since police detectives {{initially}} {{seemed to}} be unhelpful to Lieberman and assumed that Philip had died with the other victims, he hired Gallant, who found two pieces of evidence suggesting {{that she may have}} returned to the apartment building early on the morning of September 11. The first was the call from the home phone to Lieberman's cell; the second was some videotape from the security cameras in the lobby. Timestamped at 8:43a.m., just 3 minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 was crashed into the North Tower, and within the 7-9 a.m. timeframe during which, Lieberman later testified, Philip always returned after her nights out, it shows a woman entering the building, waiting near the elevator and leaving after a few minutes. Due to the poor contrast from the sunlight in the lobby, she was visible only in silhouette, but her hair and dress are consistent with Philip as seen in the Century 21 tape from the previous evening. Her family also says the woman exhibits similar mannerisms. She is, however, not carrying any of the bags that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> from her shopping trip, and again she is apparently unaccompanied. Lieberman could not positively identify her as his wife, but a city police investigator believes it was her.|$|E

Information about Zenobia's ancestry and immediate family connections is scarce and contradictory. Nothing is known about her mother, and her father's identity is debated.

500|$|Ships {{designed}} for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or [...] and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, {{was the first}} large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> little endurance {{on the other side}} of the ocean. The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule. Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.|$|E
500|$|To mark Bondfield's centenary in 1973, Linda Christmas in The Guardian {{reviewed}} {{the progress of}} women in parliament since the 1930s. By 1973, Christmas reported, only 93 women had sat in parliament; their contributions had overall [...] "not been stunning". Their best numerical representation at that point {{had been in the}} 1966 general election, when 29 women (out of 630 MPs) had been elected. The 1979 election saw this number fall to 19, but also saw Margaret Thatcher become Britain's first woman prime minister. Cox and Hobley draw attention to Thatcher's early life as a shopkeeper's daughter, and contrast her account of those days with Bondfield's experiences half a century earlier. Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute; thus, Cox and Hobley assert, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> little sympathy for Bondfield's campaigns to better shopworkers' conditions. Despite the changes that have taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield's day, Cox and Hobley believe that, were she alive, [...] "she'd still be champing at the bit, trying to coax shop assistants to join a union, and fiercely championing shopworkers' rights to better pay and conditions".|$|E

The episode had everything that makes 30 Rock great." [...] Canning opined that Liz's admissions to Oprah Winfrey were [...] "painfully funny", and that Tracy [...] "was on fire" [...] following his actions in this episode. In conclusion, Canning gave it a 10 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina of Paste was complimentary towards the episode, reporting that it had [...] "madcap humor tirelessly delivered one joke after another at a lightning fast speed, adding up to one of the funniest episodes in the series." [...] Medina enjoyed the social experiment between Jenna and Tracy, noting that it was [...] "hilarious". TV Guides Matt Mitovich commented that the episode was [...] "Rock-solid", while Neal Justin of the Star Tribune believed it was [...] "the most brilliant episode in the series' history". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "Believe in the Stars" [...] belonged to Tina Fey [...] "who has grown by leaps and bounds as an actress over the past few years. The Princess Leia voice, her drunken panic on the plane and the religious fervor at the knowledge that Oprah would be coming to the studio were all hilarious, and played with the sort of confidence I don't know that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{at the start of the}} series." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} against Nefertiti is that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{to conceal the}} presence {{of at least one}} male of royal lineage from the spies and envoy of Suppiluliuma. [...] Alternatively, if he knew of Tutankhaten or Smenkhkare, rather than merely shrewd, it must be assumed that Suppiluliuma was ruthless in the extreme and willing to risk the life of his son on a precarious endeavor where he suspected trickery. On the other hand, it portrays Nefertiti as fully informed of Hittite minutiae such as Suppiluliuma's affiliation with the Hittite sun god.|$|E
2500|$|Baret and Commerson {{joined the}} Bougainville {{expedition}} {{at the port}} of Rochefort in late December 1766. They were assigned to sail on the storeship, the Étoile. Because of the vast quantity of equipment Commerson was bringing on the voyage, the ship's captain, François Chesnard de la Giraudais, gave up his own large cabin on the ship to Commerson and his [...] "assistant". This gave Baret significantly more privacy than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> otherwise on board the crowded ship. In particular, the captain's cabin gave Baret access to private toilet facilities so that she did not have to use the shared head like other members of the crew.|$|E

2500|$|By early 1942, the German navy had {{recognized}} {{the value of}} aircraft carriers, particularly following the British attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto in 1940 {{and the loss of}} the German battleship [...] in 1941. The Navy therefore selected several vessels to be converted into auxiliary aircraft carriers in May 1942, including the passenger ship , operated by Norddeutscher Lloyd. As designed, the proposed conversion project would have been larger than even the purpose-built Graf Zeppelin class. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.
