40|$|The work {{reported}} herein aims at {{the development}} of a methodology for the assessment of the behavior of tankers when involved in a ship-ship collision. It may be applied for the comparison of the behavior of tankers with different tank arrangements and it further accounts for differences in the structural configuration and scantlings. The proposed methodology is based, on the one hand, on the results of an analysis of damage cases expressed in terms of oil outflow versus collision energy and, on the other hand, on the distribution function of collision energy. These relationships are combined to obtain the distribution function of the oil outflow. The use of the methodology to investigate the influence of a <b>stringer</b> <b>plate</b> in a double-hull tanker illustrates its applicability and potential...|$|E

It is assumed that the stringer is bonded to an isotropic plate through an adhesive, along a line perpendicular to the crack. Due to the high stress concentration around the crack tip and on the adhesive, partial debonding is assumed to develop between the <b>stringer</b> and the <b>plate.</b> The integral equation, obtained from the continuity of displacements along the line where the <b>stringer</b> and the <b>plate</b> are bonded, is solved numerically to give the shear stress distribution between the <b>plate</b> and the <b>stringer</b> and the stress intensity factors at both crack tips...|$|R

50|$|The theater sits on {{the site}} of an ancient (3rd century BC) Ionic temple portico, which was {{destroyed}} by Hannibal in 217 BC. The temple, measuring 22 by 35 m, lies behind the amphitheater. Today, the only structures remaining are the base (podium) and the eight columns that rose in front. The columns were topped with Corinthian order capitals., and had clad pottery decorated in the back with three segments paved with fine mosaics. Each of the mosaics were dedicated to different deities. The roof was built with trusses, <b>stringers,</b> <b>plates</b> and tiles, each weighing 52 kg, from Venafro. Cells and columns made up its foundations, so the mighty outer wall of the podium served as a simple decorative coating. Elaborate cornices decorated with floral motifs and ram's heads topped the altars. The segments are usually darker than the original, like the steps of the dark sunken staircase. On the left side, an inscription in Oscan recalls Statius Claro, an important figure who built at his expense half of the podium. On the back of the temple, in the containment wall of the ground (north side), a phallic symbol is carved on a block for protection against misfortune. At the sides of the podium, two porches with remains of buildings used as shops and various services complement the overall harmony.|$|R

60|$|They went at {{the work}} with a rush, and the little oblong marked out upon the prairie sod became alive with toiling figures. Tall birch posts rose as by magic, with {{struggling}} men thrusting with the long pike-poles beneath them; <b>stringers,</b> <b>plates</b> and ties seemed to fly into place; and Alison, sitting on the grass with Mrs. Farquhar, wondered as the skeleton of the house grew moment by moment before her eyes. She had never thought it possible that a dwelling could be built in a night; but the men were clearly on their mettle, and they worked with an almost bewildering activity. They {{were on the ground}} one minute, hauling ponderous masses of timber, and the next climbing among the framing; were standing with one foot on a slender beam, or crawling along another on hands and knees. There was a constant thudding of ax-heads on wooden pegs, a sharper ringing of hammers on heavy nails; curt orders broke through the clatter of boards and the persistent crunch of saws. Still, {{there seemed to be no}} confusion. Each man knew exactly what to do, for, though houses are by no means invariably raised in this fashion on the prairie, some of the men had learned their work in the bush of Michigan, and some in Ontario. When the hammers clattered more furiously and the skeleton became partly clothed, there were cries of encouragement from the women.|$|R

40|$|In {{the limits}} of brittle failure of materials, we {{investigate}} the problem of possible cracking of an infinite stringer on the boundary of an elastic half-infinite plate. The plate is exposed to tensioning by uniformly distributed forces, and also to contact stresses due to application of forces on the stringer. The accurate solution of a contact problem of interaction of an infinitely continuous stringer is constructed. With the help of this solution, we formulate the condition of cracking of a stringer and the necessary restrictions for external loading, which provide the contacts of a broken <b>stringer</b> with a <b>plate</b> without propagation of a crack inside the stringer. The problem considered here is of interest for theory and practice. We firstly formulate the modified problem of E. Melan {{and with the help}} of Fourier integral transformation, we construct its acoustic solution and then formulate the condition of cracking of an infinite stringer. After that, reveal the necessary restrictions on external loadings, which provide the contact of the failed <b>stringer</b> with a <b>plate</b> without propagation of the crack inside the plate. </p...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} elastic buckling behaviour of a small-scale model of a stiffened plate. The model was made from epoxy resin to allow large buckle deflections within the elastic strain range. These tests {{are part of a}} programme aimed at proving the feasibility of using small-scale models to elucidate the behaviour of large stiffened plates such as are used in marine or civil engineering structures. It is shown for the geometry examined here that, although the component <b>stringer</b> and <b>plate</b> elements of the panel would individually exhibit stable post-buckling, together they interact to give unstable behaviour. The effects of imperfections are systematically studied and it is shown that the loadcarrying capacity of such a structural configuration is sensitive to initial geometric deformations. A simple mathematical analysis is developed which indicates the parameters governing the physical problem and which could form the basis for future rational studies of the level of imperfections at which sensitivity may be considered slight. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{finite element}} {{approaches to the}} strength assessment of a pallet having repeated lattice pattern. The pallet is made of recycled plastics similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Due {{to the nature of}} repeat, the direct full 3 D finite element model consumes tremendous computational resource for analysis and hence is far inefficient. A full 3 D model using brick elements is created as a benchmark for comparison. Three other models contain shell elements, beam elements and bricks, representing the <b>plate,</b> <b>stringers</b> and ribs of the pallet. A last model using substructure scheme with super-elements is created to conduct the structural analysis of the pallet. The results of this study discloses that the substructural method employing superelements gives the least percent error and is advantageous over either the benchmark model or the rest models proposed in the present study...|$|R

40|$|A finite size plate {{excited by}} {{airborne}} sound has both forced and freely propagating bending waves. The forced waves are {{generated by the}} airborne sound excitation and the freely propagating waves are generated when the forced waves are reflected at a discontinuity such as {{the edges of the}} <b>plate,</b> studs or <b>stringers.</b> Unless the <b>plate</b> is very heavily damped, the transverse vibration of the plate is dominated by the freely propagating waves. However below the critical frequency of the plate, the direct airborne sound transmission of the plate is dominated by the forced waves because their radiation efficiency is very much greater than that of the freely propagating waves. The prediction of airborne flanking sound transmission requires the prediction of the transmission of the bending waves at the junction of plates. This paper shows that this transmission is different for forced and freely propagating bending waves below the critical frequency of the plate from which the bending waves are incident upon the junction. It is shown that {{it is not possible to}} separately calculate the intensity of a forced incidence wave and its freely propagating reflected wave because the cross terms do not vanish when the incident wave is forced...|$|R
40|$|Bureau of Aeronautics Design Specifications SS-IC- 2 {{for water}} loads in {{sheltered}} water are compared with experimental water loads obtained during a full [...] scale landing investigation. This investigation {{was conducted with}} a JRS- 1 flying boat which has a 20 degrees dead-rise V-bottom with a partial chine flare. The range of landing conditions included airspeeds between 88 and 126 feet per second, sinking speeds between 1. 6 and 9. 1 feet per second, flight angles less than 6 degrees, and trims between 2 degrees and 12 degrees. Landings were moderate and were made in calm water. Measurements were obtained of maximum over-all loads, maximum pitching moments, and pressure distributions. Maximum experimental loads include over-all load factors of 2 g, moments of 128, 000 pound-feet, and maximum local pressures greater than 40 pounds per square inch. Experimental over-all loads are approximately one-half the design values, while local pressures are of the same order as or larger than pressures calculated from specifications for <b>plating,</b> <b>stringer,</b> floor, and frame design. The value of this comparison is limited, to some extent, by the moderate conditions of the test and by the necessary simplifying assumptions used in comparing the specifications with the experimental loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the article is the {{optimizing}} of the internal structure of the wing with the purpose to improve its stiffness characteristics at a constant weight of the structure. This task is put {{on the development of}} the methods to optimize the stress-strain state wing aircraft under the influence of arbitrary external and internal pressures. The paper proposes rigidity interpreted as a variable that depends on the configuration of power elements, varying the location of which can be achieved by maximizing stiffness. We defined the mathematical function of mass and stiffness depending on the internal configuration of power elements (<b>plating,</b> <b>stringers,</b> longerons). The wing has the power elements, the placement of which may be various: power paneling, two longerons and stringers, four on the bottom and top panels. As a result, on the basis of the spatial theory of elasticity were obtained equations describing the bending, torsional and longitudinal vibrations of the wings, and the proposed mathematical model of the optimal hardness wing by varying the functional dependence for placing power elements and varying the parameters of this function. The results made it possible to optimize the internal structure in terms of minimum deformation at constant values of the mass of the investigated structures such as wings to reduce bending, twist angles and tensile strength elements. ???????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????, ??????? ????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ????????. ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ????????, ??????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????? ?????????, ???????? ??????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????. ???????? ???????? ???????, ??????? ???? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????. ?????????? ?????? ????? ???? ? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????????...|$|R
5000|$|The A-3 Aerosledge has a hull {{built of}} riveted metal alloy {{construction}} using 2mm D-16T plates and profiles. The craft's ribs, <b>stringers</b> and <b>plates</b> are also of D-16 Duraluminium. Traverse bulkheads divide the craft into three watertight compartments. The craft will remain afloat with one flooded compartment. Double plating is employed for the hull bottom to strengthen it for crossing ice and snow. Low friction 3.5 mm polyethylene {{is attached to}} the bottom plates, which is removable for repair. Three stainless-steel runners are mounted to the hull base to provide the craft with the ability to maintain an even course, and prevent sideslipping on ice. The smooth lines of the hull's underside allow it to traverse bodies of water choked with weeds without difficulty. [...] Even with a maximum payload, the Aerosledge has a draft of no more than 2 inches. [...] The cabin is fully enclosed with a seating capacity of five in passenger configuration. In standard mail-carrying configuration, the cabin has one swiveling seat for the driver/mail carrier, and a cargo capacity of 1,433 lbs over ice, and 661 lbs over water. [...] Cabin access is by two gull-wing doors. There is an additional baggage storage compartment in front of the cabin, located beneath a hermetically-sealed hatch. The craft is controlled by a single wheel connected to twin rudders located behind the propeller. If the wheel is pulled towards the driver both rudders fold outward, forming a brake. If turned and pulled toward the driver, only one rudder folds outward, giving greater turning control over water overgrown with reeds or weeds. Three stainless steel runners mounted along the bottom of the hull provide additional stability while traveling over ice or snow. [...] When traversing snow, the slightly upturned bow of the A-3, together with the differences in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces of the hull, generate an aerodynamic lifting force. At speeds above 50 mph aerodynamic lift reduces the pressure exerted by the craft against the surface by one third. As the depth of the furrow decreases, friction resistance is reduced accordingly. On water the large area of the lower hull, with its small keel, makes it an ideal shallow-draft watercraft.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a numerical investigation of the stresses near an abrupt change in thickness of a composite plate. The plate is a laminate of unidirectional, continuous fiber plies. The study is aimed at gaining insight into the failure behavior of co-cured <b>stringer</b> reinforced composite <b>plates</b> and shells. The analysis is performed in a plane normal to the stringer axis. The problem formulation is similar to plane strain. Because orthotropic materials are involved, a solution method allowing three-dimensional displacements as functions of two spatial variables is applied. The method is called plane-coupled strain. Failure is assumed to initiate at the sharp 90 ° reentrant corner of the step-down geometry due to a rise in stresses. The resulting stress singularity is characterized for different combinations of stacking orders in the stepped plate. Stresses in the structure are determined by means of the finite element method. The results are presented in two parts: The first describes the differences obtained with plane-coupled strain and classical plane strain; the second characterizing the stress singularity. The more computer intensive plane-coupled strain solution produces significantly different results for the stresses near the singularity. The character of the stress singularity is found to be highly dependent on the fiber direction of the material at the sharp corner. The results for the stress singularity are used in an example failure criterion. Stacking sequences are examined with respect to their susceptibility to failure under different combinations of in-plane loading...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{structures}} are thin structures reinforced using additional components, which are joined using different technologies, milling, riveting or welding. The technological process used to realize a reinforced structure {{makes it possible}} to have structural continuity between elements on which it is realized, such as the <b>plate,</b> <b>stringers,</b> and ribs. In fact, when a reinforced structure is realized using a milling machine, the stringer derives from the same work-piece and inevitably the continuity between <b>plate</b> and <b>stringers</b> is guaranteed. When the classical joints, like welding and rivets, are used the congruence of the displacements is verified only in a portion of the interface; moreover, the joints may have a lower strength of the original material. For these reasons the mathematical model used is crucial because otherwise the results are not representative of the component analyzed. Accurate analyses of reinforced structures require the use of 3 D (Solid) FEM (Finite Element Method) models. A large number of degrees of freedoms (DOFs) is needed, and the computational costs could become prohibitive when solid models are used. 2 D (Shell) and 1 D (beam) models are used instead of 3 D models to reduce the CPU in FEM analysis. These simplified mathematical models introduce assumptions, based on geometrical and kinematic approximations, which reduce the DOFs but could largely increase the error. For these reasons contribution direct to introduce efficient and robust reduced models are welcome. Among these, those referenced as "Component-Wise" approaches which are based on FEs based on Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) have been recently proved to be a reliable framework for further developments which are the object of the present research proposal. Various analysis of simple components, such as plate and curved reinforced panels, are considered to analyze the effect of the stringers in the FE models compared to the 1 D-CUF models. The stringer changes the solution locally, in term of stress and displacement field and also regarding the local vibration because indeed the local strength increases. The shape of the stringer is an additional parameter to consider when reinforce {{structures are}} modeled using the refined models (beam and shell/plate) in the FE modeling. The one-dimensional CUF formulation is also used to analyze the effect of the reinforced configurations in the case of complex structures In fact, in the case of reinforced cylindrical components or launchers, the reinforced layout must be modeled considering the local and the global effects. Composite materials, non-structural masses, and load-factor are included in the analysis, performing the implications for the dynamic analysis due to the different approaches used in the modeling. Various FE models are used to carry out the results of the FE modeling. In particular, in the 3 D FE models, both <b>plate</b> and <b>stringer</b> are modeled using the same solid elements. In the 2 D FE models, shell elements are utilized for the plate and also for the stringers. In contrast, the 2 D- 1 D FE models are characterized by the coupling between shell and beam elements, in particular, the shell elements are used for the plate while the beam elements for the stringers. The 3 D, 2 D, and 2 D- 1 D models are analyzed using the commercial NASTRAN code, where the 3 D solution is used as the reference solution. The results show the need for the reduced FE models to adopt appropriate valuations and accurate analysis when reinforced structures are modeled, because the stringer and its shape can influence the static and dynamic analyses. In addition, the results show the capabilities of the present approach to deal with the analysis of conventional complex space structure. The results indicate that the current models can give accurate results with a high reduction in the computational cost with respect traditional approaches...|$|R
