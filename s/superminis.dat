5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular <b>superminis</b> such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the first}} <b>superminis</b> were the Fiat 500 of 1957 and the Austin Mini of 1959. <b>Superminis</b> can be premium cars, {{such as the}} Citroën DS3, named 2010 Car of the Year by Top Gear Magazine. <b>Superminis</b> {{are some of the}} best selling {{vehicles}} in Europe with 25% of the market shares (2013). In 2007, the Peugeot 207 has been the most sold car in Europe, whereas the best seller is almost systematically a car from the compact segment.|$|E

5000|$|The mini-MPV {{combines}} a tall, high-roof five-door one- or two-box hatchback body configuration with a <b>supermini's</b> platform, engines and mechanicals [...] - [...] {{in order to}} provide the interior volume, packaging and comfort of a larger C-segment vehicle within a B-segment footprint. The configuration offers higher h-point seating, easy passenger and cargo access with wide-opening rear doors and large rear hatch, and a re-configurable interior volume with seats that recline, slide, tumble, fold flat or allow easy removal [...] - [...] allowing users to reprioritize passenger and cargo volumes.|$|R
5000|$|By any measure, Fiat's Uno Mille, a 1000cc car, {{was more}} {{powerful}} and spacious than Gurgel BR-800. The price of both models was then similar. BR-800's sales dropped to almost nothing in 1990. In 1992, Gurgel launched a car based on Gurgel BR-800, the Gurgel Supermini. Like its similar model, the <b>Supermini's</b> sales were very low. Fernando Collor refused {{to grant a loan}} (without guarantees) of about US$80,000,000 from BNDES to Gurgel. Even so, Gurgel got two loans; both of them from state's governments. One from BEC (then bank of Brazilian state of Ceará) and other loan from Banespa - then bank of Brazilian state of São Paulo. Again, both loans didn't have any guarantee. Even with these generous loans, the Gurgel's sales remained very small. In fact they fell unstoptable between 1990 and 1993. Just about 1,500 Supermini Gurgel's cars were produced, in 1992 and 1993.(1) ...|$|R
25|$|A hot hatch is a {{high-performance}} hatchback, based on standard <b>superminis</b> or {{small family cars}} with improved performance, handling and styling. Hot hatches are very popular in Europe, where hatchbacks {{are by far the}} most common body style for this size of car. In North America, sport compacts are usually sold as saloons or coupés rather than hatchbacks.|$|E
25|$|An {{undetermined}} {{number of}} Forsa <b>superminis</b> were imported to Hawaii and Puerto Rico {{and some of}} them have found their way to the U.S. mainland. The EPA lists the 1985 Forsa model as the Suzuki SA310 (the original JDM name for the Cultus, Forsa and Swift), no listing for 1986, and both the Forsa and Forsa Turbo for 1987 and 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Polo {{competed in}} the {{supermini}} sector with its new rivals like Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta {{and it was one}} of the largest <b>superminis</b> in production at this time, meaning that it was close to larger cars including the Ford Escort in terms of size, space and price. Within two years of its launch, however, it was faced with competition from a wave of new rivals, particularly the Fiat Uno and Peugeot 205.|$|E
25|$|As sales progressed, Honda created {{two more}} sales channels, called Honda Clio in 1984, and Honda Primo in 1985. The Honda Clio chain sold {{products}} that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and Honda Primo sold the Honda Civic, kei cars, {{such as the}} Honda Today, <b>superminis</b> like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawn mowers, portable generators, marine equipment, plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when Honda Primo and Clio began operations, in that all Verno products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while Primo and Clio products had the rear license plate installed on the trunk lid or rear door for minivans.|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s several highway-capable plug-in {{electric}} cars were produced in limited quantities, all were battery electric vehicles. PSA Peugeot Citroën launched several electric [...] "Électrique" [...] versions of its models starting in 1991, notably the Citroën C15, C25 and Berlingo and Peugeot J5 and Partner panel vans and the Citroën AX and Saxo and Peugeot 106 <b>superminis.</b> The Saxo was the best-selling and most produced ever electric {{car at the}} time. Other models were available through leasing mainly in California. Popular models included the General Motors EV1 and the Toyota RAV4 EV. Some of the latter were sold {{to the public and}} are in use still today. In the late 2000s began a new wave of mass production plug-in {{electric cars}}, motorcycles and light trucks. However, , most electric vehicles in the world roads were low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) or electric quadricycles. Pike Research estimated there were almost 479,000 NEVs on the world roads in 2011. Just in China, a total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in 2013, most of which are powered by lead-acid batteries. An additional 600,000 low-speed small electric passenger vehicles were sold in China in 2015, and more than 700,000 during the first ten months of 2016. , the GEM neighborhood electric vehicle is the market leader in North America, with global sales of more than 50,000 units since 1998.|$|E
2500|$|This {{class is}} known as {{supermini}} in the UK, subcompact in North America. [...] <b>Superminis</b> have three, four or five doors, and even as an estate shape. They are designed to seat four passengers comfortably. Current supermini hatchbacks are approximately 3900nbsp&mm long, while saloons and estate cars are around 4200nbsp&mm long. Currently (2013) sedan variants are generally not available in Europe and are marketed {{at a lower price}} than hatchback models in North America.|$|E

50|$|In {{its best}} year, 1983, more than 130,000 Metros {{were sold in}} Britian; only the Ford Escort and Sierra outsold it. This was despite {{the arrival of a}} host of new <b>superminis</b> on the British market that year - the Ford Fiesta {{received}} a major facelift, and four all-new <b>superminis</b> (the Vauxhall Nova, Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra and Peugeot 205) went on sale in Britain between April and September.|$|E
50|$|As {{small family}} cars and <b>superminis</b> grew in the 1990s to the 2000s, so did city cars. After some new <b>superminis</b> grew to be over 3900 mm long (like the Ford Fiesta, Opel Corsa, the SEAT Ibiza and the Volkswagen Polo), some {{automakers}} developed city car models more than 3650 mm long. The first of these models was the Nissan Micra (2002), which is 3720 mm long and smaller than many <b>superminis</b> of the late 1990s. Other cars are the Citroën C2, Suzuki Swift, Smart Forfour, Tata Indica, and Peugeot 1007 (the last one which can also be labelled as a mini MPV). Fiat launched their new Fiat 500 in 2007, somewhat bigger than the first 500, but still only 3546 mm long.|$|E
50|$|The K12 {{was well}} {{received}} by the motor industry and set a new standard for the <b>superminis</b> that followed it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superminis</b> {{are usually}} {{available}} in hatchback body styles. The term subcompact car {{is used for}} similar cars in North America.|$|E
50|$|The Volkswagen Group A0 {{platform}} {{is a series}} of automobile platforms shared among <b>superminis</b> of various marques of the Volkswagen Group.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, even mass-market <b>superminis</b> {{such as the}} Ford Fiesta Mk.6 and VW Polo Mk.5 {{come with}} ESC as standard.|$|E
50|$|MQB models may {{range from}} <b>superminis</b> to large family cars, {{replacing}} the current generations of models. The MQB architecture replaces the PQ25, PQ35 and PQ46 platforms.|$|E
50|$|The term is used {{along with}} other terms for small cars {{including}} subcompact in North America. The Euro NCAP calls all small cars <b>superminis.</b> The European Commission refers to A-segment (Utility/city class: entry level small passenger car).|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} {{production}} of the second generation Ibiza/Córdoba ceased during 2002, the range had established itself {{as one of the}} most popular <b>superminis</b> in Europe of the past decade, having sold 1,522,607 cars from 1993 to 2002.|$|E
50|$|Smaller or {{more basic}} cars were grouped under a Bargain Basement heading and {{included}} the Mini, Citroën 2CV, Fiat 126 and Volkswagen Beetle - these {{accounted for a}} much smaller {{share of the market}} than the modern <b>superminis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>superminis</b> {{that have}} not been widely on sale in Europe include Ford Figo (based on Ford Fiesta), Suzuki Ritz, Honda Brio, Honda Logo, Perodua Myvi, Proton Satria, Tata Indica , Toyota Etios and Proton Iriz , Maruti Suzuki Swift [...]|$|E
50|$|The Mk2 Fiesta, facing {{competition}} from the Vauxhall Nova and Austin Metro, {{was one of the}} UK's top <b>superminis.</b> In its best-ever year, 1987, over 150,000 Fiesta models were sold in the UK, though it finished second in the sales charts to the Ford Escort.|$|E
50|$|The Revolte {{is based}} on the {{historical}} Citroën 2CV. The concept car shows the changes that have been happening in terms of the role <b>superminis</b> and that style and elegance have become as important as economy and practicality. The Citroën Revolte is related to the Citroën Survolt.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} freshened in 1990 with new bumpers, headlights, grille and interior, {{but it was}} clearly {{recognisable}} as a makeover of an early 1980s design, when it had {{to compete with the}} latest two all new <b>superminis</b> in Europe - the Ford Fiesta and Renault Clio.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 British Leyland began {{considering}} {{a replacement for}} the then 13-year-old Mini. With the cancellation of the 9X under BMC the small car market had been left to the growing band of <b>superminis</b> which, as the 9X had done, took the Mini concept and improved on it.|$|E
50|$|This {{suspension}} {{is commonly}} used {{on a wide variety}} of front wheel drive cars (mainly compacts and subcompacts), and was almost ubiquitous on European <b>superminis.</b> It was popularised by Volkswagen when they changed from rear engined RR layout cars in the 1970s, to front wheel drive FF layout cars.|$|E
50|$|While early {{examples}} of the body configuration {{can be traced to}} the 1930s, the Merriam-Webster dictionary dates the term itself to 1970. The hatchback body style has been marketed worldwide on cars ranging in size from <b>superminis</b> to small family cars, as well as executive cars and sports cars.|$|E
50|$|The main {{improvement}} {{was from the}} realisation that the Mini's incredibly small size was not entirely necessary. <b>Superminis</b> were still {{much smaller than the}} usual small family car but were slightly larger than the Mini, which led to significantly more useful interior space without the need for the compromises in seating position, drivetrain refinement and low equipment levels that the Mini used to create its spacious but small interior. The Italian engineer Dante Giacosa had long been Issigonis' main rival when it came to mastery of small car design and his transverse (but no gearbox-in-sump) engine layout and the addition of a hatchback (both ideas that Issigonis had himself seen as a way of improving the Mini on the 9X) provided the template for the new generation of <b>superminis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Playable {{vehicles}} are the original 1996 GTI Club's four licensed European <b>superminis</b> from the '80s, namely the Morris Mini Cooper 1275S (Mk1), Renault 5 Alpine Turbo (A5/R122B), Volkswagen Golf GTi (Mk1), Autobianchi A112 Abarth plus the Lancia Delta HF 4WD. All {{of which are}} taken from the Supermini Festa! version.|$|E
5000|$|The car was 200 mm {{longer than}} its {{predecessor}} [...] - [...] similar to <b>superminis</b> and mini MPVs such as the Citroën C3 Picasso, Toyota Yaris, Honda Jazz and Nissan Micra. It was slightly larger in size than the previous generation, and was classified as a mini MPV. Sales began in April 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, Perodua mainly {{produces}} minicars and <b>superminis</b> {{and does}} not have models in the same market segments as Proton. In recent years, their targeted market segments have started to overlap. Especially in the supercompact segment where the Perodua Myvi has fought off the Proton Savvy and is now competing with the Proton Iriz ...|$|E
