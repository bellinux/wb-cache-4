5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state {{government}} shutdown {{was the first}} shutdown {{in the history of}} the U.S. <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline.

Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur {{originally}} {{described the}} bluntnose stingray from specimens collected in Little Egg Harbor off the U.S. <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> He published his account in an 1817 {{volume of the}} Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and named the new species Raja say in honor of Thomas Say, {{one of the founding}} members of the Academy. The species was moved to the genus Dasyatis by subsequent authors. In 1841, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, which thereafter became the typical spelling used in literature. Recently, there has been a push to use the correct original spelling again, though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) officially emend the spelling to sayi, for consistency with previous usage.|$|E
