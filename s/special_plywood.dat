40|$|Plywood is a wood-based panel {{material}} laminated of veneers {{where the}} grain di-rection is perpendicular in adjacent layers. The use of plywood {{can be extended}} {{if there is a}} possibility to use special lay-up schemes designed to improve mechanical properties which depend on the grain direction in the outer plies. This report con-tains results of research whose purpose was to determinate bending strength and modulus of elasticity of birch plywood types with special veneer lay-up schemes and of different width, bending flatwise and edgewise. Two <b>special</b> <b>plywood</b> types, 28 mm thick Spec 1 and 30 mm thick Spec 3, with different veneer lay-up schemes were selected for bending properties determination tests according to standard EN 789. Specimens were tested when the face veneer direction was parallel and then perpendicular to the specimens â€™ longer axis. Moisture content and density were determined as well. This report contains the comparison of bending strength pro-perties of <b>special</b> <b>plywood</b> specimen with different width and load direction. It was found that bending strength was significantly higher for narrower <b>special</b> <b>plywood</b> specimens, and bending strength of <b>special</b> <b>plywood</b> loaded edgewise was 4 % lo-wer for Spec 1 and 9. 5 % lower for Spec 3 than for flatwise loaded specimen of the same cross-sectional dimensions...|$|E
50|$|Several {{methods can}} be used to shore up a trench. Hydraulic shoring is the use of {{hydraulic}} pistons that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or a <b>special</b> heavy <b>plywood</b> called Finform. Another method is called beam and plate, in which steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations.|$|R
50|$|Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation was {{involved}} {{with the development of}} a plastic veneer plywood called Plymold. It was known also as duramold plywood by the Fairchild Engine and Aircraft Corporation. These veneer wood pieces were infused with phenolic resin synthetics for extra strength. They could be shaped into three dimensions which was advantageous for airplane and ship parts. Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation added 21000 ft2 m2 of floor space to their existing building in Grand Rapids in 1942. The main purpose for this was the need for <b>special</b> shaped <b>plywood</b> pieces for WWII military airplane body parts and ship interior parts. The plymold material was also used in railway cars, buses, automobiles, and boats.|$|R
