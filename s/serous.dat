5|$|<b>Serous</b> {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. <b>Serous</b> endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial <b>serous</b> carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. <b>Serous</b> carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} seen in <b>serous</b> carcinoma are chromosomal instability and mutations in TP53, an important tumor suppressor gene.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1946 a Railway Air Services Dakota 3 {{airliner}} taking-off from Northolt {{crashed into}} a house in Angus Drive, Ruislip, fortunately with no <b>serous</b> injuries to anyone, either in the aircraft or on the ground.|$|E
5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and <b>serous</b> carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of <b>serous</b> endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{surrounded}} by a <b>serous</b> membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Higher-staged cancers {{are more}} likely to recur, as are those that have invaded the myometrium or cervix, or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system. Papillary <b>serous</b> {{carcinoma}}, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma are the subtypes at the highest risk of recurrence. High-grade histological subtypes are also at elevated risk for recurrence.|$|E
5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with <b>serous</b> exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor suppressor gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with <b>serous</b> carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. <b>Serous</b> carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary <b>serous</b> carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, <b>serous,</b> and clear-cell). Some tumours {{are difficult to}} classify and have features overlapping more than one category. High grade endometroid tumours in particular tend to have both type I and type II features.|$|E
5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like <b>serous</b> {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a <b>serous</b> fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{tumor marker}} CA-125 is {{frequently}} elevated in endometrial cancer {{and can be}} used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in <b>serous</b> cell cancer or advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.|$|E
5|$|Type II endometrial carcinomas usually {{occur in}} older, post-menopausal people, in the United States {{are more common}} in black women, and are not {{associated}} with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type II endometrial cancers are often high-grade, with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), are of the <b>serous</b> or clear cell type, and carry a poorer prognosis. They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with {{a greater risk of}} relapse and/or metastasis.|$|E
5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a <b>serous</b> carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating <b>serous</b> fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} {{epithelial}} ovarian carcinoma, about two-thirds, have a <b>serous</b> carcinoma, though this proportion is estimated {{as high as}} 80%. Low-grade <b>serous</b> carcinoma is less aggressive than high-grade <b>serous</b> carcinomas, though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. <b>Serous</b> carcinomas are thought to begin in the Fallopian tube. Histologically, <b>serous</b> adenocarcinomas have psammoma bodies. Low-grade <b>serous</b> adenocarcinomas resemble Fallopian tube epithelium, whereas high-grade <b>serous</b> adenocarcinomas show anaplasia and nuclear atypia.|$|E
25|$|A <b>serous</b> {{membrane}} (also {{referred to}} as a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The <b>serous</b> membranes have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled <b>serous</b> space, or cavity. For example, the pericardium is the <b>serous</b> cavity which surrounds the heart.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serous</b> carcinomas {{may develop}} from <b>serous</b> tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, rather than {{developing}} spontaneously from ovarian tissue. Other carcinomas develop from cortical inclusion cysts, which are groups of epithelial ovarian cells inside the stroma.|$|E
25|$|EIN {{should not}} be {{confused}} with an unrelated entity, <b>serous</b> intraepithelial carcinoma ("serous EIC"), which is an early stage of a different tumor type known as papillary <b>serous</b> adenocarcinoma that also occurs in the same location within the uterus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>serous</b> humour is {{described}} as a sweet fluid that is cold and moist in relation to blood and bilious humours. <b>Serous</b> humour resembles blood and is necessary for body tissues for two reasons: to provide the tissue with nutrients as an auxiliary and to keep the bones and tissues moist.|$|E
25|$|In 50% of {{high-grade}} <b>serous</b> cancers, {{homologous recombination}} DNA repair is dysfunctional, {{as are the}} notch and FOXM1 signaling pathways. They also almost always have p53 mutations. Other than this, mutations in high-grade <b>serous</b> carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of genomic instability. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for homologous recombination DNA repair, and germline mutations in these genes are found in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer. The most common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the frameshift mutations that originated in a small founding population of Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E
25|$|Central <b>Serous</b> Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) {{which can}} produce {{micropsia}} predominantly affects persons {{between the ages}} of 20 and 50. Women appear to be affected more than men by a factor of almost 3 to 1.|$|E
25|$|CSCR is {{a disease}} in which a <b>serous</b> {{detachment}} of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The most common symptoms that result from the disease are a deterioration of visual acuity and micropsia.|$|E
25|$|Increased H19 {{expression}} {{is found in}} the following cancers: adrenocortical neoplasms, choriocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, bladder cancers, ovarian <b>serous</b> epithelial cancers, head and neck carcinomas, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, acute T cell leukemia/lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, testicular germ cell cancer, esophageal cancer and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancers are {{histological}}ly and genetically {{divided into}} type I or type II. Type I cancers are of low histological grade, and include endometrioid, mucinous, and clear-cell carcinomas. Type II cancers are of higher histological grade and include <b>serous</b> carcinoma and carcinosarcoma.|$|E
25|$|Chylothorax (fluid from lymph vessels leaking {{into the}} pleural cavity) may be {{identified}} by determining triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which are relatively high in lymph. A triglyceride level over 110nbsp&mg/dl {{and the presence of}} chylomicrons indicate a chylous effusion. The appearance is generally milky but can be <b>serous.</b>|$|E
25|$|A hydrosalpinx is a {{distally}} blocked {{fallopian tube}} filled with <b>serous</b> or clear fluid. The blocked tube may become substantially distended giving the tube a characteristic sausage-like or retort-like shape. The condition is often bilateral and the affected tubes may reach several centimeters in diameter. The blocked tubes cause infertility.|$|E
25|$|Abdominocentesis, or the {{extraction}} of fluid from the peritoneum, {{can be useful in}} assessing the state of the intestines. Normal peritoneal fluid is clear, straw-colored, and of <b>serous</b> consistency, with a total nucleated cell count of less than 5000 cells/microliter (24–60% which are neutrophils) and a total protein of 2.5 g/dL.|$|E
25|$|Mucinous adenocarcinomas make up 5–10% of {{epithelial}} ovarian cancers. Histologically, {{they are}} similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas, and are often actually metastases of appendiceal or colon cancers. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than <b>serous</b> tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.|$|E
25|$|Low {{malignant}} potential ovarian tumors, {{also called}} borderline tumors, have some benign and some malignant features. LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors. They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around {{the age of}} 40–49. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, changes in cell size or nucleus size, abnormal nuclei, cell stratification, and small projections on cells (papillary projections). <b>Serous</b> and/or mucinous characteristics {{can be seen on}} histological examination, and <b>serous</b> histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV. Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.|$|E
25|$|Undifferentiated cancers - {{those where}} the cell type cannot be {{determined}} - {{make up about}} 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis. When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of <b>serous</b> cells inside the tumor.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{epithelial}}-stromal tumour, {{also known}} as ovarian epithelial carcinoma, {{is the most common}} type of ovarian cancer, representing approximately 90% of ovarian cancers. It includes <b>serous</b> tumour, endometrioid tumor, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Less common tumors are malignant Brenner tumor and transitional cell carcinoma of the ovary. Epithelial ovarian cancers develop from the epithelium, a layer of cells that covers the ovary.|$|E
25|$|In cattle, the {{symptoms}} may include drooling, restlessness, uncoordination, urine retention, dysphagia, and sternal recumbency. Laterally recumbent animals are usually {{very close to}} death. In sheep, {{the symptoms}} may include drooling, a <b>serous</b> nasal discharge, stiffness, and incoordination. Abdominal respiration may be observed and the tail may switch on the side. As the disease progresses, the limbs may become paralyzed and death may occur.|$|E
25|$|Fulminant disease {{correlates}} {{with more than}} ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement and colonic dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic megacolon. If the <b>serous</b> membrane is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue. Unless treated, the fulminant disease will soon lead to death.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, five of 100 {{women with}} a first-degree {{relative}} with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members. Seven of 100 women with two or more relatives with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer. In general, 5–10% of ovarian cancer cases have a genetic cause. BRCA mutations are associated with high-grade <b>serous</b> nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer.|$|E
