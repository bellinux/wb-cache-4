Moreover in the first chapter, there will be constructed a business cycle model based chiefly on innovational doctrines "Financial Instability Hypothesis" by Hyman Minsky and Schumpeterian waves.

40|$|OTHER PEOPLE’S HOUSES ADDS TO A GROWING LITERATURE on {{the origins}} of the Financial Crisis of 2008. Jennifer Taub’s {{contribution}} provides one of the most comprehensive studies to date. She outlines the many causes of the crisis, dispels myths, and explains what has been done—or how little has been done—in the wake of the crisis, while keeping the perspectives of struggling homeowners front and center. Taub begins by showing how the 2008 crisis was a continuation of the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> <b>crisis</b> of the 1980 s and 1990 s that brought countless farmers and banks to ruin. In both crises, the “same players” operated, she argues, just under “new names” and in “new institutions with the same frailties. ” 2 She also reveals how the United States Congress, under pressure from the <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> industry, dismantled the New Deal regulatory framework, thus allowing <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> institutions to operate with much more risk.

Recently, the Korean government strengthens the tax on the property in order to stabilize the residential real estate market which has been in a boom since 2000. Considering that the banks in Korea have expanded their exposure to the residential real estate sector rapidly during the boom period, the tax change can be a potential threat to the banking business in Korea.
