40|$|A method, an {{embedded}} state metric storage, is {{used for}} MAP (Maximum A Posterior) -based decoder of turbo codes to reduce the memory requirement of state metric storage. For MAP decoder, this method comprises <b>selecting</b> any <b>state</b> metric from the updated state metrics for each recursion direction, forward and reverse, and dividing the state metrics by the <b>selected</b> <b>state</b> metric; the <b>selected</b> <b>state</b> metric value becomes a constant, namely, one.

We are particularly interested in this problem when evaluating such state machines on a particular robotics task is expensive. As a motivating example, we consider a problem where a simulated vacuuming robot must select a driving state machine well-suited for a particular (unknown) room layout. By borrowing concepts from collaborative filtering (recommender systems such as Netflix and Amazon. com), we present a multi-armed bandit formulation that incorporates recommendation techniques to efficiently <b>select</b> <b>state</b> machines for individual room layouts. We show that this formulation outperforms the individual approaches (recommendation, multi-armed bandits) {{as well as the}} baseline of selecting the ‘average best ’ state machine across all rooms.
