50|$|Black metal artists {{often appear}} {{dressed in black}} with combat boots, bullet <b>belts,</b> <b>spiked</b> {{wristbands}} and inverted crosses and pentagrams to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.

5000|$|The band's lyrics treat Satanism {{and other}} topics typical for black metal. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic claimed that [...] "While {{many of the}} Norwegian black metal bands of the early 1990s were taking {{themselves}} so seriously that heinous acts of murder, church burnings, and the like wound up stealing more headlines than their actual music, Sweden's Nifelheim were shrewdly still treating the genre's Satanic silliness with the appropriate tongue-in-cheek tone. On the surface, this was illustrated by their cartoonish album covers and traditional black metal 'uniform,' consisting of the necessary leather and <b>spikes,</b> bullet <b>belts,</b> pentagrams, and inverted crucifixes." [...] Nifelheim rejected this characterization and cited it {{as a reason for}} ceasing to give interviews anymore.|$|R

50|$|Pimple (George Pie) is {{the muscle}} of the 'Toads and prefers to fight instead of talk. Pimple {{is the largest}} 'Toad. He wears spiked black kneepads and spiked black arm braces. Early artwork {{depicted}} him wearing a <b>spiked</b> black <b>belt,</b> {{but he was never}} seen wearing this belt in any of the games and later artwork eliminated the belt. According to his profile in the arcade Battletoads, he stands at a height of 7'4". Pimple's skin has changed in appearance a few times {{over the course of the}} series. He began with a medium shade of green, just like the other two 'Toads, and appears that way on the original box art. In the first game itself his skin was a darker shade of green, matching Rash but not Zitz. His skin was later changed to a light tan before finally being presented with a brown color for his skin, which is now considered his official skin color. He appears with his current color in Battletoads & Double Dragon and the arcade Battletoads arcade game.|$|R
