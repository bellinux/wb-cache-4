40|$|Amaranth starch {{granules}} {{are very}} small, {{which makes them}} suitable {{for a range of}} specialty applications. This starch is difficult to extract by wet milling due to the strong association between the starch and protein, the high protein content of the seed, and the small granule size. At the time of this research, no commercial amaranth starch extraction methods existed. The recently developed Al-Hakkak process has been successfully used to extract amaranth starch on a laboratory-scale. The work reported here forms part of the Al-Hakkak process scale-up investigations being performed by AgResearch Ltd, for the Biopolymer Network Ltd. During the Al-Hakkak process, an aqueous stream (known as starch-milk) containing insoluble starch granules, soluble carbohydrates, soluble proteins, and lipids, is produced. On the laboratory-scale the starch is recovered from the starch-milk using a high-speed centrifuge. However, at pilot and industrial scales density-based processes, such as centrifuges, <b>settling</b> <b>tables,</b> or hydrocyclones, may not be practical due to the small size, and low mass, of the amaranth starch granules. The research reported here investigated microfiltration as an alternative to density-based processes for separating the amaranth starch-milk into (i) a starch-rich concentrate and (ii) an aqueous stream containing the soluble proteins and carbohydrates. A Millipore ProFlux M 12 Tangential Filtration System, fitted with a 1000 kDa regenerated cellulose membrane, was used as the experimental apparatus. It was shown that microfiltration has the potential to recover amaranth starch from the starch-milk produced during the pilot-scale Al-Hakkak process. The selected membrane retained all the starch granules, but also retained more protein than desired (protein retention was 67 % and the starch-rich concentrate had a dry-basis protein content of 12 %). Diafiltration was used to decrease the protein content of the starch-rich concentrate and after six washes the protein content had stabilised at 4 %, which was significantly higher than the 0. 1 % previously reported for the laboratory-scale Al-Hakkak process. Analysis of the feed liquor, and diafiltered concentrate, revealed the presence of some non-starch insoluble material. This material, which may have been protein-based, was present in the starch-milk produced using the pilot-scale method but not the laboratory-scale method, and its presence determined the final protein content of the diafiltered concentrate. During processing to reach steady-state conditions membrane flux declined from 60 to 15 L m- 2 h- 1 over the first 45 minutes. This decrease was predominantly caused by the soluble components of the feed stream, {{and to a lesser extent}} by the starch granules. During concentration, flux had a three stage relationship with volumetric concentration (VCF). During the first stage flux decreased almost linearly with increasing VCF, in the second stage flux increased with increasing VCF, and in the third stage flux was independent of VCF. The second stage (flux increase) is unusual, and could form the subject of a separate study. The optimal transmembrane pressure was approximately 100 – 150 kPa, above which flux increased non-linearly with pressure. However, the flux-pressure relationship was weak, suggesting that higher operating pressures may be sustainable. The membrane proved very difficult to clean. A multi-step cleaning cycle was developed which adequately cleaned the membrane between runs. Key cleaning steps were: a cold water rinse to remove loosely bound material, a protease wash to remove protein, a sodium hydroxide wash to “pre-treat” any remaining starch granules, an amylase wash to degrade the starch granules, and a final sodium hydroxide wash to remove residues from the previous step. Additional research is needed to determine why the starch-milk from the pilot-scale process contains insoluble non-starch material, and to improve the process to prevent its inclusion, or remove it. Microfiltration should then be re-evaluated as a potential starch recovery process. An alternative membrane material, and larger pore size, should be trialled with the aim of decreasing protein retention and improving cleanability...|$|E

Beau-fort (1991; p. 415) stressed that “a count of relative abundance using smear slides is accurate only for species of similar size unless a large number of view fields are examined. ” To avoid the size fractionation of calcareous nannofossils during the preparation of smear slides, the settling method developed by Beaufort (1991) and Ehrendorfer (1993) is used. Neogene zonation of Okada and Bukry (1980) was used for the biostratigraphy (Table 1). Biostratigraphy was based on analysis of 371 Neogene (Pliocene to Pleistocene) samples from Cores 1 H through 8 H. Samples were selected at 20 -cm sampling intervals. Cores 1 H through 8 H are composed of nannofossil ooze with fora-minifers (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1996). Only the presence or ab-sence of the biostratigraphic marker species are checked in the 371 samples. Relative abundances of calcareous nannoplankton species per section (1. 5 -m intervals) among the above mentioned 371 sam-ples are reported based on 500 countings from the <b>settled</b> slide (<b>Table</b> 2).

40|$|Abstract: The variant {{execution}} {{time of the}} update operation repair rules in a parallel and distributed environment is highly affected {{by the way the}} rules and <b>tables</b> <b>settled</b> in a database in according to whether they were partitioned or not. The wellknown partitioning methods in the database were succeeded to reduce the response time of update operations since they expeditiously execute the update operation affecting different sites of partitions. These methods are mortgaged by the determination of the type of partitioning during the design state of the system fixing all sites of the partitioned tables and distributed rules to different nodes. Although distribution and partitioning have these merits, it still face some restrictions since it may be time consuming for the distributed system to locate the proper rule and the partition of data, which fulfill the requirement of repair update operation. This paper proposes virtual rule partition method. This method has more advantages over the classical methods because it allows us to reduce the total cost or the total response time consumed by repair update operations using horizontal partitioned tables...|$|R

In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners SS Ile de France in 1927 and the SS Normandie in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a <b>table</b> <b>settling</b> and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.|$|R
60|$|So far then as taste {{belongs to}} the imagination, its {{principle}} is the same in all men; {{there is no difference}} in the manner of their being affected, nor in the causes of the affection; but in the degree there is a difference, which arises from two causes principally; either from a greater degree of natural sensibility, or from a closer and longer attention to the object. To illustrate this by the procedure of the senses, in which the same difference is found, let us suppose a very smooth marble table to be set before two men; they both perceive it to be smooth, and they are both pleased with it because of this quality. So far they agree. But suppose another, and after that another table, the latter still smoother than the former, to be set before them. It is now very probable that these men, who are so agreed upon what is smooth, and in the pleasure from thence, will disagree when they come to <b>settle</b> which <b>table</b> has the advantage in point of polish. Here is indeed the great difference between tastes, when men come to compare the excess or diminution of things which are judged by degree and not by measure. Nor is it easy, when such a difference arises, to settle the point, if the excess or diminution be not glaring. If we differ in opinion about two quantities, we can have recourse to a common measure, which may decide the question with the utmost exactness; and this, I take it, is what gives mathematical knowledge a greater certainty than any other. But in things whose excess is not judged by greater or smaller, as smoothness and roughness, hardness and softness, darkness and light, the shades of colors, all these are very easily distinguished when the difference is any way considerable, but not when it is minute, for want of some common measures, which perhaps may never come to be discovered. In these nice cases, supposing the acuteness of the sense equal, the greater attention and habit in such things will have the advantage. In the question about the tables, the marble-polisher will unquestionably determine the most accurately. But notwithstanding this want of a common measure for settling many disputes relative to the senses, and their representative the imagination, we find that the principles are the same in all, and that there is no disagreement until we come to examine into the pre-eminence or difference of things, which brings us within the province of the judgment.|$|R

The winged females, after their marriage flight, have a disagreeable habit of flying in at the open doors and windows at lunch time, <b>settling</b> upon the <b>table</b> like the Harpies in the Æneid, and then quietly shuffling off their wings one at a time, by holding them down against the table-cloth with one leg, and running away vigorously with the five others.

One doesn't so much mind their philosophical inquiries into the nature of the bread or even the meat; but when they come to drowning themselves by dozens, in the pursuit of knowledge, in the soup and sherry, one feels bound to protest energetically against the spirit of martyrdom by which they are too profoundly animated. That is one of the slight drawbacks of the realms of perpetual summer; in the poets you see only one side of the picture--the palms, the orchids, the humming-birds, the great trailing lianas: in practical life you see the reverse side--the thermometer at 98°, the tepid drinking-water, the prickly heat, the perpetual languor, the endless shoals of aggressive insects.

50|$|Bristol City {{struggled}} throughout 1956-57 {{hovering above}} the relegation places {{for much of}} the season before <b>settling</b> into mid <b>table</b> with a run of 8 league victories in 9 matches between mid February and mid April 1957. Atyeo started the season with five goals in the opening 4 matches playing mainly at inside right alongside Hinshelwood on the right wing. However, in mid November manager Pat Beasley sold both centre forward Jimmy Rogers and left winger Jack Boxley to Coventry City. This prompted the signing of Irish centre forward Dermot Curtis from Shelborne for £5,000 in December 1956. Atyeo moved between inside right and centre forward depending on whether Curtis was playing in the team. Further forward line changes took place at much the same time as Bobby Etheridge signed from Gloucester City and young Johnny Watkins teamed up to form a new left sided partnership for Bristol City. As a result, only Hinshelwood with 41 appearances and Atyeo with 37 appearances were regulars throughout the season. Atyeo was the leading scorer again with 23 goals and Curtis the only other to reach double figures with 13 goals in only 16 games. Atyeo scored a league hat-trick in a 5-1 win v Sheffield United in January. Atyeo also created Bristol City history on 16 March 1957 scoring after only nine seconds of the match v Bury which City went on to win 2-0 with Atyeo scoring both goals. This still remains as the fastest ever goal scored in a match by a Bristol City player. In the FA Cup Atyeo scored doubles in both the 3rd & 4th round ties v Rotherham United and Rhyl. Atyeo also scored the goal in a 1-2 defeat at Aston Villa in the 5th round before a crowd of 63,099.|$|R
