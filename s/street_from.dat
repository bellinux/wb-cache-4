5|$|Atlético had {{its first}} home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in {{downtown}} Belo Horizonte, across the <b>street</b> <b>from</b> América's first stadium. The club's main ground {{for most of}} its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed Estádio de Lourdes for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos {{was one of the first}} stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2. The following year, the stadium was visited by FIFA president Jules Rimet, who watched a night game for the first time. The stadium fell out of favour when the larger Independência was built in 1950, and remained largely unused by the first team; eventually it was sold by the club to the Belo Horizonte municipality in the 1960s. After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991. It was leased to a shopping mall in 1995, which was built in the following year where the stadium once was, across the <b>street</b> <b>from</b> Atlético's administrative headquarters.|$|E

Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E
