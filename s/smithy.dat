5|$|As in most Mario series games, {{the main}} protagonist is Mario, whose initial {{goal is to}} rescue Princess Peach (Toadstool) from Bowser. However, the story takes on an unusual and very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the <b>Smithy</b> Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the <b>Smithy</b> Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the <b>Smithy</b> Gang arrived.

5|$|A 16th-century water gate in {{the eastern}} wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to {{the shore of the}} loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a <b>smithy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pottery shards {{found at}} the {{important}} site of Jarlshof also indicate that there was Neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age. This includes a <b>smithy,</b> a cluster of wheelhouses and a later broch. The site has provided evidence of habitation during various phases right up until Viking times. Heel-shaped cairns, are a style of chambered cairn unique to Shetland, with a particularly large example on Vementry.|$|E
40|$|Human haptoglobin, the serum haemoglobin-binding protein, can be {{differentiated}} {{into three}} common phenotypes (Hp i-i, Hp 2 -I, and Hp 2 - 2) {{by means of}} starch gel electrophoresis at pH 8 - 6 (<b>Smithies,</b> 1955). These differences {{were thought to be}} determined by a pair of allelic genes Hp" and Hp 2 (<b>Smithies</b> and Walker, I 955, I 956). However, chemical reduction of purified hapto-globin followed by electrophoresis in starch gels, prepared in formic acid buffer containing 8 M urea, enabled Connell, Dixon, and <b>Smithies</b> (I 962) and <b>Smithies,</b> Connell, and Dixon (i 962 a) to classify individuals of phenotype i-i into three subphenotypes, HpiF-iF, HpiF-iS, and HpiS-iS.

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England. On {{the basis of an}} example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs, which served the same purpose as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's <b>Smithy.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills.

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as {{different kinds of}} pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, <b>smithy,</b> gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme did {{not grow}} around a church like many English villages, but instead grew from several hamlets {{that existed in}} the area. Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas, {{including}} <b>Smithy</b> Green, Lane End, Gill Bent, and Grove Lane. Some of the many farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built against the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a <b>smithy.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both large and small industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a <b>smithy,</b> milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's <b>Smithy.</b> It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's <b>smithy,</b> {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people {{in places such as}} Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area. In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the <b>Smithy</b> Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban. In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms. In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm. By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains at}} Jarlshof {{represent}} {{thousands of years}} of human occupation, and {{can be seen as a}} microcosm of Shetland history. Other than the Old House of Sumburgh (see below) the site remained largely hidden until a storm in the late 19th century washed away part of the shore, and revealed evidence of these ancient buildings. Formal archaeological excavation started in 1925 and Jarlshof was one of two broch sites which were the first to be excavated using modern scientific techniques between 1949–52. Although the deposits within the broch had been badly disturbed by earlier attempts, this work revealed a complex sequence of construction from different periods. Buildings on the site include the remains of a Bronze Age <b>smithy,</b> an Iron Age broch and roundhouses, a complex of Pictish wheelhouses, a Viking longhouse, and a mediaeval farmhouse. No further excavations have been undertaken since the early 1950s and no radiocarbon dating has been attempted.|$|E
