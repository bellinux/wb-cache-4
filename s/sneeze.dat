5|$|When {{people with}} active {{pulmonary}} TB cough, <b>sneeze,</b> speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 µm in diameter. A single <b>sneeze</b> can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each {{one of these}} droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to <b>sneeze</b> periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Little Sammy <b>Sneeze</b> was a {{comic strip}} by American {{cartoonist}} Winsor McCay. In each episode the titular Sammy sneezed himself into an awkward or disastrous predicament. The strip ran from July 24, 1904, until December 9, 1906, in the New York Herald, where McCay {{was on the}} staff. It was McCay's first successful comic strip; he followed it with Dream of the Rarebit Fiend later in 1904, and his best-known strip Little Nemo in Slumberland in 1905.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} a purported scent-marking behavior, <b>sneezing,</b> in the squirrel monkey. <b>Sneezing</b> occurred {{more often in}} males than in females, varied in frequency with the phase of the reproductive cycle in both males and females, and {{was positively correlated with}} male testosterone levels during the period when the most <b>sneezing</b> occurred. These results suggest androgen involvement in <b>sneezing</b> and are consistent with the notion that <b>sneezing</b> is a scent-marking behavior in this species...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz, {{inside his}} robot, traps Perry, {{offering}} him a deli platter thinking he has won; Perry, however, has him pour {{a large amount}} of pepper onto it, blowing it and causing the robot to <b>sneeze.</b> The two are sent flying and crashing through the record building, Perry using the PFT tape to latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing on top of a mattress placed on top of a parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or <b>sneeze.</b> People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), {{and the most}} recent is 13 Lakes (2004). Counting the 11multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) by year of completion, the years with the most films selected are 1928, 1939, and 1940, with 18films from each year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a <b>Sneeze</b> was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10years; this distinction is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, Fargo and 13 Lakes.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>sneezing</b> is a {{particularly}} common symptom, there are surprisingly few references to this subject in the medical literature. Many of these references are shrouded in superstition and unscientific theory. Preparation of this report was stimulated by an interesting example of severe uncontrollable non-allergic paroxysmal <b>sneezing</b> which was carefully investigated with regard to both physical and psychological factors. A further example of paroxysms of <b>sneezing</b> occurring in a patient with temporal lobe seizures is also discussed with particular reference to {{the control of the}} <b>sneezing</b> episodes in association with anticonvulsant medication and control of the epileptic attacks. In addition, the neurophysiological mechanisms of <b>sneezing</b> are reviewed and the specific neurological references to the subject are discussed in relation to physiological and clinical data. At times the symptom of <b>sneezing</b> would appear to reflect some unknown disorder which may have central and possibly cortical affiliations...|$|R
5000|$|An {{explanation}} for the piece given by Duchamp involves the coldness of the marble cubes, the [...] "heat-giving" [...] properties of the sugar cubes, the thermometer evaluating temperature, and the <b>sneezing</b> that can result from cold. In commenting on the title Duchamp {{pointed out that there}} is a [...] "dissociation gap" [...] between <b>sneezing</b> at will and <b>sneezing</b> against one's will.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sneezing</b> cannot {{occur during}} sleep due to REM atonia - a bodily state wherein motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain. Sufficient {{external}} stimulants, however, may cause {{a person to}} wake from their sleep {{for the purpose of}} <b>sneezing,</b> although any <b>sneezing</b> occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum.|$|R
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or <b>sneeze.</b> Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E
5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that winds through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each <b>sneeze,</b> who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper Marshmallow.|$|E
5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a <b>sneeze</b> came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Pinocchio and Jiminy {{find the}} workshop vacant. They soon {{get a letter}} from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out in search of Pinocchio, but was swallowed by a giant sperm whale named Monstro, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro <b>sneeze,</b> giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.|$|E

He frees Lili and restores Sasha and Milla's minds, allowing them to confront Oleander. The inmates subsequently burn down the asylum, allowing Oleander to transfer his brain to one of the tanks. Raz defeats him, but when he approaches the tank, it releases a cloud of sneezing powder, causing him to <b>sneeze</b> his brain out. Raz uses his telekinesis to place his brain inside the tank, merging it with Oleander's.|$|E

25|$|Since November 19, 2004, {{there have}} been over 2,800 {{incidents}} of lasers directed at aircraft within the United States. These concerns have led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and beam spread of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as flash blindness. If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant genetic trait, photic <b>sneeze,</b> that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light. Some observers believe that the danger is greatly exaggerated, at least for small hand-held lasers.|$|E
