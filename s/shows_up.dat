40|$|This paper {{establishes}} that partial suspension is {{an optimal}} arrangement in an aggregate-risk {{version of the}} Diamond-Dybvig (1983) model. The model is a variant of Wallace (1988) in which aggregate risk about the fraction of agents who "want to" consume early {{is limited to a}} small group who <b>show</b> <b>up</b> last to possibly withdraw early. Partial suspension means that when they do withdraw early, members of this group get less than those who <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> first to withdraw early. Limiting the aggregate risk to a group who <b>show</b> <b>up</b> last is a simplifying assumption because it makes it impossible to draw inferences about the aggregate state from the actions of those who <b>show</b> <b>up</b> first.

The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.|$|R
