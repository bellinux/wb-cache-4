As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
25|$|Monoclinic phosphorus, or violet phosphorus, is {{also known}} as Hittorf's {{metallic}} phosphorus.

25|$|In {{practice}} a detection system using this reaction works by subjecting the mine to thermal neutrons while {{searching for the}} characteristic gamma ray emitted from the excited state in nitrogen-15; these photons will only be observed when an object containing nitrogen is being subjected to the neutron irradiation.

500|$|Neon's {{scarcity}} precluded its prompt {{application for}} lighting {{along the lines}} of Moore tubes, which used nitrogen and which were commercialized in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company, Air Liquide, produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business. In December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a <b>sealed</b> <b>tube</b> of neon. Claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor domestic lighting, due to their intensity, but the market failed because homeowners objected to the color. In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye-catching advertising signs and was instantly more successful. Neon tubes were introduced to the U.S. in 1923 with two large neon signs bought by a Los Angeles Packard car dealership. The glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition. The intense color and vibrancy of neon equated with American society at the time, suggesting a [...] "century of progress" [...] and transforming cities into sensational new environments filled with radiating advertisements and [...] "electro-graphic architecture." ...|$|E

30|$|Fluorescence {{transduction}} signal mechanism, {{which is}} influenced by changes within the chemical environment of a fluorophore molecule, has enabled MB to function as ultrasensitive probes for real-time monitoring whilst generating high background signal-to-noise ratio. The fluorescence “switch ON” state of a MB can increase up to 200 -fold when hybridized with the target nucleic acid [2]. Hence, with respect to signal generation, MB holds the advantage over other oligonucleotide probes. This is corroborated by the imaging of single molecule DNA in living system [32]. MB possesses the functionality of being effective in situation where it is practically difficult or undesirable to separate the target-probe hybrid from an excess of unhybridized solution. This is essentially needed in the detection of mRNAs in living cells or in real-time PCR in <b>sealed</b> <b>tubes</b> [30]. We cannot overemphasize the degree of usefulness of MB in detection without {{the separation of the}} target-probe.
