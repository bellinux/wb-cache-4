Although research {{findings suggest that the}} integration of mental health services in primary care can increase access to services and reduce stigma for typically underserved populations, dropout occurs at high rates. The current study aims to: (1) identify correlates of attitudinal and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> in a primary care setting, and (2) test the ability of the Integrated Model of Seeking Help (IMoSH) to predict follow-up for behavioral health visits. In particular, it was hypothesized that attitudinal barriers would predict behavioral intentions to return to a recommended appointment. On the other hand, <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> would better predict dropout for patients who had greater intentions of returning to their behavioral health appointment. Participants (N = 100) were recruited from two primary care clinics. During their initial contact with behavioral health services, patients rated their perceptions of attitudinal and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> to treatment continuation, perceived need, and intention to return for a follow-up appointment. Electronic medical records indicated that 50 % of patients attended their recommended follow-up appointment. Correlational analyses did not identify any significant correlates of attitudinal barriers. However, Spanish language preference was related to the endorsement of more <b>structural</b> <b>barriers.</b> Findings from a path analysis testing the IMoSH’s ability to predict follow-up demonstrated that neither attitudinal <b>barriers</b> or <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> predicted behavioral intentions or follow-up, and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> did not moderate the relation between behavioral intentions and follow-up attendance. Post hoc analyses revealed that a model including perceived need was able to predict follow-up attendance.

40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} to describe the frequency with which structural- and individual-level barriers to adherence are experienced by people receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and to determine predictors of non-adherence. Three hundred adherent and 300 non-adherent patients from 6 clinics in Cape Town completed the LifeWindows Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills ART Adherence Questionnaire, the Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Symptoms Screener and the <b>Structural</b> <b>Barriers</b> to Clinic Attendance (SBCA) and Medication-taking (SBMT) scales. Overall, information-related barriers were reported most frequently followed by motivation and behaviour skill defects. <b>Structural</b> <b>barriers</b> were reported least frequently. Logistic regression analyses revealed that gender, behaviour skill deficit scores, SBCA scores and SBMT scores predicted non-adherence. Despite the experience of <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> being reported least frequently, <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> to medication-taking had the greatest impact on adherence (OR: 2. 32, 95 % CI: 1. 73 to 3. 12), followed by <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> to clinic attendance (OR: 2. 06, 95 % CI: 1. 58 to 2. 69) and behaviour skill deficits (OR: 1. 34, 95 % CI: 1. 05 to 1. 71). Our data indicate the need for policy directed at the creation of a health-enabling environment that would enhance the likelihood of adherence among antiretroviral therapy users.

40|$|Mental {{health is}} of utmost {{importance}} in military settings due to the demanding and often dangerous {{nature of the work}} involved. However, military personnel are disproportionately deterred from seeking mental health help when the need arises. Perceived stigma and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> to help seeking have been widely researched in military settings, however, results are often mixed. The current study examined the traditional stigma and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> help seeking model alongside an alternative model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to explain help seeking behaviour. A cross-sectional study design surveying 2633 enlisted New Zealand Defence Force Personnel was carried out. Within the two models, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, stigma, and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> were assessed as predictors of intentions to seek professional help for mental health problems. The Theory of Planned Behaviour model accounted for 26 % of total variance in help seeking intentions, while the traditional model only accounted for 7 %. Additionally, the Theory of Planned Behaviour model showed potential for its capacity to include stigma and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> as antecedents to its core predictors, with stigma being partially mediated by attitudes, and <b>structural</b> <b>barriers</b> being fully mediated by perceived behavioural control. Additional group level measures were also considered in relation to help seeking intentions which highlighted at risk groups. A common theme arose across these groups of less chances for both formal and informal learning opportunities about mental health help seeking in the defence force. Using these group level differences, recommendations for how the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be utilized to increase mental health learning experiences for the New Zealand Defence Force personnel are made.

50|$|The New England land system, {{while the}} primary {{influence}} on the great land ordinances of the 1780s, {{was not the only}} land system influence. The Southern land system, marked by individualism and personal initiative, also helped shape the ordinance. While the New England land system was premised on community-based development, the Southern land system was premised on individual frontiersman appropriating undeveloped land to call their own. The Southern pioneer claimed property and the local surveyor would demarcate it for him. The system did not protect people from competing claims or set up an orderly chain of title. The process was called ‘indiscriminate location”. This system encouraged individuals to amass large plantations instead of settling into dense communal development. This system was supported by the use of slave labor. Perhaps the committee’s resistance against indiscriminate location and support for limited and disciplined land settlement was an implicit attempt to create a <b>structural</b> <b>barrier</b> to developing a plantation economy that was dependent on slave labor.

40|$|AbstractStructural {{barriers}} to wave propagation in cardiac tissue {{are associated with}} a decreased threshold for repolarization alternans both experimentally and clinically. Using computer simulations, we investigated the effects of a <b>structural</b> <b>barrier</b> on the onset of spatially concordant and discordant alternans. We used two-dimensional tissue geometry with heterogeneity in selected potassium conductances to mimic known apex-base gradients. Although we found that the actual onset of alternans was similar with and without the <b>structural</b> <b>barrier,</b> the increase in alternans magnitude with faster pacing was steeper with the barrier—giving the appearance of an earlier alternans onset in its presence. This is consistent with both experimental <b>structural</b> <b>barrier</b> findings and the clinical observation of T-wave alternans occurring at slower pacing rates in patients with structural heart disease. In ionically homogeneous tissue, discordant alternans induced by the presence of the <b>structural</b> <b>barrier</b> arose at intermediate pacing rates due to a source-sink mismatch behind the barrier. In heterogeneous tissue, discordant alternans occurred during fast pacing due to a barrier-induced decoupling of tissue with different restitution properties. Our results demonstrate a causal relationship between the presence of a <b>structural</b> <b>barrier</b> and increased alternans magnitude and action potential duration dispersion, which may contribute to why patients with structural heart disease are at higher risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias...|$|E
