Great whites are <b>so</b> <b>sensitive</b> they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Zhou Enlai met {{secretly}} with President Nixon's security advisor, Henry Kissinger, who {{had flown}} to China {{to prepare for}} a meeting between Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong. During the course of these meetings, the United States agreed to allow the transfer of American money to China (presumably from relatives in the United States), to allow American-owned ships to conduct trade with China (under foreign flags), and to allow Chinese exports into the United States {{for the first time since}} the Korean War.

25|$|In late 1944, Soviet forces battled {{fiercely}} {{to capture}} Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, {{but could not}} take it, which became a topic <b>so</b> <b>sensitive</b> to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to speak of it. The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belarus and western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula–Oder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly guessed the Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of {{which resulted in the}} Red Army advancing from the Vistula River in Poland to the German Oder River in Eastern Germany.|$|E
25|$|The band's 1973 album Atem {{was named}} as Album of the Year by British DJ John Peel, and this {{attention}} helped Tangerine Dream to sign to the fledgling Virgin Records {{in the same}} year. Soon afterward they released the album Phaedra, an eerie soundscape that unexpectedly reached #15 in the United Kingdom album charts {{and became one of}} Virgin's first bona-fide hits. Phaedra {{was one of the first}} commercial albums to feature sequencers and came to define much more than just the band's own sound. The creation of the album's title track was something of an accident; the band was experimenting in the studio with a recently acquired Moog synthesizer, and the tape happened to be rolling at the time. They kept the results and later added flute, bass-guitar, and Mellotron performances. The cantankerous Moog, like many other early synthesizers, was <b>so</b> <b>sensitive</b> to changes in temperature that its oscillators would drift badly in tuning as the equipment warmed up, and this drift can easily be heard on the final recording. This album marked the beginning of the period known as the Virgin Years.|$|E

500|$|Antennae are {{the primary}} organs of {{olfaction}} (smell) in Lepidoptera. The antenna surface is covered {{with large numbers of}} olfactory scales, hairs or pits; as many as 1,370,000 are found on the antennae of a monarch. Antennae are extremely sensitive; the feathered antennae of male moths from the Saturniidae, Lasiocampidae and many other families are <b>so</b> <b>sensitive</b> that they can detect the pheromones of female moths from distances of up to [...] away. Lepidoptera antennae can be angled in many positions. They help the insect in locating the scent and can be considered to act as a kind of 'olfactory radar'. In moths, males frequently have antennae which are more feathery than those of the females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. Since females do not need to detect the males, they have simpler antennae. Antennae have also been found {{to play a role in}} the time-compensated sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.|$|E

Chris Jones, writing for BBC Music said [...] "everything great about the Who is contained herein." [...] In 2013, Billboard, reviewing the album for its 40th anniversary, said: [...] "Filled with performances packed with life and depth and personality, Quadrophenia is 90 minutes of the Who at its very best." [...] The album has sold 1 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2000 Q magazine placed Quadrophenia at #56 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.

500|$|The {{performances}} of several cast members {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior {{to the rest of}} the cast; [...] "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano." [...] Similarly, The New Yorker Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice Karina Longworth concluded: [...] "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself." [...] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a [...] "scruffy warmth and humor" [...] vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man <b>so</b> <b>sensitive</b> that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)" ...|$|E
500|$|Significant {{cases of}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{are easy to}} diagnose because of the characteristic signs of the condition. In some cases, the signs are subtle, making diagnosis more difficult. Medical imaging is used to diagnose the condition or confirm a diagnosis made using clinical signs. On a chest radiograph, subcutaneous emphysema {{may be seen as}} radiolucent striations in the pattern expected from the pectoralis major muscle group. Air in the subcutaneous tissues may interfere with radiography of the chest, potentially obscuring serious conditions such as pneumothorax. It can also reduce the effectiveness of chest ultrasound. [...] On the other hand, since subcutaneous emphysema may become apparent in chest X-rays before a pneumothorax does, its presence may be used to infer that of the latter injury. Subcutaneous emphysema can also be seen in CT scans, with the air pockets appearing as dark areas. CT scanning is <b>so</b> <b>sensitive</b> that it commonly makes it possible to find the exact spot from which air is entering the soft tissues. [...] In 1994, M.T. Macklin and C.C.
