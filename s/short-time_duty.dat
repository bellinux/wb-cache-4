Generally at all performances a part of the input energy will be dissipated as heat. The higher the operation power the higher the heat to dissipate. If the performance is too high, the device {{will not be able to}} dissipate the heat to its environment and its temperature will raise proportionally to the energy surplus. If the temperature raises too much the mechanical and chemical properties of the device will begin to change causing permanent deformations for plastical material or fractures for brittle materials. Being the energy the product of power and time, either the power (or any to it related physical value) as by normal operation/duty or the time as by <b>short-time</b> <b>duty</b> have to be limited. A common application is the high current measure (typically up to 10 or 20 A) with multimeters. The maximum time length of short time duty (typically 10 to 30 seconds) is indicated near the corresponding socket (usually the left one) as well as the time to be waited for, before each of such measures might be repeated (typically [...] "each 15 minutes"). Another common application is inflation with air compressors: those become very hot, if used for a too long time and have to be shut down after a certain time (for small compressors such that of the picture a typical time is 10 minutes).|$|E

The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze thermal state of the traction permanent magnet synchronous motor for mine electric battery locomotive when operating in continuous and <b>short-time</b> <b>duty</b> modes. These operating modes are selected for study, as they are typical for mine electric locomotives. Methodology. Thermal calculation was performed by means of FEM in three-dimensional formulation of problem using Jmag-Designer. Results. The modeling results of thermal state of the PMSM in continuous and <b>short-time</b> <b>duty</b> operation modes showed good agreement with experimental results. The results showed that the temperature of PM is higher than temperature of the stator winding in continuous operation mode. It was found that PM temperature might reach excessive values because of the high presence of eddy current losses in neodymium PM. Therefore, special attention in the design and testing of PMSM should be paid to the temperature of PM in various operation modes. Practical value. It was recommended to use high temperature permanent magnets in traction PMSM to avoid demagnetization of PM and performance degradation...|$|E

The PM-BLDCM is a <b>short-time</b> <b>duty</b> motor with high-power-density. Since thermal equilibrium is not reached for the PM-BLDCM, the temperature distribution is not uniform and there is a risk of local overheating. The winding is a main heat source and its insulation is thermally sensitive, so reducing the winding temperature rise {{is the key to the}} improvement of the reliability. In order to reduce the winding temperature rise, an electromagnetic-thermal integrated design optimization method is proposed. The method is based on electromagnetic analysis and thermal transient analysis. The requirements and constraints of electromagnetic and thermal design are considered in this method. The split ratio and the maximum flux density in stator lamination, which are highly relevant to the windings temperature rise, are optimized analytically. The analytical results are verified by finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments. The maximum error between the analytical and the FEA results is 4 %. The errors between the analytical and measured windings temperature rise are less than 8 %. It can be proved that the method can obtain the optimal design accurately to reduce the winding temperature rise...|$|E

The research benefit, especially for the company, there hoped that the research could be used by the management party to increase optimum work capital as an effort to increase financial performance of the company. From the analysis and discussion in previous chapter, there could be concluded that work capital of food & Beverage companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange could be said as not optimum, it happened since optimum work capital larger than real work capital owed by each groups’ companies. There were differences of optimum work capital from three group of food & beverage. After studying, analyzing, and concluding the research done, there some suggestions from the writer. There hoped that the company did optimization of work capital to do processing in each work capital elements owed. Real efforts could be done was doing cash-flow owed, so that the company would be able to fulfill their <b>short-time</b> <b>duty.</b> In the other side, the policy should not hold cashflow in exaggeration amount, since it would let some cashflow unusable and at last, created loss in the company. For the investors, there hoped in deciding stock for investment, there hoped the investor did assessment of the development in company financial which did transaction in stock exchange. Through the step, there hoped investor candidate didn’t make a false in deciding stock used in investment, especially related with work capital owed by the company...|$|E
