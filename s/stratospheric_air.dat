5000|$|Sudden stratospheric warming {{events are}} {{associated}} with weaker polar vortices. This warming of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> can reverse the circulation in the Arctic Polar Vortex from counter-clockwise to clockwise. These changes aloft force changes in the troposphere below. An example of {{an effect on the}} troposphere is the change in speed of the Atlantic Ocean circulation pattern. A soft spot just south of Greenland is where the initial step of downwelling occurs, nicknamed the [...] "Achilles Heel of the North Atlantic". Small amounts of heating or cooling traveling from the polar vortex can trigger or delay downwelling, altering the Gulf Stream Current of the Atlantic, and the speed of other ocean currents. Since all other oceans depend on the Atlantic Ocean's movement of heat energy, climates across the planet can be dramatically affected. The weakening or strengthening of the polar vortex can alter the sea circulation more than a mile beneath the waves. Strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles, intensify the polar vortex. La Niña-related climate anomalies significantly strengthen the polar vortex. [...] Intensification of the polar vortex produces changes in relative humidity as downward intrusions of dry, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> enter the vortex core. With a strengthening of the vortex comes a longwave cooling due to a decrease in water vapor concentration near the vortex. The decreased water content is a result of a lower tropopause within the vortex, which places dry <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> above moist tropospheric air. Instability is caused when the vortex tube, the line of concentrated vorticity, is displaced. When this occurs, the vortex rings become more unstable and prone to shifting by planetary waves.The planetary wave activity in both hemispheres varies year-to-year, producing a corresponding response in the strength and temperature of the polar vortex. The number of waves {{around the perimeter of the}} vortex are related to the core size; as the vortex core decreases, the number of waves increase.|$|E

Stratospherically influenced air masses were detected using a suite of long-lived halocarbons, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and HCFCs, as a tracer for <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air.</b> A large number of stratospherically influenced samples {{were found to have}} reduced levels of O 3 and elevated levels of CO (both relative to background <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air),</b> indicative of mixing with anthropogenically influenced air. Using n-butane and propane as further tracers of anthropogenically influenced air, we show that this type of mixing was present both at low altitudes and in the upper troposphere (UT). At low altitudes, this mixing resulted in O 3 enhancements consistent with those reported at surface sites during deep stratospheric intrusions, while in the UT, two case studies were performed to identify the process by which this mixing occurs. In the first case study, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> was found to be mixed with aged outflow from a convective storm, while in the second case study, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> was found to have mixed with outflow from an active storm occurring in the vicinity of a stratospheric intrusion.

Throughout the entire DC 3 study region, this mixing was found to be prevalent: 72 % of all samples that involve stratosphere-troposphere mixing show influence of polluted air.

We used idealized <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> tracers, along with observations, to determine the frequency and extent of SIs in Maryland during July 2011. On 4 of 14 flight days, SIs were detected in layers that the aircraft encountered above the PBL from the coincidence of enhanced ozone, moderate CO, and low moisture. Satellite observations of lower tropospheric humidity confirmed the occurrence of synoptic scale influence of SIs as do simulations with the GEOS- 5 Atmospheric General Circulation Model. The evolution of GEOS- 5 <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> tracers agree with the timing and location of observed stratospheric influence and indicate that more than 50 % of air in SI layers above the PBL had resided in the stratosphere within the previous 14 days.

The model indicates similar frequencies of stratospheric influence during all summers from 2009 - 2013.

This flight {{is part of}} the AMMA-SCOUT-O 3 measurement campaign, where CRISTA-NF was deployed on the high-flying research aircraft M 55 -Geophysica. The flight path was located over Italy and the Mediterranean Sea and crossed over the subtropical jet twice. Measurements of temperature, and the volume mixing ratios of water vapor (H 2 O), ozone (O 3), nitric acid (HNO 3) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) are available with a vertical resolution of up to 500 m between about 6 to 21 km altitude. CRISTA-NF observes these trace gases simultaneously and provides a quasi- 2 -D view of the transition region between the troposphere and the stratosphere. The observation of these different trace gases allows to determine tropospheric and <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> masses. As expected, higher abundances are found where the main source of the trace gases is located: in the stratosphere for O 3 and in the troposphere for H 2 O and PAN. Tracer-tracer correlations between O 3 and PAN are used to identify the mixed tropospheric and lowermost <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> at the subtropical jet and around the thermal tropopause north of the jet. An intrusion of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>air</b> into the troposphere associated with the subtropical jet is found in the CRISTA-NF observations.

Stratosphere-troposphere exchange differs significantly {{between the two}} life cycles. Specifically, transport from the stratosphere into the troposphere is significantly larger for LC 2 (typically by 50 %), due {{to the presence of}} large and deep cyclonic vortices that create a wider surf zone than for LC 1. In contrast, the transport of tropospheric air into the stratosphere is nearly identical between the two life cycles.

We observe high OCS mixing ratios (> 400 pptv) within the tropical stratosphere owing to convected tropospheric <b>air.</b> <b>Stratospheric</b> mixing ratios decrease more rapidly with altitude {{moving away from the}} Equator, creating a poleward gradient. Elevated OCS concentrations observed at low southern latitudes are consistent with a significant pyrogenic source. Using coincident ACE measurements of CFC- 11 and CFC- 12 we determine a global OCS stratospheric lifetime of 64 ± 21 years corresponding to a stratospheric sink of 63 – 124 Gg OCS yr- 1...|$|R
40|$|The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), {{which is}} on the EOS AURA satellite, {{retrieves}} vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO 2, along with those of several other trace gases. The relatively high spatial resolution and daily global coverage of the instrument make it particularly well-suited to monitoring tropospheric pollution at scales on the order of 20 km. The OMI NO 2 algorithm distinguishes polluted regions from background stratospheric NO 2 using a separation algorithm that relies on the smoothly varying stratospheric NO 2 and estimations of both <b>stratospheric</b> and tropospheric <b>air</b> mass factors (AMFs). Version 1 of OMI NO 2 data has been released for public use. An overview of OMI NO 2 data, some recent results and a description of the improvements for version 2 of the algorithm will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{from the}} GOME- 2 {{satellite}} instrument have been analyzed for tropospheric BrO using a residual technique that combines measured BrO columns and {{estimates of the}} stratospheric BrO content from a climatological approach driven by O 3 and NO 2 observations. Comparisons between the GOME- 2 results and BrO vertical columns derived from correlative ground-based and SCIAMACHY nadir observations, present a good level of consistency. We show that the adopted technique enables separation of stratospheric and tropospheric fractions of the measured total BrO columns and allows quantitative study of the BrO plumes in polar regions. While some satellite observed plumes of enhanced BrO {{can be explained by}} <b>stratospheric</b> descending <b>air,</b> we show that most BrO hotspots are of tropospheric origin, although they are often associated to regions with low tropopause heights as well. Elaborating on simulations using the p -TOMCAT tropospheric chemical transport model, this result is found to be consistent with the mechanism of bromine release through sea salt aerosols production during blowing snow events. No definitive conclusion can be drawn however on the importance of blowing snow sources in comparison to other bromine release mechanisms. Outside polar regions, evidence is provided for a global tropospheric BrO background with column of 1 – 3 × 10 13 molec cm − 2, consistent with previous estimates...|$|R
