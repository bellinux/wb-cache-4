Therefore {{it is necessary to}} build the transliteration model named JawaTEX to transliterate the Latin text document to Javanese characters. The parser method used in this {{research is}} The Context Free Recursive Descent Parser. The Latin text document processing becomes the list of the Latin string <b>split</b> <b>pattern</b> by using rule-based method, whereas the matching process of each Latin string <b>split</b> <b>pattern</b> in mapping form of LATEX uses Pattern Matching method. The using of rule-based method can solved problems of the previous reseraches by using certain methods. The established transliteration model is supported by the production rule of browsing the Latin string <b>split</b> <b>pattern,</b> the models of the Latin string <b>split</b> <b>pattern,</b> the production rule for the Latin-Javanese character mapping, the models of syntax coding pattern, style or macro LATEX, Javanese character Metafont.

This is achieved by treating ethane-like mols. by the internal axis method (IAM) and methanol-like mols. by the principal axis method (PAM) or rho-axis method (RAM). Using the extended mol. groups G 6 (EM) or C 6 v(M) for methanol and G 36 (EM) for ethane, vibrations perpendicular to the internal rotation axis are conveniently described by modes of higher degeneracy (E for methanol and Gs for ethane) {{in the absence of}} coupling of top and frame. Head-tail coupling operators, except the cos-type barrier terms, lower the degeneracy, causing vibrational splittings. Coupled vibrational pairs with torsional <b>splitting</b> <b>patterns</b> that we call 'regular' (pure A 1, A 2 pairs for methanol and pure E 1 d, E 2 d pairs for ethane) or 'inverted' (pure B 1, B 2 pairs for methanol and pure E 1 s, E 2 s pairs for ethane) can be formed as limit cases. Actual <b>splitting</b> <b>patterns</b> occur between the above limits, and are basically detd. by torsional Coriolis coupling, which can tune more or less to resonance pairs of uncoupled basis levels linked by specific head-tail coupling operators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} observational study was to evaluate whether cone beam CT (CBCT) is {{a useful tool for}} analyzing the fracture line in a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). The patient group consisted of 40 consecutive patients (9 males and 31 females) with a mandibular hypoplasia who underwent a BSSO advancement (Hunsuck modification; n= 80 splits) between September 2006 and July 2008. The mean age at the time of surgery was 34 years (range 17 - 61 years). A newly developed lingual split scale was used to categorize the path of the fracture line on the lingual side of the ramus based on one-day postoperative data sets reconstructed from CBCT data. Although all splits (n= 80) were performed according to the standardized protocol, only 51 % of the fracture lines run according to the Hunsuck's description, whereas 33 % ran through the mandibular canal and 16 % split otherwise.

The analysis is carried out on more populations (130) but fewer genetic systems (11) than earlier studies. We constructed an overall genetic distance matrix that allowed for missing values. A separate genetic distance matrix was also computed for each genetic system, and matching matrices of linguistic and geographic distances were associated with each genetic distance matrix, because the number of populations used differed among the genetic systems studied. Significant matrix correlations between language and genetics were found for both overall genetic distances and a substantial number of genetic systems, even when the effects of geographic distances were held constant. This demonstrates a significant correspondence between genetics and language on a global scale. Genetic matrices were correlated with two different linguistic distance matrices: one with higher (supraphyletic) taxonomic structure, in which among other features sub-Saharan Africans separate from non-Africans in the basal split and the Eurasiatic superphylum is postulated; and one without such structure.

40|$|The {{theory of}} vibration-rotational {{perturbations}} in tetrahedral XY 4 molecules has been reexamined {{in the light}} of the modern theory of angular momentum coupling. It is shown that, even to third order of approximation, the splitting of a vibration rotation level into its tetrahedral sublevels is governed only by perturbation terms of one basic symmetry in all states in which vibrational quanta of [nu] 1, [nu] 3, and [nu] 4 are excited and to a certain approximation in many of the infrared active states in which quanta of both [nu] 2 and [nu] 3 or [nu] 4 are excited. The perturbation term is identified as the tetrahedrally symmetric linear combination of fourth rank spherical tensor operators. In dominant approximation the rotational fine structure <b>splitting</b> <b>patterns</b> are characterized solely by the rotational angular momentum of the state. Only the overall extent of the patterns depends on the vibrational and total angular momentum quantum numbers and the vibrational character of the state. In next approximation the basic <b>splitting</b> <b>patterns</b> are all deformed to a certain extent by matrix elements off-diagonal in the rotational angular momentum quantum number. These cannot be neglected if theory is to account for the modern high resolution spectra.
