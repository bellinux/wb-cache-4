50|$|The above process {{uses the}} subcarrier. But as {{previously}} mentioned, it was deleted before transmission, {{and only the}} chroma is transmitted. Therefore, the receiver must reconstitute the subcarrier. For this purpose, a short burst of subcarrier, known as the color burst, is transmitted during the back porch (re-trace blanking period) of each scan line. A <b>subcarrier</b> <b>oscillator</b> in the receiver locks onto this signal (see phase-locked loop) to achieve a phase reference, resulting in the oscillator producing the reconstituted subcarrier.|$|E

(Apollo 13 made extensive use of the [...] "backup voice" [...] mode, as did the Apollo 16 lunar module Orion due to a failed high gain antenna).|$|E

30|$|At {{the early}} {{advancement}} stage (Chang 1966, 1970; Saltzberg 1967; Chang and Gibby 1968), customary strategies as that utilized {{as a part}} of single-transporter regulation were connected to actualize OFDM–MIMO modem, which oblige various sinusoidal <b>subcarrier</b> <b>oscillators</b> and multipliers in the modulator and banks of correlators in the demodulator. The execution many-sided quality restricted the improvement of OFDM–MIMO until 1971, when the discrete Fourier change (DFT) was connected to this innovation (Weinstein and Ebert 1971). The DFT essentially rearranged the regulation and demodulation forms and made it down to earth to actualize the baseband OFDM–MIMO modem in a computerized way. From that point on, more utilizations of OFDM–MIMO have been explored by and by.|$|R

The design uses a diode-bridge modulator in conjunction with a phase-shift osciUator; the thermocouple voltage is changed to alternating current and is used to shift the phase and hence to change the frequency of oscilla-tion. This method results in an oscillator having a small size, low micro. phonics, high input resistance, and satisfactory stability if a switch is used to commutate calibration voltages along tith the pickups...|$|E

C. 15 - and 9 -channel FM/FM physiological/force-field {{telemetry}} {{data acquisition}} systems utilizing microminiaturized signal conditioning modules, IRIG <b>subcarrier</b> <b>oscillators</b> and 220 or 1485. 5 MHz transmitters have been utilized {{to monitor the}} responses of military test parachutists throughout intentional free-fall parachuting and continuously during highspeed (110 - 150 KIAS) through-the-air-tow by C- 130 aircraft. No in-depth physiological studies of parachutists have previously been conducted and no reference to intentional aerial tow of humans {{was found in the}} literature. The objective is to provide better human engineered egress and retardation equipment for the aircrewmember, to describe parachutists physiologically, and to assess biomedical response to aerial tow so that mid-air retrieval systems can be developed for rescuing ejectees over enemy territory. Mean heart rate profile to parachuting exhibits a double peaked curve with the highest values near parachute deployment (157. 7 BPM) and second highest rates near landing (155. 7 BPM) compared with baseline values of 77. 4 BPM one hour pre-jump. Respiratory rate more than doubles during the jump (32. 1 BrPM) at deployment when compared with baseline conditions (15. 6 BrPM). Total riser forces at parachute deployment average 1632 lbs (8. 34 +G(z)), Preliminary air tow data indicate that heart rate increases linearly with speed to 150 KIAS. One subject, who averaged 131. 5 BPM at landing during nine parachute descents, had heart rates of 128 BPM at egress during tow, 171 BPM at 110 KIAS, and 182 BPM at 150 KIAS. Thermistors and subjective data indicated no significant chilling after 14 minutes in the air-stream...|$|R
