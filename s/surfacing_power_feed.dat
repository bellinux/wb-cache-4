40|$|Data center power {{infrastructure}} incurs massive capital costs, {{which typically}} exceed energy costs {{over the life}} of the facility. To squeeze maximum value from the infrastructure, researchers have proposed over-subscribing power circuits, relying on the observation that peak loads are rare. To ensure availability, these proposals employ power capping, which throttles server performance during utilization spikes to enforce safe power budgets. However, because budgets must be enforced locally—at each power distribution unit (PDU) —local utilization spikes may force throttling even when power delivery capacity is available elsewhere. Moreover, the need to maintain reserve capacity for fault tolerance on power delivery paths magnifies the impact of utilization spikes. In this paper, we develop mechanisms to better utilize installed power infrastructure, reducing reserve capacity margins and avoiding performance throttling. Unlike conventional high-availability data centers, where collocated servers share identical primary and secondary <b>power</b> <b>feeds,</b> we reorganize <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> to create shuffled power distribution topologies. Shuffled topologies spread secondary <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> over numerous PDUs, reducing reserve capacity requirements to tolerate a single PDU failure. Second, we propose Power Routing, which schedules IT load dynamically across redundant <b>power</b> <b>feeds</b> to: (1) shift slack to servers with growing power demands, and (2) balance power draw across AC phases to reduce heating and improve electrical stability. We describe efficient heuristics for scheduling servers to PDUs (an NP-complete problem). Using data collected from nearly 1000 servers in three production facilities, we demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce the required power infrastructure capacity relative to conventional high-availability data centers by 32 % without performance degradation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAiming at the {{shortcomings}} {{appearing in the}} BP neural network method for obtaining the road <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> spectrum density, the paper applies a new cubic spline weight function neural network (CSWFNN) to the identification of road <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> spectrum density. First, a vibration model with four freedoms is established to simulate the actual vehicles. Subsequently, we deduce the nonlinear relationship between power spectrum density of the response {{and that of the}} excitation, and then acquire some input and output data. Next, a CSWFNN is built and trained until converges. In the end, the paper analyses the errors of CSWFNN in the identification of road <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> spectrum density. The results show that the proposed method in the paper successfully overcomes the deficiencies of BP neural network method, and consequently enhances the identification precision of road <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> spectrum density...|$|R

40|$|A set {{of tasks}} have been {{identified}} to help demonstrate the viability, performance, and affordability of surface fission systems. Completion of these tasks will move surface fission systems closer to reality by demonstrating affordability and performance potential. Tasks include fabrication and test of a 19 -pin section of a <b>Surface</b> <b>Power</b> Unit Demonstrator (SPUD); design, fabrication, and utilization of thermal simulators optimized for surface fission' applications; design, fabrication, and utilization of GPHS module thermal simulators; design, fabrication, and test of a fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> system shield; and work related to potential fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> fuel/clad systems.

40|$|Power is a {{critical}} consideration in planning exploration of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and places beyond. Nuclear power is an important option, especially for locations {{in the solar system}} where sunlight is limited or environmental conditions are challenging (e. g., extreme cold, dust storms). NASA and the Department of Energy are maintaining the option for fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> for the Moon and Mars by developing and demonstrating technology for a fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> system. The Fission <b>Surface</b> <b>Power</b> Systems project has focused on subscale component and subsystem demonstrations to address the feasibility of a low-risk, low-cost approach to space nuclear <b>power</b> for <b>surface</b> missions. Laboratory demonstrations of the liquid metal pump, reactor control drum drive, power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution technologies have validated that the fundamental characteristics and performance of these components and subsystems are consistent with a Fission <b>Surface</b> <b>Power</b> preliminary reference concept. In addition, subscale versions of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, using electric resistance heating in place of the reactor fuel, have been built and operated with liquid metal sodium-potassium and helium/xenon gas heat transfer loops, demonstrating the viability of establishing system-level performance and characteristics of fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> technologies without requiring a nuclear reactor. While some component and subsystem testing will continue through 2011 and beyond, the results to date provide sufficient confidence to proceed with system level technology readiness demonstration. To demonstrate the system level readiness of fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> in an operationally relevant environment (the primary goal of the Fission <b>Surface</b> <b>Power</b> Systems project), a full scale, 1 / 4 power Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is under development. The TDU will consist of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, a sodium-potassium heat transfer loop, a power conversion unit with electrical controls, and a heat rejection system with a multi-panel radiator assembly. Testing is planned at the Glenn Research Center Vacuum Facility 6 starting in 2012, with vacuum and liquid-nitrogen cold walls to provide simulation of operationally relevant environments. A nominal two-year test campaign is planned including a Phase 1 reactor simulator and power conversion test followed by a Phase 2 integrated system test with radiator panel heat rejection. The testing is expected to demonstrate the readiness and availability of fission <b>surface</b> <b>power</b> as a viable power system option for NASA's exploration needs. In addition to <b>surface</b> <b>power,</b> technology development work within this project is also directly applicable to in-space fission power and propulsion systems...|$|R
