25|$|More {{aggressive}} self-defense {{measures are}} taken by some caterpillars. These measures include having spiny bristles or long fine hair-like setae with detachable tips that will irritate by lodging {{in the skin}} or mucous membranes. However some birds (such as cuckoos) will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillars. Other caterpillars acquire toxins from their host plants that render them unpalatable to most of their predators. For instance, ornate moth caterpillars utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids that they obtain from their food plants to deter predators. The most aggressive caterpillar defenses are bristles associated with venom glands. These bristles are called urticating hairs. A venom which {{is among the most}} potent defensive chemicals in any animal is produced by the South American <b>silk</b> <b>moth</b> genus Lonomia. Its venom is an anticoagulant powerful enough to cause a human to hemorrhage to death (See Lonomiasis). This chemical is being investigated for potential medical applications. Most urticating hairs range in effect from mild irritation to dermatitis.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{biological}} pest control agents, or using predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, {{has the potential}} to reduce agricultural pollution associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native biocontrol agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a biocontrol agent can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a biocontrol program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control gypsy moth and browntail moth. [...] This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native <b>silk</b> <b>moth</b> species.|$|E

40|$|Most of the world's silk is {{produced}} in Asia and the Far East with a few countries in Africa developing a small industry using introduced Asian <b>silk</b> <b>moths.</b> But Africa has it's own wild <b>silk</b> <b>moths,</b> although up until now, the cocoons of these wild moths have not been harvested sustain ably. Until recently many people were unaware of the potential of wild African <b>silk</b> <b>moths</b> {{and as a result}} many silkworms were killed and eaten before they had had time to make their cocoons. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) has been looking into ways of sustain ably exploiting the potential of wild <b>silk</b> <b>moths.</b> One problem has been that these moths are not easy to domesticate so ICIPE has set up a system of partial domestication. This involves taking cocoons from the wild and once the moths emerge, they are encouraged to lay eggs in the laboratory. When the eggs have hatched, the larvae are returned to the wild and within 52 - 53 days spin their cocoons. Local communities are encouraged to, harvest the cocoons but on condition that 25 % of the cocoons are left to provide sufficient adult moths to produce the next breeding generation. ICIPE has developed a simple device to unreel the harvested silk thread. This ensures that local communities obtain a good quality thread that can either be twisted for cloth making or sold as raw silk. Five to six kilos of cocoons will yield one kilo of raw silk worth the equivalent of US$ 90 which is a valuable income for any household.
