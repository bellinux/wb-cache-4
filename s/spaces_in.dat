5|$|Although {{important}} to the local economy with spending generating over £53,000,000 GVA, Christchurch is not so heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. Tourism's contribution to the local economy is about 9% compared to 18% for Weymouth and Portland, 15% for Purbeck and 12% for Bournemouth. Visitor accommodation consists of 11 caravan and camping parks and some 900 bed <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> eight hotels and 75 guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector <b>spaces,</b> <b>in</b> which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Princess {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} {{exclusively on the}} more profitable cinema side of the business. Revenues from the rental <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> the basement and upper floors had also begun to flow in. Notably, Hugh Morrow, a beat cop, had leased apartment 205.

5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s it was {{recognised}} that {{conservation of}} historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open <b>spaces.</b> <b>In</b> 1987 {{the city was}} selected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

5|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Cut the Crap were chaotic, with manager Bernard Rhodes and Strummer working in Munich. Most {{of the music}} was played by studio musicians, with Sheppard and later White flying in to provide guitar parts. Struggling with Rhodes {{for control of the}} band, Strummer returned home.

40|$|International audienceLook-Up Table (LUT) based Digital PreDistortion (DPD) {{is widely}} used for Power Amplifier (PA) linearization. In this paper, two LUTs of {{different}} spacing structures are compared with each other. One is even <b>spacing</b> <b>in</b> the in-LUT domain and uneven <b>spacing</b> <b>in</b> the out-LUT domain. The other one is uneven <b>spacing</b> <b>in</b> the in-LUT domain and even <b>spacing</b> <b>in</b> the out-LUT domain. These two LUT structures are adopted in DPD based on MP model and linearly interpolated LUT. The performance of the two LUT structures in DPD is compared by using Matlab and simulation results are analyzed. The performance of LUT in DPD {{is closely related to}} the predistorted signal statistics...|$|R

5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of {{areas of the city}} in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open <b>spaces.</b> <b>In</b> 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, Frank Lloyd Wright was retained to remake the interior <b>spaces.</b> <b>In</b> keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E
