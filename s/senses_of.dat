5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{satisfaction}} is important as {{it contributes to}} a person‟s psychological wellbeing and quality of life. Residential satisfaction develops due to physical {{factors such as the}} provision of parks and amenities within a community, social factors such as a feeling of belongingness to the community and social support within the community and personal factors such as homeownership and length <b>of</b> residence. <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place also influence residential satisfaction; however, the extent that these contribute is unclear. As a result, this study investigated the contribution of these constructs to the development of residential satisfaction in the planned community of Ellenbrook, designed to promote these concepts. Additionally, this study investigated the relationship between residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place as well as the factors that comprise of these constructs. A quantitative approach was utilised in which 300 residents completed published questionnaires measuring residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging. to examine the extent that social, physical and personal predictors contributed to the development <b>of</b> residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place, a Kruskal-Wallis analysis was undertaken. The findings indicated that the social and physical factors: feelings of belongingness, community attachment, community participation, minimal fear of crime, community layout and design and housing density contribute to the experience of high levels <b>of</b> residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place. Regarding personal factors: age, ethnicity, homeownership, length of residence and educational level did not contribute to the development <b>of</b> residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place. However, marital status contributed to the development <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place but not residential satisfaction. Household income and number of people known in the community contributed to the development <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging, while gender contributed to the development of residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community. These findings indicate that a community developed with sensitivity to people‟s social and personal needs as well as specific spatial planning elements, {{contribute to the development of}} residential satisfaction. The interrelation <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and their impact on residential satisfaction was explored through factor analysis. Results showed nine factors to emerge. One factor consisted of several residential satisfaction items along with the attraction to neighbourhood components <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, and the place attachment components <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place, indicating the communality of these items. Despite efforts to use distinctive measures of these concepts, there is to a certain degree, an inseparable nature of the dimensions <b>of</b> residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place. The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging items emerged as a separate factor indicating it to have a unique identity from residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community. Additionally, three of the four place identity items emerged on one factor, as did the residential satisfaction items referring to feelings of dissatisfaction, suggesting the uniqueness of these items. To examine the relationship between residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place, regression analyses were performed. There was a significant positive relationship between residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community χ 2 (1, 300) = 40. 127, p 3 ̆c. 05; residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place χ 2 (1, 300) = 56. 805, p 3 ̆c. 05 and residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging χ 2 (1, 300) = 25. 848, p 3 ̆c. 05. This indicates that <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place contribute to the development of residential satisfaction, supporting previous research. The examination of these concepts in conjunction is a new concept. As a result, this research provides a theoretical understanding of the interrelation, as well as the uniqueness, <b>of</b> residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place. Practically, this research assists policy makers and planners to develop communities that encompass these concepts to avoid issues faced by unplanned communities...|$|R
30|$|The {{dissociation}} <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{agency and}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership is for sure, but how these two senses {{interact with each}} other is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency seems to promote the integration <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership, pure <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership is fragmentary, and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency with <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership, the role of these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership have no interactions. The interaction of modality and synchronicity {{had a significant impact on}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership rather than <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency, indicating <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency seems to increase <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership but not vice versa.|$|R
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the feeling of belonging that students {{may or may not have}} and the relationship <b>of</b> student <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging to the overall academic achievement of a school. Students were surveyed on their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging in selected middle schools. The students scored themselves on the Psychological <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> School Membership scale, which revealed an overall mean score of belonging. Students from high-performing schools were compared to students from low-performing schools in regard to their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging. Additionally, teachers were asked to rate their perception <b>of</b> the students? <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging. The teachers? scores were compared to the students? scores in both high- and low-performing schools. Lastly, teachers were asked to provide qualitative information about the schools? role in creating a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging. An extensive review of the literature regarding <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging reveals support of the importance <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging in student achievement. There is also extensive evidence regarding variation <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging among minority groups and the important role of teachers in creating a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging for students. This study found that there is no significant difference in students? reported <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging between high-performing schools and low-performing schools on the Psychological <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> School Membership scale. There is a significant difference between the teachers? perception <b>of</b> the students? <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and the students? reported <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging on the Psychological <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> School Membership scales. Teachers reported important roles in creating an environment of belonging. The qualitative data provided by teachers support evidence from the literature review indicative <b>of</b> schools with <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging. High-performing schools do not report much information regarding discipline and routine as being important parts of creating belonging. However, low performing schools often report these as important to creating a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging for students. Implications of the research include: Teachers may not have an accurate understanding <b>of</b> students? <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and how to create a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging in schools. Further study should try to gain better understanding of the relationship between <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging and minority status...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the strength and nature <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community in a small New Zealand primary school learning community. The research used a mixed methods approach to examine individual and group-level predictors and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community among parents, students and staff. The strength <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community was assessed through the Brief <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Community Index (BSCS) while further understanding <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community was gained through analysis of qualitative data according to McMillan and Chavis' (1986) four dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community. Factors identified as enabling <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community were: acceptance and belonging, shared understandings of and commitment to parent volunteering, positive experiences of adult induction, being heard, shared norms or guiding principles, pride in the community, shared values and goals, reciprocal support, friendship, personal development, shared history, and sharing experiences. The study revealed {{a difference in the}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community between students and adults in the school, with students having a higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community.

5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E

The extrinsic variables were <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> teaching presence, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> cognitive presence, and usage. According to structural equation modeling, each of these variables and flow significantly affected satisfaction. Although <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> teaching presence and satisfaction significantly affected <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> cognitive presence, usage and flow did not significantly affect learning persistence.
