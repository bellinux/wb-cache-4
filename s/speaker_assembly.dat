50|$|The Instruction set used a {{fixed length}} of one word {{providing}} 24 bits {{for the operation}} and 24 bits for the address. The address consisted of 18 bits (3 bytes) for the memory address, with other bits used for the specification of index registers and indirect addressing. The operation field provided the operation code {{and a variety of}} modifiers. Some modifiers allowed instructions to operate only on specific bytes of a word or on specific bits of a byte without separate masking operations. Other modifiers allowed the single 48-bit ALU to operate on a pair of 24-bit operands to facilitate vector operations. CPU controls included sense switches to control various software functions, a run/halt switch, and a switch, amplifier, and <b>speaker</b> <b>assembly,</b> to provide audio feedback or even play music, by connecting one of four bits in the main accumulator which could then be toggled under software control at an appropriate rate to produce whatever tones one wanted.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Response surface models (RSMs) {{can be used}} {{to model}} {{expensive}} simulations or real measurements [1]. An RSM is constructed by simulating solutions at systematic points in a design space and fitting a model to them. The RSM is then employed in subsequent calculations (for instance in optimization) effectively replacing the original expensive simulator, which leads to considerable savings in time and money. A novel technique is presented here which uses the gradient of a function as well as the function itself to construct the RSM. Such an approach is possible because, for many types of simulations, gradient information is simple and cheap to obtain. The design of an electromagnetic <b>speaker</b> <b>assembly</b> is used to illustrate the new approach. The finite element method (FEM), on which the simulation is based, can provide gradient information at little extra cost and hence the benefits of using gradient information are considerable, being especially marked in higher-dimensional spaces...|$|E
