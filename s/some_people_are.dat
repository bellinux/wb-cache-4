5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{resistant}} to certain strains of HIV. For example, {{people with the}} CCR5-Δ32 mutation are {{resistant to}} infection with R5 virus, as the mutation stops HIV from binding to this coreceptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and {{at an earlier age}} than is typical.|$|E
5|$|First the {{machines}} {{will do a}} lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not concerned.|$|E

5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When used for this purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who follow}} Voldemort {{consider}} the Dark Mark {{to be of}} great importance, and while <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> 'lucky' enough to have one, the privilege is restricted to those of 'pure' blood.

25|$|Not {{all people}} have the same {{internal}} perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of hallucinogenic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts. The Mental Imagery article goes into more detail.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is metabolized by the {{cytochrome}} P450 enzyme {{system in}} the liver, making it vulnerable to drug interactions. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> fast metabolizers, resulting in reduced analgesic effect, but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolisers, resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia. The dose of oxycodone must be reduced in patients with reduced hepatic function.|$|E
25|$|Certain modern Buddhists, {{particularly}} in Western countries, reject—or {{at least take}} an agnostic stance toward—the concept of rebirth or reincarnation, which they view as incompatible {{with the concept of}} anatta. Stephen Batchelor discusses this issue in his book Buddhism Without Beliefs. Others point to research that has been conducted at the University of Virginia as proof that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> reborn.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the humans}} {{practice}} polytheism, worshiping the Lords of Kobol. This {{appears to be}} the state religion of the colonies; government oaths refer to the gods, and back on the Twelve Colonies, public museums housed artifacts of the gods. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> devout believers, others are atheists, and most fall somewhere in the middle; all three viewpoints are accepted more or less equally.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, trait theory (also called dispositional theory) is an {{approach}} {{to the study of}} human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ across individuals (e.g. <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> outgoing whereas others are not), and influence behavior. Traits are in contrast to states which are more transitory dispositions.|$|E
