25|$|Over time, {{electrical}} {{codes in}} the US and Canada began to require additional safety {{features in the}} basic NEMA 5-15R and 5-20R configurations to address specific electric <b>shock</b> <b>hazard</b> concerns. The safety features listed below are not mutually exclusive; for example, tamper-resistant GFCI receptacles are available.|$|E
25|$|Earlier type 11 & 12 plugs had {{line and}} neutral pins without sleeved pins, which present a <b>shock</b> <b>hazard</b> when {{partially}} inserted into non-recessed sockets. Since 1 January 2013, only type 11 & 12 plugs with line and neutral pins partially sleeved {{are allowed to}} be imported and distributed to reduce the risk.|$|E
25|$|Transformer-less power {{supplies}} required safety precautions in their design {{to limit the}} <b>shock</b> <b>hazard</b> to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an interlock tying the power cord to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A cheater cord was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.|$|E
50|$|Squirrels, {{rats and}} other rodents may gnaw on {{unprotected}} wiring, causing fire and <b>shock</b> <b>hazards.</b> This {{is especially true}} of PVC-insulated telephone and computer network cables. Several techniques have been developed to deter these pests, including insulation loaded with pepper dust.|$|R
50|$|Because {{third rail}} systems present {{electric}} <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> {{close to the}} ground, high voltages (above 1500 V) are not considered safe. A very high current must therefore be used to transfer adequate power, resulting in high resistive losses, and requiring relatively closely spaced feed points (electrical substations).|$|R
25|$|One {{apparent}} {{disadvantage of}} twist-lock connectors {{is that in}} the event that the cable is accidentally pulled too hard, rather than the plug falling out of the receptacle, exposed conductors may come out of the plug, causing dangerous shorts or <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> if the circuit is live. This is resolved in most cases by the connector having a robust integral strain relief.|$|R
25|$|Where {{the danger}} of {{electric}} shock is high, special ungrounded power systems {{may be used to}} minimize possible leakage current to ground. Examples of such installations include patient care areas in hospitals, where medical equipment is directly connected to a patient and must not permit any power-line current to pass into the patient's body. Medical systems include monitoring devices to warn of any increase of leakage current. On wet construction sites or in shipyards, isolation transformers may be provided so that a fault in a power tool or its cable does not expose users to <b>shock</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Made by Dorman & Smith Ltd. (using patents {{applied for}} in 1943) the {{plugs and sockets}} were rated at 13A and {{were one of the}} {{competing}} types for use on ring final circuits. They were never popular in private houses but were widely deployed in prefabricated houses and council housing. The BBC also used them. Some local authorities continued to use them in new installations until the late 1950s. Many D sockets were still in use until the early 1980s, although the difficulty in obtaining plugs for them after around 1970 often forced their users to replace them with BS1363 sockets. The D plug suffered from a serious design fault: the line pin was a fuse which screwed into the plug body and tended to come unscrewed on its own in use. A fuse that worked loose could end up protruding from the socket, electrically live and posing a <b>shock</b> <b>hazard,</b> when the plug was removed.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{examples}} of a rheostat dimmer include a salt water dimmer or liquid rheostat; the liquid between a movable and fixed contact provided a variable resistance. [...] The closer the contacts to each other, the [...] more voltage was available for the light. [...] Salt water dimmers [...] required regular addition of water and maintenance due to corrosion; exposed parts were energized during operation, presenting a <b>shock</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
50|$|If more {{capacity}} is needed, a second SWER {{line can be}} run on the same poles to provide two SWER lines 180 degrees out of phase. This requires more insulators and wire, but doubles the power without doubling the poles. Many standard SWER poles have several bolt holes to support this upgrade. This configuration causes most ground currents to cancel, reducing <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> and interference with communication lines.|$|R
25|$|Starting {{with the}} 2008 National Electrical Code and the 2009 Canadian Electrical Code, listed {{tamper-resistant}} receptacles that address electric <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> to children {{must now be}} installed in almost all areas of new or renovated dwellings. According to statistics cited by the NFPA, the code change adds only $40 {{to the cost of}} building an average, 75-receptacle home in the US, yet prevents <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> to a child that sticks a single, metal object into the receptacle. The new receptacles are expected {{to reduce the number of}} electric shocks to children because inserting a normal, two-blade electrical plug applies pressure on both sides of the receptacle to open an internal, spring-loaded shutter, but a foreign object fails to do so and therefore does not make contact with the live electrical contacts. However, the device can still be defeated by inserting two objects simultaneously. Despite its weaknesses, the tamper-resistant receptacle is superior to protective plastic outlet caps which must be individually installed on each receptacle (and are a choking hazard when removed), and to sliding covers that children easily learn to defeat.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{electrical}} {{power distribution system}} of Marinas requires a special architecture to supply the distributed loads constituted by pleasure crafts. It must also provide for solutions to possible stray currents circulating through {{the earth and the}} water that can cause electrical hazards and corrosions. The authors suggest the adoption of a distribution operated at 1 kV and the TN-island System to supply each pleasure craft. This distribution system is an effective way to protect persons from <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> in installations with contained demand load, and to greatly limit electrical interferences among systems...|$|R
2500|$|Small stray {{voltages}} {{may never}} be noticed and may only be detected with a voltmeter. Larger voltages may {{have a range of}} effects, from barely perceptible to dangerous electric shocks, or unintended electrical heating resulting in fires. [...] Normally, metal electrical equipment cases are bonded to ground to prevent a <b>shock</b> <b>hazard</b> if energized conductors accidentally contact the case. Where this bonding is not provided or has failed, a severe hazard of electric shock or electrocution is presented when circuit conductors contact the case.|$|E
2500|$|For {{measurement}} purposes, the Earth {{serves as}} a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground system should have an appropriate current-carrying capability {{to serve as an}} adequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a [...] "ground" [...] is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or earth potential rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric <b>shock</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These {{electrical}} wiring devices {{are designed to}} quickly and automatically disconnect a circuit when it detects that the electric current is not balanced between the energized (line) conductor(s) and the return (neutral) conductor. Under normal circumstances, these two wires are expected to carry matching currents, and any difference can indicate a short circuit or other electrical anomaly is present, such as leakage. Leakage can indicate a <b>shock</b> <b>hazard</b> (or shock in progress) which is a potential danger to a person. Current leakage can result in harm or death due to electric shock, especially if the leaking electric current passes through the torso of a human. A current of around 30mA (0.030amperes) is potentially sufficient to cause cardiac arrest or serious harm if it persists {{for more than a}} small fraction of a second. RCDs are designed to disconnect the conducting wires quickly enough to prevent serious injury from such shocks, commonly described as the RCD being [...] "tripped".|$|E
50|$|Wildland firefighters {{working around}} {{energized}} power lines {{are exposed to}} electrical <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> including: direct contact with downed power lines, contact with electrically charged materials and equipment due to broken lines, contact with smoke that can conduct electricity between lines, {{and the use of}} solid-stream water applications around energized lines. Between 1980 and 1999 in the U.S., there were 10 firefighter fatalities due to electrical structure contact during wildfire suppression (NFPA, 2001). Maintaining a minimum 500 ft safety buffer greatly reduces the risk of electrical structure contact, and it also reduces the effectiveness of ground-based frontal attacks.|$|R

The signals for these parameters are for the most part low-level signals that require good instrumentation amplification.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine rapid-rate nonsustained {{ventricular}} tachycardia (RR-NSVT) during routine implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) evaluation in patients with heart failure and its relationship to outcomes. BackgroundThe clinical implications of RR-NSVT identified during routine ICD interrogation are unclear. In this study, the occurrence of RR-NSVT and its association with ICD shocks and mortality in SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) were examined. MethodsThe 811 patients who received ICDs in SCD-HeFT constituted the study population. The occurrence of RR-NSVT and its association with ICD shocks and mortality in SCD-HeFT were examined. ResultsRR-NSVT was documented on ICD interrogation in 186 of 811 patients (22. 9 %). The mean duration of RR-NSVT was 26. 4 ± 9. 1 beats (7. 5 ± 2. 6 s), with a mean cycle length of 259 ± 32 ms. Polymorphic RR-NSVT accounted for 56 % of episodes. Compared with patients without RR-NSVT, those with RR-NSVT were less likely to be taking beta-blockers, statins, or aspirin at enrollment. After adjusting for other known predictors of mortality in SCD-HeFT, RR-NSVT was independently associated with appropriate ICD <b>shocks</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio: 4. 25; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 94 to 6. 14; p < 0. 0001), with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 2. 40; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 62 to 3. 54; p < 0. 0001), and with a composite of all-cause mortality and appropriate ICD <b>shocks</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio: 3. 03; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 21 to 4. 15; p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsRR-NSVT identified on routine ICD interrogation should be considered an important clinical event. RR-NSVT during ICD interrogation is associated with appropriate ICD shocks and all-cause mortality. The clinical evaluation of patients with RR-NSVT should include intensification of medical therapy, particularly beta-blockers, or other appropriate clinical interventions.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{assessment of the}} possible damage to {{electrical and electronic equipment}} caused by accidental release of carbon fibers from burning civil aircraft with carbon composite parts was completed. The study concluded that the amount of fiber likely to be released is much lower than initially predicted. Carbon fiber released from an aircraft crash fire was found (from atmospheric dissemination models) to disperse over a much larger area than originally estimated, with correspondingly lower fiber concentrations. Long term redissemination of fiber was shown to be insignificant if reasonable care is exercised in accident cleanup. The vulnerability of electrical equipment to structural fibers in current use was low. Consumer appliances, industrial electronics, and avionics were essentially invulnerable to carbon fibers. <b>Shock</b> <b>hazards</b> (and thus potential injury or death) were found to be extremely unlikely...|$|R

40|$|High-voltage {{transmission}} lines {{can be just}} as safe as the electrical wiring in the homes [...] or just as dangerous.

2500|$|The {{cold cathode}} system was {{installed}} {{in a number of}} gold mines and worked reliably. However, Rubin began working on a completely novel system with greatly improved sensitivity, and by early 1956, he had produced a prototype second-harmonic magnetic amplifier-type core balance system (South African Patent No. 2268/56 and Australian Patent No. 218360). [...] The prototype magamp was rated at 220 V, 60 A and had an internally adjustable tripping sensitivity of 12.5–17.5 mA. Very rapid tripping times were achieved through a novel design, and this combined with the high sensitivity was well within the safe current-time envelope for ventricular fibrillation determined by Charles Dalziel of the University of California, Berkeley, USA, who had estimated electrical <b>shock</b> <b>hazards</b> in humans. [...] This system, with its associated circuit breaker, included overcurrent and short-circuit protection. In addition, the original prototype was able to trip at a lower sensitivity in the presence of an interrupted neutral, thus protecting against an important cause of electrical fire.|$|R
