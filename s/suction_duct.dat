In this study, full 3 D numerical simulations have been performed using a commercial code inside the pump from the inlet of <b>suction</b> <b>duct</b> to the outlet of delivery duct. The numerical model is based on a combination of multiphase flow equations with the truncated version of the Rayleigh-Plesset model predicting the complicated growth and collapse process of cavity bubbles.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} a microfluidics chip for cell capturing and pairing with a high efficiency. The chip was fabricated by the polydimethylsiloxane-based soft-lithography technique and contained two <b>suction</b> <b>duct</b> arrays set in parallel {{on both sides of}} a main microchannel. Cells were captured and paired by activating two sets of suction ducts one by one with the help of syringe pumps along with switching the cell suspensions inside the main microchannel correspondingly. The effects of suction flow rate and the dimensions of suction channels on the cell capturing and pairing efficiency were characterized. The present chip was capable of creating 1024 pairs of two different cell populations in parallel. The preliminary experimental results showed that the cell capturing efficiency was 100 % and the pairing one was 88 % with an optimal suction rate of 5 μl/min in the chip in the 2 μm-sized <b>suction</b> <b>duct</b> chip. The cell viability after capture inside the microfluidic device was 90. 0 [*]±[*] 5. 3 %. With this cell capturing and pairing chip, interaction between cells in a single pair mode can be studied. The ability to create cell pairs has a number of biological applications for cell fusion, cell-cell interaction studies, and cell toxicity screening...|$|E

Characteristic of this system is one single <b>suction</b> <b>duct,</b> the leading edge box itself, a double sheet suction surface with suction velocity control by orifices in the inner sheet and a constant speed suction pump directly with the leading edge box.

40|$|Last stage {{rotor blades}} of low {{pressure}} steam turbines {{are still being}} under consideration. In order to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} low pressure turbine a new open porosity powder metallurgical composite should be developed, so that the condensed water could be sucked off over the whole surface instead of locally via slots. To this end chromium steel powder for the carrier material and the porous surface layer is combined with place holder material for the <b>suction</b> <b>ducts.</b> The open porous layer is formed from mixtures of chromium steel powder and pure iron powder and different salts as place holder powder.

40|$|Curved {{diffusers}} {{are used}} in pipe lines or in some fluid machineries, such as blades of impeller, a volute casing, or <b>suction</b> <b>duct.</b> The performance of the curved diffuser has a considerable effect on the energy conversion in the pipe lines or the machineries. Furthermore, the volute casing in the pumps or blowers is generally attached to the radial diffuser, so that the flow in the volute or scroll casing has usually very high complexities. The flow in the volute casing will be moderated by {{the combination of the}} single curved diffuser and the longitudinal side wall slit duct. However, the studies to the flow in the curved diffuser with the longitudinal slit, were merely conducted in the past ages. In this report, as a step of the study of the flow in the volute casing, experiments of flow in a two-dimensional curved diffuser, which has a small diverging angle and 90 ° turning angle, were carried out. The time average velocities and velocity fluctuations were measured using a constant temperature hot-wire or split film probe system. It is shown that the flow in the curved diffuser has velocity profiles with gradually variant gradients and attached to the outer side wall, and the profiles of velocity fluctuations have very interesting patterns concernig to the stall and the secondary flow...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnels {{are used}} to study {{airflows}} around objects like cars, airplanes and ice-skaters. This is done, simulating the real world, by blowing an airflow over a fixed body. In the real situation an object moves through the air, while in a wind tunnel it is the air that is moving. So a wind tunnel needs to generate an airflow. In this airflow, at {{the walls of the}} wind tunnel, an undesired effect occurs called boundary layer development. A thin layer of air is retarded due to friction of the airflow with the walls of the tunnel. In an automotive wind tunnel, which simulates airflows around cars, this boundary layer will also develop over the ground plane under the car. Because this boundary layer is not present on the road, this ground plane boundary layer should be minimized for accurate simulations. To minimize the ground plane boundary layer many techniques are implemented in wind tunnels {{and one of them is}} boundary layer suction. With boundary layer suction, a suction section in the wind tunnel floor removes, or partly removes, the boundary layer by sucking air away from the main airflow. This suction section is the main subject of this master thesis. Research will be done on a new suction system with an adaptive <b>suction</b> <b>duct</b> geometry. It will explore the possibilities to control the suction speed distribution on this suction system by adapting the geometry of the duct by actuators. A model of a system with an adaptive geometry is made based on the physical properties of the airflow in the duct. This model is verified by measurements on a test setup. It is found that different control techniques can be used to control the suction speed distribution of the airflow through a porous material. The capabilities of the controlled system are quantified for wind tunnel integration. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|De Beers Marine is {{currently}} mining diamonds offshore near the Namibian coast (at water depths of 115 - 140 meters), using a vertical batch drill mining system ('Wirth drill"). Previously also continuous seabed crawlers have been used, but this method was discontinued because of unsatisfactory operational performance and {{recovery of the}} diamonds. New crawler-type mining tools (latest tool is the so-called "Gravel Wheel") are being developed due to their higher mining rate potential compared to the Wirth drill. On 1 / 3 scale {{different versions of the}} Gravel Wheel had been thoroughly tested on imitated seabeds of gravel and initial tests had been done in clay. Since together with the gravel on average 5 to 10 cm (up to 30 cm) of underlying clay footwall may have to be loosened and removed more thorough tests have to be done in clay. The first reason to study the cutting into clay is the irregular gravel-footwall interface, which makes it nearly impossible to stay right at this interface all the time. Secondly, 100 % of the diamonds have to be removed since the likelihood of diamonds occurring at the gravel-footwall interface is high. With the Gravel Wheel currently being tested, the focus {{of this study is to}} mine both gravel and clay with one tool in one step. The main objective of this study is to define and improve the clay handling ability of the current Gravel Wheel model MkIII through scaled testing. The clay handling ability is specified as the ability to remain 100 % clear from blockages and the ability to penetrate the clay footwall for 50 mm (full scale) whilst mining gravel. To reach to goals set, sub-objectives set are to establish a proper theoretical basis for the execution of scaled tests in clay, as well as derive basic design guidelines from experience in other related industries in order to evaluate and improve the Gravel Wheels' clay handling ability. In the attempt to achieve similarity between model and full scale, three scenarios for scaled testing are identified. Although all three show scale effects, the most favourable scenario is selected to perform scaled tests. The main drawback of this scenario is that the clays' shear strength is not scaled back correctly in ratio to the force to mould the cut clay lumps (drag force). The consequence is that the test conditions on model scale are much tougher than on full scale. It is argued that if this scenario is used in scaled testing and if testing is successful, the tool will definitely work on full scale. From experience in dredging several design guidelines have been derived to evaluate a tools' clay cutting ability and an initial evaluation of the Gravel Wheel has been made. The Gravel Wheel scores negative on the risk of bulldozing, openness of the tool and the converging shape of the <b>suction</b> <b>duct</b> and these features are expected to be most critical in the Gravel Wheels' design. Based on this analysis the scoop grizzly has been modified to reduce the risk of bulldozing. The scaled tests (continued on 1 / 3 scale) prove that the maximum cut depth at which the tool remains free from blockage increases with increased rotational speed and modified scoop design. On model scale a 100 mm cut in clay has been achieved with a rotational speed of 20 RPM and a modified scoop design. Tests show that while mining gravel, a 20 mm and 50 mm cut in clay can be achieved at forward mining speeds of 2. 5 and 1. 7 m/min respectively. Further modifications to the scoop are made to reduce the obstructing side effect of the grizzly bars. The test results confirm that the risk of bulldozing and the converging shape of the <b>suction</b> <b>duct</b> are the most critical features in the Gravel Wheels design. The obstructing side effect of the grizzly bars has also been recognized as problematic. It is recommended that more shear strength testing is done on offshore footwall clays to get more insight in the actual clay footwall shear strengths since currently only limited shear strength data of the clay footwall is available. Further more tests in clay and gravel should be performed to find the optimum operational parameters (e. g. forward mining speed) at different set cut depths: initial tests in clay and gravel have proven valuable to study the clay and gravel interaction and initial trends have been observed. The necessity to achieve a specific cut depth in clay depends all on the degree of undulation and the accuracy with which the clay-gravel interface can be followed. It is therefore finally recommended to further study these factors in order to better define the clay cut depth requirement of any mining tool.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} convection heat transfer and fluid flow in an insulated rectangular cavity, i. e., an indoor with the injection and <b>suction</b> <b>ducts.</b> Emphasis is placed on the effect of a vertical partition plate in the cavity on the thermal and velocity fields and local area heating-performance. The numerical method is based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes and energy equations. The fluid in the cavity {{in the absence of the}} vertical partition plate shows the large clockwise flow pattern and as time progresses, the fluid temperature is gradually increased and becomes uniformly over the whole region of the cavity. When the vertical plate is installed at the central location of the upper horizontal wall, the higher velocity field appears in the left area of the indoor and the corresponding fluid temperature is higher than that of the right area. By installing the partition plate, the temperature distribution in the indoor is controlled. In other words, only the desired space of the cavity is warmed, because the flow pattern is changed due to the presence of the plate. The optimum partition plate height is obtained based on the numerical and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight tests have clearly {{demonstrated}} {{the potential of}} hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) to reduce 2 d-airfoil drag on a modern transport aircraft by about 50 % leading to a total drag reduction of about 10 % to 15 %. However, these tests also revealed that much of HLF technology's advantage might be obliterated {{by the weight of}} additional structures and systems. Consequently, one central objective of the EC funded programme ALTTA is the simplification of the suction system for an Airbus A 320 HLFC fin. The simplest internal structure for an HLF system would have only one suction chamber, the leading edge box itself. Unfortunately, the usage of combination with a constant-porosity suction surface results in a very ineffective suction speed distribution. From the aerodynamic point of view the porous surface has to be supported by stringers arranged in spanwise direction. Then the risk of inducing turbulent by nonporous parts of the surface is very small. Lift forces, meanwhile, have to be lead to the front spar by ribs. A very efficient structural solution is a second sheet between stringers and ribs. The outer porous surface, the supporting stringers and the inner sheet form a double sheet surface with a relatively high number of chambers. This structure also allows for a very efficient control the suction distribution. Assuming that the porosity of the suction surface is constant in chord and span direction, the local mass flow between two stringers can be adjusted by metering orifices in the inner sheet, making the whole leading edge box a single <b>suction</b> <b>duct.</b> Active computer control of the mass flow in the suction pipes through butterfly valves and corresponding sensor equipment have also contributed to the high complexity of suction systems in the past. In the present design such elements will not be used. The mass flow-controlling elements are the porous outer surface, the inner sheet with orifices and a suitable suction pump assumed to be located within the leading box. The system is designed to be fully self adapting for a certain range of Mach numbers, flight levels and yaw angles. The paper describes the assumptions and equations to calculate suction speed, mass flow, pressure and pressure losses of such a system. It is shown that this system allows very efficient suction distribution. Reversed turbulence inducing suction velocity (local outflow) can be avoided for a range of yaw angles of +/- 3 °. The transition location on the fin is determined by linear stability calculations. Based on general flight conditions, surface geometry, surface pressure distribution and the suction speed distribution the stability analysis of the laminar boundary layer is performed by means of the local stability code COAST 3. The transition location is determined using the stability results in combination with the so-called 2 -N-factor criterion. The calculation procedure described above is applied on a set of design and off-design flight conditions. It includes Mach numbers from 0. 76 to 0. 80, flight levels between 23000 and 39000 ft, yaw angles of +/- 4 °, ruder deflections of 2 ° and a variation of the suction surface porosity. With increasing Mach number the extent of laminar flow moves slightly downstream. The influence of the flight level is negligible. Varying yaw angle induced by the pressure distribution has a strong influence on the development of laminar flow. The essential result is that up to +/- 3 ° of yaw angle the boundary layer is kept laminar. At larger yaw angles local outflow causes transition of the laminar boundary layer. The extent of laminar flow varies between nearly 40 % on the outer half of the fin and about 30 % on the lower part. The simplified layout of the suction system fulfils the design objectives agreed by the ALTTA partners...|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{to catch}} paint overspray has been proposed. Overspray is an unavoidable parasitic component of spray that occurs because {{the flow of}} air or other gas in the spray must turn at the sprayed surface. Very small droplets are carried away in this turning flow, and some land on adjacent surfaces {{not meant to be}} painted. The basic principle of the paint-spray catcher is to divert the overspray into a suction system at the boundary of the area to be painted. The paint-spray catcher (see figure) would include a toroidal plenum connected through narrow throat to a nozzle that would face {{toward the center of the}} torus, which would be positioned over the center of the area to be spray-painted. The plenum would be supported by four tubes that would also serve as <b>suction</b> exhaust <b>ducts.</b> The downstream ends of the tubes (not shown in the figure) would be connected to a filter on a suction pump. The pump would be rated to provide a suction mass flow somewhat greater than that of the directed spray gas stream, so that the nozzle would take in a small excess of surrounding gas and catch nearly all of the overspray. A small raised lip at the bottom edge of the nozzle would catch paint that landed inside the nozzle. Even if the paint is directly piston pumped, the droplets entrain an air flow by time they approach the wall, so there is always a gas stream to carry the excess droplets to the side. For long-duration spraying operations, it could be desirable to include a suction-drain apparatus to prevent overflowing and dripping of paint from inside the lip. A version without an external contraction and with the throat angled downward would be a more compact version of catcher, although it might be slightly less efficient...|$|R
