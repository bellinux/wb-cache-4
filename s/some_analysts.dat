In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E
5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. <b>Some</b> <b>analysts</b> believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan {{took advantage of the}} panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and the significance of the role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.|$|E

5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> have described as another executive.|$|E
5|$|In North America, King Kong grossed $9,755,745 {{during its}} Wednesday opening and $50,130,145 over its first weekend for a five-day total of $66.1 million. <b>Some</b> <b>analysts</b> {{considered}} these initial numbers disappointing, saying that studio executives {{had been expecting}} more.

The film grossed an additional $332,437,332 in the international box office for a worldwide total of $550,517,357, which not only ranked it in the top five highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, but also helped the film bring back more than {{two and a half times}} its production budget.|$|E

Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J.

5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem.

On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|Raised in Evergreen Park, Illinois, Kaczynski {{was a child}} prodigy {{and entered}} Harvard College {{at the age of}} 16.

After receiving his doctorate at age 25, he became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, but resigned abruptly two years later. As an undergraduate at Harvard, Kaczynski was a research subject in an ethically questionable experiment conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray, which <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> have claimed influenced Kaczynski's later actions.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{season was}} perhaps the most {{historically}} relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen. The 2009 Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16–14 in the fifth set. Upon breaking the Grand Slam tournament record, Federer was hailed by <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> and many tennis greats as the greatest player in tennis history. Federer finished the season as the year end World No.1 for the fifth time in his career.|$|E

5|$|Ukraine {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to participate in}} the Eurasian Economic Union as an observer in August 2013. Viktor Yanukovych's decision to abandon an association agreement with the European Union and exclusively pursue integration with the EEU was a key factor in the Euromaidan protests that ended his term as president of Ukraine and led to the Crimean Crisis. The country's membership in the EEU was seen by <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> as the key {{to the success of the}} union as Ukraine has the second largest economy of any of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union. With high tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the wake of the crisis, Ukraine decided to pursue integration with the EU.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E

5|$|James' playmaking {{ability is}} {{generally}} considered to be one of his premier skills, with <b>some</b> <b>analysts</b> ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history. He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists. Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage, James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013. He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man {{played a significant role in}} the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.|$|E
5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. <b>Some</b> <b>analysts</b> have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E
