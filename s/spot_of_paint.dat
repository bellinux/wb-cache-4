The first three adventurers failed, all coming very near the mark, but neither touching it. The fourth person who presented himself was the Quartermaster, who, after going through his usual attitudes, so far succeeded as to carry away {{a small portion of the}} head of the nail, planting his bullet by the side of its point. This was not considered an extraordinary shot, though it brought the adventurer within the category.|$|E
5000|$|Along with Dickinson, Ford {{helped shape}} Biala's {{aesthetic}} vision by encouraging her spirit of experimentation, devotion to creative freedom, and the seeking of poetic truth in preference to literal facts. From both men she absorbed {{a passion for}} eliminating unnecessary detail. Dickinson emphasized areas of color, which he called [...] "spots," [...] {{as the starting point}} for a painting. He spoke of [...] "two spots being pulled up together, which is, of course, necessary because there's no such thing as one color. They all exist in harmonious common relationships." [...] In 1937 Biala enlarged upon this thought in a rare public statement on art. She said [...] "The very first <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> you put on your canvas sets the note for everything that must follow. Just as in writing a novel ... no word or phrase must be there just because you happen to like it, so each <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> in your picture must lead up to some definite movement and must connect with every other <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> in the picture. Because red is not red itself, its full quality of redness only becomes apparent when it has green beside it or the full quality of green is brought out only when it has purple beside it and so forth. Then against the color you play your forms, lines, and texture." [...] The occasion for the lecture was a visit to Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan, where Ford had been appointed writer and critic in residence. In January 1937 Biala had exhibited paintings and drawings at the Georgette Passedoit Gallery in New York. In August the show was mounted at the Denver Art Museum in Colorado, and in November she brought it to Olivet when Ford began his residency there.|$|E
5000|$|Wau {{is a town}} in New Guinea, in the {{province}} of Morobe situated {{at one end of the}} Wau-Bulolo Valley. It was the site of a gold rush during the 1920s and 1930s. Gold prospectors arrived at the coast at Salamaua and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track. The miners partially cleared the area and built houses and workshops, and established a water supply and an electricity grid. They constructed the aerodromes at Wau and Bulolo which were the primary means of reaching the Wau-Bulolo Valley. Wau aerodrome was a rough Kunai grass airstrip 3100 ft in length with a 10 per cent slope heading directly for Mount Kaindi. Aircraft could approach from the north east only, landing uphill and taking off downhill. The mountain at the end of the runway prevented second attempts at landing and precluded extension of the strip. Pilots had to manoeuvre Dakotas under clouds and through dangerous passes, [...] "dodging a peak here and cloud there", landing at high speeds. This required good visibility, but the weather over Owen Stanley Range was characterised by frequent storms, vertical drafts, and mists which rose from the jungle floor. The first landing at Wau was made by Ernest Mustard in his De Havilland DH.37 on 19 April 1927. Osmar White, who reached Wau in June 1942, wrote: and Bulolo were towns built sole by virtue of man's conquest of the air. Every nail, sheet of iron, weatherboard, <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> pane of glass, crock, wire or sheet of paper was carried in by air at freight rates between 4d and 1/5d per pound. The wrecked trucks that now dotted the highways, rusted out and twisted by fire, were brought in by air. The billiard tables at the hotels were brought in by air. Easy chairs, refrigerators, bathtubs, stoves, dynamos, linoleum, carpets, garden statuary, even great mining dredges, bulldozers and power shovels—all were brought in by air, and this in a decade when most people in Australia were still thinking it adventurous to take a five-minute joy ride over an airfield.|$|E

The principle conclusions from the analysis are: UV exposure degraded the surface resin <b>of</b> A 276 <b>paint,</b> with coating solar absorptance increasing with UV exposure; contamination, though detected, was not enough to have adversely affected optical properties; atomic oxygen eroded resin on specimens with incidence angles of up to 100 deg; the erosion <b>of</b> Z 306 <b>paint</b> on leading edge specimens removed a minimum of 10 microns of that coating; and the erosion <b>of</b> A 276 <b>paint</b> at up to 80 deg incidence angle resulted in near original condition solar absorptance readings...|$|R
2500|$|For {{his home}} town <b>of</b> Castelfranco, Giorgione <b>painted</b> the Castelfranco Madonna, an altarpiece in sacra conversazione form—Madonna enthroned, with saints on either side forming an {{equilateral}} triangle. This gave the landscape background an importance which marks an innovation in Venetian art, and was quickly followed by his master Giovanni Bellini and others. Giorgione began to use the very refined chiaroscuro called sfumato—the delicate use of shades of color to depict light and perspective—around {{the same time as}} Leonardo. [...] Whether Vasari is correct in saying he learned it from Leonardo's works is unclear—he is always keen to ascribe all advances to Florentine sources. Leonardo's delicate color modulations result from the tiny disconnected <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> that he probably derived from Illuminated manuscript techniques and first brought into oil painting. These gave Giorgione's works the magical glow of light for which they are celebrated.|$|R

50|$|Vessels of a third, post-1300 {{tradition}} {{is classified as}} Galisteo Black-on-white (AD 1300-1400). The interior slip is thick, white, often pearly, and distinctly “crackled.” Sherds of Galisteo Black-on-white are further distinguished from Santa Fe and Wiyo Black-on-white by having a darker core or “carbon streak” when viewed in cross-section. Angular crushed sherd temper is prominent. Bowl decorations are on the interiors only (Wilson 2005:34). Rim ticking (widely spaced <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> on rims) occurs, suggesting a possible link to earlier white wares of the Mesa Verde region. Hawley (1950:69) asserted that in the central and western portion of its range, Galisteo Black-on-white “is so similar to Mesa Verde Black on White {{that it can be}} distinguished only by detailed observations.” A somewhat cruder local variant with soft paste, Rowe Black-on-white, was made in the upper Santa Fe and upper Pecos drainages (Hawley 1950:69; Wilson 2005:35).|$|R

2500|$|Cross's {{paintings}} of the early- to mid-1890s are characteristically Pointillist, with closely and regularly positioned tiny dots of color. Beginning around 1895, he gradually shifted his technique, instead using broad, blocky brushstrokes and leaving small areas of exposed bare canvas between the strokes. The resulting surfaces resembled mosaics, and the paintings {{may be seen as}} precursors to Fauvism and Cubism. In the Pointillist style, minute <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> were used to blend colors harmoniously; in contrast, the strategy in [...] "second generation Neo-Impressionism" [...] was to keep the colors separate, resulting in [...] "vibrant shimmering visual effects through contrast". Cross stated that the Neo-Impressionists were [...] "far more interested in creating harmonies of pure color, than in harmonizing the colors of a particular landscape or natural scene". Matisse and other artists were very influenced by the late-career Cross, and such works were instrumental in forming the principles of Fauvism. Among the other artists influenced by Cross were André Derain, Henri Manguin, Charles Camoin, Albert Marquet, Jean Puy, and Louis Valtat.|$|R

The diffractometer consists of a θ − θ goniometer, a Cu X-ray tube (MAGPRO® 60  kV, 12  W/ 200  μA) and an SDD detector; the latter can also be used for XRF. The X-ray beam size is 2  mm in diameter; typical scan range (2 θ) 30 – 70 °; step size 0.1 °/ 3  s, minimum 0.02 °; FWHM of Si (111) =  0.65 ° in 2 θ; typical measurement time 40  min.

60|$|Harry Prendergast and {{his brother}} looked in astonishment at the massive walls that rose around the {{eminence}} on which the temple had stood. The latter had disappeared, but its situation could be traced on the plateau buttressed by the walls. These were of immense thickness, and formed of huge adobe bricks almost as hard as stone; even the long efforts of the Spaniards had caused but little damage to them. The plateau rose some five hundred feet above the sea, which almost washed one face of it. Half-way up the hill four series of these massive walls, whose tops formed terraces, stood in giant steps some fifty feet high. Here and there <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> red <b>paint</b> could be seen, showing that the whole surface was originally painted. The ascent was made by winding passages through the walls. On {{the side of the}} upper area facing the sea could be seen the remains of a sort of walk or esplanade, with traces of edifices of various kinds. On a hill {{a mile and a half}} away were the remains of the Incas' temple and nunnery, the style differing materially from that of the older building; it was still more damaged than the temple on the hill by the searchers for treasure.|$|R
30|$|The XRF spectra were {{recorded}} with an ARTAX- 200  μ-XRF spectrometer (Bruker), {{equipped with a}} molybdenum X-ray tube, an integrated CCD camera with sample illumination and laser spot, a silicon drift detector with a resolution of < 150  eV and a 0.65  mm collimator. The X-ray tube was operated at 50  kV and 700  μA with an integration time of 90  s. Prior to the current study, the effect of helium atmosphere on the detection of low-Z elements {{was carried out by}} measuring various <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> the <b>painting</b> with and without helium flush. The spectra did not demonstrate any difference in the intensity of the low-Z elements, presumably due to the thick layer of varnish on the surface of Ecce Homo, which significantly attenuated the signal of light elements. Therefore, all XRF measurements were carried out in air atmosphere with a molybdenum filter. The energy to channel calibration was performed with a bronze standard, using the Cu- and Sn-Kα lines; the Mn-Kα line of a manganese standard was used for the FWHM calibration. The obtained XRF spectra demonstrated variable intensities of Pb Lα, Cu Kα, Hg Lα, Mn Kα and Fe Kα lines. The net areas of these lines were evaluated to study distributions of lead, copper, mercury, manganese and iron across the painting surface. The spectra acquisition and evaluation were performed with the Spectra 5.3 software.|$|R

That darkening of the foreground {{to bring out the}} white cloud, is, in one aspect of it, a type of the subjection of all plain and positive fact, to what is uncertain and unintelligible. And, as we examine farther into the matter, we shall be struck by another great difference between the old and modern landscape, namely, that in the old no one ever thought of drawing anything but as well as he could. That might not be well, as {{we have seen in the}} case of rocks; but it was as well as he could, and always distinctly. Leaf, or stone, or animal, or man, it was equally drawn with care and clearness, and its essential characters shown. If it was an oak tree, the acorns were drawn; if a flint pebble, its veins were drawn; if an arm of the sea, its fish were drawn; if a group of figures, their faces and dresses were drawn--to the very last subtlety of expression and end of thread that could be got into the space, far off or near. But now our ingenuity is all [...] "concerning smoke." [...] Nothing is truly drawn but that; all else is vague, slight, imperfect; got with as little pains as possible.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{observation}} of a nonhysteretic dc and ac Josephson effect in break junctions obtained at 4. 2 K in high-quality, high-density polycrystalline metallic MgB 2 samples recently reported by us (1). Shapiro steps spaced by the ideal dV value were observed by microwave irradiation and we obtained the temperature {{dependence of the}} dc Josephson current {{as well as the}} dependence on microwave power of the step heights. Besides giving direct proof of the existence of pairs with charge 2 e in MgB 2 and of the SNS long weak-link character of these junctions, these results provide information on the energy gap. Josephson data are consistent with a dirty-limit gap Delta~ 4 meV with Tc~ 27 K in agreement with the two-band model of superconductivity in MgB 2. In different experiments we studied the behaviour in voltage and temperature of the dynamic conductance of normal metal-MgB 2 junctions obtained either by using the point-contact technique (with Au and Pt tips) or by making a <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> Ag <b>paint</b> on the sample surface. The conductance curves presented clear Andreev reflection features and were fitted with the generalized BTK model giving evidence of pure s-wave gap symmetry and of a temperature dependency of the gap in dirty limit which follows the standard BCS curve. Out-of-plane, high-pressure point-contact junctions showed almost ideal Andreev reflection characteristics from which the small 3 D gap in the clean limit Delta 3 D = 2. 6 ± 0. 2 meV and its temperature dependency were obtained, once more in agreement with the two-band model for MgB 2.

50|$|Using {{a primer}} on {{surfaces}} {{made of plastic}} is only necessary when making a drastic change of color (going from dark brown to white, for example), because most household plastics are not very porous and are not easily damaged by moisture; or when a long-lasting coat <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> is desired. A primer will reduce the number <b>of</b> layers <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> necessary to completely cover the previous color, and will help the paint make a thorough bond with the surface being painted. Because most paints and primers designed {{to be used for}} painting plastics are not water based, an important point for choosing a primer for plastic is making sure the primer's propellant or solvent will not dissolve or warp the plastic part itself (e.g. most common household spray paint will damage polystyrene foam). Both the primer and paint should be tested on a small hidden <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> the part being painted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Granular {{computing}} {{and fuzzy}} sets concepts are proposed {{here as a}} novel method to process speckle images stacks in a fast and natural way. Speckle images are the result of scanning a phenomenon that occurs when a beam of coherent light illuminates a sample in which there is any type of activity, not visible, which produces a pattern variable in time. This process has been applied to the drying <b>of</b> <b>paints</b> without contact. The proposed methodology evaluates the intensity variations, considering the uncertainties proper of the phenomenon, being necessary only few images to characterize the activity. In many manufacturing processes it is of great importance the automation of the thickness evaluation in fresh film coatings. Examples about drying <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> process and activity images in paint layers are presented. The results obtained show that this methodology requires less information and computational efforts than the usual methods and also allows almost real time processing. This granular computing approach should be of interest in automatic processes, adding quality test <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> fresh films to improve the performance <b>of</b> the <b>painting</b> tasks...|$|R
