40|$|The {{fascinating}} way nature {{relies on}} biomolecules, mostly proteins and sometimes RNA, {{to carry out}} sophisticated chemical processes led {{to more and more}} efforts to use the concepts of biology for preparing efficient chiral catalysts. The “hybrid catalyst” approach that combines the steric information derived from a protein scaffold with the catalytic activity of transition metal complexes offers a resourceful means of developing semisynthetic metalloenzymes for enantioselective applications. Since the discovery of nucleic acids with enzyme-like functions, the catalytic potential of nucleic acids is being revealed by in vitro selection and evolution of novel ribozymes and DNAzymes. Nucleic acids, especially RNA, appear to be versatile catalysts capable of accelerating a broad range of reactions and exquisitely discriminating between chiral targets. However, while proteins dominated the construction of hybrid catalysts, the application of DNA and RNA in asymmetric catalysis has hardly been explored. This work aimed at exploring the chirality of nucleic acids and generating hybrid catalysts based on DNA and RNA. Towards the development of metallo-(deoxy) ribozymes assisted by combinatorial strategies (e. g., SELEX), a straightforward synthetic way of embedding transition metal complexes in nucleic acids folds was established. DNA sequences carrying mono- and bidentate phosphine ligands as well as P,N-ligands were successfully prepared starting from amino-modified oligonucleotide precursors. The optimized “convertible nucleoside” approach allowed the parallel, high-yielding synthesis of various alkylamino-DNA conjugates differing in length and structure of the <b>spacer.</b> <b>Coupling</b> of amino-oligonucleotides with PYRPHOS, BINAP and PHOX ligands equipped with a carboxyl group led to the incorporation of phosphine moieties at predetermined internal sites. Moreover, the stability of the DNA-tethered BINAP and PHOX was reasonably high, which makes them attractive candidates for the development of transition metal-containing oligonucleotides. To this end, systematic studies on the behavior of phosphine- and PHOX-metal complexes in aqueous medium - a prerequisite of nucleic acid catalysts - were carried out. Two model organometallic transformations were selected that were compatible with the structure and chemistry of nucleic acids. The rhodium(I) -catalyzed 1, 4 -addition of phenyl boronic acid to 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one and iridium(I) -catalyzed allylic amination of the branched phenyl allyl acetate, respectively, proceeded efficiently in the presence of phosphorus-based ligands, in aqueous medium, at room temperature and low catalyst concentration. For the first model reaction, the best conversion (80 %) was achieved with the isolated [Rh(nbd) BINAP]BF 4 complex, in 6 : 1 dioxane/water, and TEA additive. On the basis of these data, a suitable system for assessing the catalytic potential of the DNA-BINAP ligand was implemented. In the second chosen reaction the in situ formed Ir(I) -PHOX complexes (0. 05 - 0. 1 mM) gave rise to racemic, branched allylic amination products in good yields (33 - 75 %), in 3 : 7 dioxane/water. Kinetic resolution of the racemic substrate was then attempted by employing catalysts generated from the [Ir(cod) Cl] 2 precursor and single- and double-stranded DNA-PHOX conjugates. Good conversions were obtained in the presence of G-poor DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA hybrids bearing the PHOX moiety, indicating a potential role of the G-N 7 site in the first coordination sphere. With all tested DNA-PHOX conjugates, the levels of enantioselectivity remained modest. The results described in this work provide useful information for understanding the influence of nucleic acid sequence and covalent tethering on the reaction outcome. These are the first reported applications of DNA-based ligands in organometallic catalysis and they build the fundamentals for further development of selective nucleic acid catalysts, by means of rational design and in vitro selection approaches...|$|E

40|$|Spin {{arrangement}} at interfaces in a layered {{magnetic material}} often {{has an important}} effect on {{the properties of the}} material. In exchange-biased ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic systems, the interfacial spin arrangement is believed {{to play an important role}} in appearance of exchange bias. Due to the interfacial exchange coupling, the spin arrangement at the interface can strongly affect the spin configuration in the ferromagnetic layer. As part of this thesis, investigations have been performed on domain wall nucleation and behavior during magnetization reversal in a series of exchange-biased ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayers with in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropies using magnetometry and magnetic force microscopy. From these investigations, useful information has been obtained on the interfacial arrangement and its effect on the magnetization reversal in the exchange- biased ferromagnetic layer. ^ Interlayer exchange coupling is a general feature that exists in ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic metallic (insulating) spacer/ferromagnetic systems with in-plane anisotropy. The coupling oscillates between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic as a function of thickness of metallic spacers, but decays monotonically as a function of thickness of insulating <b>spacers.</b> Interlayer exchange <b>coupling</b> also exists in ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic metallic spacer/ferromagnetic systems with perpendicular anisotropy. However, for insulating spacers, observation of out-of-plane interlayer exchange coupling is scarce. In this thesis, out-of-plane interlayer exchange coupling has been investigated in two Pt/Co multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy separated by NiO <b>spacers.</b> Strong antiferromagnetic <b>coupling</b> has been observed when the NiO spacer is very thin, and the coupling oscillates between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic as a function of the NiO thickness. This oscillatory behavior has been ascribed to the antiferromagnetic ordering of NiO spacers. Oscillatory behavior has also been observed as a function of the Pt thickness. ...|$|R

Several factors affecting this reaction, such as pH, temperature, and concentrations of substrates were investigated. The results indicated good enzyme-binding efficiency of the pre-treated membrane, and an increased stability of the immobilized PGA towards pH and temperature. Calculation of the activation energies showed that cephalexin production by the immobilized biocatalyst was limited by diffusion, resulting in a decrease of enzyme activity and substrate affinity. Temperature gradients were employed as a way to reduce the effects of diffusion limitation. Cephalexin was found to linearly increase with the applied temperature gradient. A temperature difference of about 3 °C across the catalytic membrane resulted into a cephalexin synthesis increase of 100 % with a 50 % reduction of the production times.

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight proteins (LMWPs) {{are known to}} be reabsorbed and catabolized primarily by the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys. As such, LMWPs might serve as drug carriers that release drugs site-specifically in the kidney. We tested this concept in vitro by coupling different drugs to the LMWP lysozyme both directly (amide bond) and via different spacers: oligopeptides (amide bond), (poly-) alpha-hydroxy acids (ester bond), and a pH sensitive cis-aconityl spacer (amide bond). The capability of the kidney to release the parent drug from such drug-spacer derivatives and drug-LMWP conjugates by enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis of the bond was tested by incubation experiments in renal cortex homogenates and lysosomal lysates. Directly coupled conjugates of terminal carboxyl group containing drugs and lysozyme were catabolized to single amino acids, but did not result in release of the parent drug. The amide bond between the drug and the final amino acid (lysine) appeared to be stable in the incubation milieu. Different oligopeptide <b>spacers</b> <b>coupled</b> to the drugs showed similar results: the oligopeptide itself was cleaved but the amide bond between the drug and different single amino acids remained untouched. Only amide bonds of derivatives of carboxylic drugs with peptide structures themselves were cleaved. Some of the directly coupled conjugates of terminal amino drugs and oligopeptides showed clear release of the parent drug whereas others were stable. Terminal amino drugs were rapidly released from an acid-sensitive cis-aconityl spacer. Terminal carboxyl group containing drugs were enzymatically released from their glycolic and lactic ester spacers at different rates. These kinds of drugs were also released as parent drug from LMWP conjugates with ester spacers like L-lactic acid. Increasing spacer length by intercalating a tetra(L-lactic acid) molecule between the drug and the protein further increased the extent and rate of drug release, indicating increased accessability of the bond to the enzymes. Terminal amino group containing drugs were rapidly generated as parent drug from LMWP conjugates using an acid-sensitive spacer. In addition the conjugates were found to be adequately stable in plasma, considering their rapid clearance from the bloodstream. It is concluded that LMWPs may indeed be of use as carriers for specific renal delivery of drugs, since renal cortex homogenates and lysosomal lysates are able to catabolize the protein and generate the parent drug from drug-LMWP conjugates bearing suitable spacers. The option of enzymatic release is limited by the narrow specificity of the lysosomal enzymes. This has profound implications for the synthesis of suitable conjugates, since the nature of the drug itself, the type of bond, and also spacer length largely determine whether release of the parent drug will occur. Tailor-made spacers containing the correct mode of attachment and the right spacer length are required for this option. Chemical hydrolysis, using acid-sensitive linkers, is suggested as a viable alternative approach...|$|R

Despite many years of intensive research materials used to fabricate synthetic implants still cause clot formation in the bloodstream, which can have fatal consequences for the patient. Currently, the most promising strategy to fabricate non-thrombogenic materials is covering the implant surface {{with a layer of}} endothelial cells. Endothelial cells can be applied onto the synthetic implant before the procedure (in vitro endothelialization) or can be recruited from the bloodstream and the surrounding areas (in situ endothelialization).

Converting BBN[6 - 13] to a diagnostic imaging agent or one for radiotherapy includes radiolabeling of a chelating agent that is coupled to the peptide through a spacer. The carbon-based spacer is important for the affinity between the receptor and the peptide along with the efficiency of the chelating agent to form a conjugate with the peptide. To explore the efficiency, the acetyl (C 2) and hexanoyl (C 6) <b>spacers</b> were <b>coupled</b> to BBN[6 - 13]. BBN[6 - 13] was first manually synthesized through solid phase peptide synthesis.

40|$|The Anderson {{model of}} local-state {{conduction}} electron mixing {{is applied to}} the problem of interlayer magnetic coupling in metallic multilayered structures with palladium (Pd) spacer layers. An oscillation period of 5 spacer monolayers and the tendency towards ferromagnetic bias of the interlayer magnetic coupling that we obtain are consistent with the experimental data. The discovery of oscillatating interlayer magnetic couplings between ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic metallic spacer [1] and of the related giant magnetoresistance effect [2], has stimulated a lot of experimental and theoretical activity. It has been shown that the periods of the coupling are related to the topology of the Fermi surface of the spacer layers. This interpretation has been confirmed by model and first-principles calculations, and is also supported by experiments [3, 4]. There are, however, other aspects of the coupling, e. g., the bias (ferro- or antiferro-magnetic) of the interlayer magnetic coupling, which have not been fully explained. For Fe(001) layers separated by Pd(001) spacers of thickness between 4 and 12 ML the interlayer magnetic coupling is observed to have a strong ferromagnetic bias as seen in the experiments [5]. Above a 13 ML thickness of the Pd <b>spacer</b> the <b>coupling</b> begins to be antiferromagnetic. Metallic Pd is believed to be near the threshold of becoming ferromagnetic. The non-relativistic calculations of Moruzzi and Marcus [6] and of Chen et al. [7] predicted the onset of ferromagnetism in fcc palladium with a 5 % expanded lattice. In a recent publication the ferromagnetic bias of the coupling in magnetic multilayer structures with a Pd spacer is explained in terms of the Pd as an almost ferromagnetic media [3]. Alternatively, in this paper, we interpret this ferromagnetic bias to be a consequence of a competition between RKKY-like and superexchange couplings, with RKKY coupling being dominant. The RKKY-like coupling comes from intermediate states which correspond to spin excitations of the Fermi sea. States corresponding to electron-hole pair production in the Fermi sea, with an attendant spin-flip, contribute to the RKKY coupling as [8]; jRKKY (q) = ∑ n 1,n 2,...|$|R

40|$|The {{scattering}} of photons from spin waves (Brillouin light scattering [...] BLS) is a well-established technique {{for the study}} of layered magnetic systems. The information about the magnetic state and properties of the sample is contained in the frequency position, width, and intensity of the BLS peaks. Previously [Phys. Rev. B 67, 184404 (2003) ], we have shown that spin wave frequencies can be conveniently calculated within the ultrathin film approach, treating the intralayer exchange as an effective bilinear interlayer coupling between thin virtual sheets of the ferromagnetic layers. Here we give the consequent extension of this approach to the calculation of the Brillouin light scattering (BLS) peak intensities. Given the very close relation of the BLS cross-section to the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), the depth-resolved longitudinal and polar MOKE coefficients calculated numerically via the usual magneto-optic formalism can be employed in combination with the spin wave precessional amplitudes to calculate full BLS spectra for a given magnetic system.

Although the uPCU did not promote EC growth over a 5 day period, the early (30 minutes) adhesion and spreading behaviour on this surface was comparable to that of some modified surfaces which gave good promotion of EC growth in the longer term studies. Adhesion, but not spreading data at 4 hours gave a good correlation with the longer term studies of EC growth on the polymer surfaces.

The effective Landé g-factor, extrinsic linewidth, and Gilbert relaxation rate are all found to decrease in magnitude with increasing sample growth temperature from 20 oC to about 400 – 500 oC and then on further increase of the growth temperature to increase in magnitude. Samples grown at about 400 – 450 oC display the smallest coercivity, while the smallest value of the Gilbert relaxation rate of about 0. 1 GHz is obtained for samples grown at 450 – 500 oC. An almost linear relation between extrinsic linewidth and coercivity is observed, which suggests a positive correlation between magnetic inhomogeneity, coercivity and extrinsic linewidth. Another major discovery in this study is that the Gilbert relaxation decreases with increasing lattice constant, which is ascribed to the degree of structural order in the films. A micromagnetic model is established for an asymmetric trilayer system consisting of two different ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by thin non-magnetic (NM) layer, treating the magnetization in each FM layer as a macrospin. Based on the model, numerical simulations of magnetization curves and FMR dispersion relations, of both the acoustic mode where magentizations in the two FM layers precess in phase and the optic mode where they precess out-of-phase, have been carried out. The most significant implication from the results is that the coupling strength can be extracted by detecting only the acoustic mode resonances at many different unsaturated magnetic states using broadband FMR technique. Finally, trilayer films of FeCo(100 Å) /NM/FeNi(100 Å) with NM=Ru or Cu were prepared and studied. The thickness of the Ru and Cu spacer was varied from 0 to 50 Å. For the Ru spacer series, the film with 10 Å Ru <b>spacer</b> shows antiferromagnetic <b>coupling</b> while all other films are ferromagnetically coupled. For the Cu spacer trilayers, it is found that all films are ferromagnetically coupled and that films with thin Cu spacer are surprisingly strongly coupled (the coupling constant is 3 erg/cm 2 for the sample with 5 Å Cu <b>spacer).</b> The strong <b>coupling</b> strength is qualitatively understood within the framework of a combined effect of Ruderman-Kittel- Kasuya-Yosida interaction and pinhole coupling, which is evidenced by transmission electron microscopy analysis. The magnetic coupling constant decreases exponentially with increasing Cu spacer thickness, without showing an oscillatory thickness dependence. The results have implications for the design of multilayers for spintronic applications...|$|R
40|$|Two {{variants}} of the thermostable beta-glucosidase TnBgl 1 A (wt and N 221 S/P 342 L) from Thermotoga neapolitana were immobilized on acrylic supports (Eupergit (R) C, Eupergit (R) C 250 L, and cryogel) and evaluated at conditions {{close to the}} boiling point of water. Thermo-gravimetric analysis showed the supports to be stable < 250 degrees C. Both wt and N 221 S/P 342 L were covalently bound to oxirane-groups respectively via glutaraldehyde <b>spacers,</b> and for <b>coupling</b> reactions 26 Lys and 20 Ser/Thr were surface-located. Immobilized enzymes were active on all supports in the temperature range 80 - 95 degrees C, but the observed specific activity was low (<= 19 U mg(- 1)) using the cryogel. More than 91 % of the initial activity was maintained after ten times recycling, and the same was recovered after 3 months storage at 4 degrees C for Eupergit (R) supports by simply incubating the preparation with bovine serum albumin. No storage loss was detectable on cryogels. The glutaraldehyde spacer improved activity on cryogels, but not on Eupergie supports. Immobilization on Eupergit (R) C 250 L yielded the highest observed specific activity (254 U mg(- 1) for N 221 S/P 342 L) in a procedure including blocking of free oxirane-groups by BSA. This biocatalyst was used for on-line hydrolysis of quercetin-glucosides in a yellow onion extract at 80 degrees C, proving the immobilized biocatalyst to be promising in on-line systems for extraction and hydrolysis using hot pressurized water.

40|$|Especially in {{the case}} of a {{chelating}} binding mode, it is necessary to find the optimal linker. The results obtained led to the conclusion that, despite the difficulties encountered during the design of a rigid linker, a fixed geometry could bring an enhancement in the affinity and a higher selectivity. The lectin LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an extremely interesting target, not only because of its biological relevance but also for its suitability to study the chelating multivalency effect. Furthermore, the affinity for LecA showed to be dependent on the geometry of the multivalent system and it seemed to be an optimal target to investigate the role of a rigid linker. This thesis covers the design and the synthesis of new rigid spacers used to form divalent systems. The spacer designs were based on a triazole-glucose repeating unit or on phenylene-ethynylene repeating unit. The inhibitors obtained were tested with LecA to evaluate a correlation between rigidity and affinity. The first spacer taken into account was based on a triazole-glucose repeating unit and in Chapter 2 the attempts to synthesize a suitable building block were described. The ideal building block required reproducible and high-yielding reactions. The successfully synthesized building block was used in Chapter 3 to synthesize rigid spacers. The strategy was based on the reiteration of three reactions: copper alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) and introduction of the azide moiety via a triflate. The spacers synthesized were characterized by a different number of units, ranging from 2 to 4. The galactoside ligands <b>coupled</b> to the <b>spacers</b> exhibited different degrees of freedom. Furthermore, a PEG-based divalent system was synthesized as a flexible reference to compare with the rigid systems. The divalent inhibitors obtained were evaluated with lectin LecA. In Chapter 4 a different spacer design is described. The repeating unit was based, this time, on a phenylene-ethynylene moiety. The syntheses of the building blocks is described. The strategy consisted of alternating Sonogashira reactions and silyl-protecting group removal. The spacers obtained contained two to five phenylene-ethynylene unit. The three-unit <b>spacer</b> was <b>coupled</b> to a galactoside ligand and its potency as a LecA inhibitor was determined. In the last chapter, Chapter 5, a new and faster strategy to build rigid spacers based on the triazole-glucose unit is described. To increase the solubility of the protected spacer a new building block containing a silyl group was synthesized. The three different length spacers, from two to four units, were coupled with galactose ligands with different aglycon chains. Their inhibitiory potencies were tested with LecA and, for some compounds, also the Kd values were determined by ITC in selected cases...|$|R
30|$|To {{separate}} {{and analyze the}} part of the dependence Hcpart(T), which is driven by changes in the strength and sign of the interlayer coupling (HJ), the coercivity of the simulated M(H) is plotted versus HJ in Fig.  5 c. Thus, obtained Hcsim vs T depends on the ratio between the effective anisotropy fields of the F 1 and F 2 layers, Ha 1 /Ha 2. The larger the deviation of Ha 1 /Ha 2 from unity, the deeper the minimum and bigger its offset from zero field on the FM side of the diagram (HJ[*]<[*] 0). When the anisotropy fields are equal (Ha 1 /Ha 2 [*]=[*] 1), the minimum is not present. This behavior is similar to the difference between Hcpart*(T) for the structures with uniform and composite spacers with large dCr (≥[*] 4  nm) [blue and black curves in Fig.  5 b, respectively]. This indicates that these two types of spacers transmit the interlayer coupling between the two outer Fe layers differently. In the uniform spacer, direct FM exchange competes with indirect AFM exchange, at some temperature compensating it such that HJ[*]=[*] 0. This case is well described by our model, where the F 1 and F 2 layers have different anisotropy fields [blue curve in Fig.  5 c]. In contrast, the Fe layers in the structure with the composite <b>spacer</b> are FM <b>coupled</b> at low temperature sequentially through Fe/Cr/FeCr and FeCr/Cr/Fe, with the spacers’ FeCr inner layer is in FM state. Since this FeCr layer acts as an addition exchange link, the spacer transmits exchange {{in such a way as}} to effectively equalize the coercivity of the outer Fe layers [black curve in Fig.  5 c]. When the FeCr layer is in its paramagnetic state, the system behaves similar to the one with the uniform spacer [high-temperature part of the Hcpart* vs T dependence in Fig.  5 b and the AFM side of Hcsim vs T (HJ[*]>[*] 0) in Fig.  5 c].|$|R

Further testing confirmed the lateral critical {{speed of the}} pinion was lower than originally designed due to modifications applied while the gear unit was in the test stand, which were aimed at lowering bearing pad operating temperatures under full load field conditions. The lateral critical speed was seen to increase as expected by sequentially removing the <b>coupling</b> <b>spacer,</b> adapter plate, and the hub. However, resulting vibration measurements showed a resonance remained near running speed. Impact testing pointed to a structural, resonant axial motion of the gear case near rated operating speed. Finite element analyses of the gear unit confirmed the existence of two structural resonances with endwall breathing mode shapes near pinion speed. Excitation {{of one of these}} modes was provided by coupling unbalance on the rotating pinion shaft that demonstrated cross-coupling of radial forces due to unbalance and axial structural motions. The near coincidence of the structural resonance and the lateral critical speed on the test stand provided vibration amplification above that normally expected due to either resonant condition alone. Amplification factors were moderate and significant overlap occurred between the flanks of the two resonances. A two-step solution was implemented to increase the resonant frequencies of both the shaft in its oil film bearings and the gear case end walls. First, a bearing clearance and preload modification were applied along with additional hot oil removal techniques. Second, a tie bar brace was added above and parallel to the pinion between the end walls of the upper section of the gear case to increase structural stiffness in an axial direction. Additional rotordynamic and finite element analyses predicted significantly improved response to unbalance. The bearing and structural modifications were installed and tested sequentially. These tests, under similar conditions as previously imposed on the unit for qualification and acceptance, were successful in proving the solution. This paper documents measured vibrations at various stages in the investigation, results of rotordynamic and finite element analyses, bearing and gear case modifications, and final successful tests...|$|R
40|$|Spin {{transfer}} torque {{induced magnetization}} switching has recently attracted much interest {{due to its}} potential applications in {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM), fast programmable logic, high-density magnetic storage devices, magnetic sensors and in high frequency devices for telecommunications. Magnetic storage devices and magnetic sensors based on Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) and Tunnelling Magnetoresistance (TMR) effects require high quality multilayers constructed out of ultrathin ferromagnetic and non-magnetic films. The performance of these devices strongly depend on the morphological and structural properties of the films and their physical characteristics. Among them, the crucial factors the interlayer coupling between the two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic <b>spacer.</b> Various interlayer <b>coupling</b> mechanisms have been reported. Among them, pinhole coupling, orange peel coupling, biquadratic coupling and RKKY coupling are important ones. These interlayer couplings {{play an important role in}} the understanding of magnetization switching mechanism and GMR of spin valves and TMR of magnetic tunnel junction structures. We have done a systematic and in-depth study about the effect of interlayer coupling that arises due to the interface roughness namely orange peeling coupling and biquadratic coupling on spin transfer torque magnetization switching in trilayer and pentalayer nanopillar structures. Our study started with an investigation on the impact of orange peel coupling on the magnetization switching in the trilayer nanopillar structure. Then, we studied the effect of biquadratic coupling on magnetization switching in trilayer structure. Further, the study was extended to pentalayer nanopillar structure and we studied the effect of both orange peeling coupling and biquadratic coupling on spin transfer torque magnetization switching. In order to have a better understanding of the effect orange peel coupling, we also studied the influence of free layer thickness and spacer layer thickness on the switching time in the case of both trilayer and pentalayer structures. Likewise, to understand the effect of biquadratic coupling, we have investigated the influence of spacer layer thickness and roughness on the switching time in the case of trilayer and pentalayer nanopillar structures. Further, we have investigated the effect of biasing on spin transfer torque magnetization switching in the pentalayer structure, in order to reduce the switching time and critical current density required to initiate the magnetization switching...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and explains {{the effect of}} structure, dilution, anisotropy and temperature on the exchange bias effect in metallic ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) thin films. The exchange bias effect appears at the interface between a FM and an AFM when the FM/AFM bilayer is either deposited or cooled below the Néel temperature of the AFM, {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. The effect manifests itself in a shifted and broadened hysteresis loop of the FM/AFM bilayer along the field axis direction. This is the consequence of the unidirectional anisotropy induced in the FM layer which results from the exchange coupling across the FM/AFM interface. Despite intensive research activities in this field, many aspects of exchange bias are not yet fully understood. This refers also to the role of structure, dilution by nonmagnetic defects, anisotropy and temperature on the exchange bias of metallic FM/AFM bilayers. However, the exchange bias is used in many applications such as spin valves, read heads, magnetic random access memories, etc, for pinning the magnetization of a FM layer in a certain direction. The thesis is organized in 8 chapters. First, an introduction is given in chapter 1. This is followed in chapter 2 by a review of the existing exchange bias theories from the discovery to the current models, with the emphasis on the domain state model. A brief description of some of the experimental techniques that were used is given in chapter 3. The central part of the thesis, chapter 4, addresses the domain state model for metallic FM/AFM bilayers, both from an experimental and Monte Carlo simulation point of view. Experimentally, we tested the domain state model for two metallic FM/AFM systems: NiFe/FeMn and CoFe/IrMn. The metallic AFMs FeMn and IrMn have low and intermediate magnetic anisotropy, respectively, polycrystalline structure, and Néel temperatures above room temperature. Lattice matched Cu dilution was used both for FeMn and IrMn. Our experimental results showed that the presence of Cu dilution throughout the volume of the AFM gives rise to a domain state and to an enhanced exchange bias field. This is in agreement with the initially proposed domain state model for high-anisotropy and epitaxial AFM CoO. The thermoremanent magnetization of the diluted AFM (without FM in contact) showed qualitatively similar dilution and temperature dependencies to those of the exchange bias field of the FM/AFM bilayers. These observations are also in agreement with the domain state model and indicate that the domain state magnetization is at the origin of exchange bias in the systems under consideration. The initially proposed domain state model was extended for describing the EB properties of metallic, polycrystalline AFMs with low and intermediate anisotropies, such as FeMn and IrMn. For this purpose Monte Carlo simulations were performed using a Heisenberg type AFM which accounts for the three-dimensional rotation of the magnetic moments. The granular structure of the AFM, the energy barriers upon reversal of the AFM moments and the thermal relaxation in the AFM were included in the model. The influence of various parameters, such as temperature, dilution, AFM grain size, etc. on exchange bias and thermoremanent magnetization was tested within the adapted domain state model. We found a good agreement between the experimental data and the Monte Carlo simulations which suggests that the adapted domain state model can be successfully applied to metallic, low and intermediate anisotropy AFMs. In chapter 5 the thermally activated reversal and the blocking temperature distribution in CoFe/IrMn bilayers are investigated. It is shown that the blocking temperature distribution measured at 5 K is mainly given by the contribution of the isolated uncompensated moments in the AFM. This is in agreement with our Monte Carlo simulations from chapter 4 where an average blocking temperature of about 10 - 2 K was estimated for the isolated uncompensated moments in the AFM IrMn. The influence of the AFM grain size on the blocking temperature distribution is also investigated. We found that larger crystalline FM/AFM grains give rise to a larger median blocking temperature and to a shifted blocking temperature distribution towards higher temperatures as compared to that of smaller FM/AFM grains. A novel study of the training effect and the temperature dependence of the exchange bias field and coercivity in epitaxial and polycrystalline NiFe/FeMn metallic thin films is presented in chapter 6 of this thesis. We show that the training effect depends on the crystalline structure and epitaxial quality of the AFM FeMn, being larger for the polycrystalline sample and decreasing in magnitude with increasing growth quality of the epitaxial bilayers. The vertical shift of the hysteresis loop (also referred to as the pinned AFM magnetization) is used to estimate the fraction of pinned uncompensated moments per AFM monolayer. We find a very good qualitative agreement between the decrease of the fraction of pinned uncompensated moments of an AFM monolayer and the decrease of the exchange bias field as a function of the hysteresis cycle number. Our estimated maximum values of the fraction of pinned uncompensated moments of an AFM FeMn monolayer (2 - 3 %) are in a good agreement with those determined in literature for other AFMs. Moreover, the magnitude of the exchange bias field and of the coercive field depends strongly on the crystalline structure and epitaxial quality of the bilayers. In chapter 7 we discuss the exchange coupling between an amorphous FM (CoFeB) and a crystalline AFM (IrMn). We show that when the AFM IrMn is deposited on top of the FM CoFeB no exchange coupling appears. On insertion of a thin crystalline FM layer of NiFe between the amorphous CoFeB and the IrMn, exchange bias appears and it is dependent on the thickness of the NiFe layer. Moreover, an enhancement in the blocking temperature of the CoFeB/NiFe/IrMn trilayers is observed on increasing the thickness of the NiFe layer. X-Ray diffractometry measurements show that these effects are directly correlated with the (111) texture in the AFM phase of the IrMn layer, which develops progressively with increasing thickness of the NiFe layer. A thin nonmagnetic spacer layer of Cu or Ru at the NiFe/IrMn interface is found to reduce the exchange coupling and the coercive field of the exchange biased system. The exchange bias field vanishes for nonmagnetic spacers thicker than about 1 nm, indicating that exchange bias is a short-range exchange interaction. We also show and explain the decrease of blocking temperature with increasing thickness of the nonmagnetic <b>spacer.</b> The exchange <b>coupled</b> trilayer CoFeB/NiFe/IrMn is used for inducing an additional source of anisotropy in giant magnetoresistance sensors and magnetic tunnel junctions, by setting its anisotropy in an orthogonal direction with respect to that of the pinned FM layer. We show that the resistance of such a device depends linearly with the external field over a range of more than 200 Oe. This characteristic could be beneficial in different applications which require a linear resistance dependence on the external magnetic field. In chapter 8 the main conclusions of the thesis and some suggestions for further work are presented...|$|R
