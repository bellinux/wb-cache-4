5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged <b>steroid</b> usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the <b>steroid</b> controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and <b>steroid</b> use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole <b>steroid</b> use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E

5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the <b>steroid</b> hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the <b>steroid</b> hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the <b>steroid</b> hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Cyclosporin is used {{in severe}} {{ulcerative}} colitis that is refractory to intravenous <b>steroids.</b> Cyclosporin is a potent immunosuppressant and can cause side effects such as opportunistic infections. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of perioperative complications in patients treated with intravenous cyclosporin and <b>steroids</b> compared with patients treated with intravenous <b>steroids</b> alone. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the case notes of 44 patients with severe ulcerative colitis who underwent total abdominal colectomy and ileostomy. Twenty-five patients were treated with intravenous <b>steroids</b> and 19 patients were treated with intravenous cyclosporin and <b>steroids.</b> Details were recorded with respect to age, length of illness, extent of disease, Truelove and Witt's criteria, hemoglobin and albumin at surgery, surgical procedure, and perioperative morbidity. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of patients treated with intravenous <b>steroids</b> alone and 15. 8 percent of patients treated with intravenous cyclosporin and <b>steroids</b> had major surgical complications. Sixteen percent of patients treated with intravenous <b>steroids</b> alone and 5. 2 percent of patients treated with intravenous cyclosporin and <b>steroids</b> had minor surgical complications. Eight percent of patients treated with intravenous <b>steroids</b> alone and 10. 5 percent of patients treated with intravenous cyclosporin and <b>steroids</b> had major medical complications. There was no mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: There is no increased incidence of perioperative complications {{associated with the use}} of intravenous cyclosporin in addition to <b>steroids</b> in acute severe ulcerative colitis provided cyclosporin treatment is for a defined period and surgery is not delayed...|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of <b>steroid</b> hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens.

The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of <b>steroid</b> hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the {{relevant}} physicochemical properties for the absorption of <b>steroids.</b> Methods. Various physicochemical properties of <b>steroids</b> were calculated (molecular weight, ClogP, static polar surface area [PSA], etc.). Within this series of <b>steroids,</b> different pharmacological groups were defined. Based {{on the outcome of}} this survey, <b>steroids</b> were selected for the Caco- 2 permeability study. The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) were related to the calculated and measured physicochemical properties. Results. Between the defined groups of <b>steroids,</b> ClogP was the most discriminative descriptor. The <b>steroids</b> were well transported over the cell monolayers and the Papp was independent of the concentration and the transport direction. No relationship was found with the PSA; however, the Papp showed a weak inverse correlation with ClogP. Conclusions. The molecular descriptors and Papp values showed that all <b>steroids</b> are well transported. The small differences in the Papp values showed a weak inverse correlation with ClogP: the hydrophilic <b>steroids</b> (ClogP approximately 0 - 2) tend to diffuse faster over the cell monolayers compared with the more hydrophobic <b>steroids</b> (ClogP approximately 5). The relationship with ClogP suggests that partitioning of <b>steroids</b> between the biologic membrane and the surrounding aqueous phase {{is one of the main}} mechanisms for absorption...|$|R
