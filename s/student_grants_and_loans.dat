40|$|In {{the area}} of higher education, the {{relationship}} between the Bologna Process, Union law and national law is tense. This paper analyses that relationship through the lens of <b>student</b> <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans.</b> The Bologna Process is a form of voluntary cooperation between European states including all those of the EU. One of the targets agreed in this process is to double student mobility in 2020 and portability of student grants is a tool to reach that target. In the European Union, higher education and student mobility are also high on the agenda, however targets are not {{similar to those of the}} Bologna Process. <b>Student</b> <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans,</b> indispensable for student mobility, are firmly in the hands of the Member States. Their support systems differ widely according to the national perception of the role of the student in society. Still, financial support needs to be compatible with Union law. This paper looks at how national financial measures are constrained by free movement rights of Union citizens. It argues that this might affect the Bologna target of higher mobility of students and could indirectly lead to social discrimination according to the wealth of the country of origin. The paper concludes with a short discussion of how a European Student Lending Facility might decrease the tension between targets, Union law and financial support and what consequences this might have for social justice and the construction of a European view on the role of the student in society...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the existing design and processes of <b>student</b> <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> and identifies {{the strengths and}} weaknesses on the control mechanism of student grants. A look into the present procedures and control mechanisms of policies concerning scholarships and grants-in-aid (GIAs) is an imperative measure when seeking to reform the delivery of higher education in the country. This can shed light on the reasons why the administration of a public good is efficient or inefficient. Though, the funds for these scholarship programs and grants are expended in the spirit of charity and altruism for the poor and deserving, they are nonetheless from the government and thus, from the taxpayers' pockets. This makes scholarship funds and other subsidies no different from ordinary government procurement that should be expended in a transparent, accountable, and cost-efficient manner ensuring that every centavo is going where it should. Undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate scholarships and GIAs implemented by national government agencies are generally guided by policies and guidelines for the administration and monitoring of the said subsidies through laws, implementing rules and regulations, and department issuances. However, testing is not widely observed by all agencies to ensure that the student is ready and able to complete tertiary education. More importantly, the result of this study shows much can be improved in the institutionalization of policies that would strengthen transparency and accountability and would reduce conflict of interest and vulnerabilities to unethical behavior...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the policies, administrative plans and strategies taken by eight leading Thai private {{institutions of higher education}} to develop equality of educational opportunity for economically disadvantaged college-age people. It also probes into the viewpoints of students, as the real users of higher education, on the ethics of markets in education as well as the possibility of the development of equity in a private university in Thailand. In addition, it explores students' attitudes towards equity in private higher education, socio-economically disadvantaged students and student aid schemes provided by the eight focus institutions. In this study, the researcher applied a mixed-methods approach to elicit data from a range of sources: the government, the eight focus universities and students. The staff participants are university administrators and officers (ten of them in total, at least one and sometimes two from each focus institution) in charge of <b>student</b> <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans.</b> Student participants are divided into two groups: the control group and the focus group. The control group consists of on average 174 students who are non-takers of loans and grants from each institution (1, 390 in total). The focus group is composed of on average 203 students who are loan and grant takers from each university (1, 626 in total). In the research, all student participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire on students' attitudes towards Thai private higher education, designed by the researcher. Face-to-face interviews were also conducted with 35 students from all the focus institutions (four or five from each university). The research findings reveal that it is possible for the eight focus institutions to develop equality of educational opportunity through the application of a variety of student aid programmes, focusing on loans. In this study, it turns out that a student loan programme tends to be able to assist economically disadvantaged students on a larger scale than can a grant or a scholarship scheme. These results are hoped to serve as a guideline for the promotion of equality of educational opportunity, the establishment and improvement of future student aid schemes, as well as the creation and development of a more equitable system in Thai higher education.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the financing of}} tertiary education in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, comparing the affordability and accessibility of tertiary education with that in high-income countries. To measure affordability, the authors estimate education costs, living costs, <b>grants,</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans.</b> Further, they compute the participation rate, attainment rate, and socio-economic equity index in education and the gender equity index as indicators of accessibility. This is the first study attempting to estimate affordability of tertiary education in Latin America within a global context. The analysis combines information from household surveys, expenditure surveys, and administrative and institutional databases. The findings show that families in Latin America have to pay 60 percent of per-capita income for tertiary education per student per year compared with 19 percent in high-income countries. Living costs are significant, at 29 {{percent of gross domestic}} product per capita in Latin America (19 percent in high-income countries). <b>Student</b> assistance through <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> plays a marginal role in improving affordability. Moreover, the paper confirms previous findings of low access to tertiary education in the region. One policy implication of the findings is that Latin American governments could take steps to make tertiary education more affordable through student assistance.

50|$|Division II {{institutions}} have to sponsor {{at least five}} sports for men and five for women, (or four for men and six for women), with two team sports for each gender, and each playing season represented by each gender. There are contest and participant minimums for each sport, as well as scheduling criteria—football and men's and women's basketball teams must play at least 50 percent of their games against Division II or Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) or Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) opponents. For sports other than football and basketball there are no scheduling requirements. There are not attendance requirements for football, nor arena size requirements for basketball. There are maximum financial aid awards for each sport, {{as well as a}} separate limit on financial aid awards in men's sports, that a Division II school must not exceed. Division II teams usually feature a number of local or in-state student-athletes. Many Division II student-athletes pay for school through a combination of scholarship money, <b>grants,</b> <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> employment earnings. Division II athletics programs are financed in the institution's budget like other academic departments on campus. Traditional rivalries with regional institutions dominate schedules of many Division II athletics programs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} three different types of education policies: tuition subsidies (broad based, merit based, <b>and</b> flat tuition), <b>grant</b> subsidies (broad based and merit based), <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> limit restrictions. We develop a quantitative theory of college {{within the context of}} general equilibrium overlapping generations economy. College is modeled as a multi-period risky investment with endogenous enrollment, time-to-degree, and dropout behavior. Tuition costs can be financed using federal <b>grants,</b> <b>student</b> <b>loans,</b> <b>and</b> working while at college. We show that our model accounts for the main statistics regarding education (enrollment rate, dropout rate, and time to degree) while matching the observed aggregate wage premiums. Our model predicts that broad based tuition subsidies <b>and</b> <b>grants</b> increase college enrollment. However, due to the correlation between ability and financial resources most of these new students are from {{the lower end of the}} ability distribution and eventually dropout or take longer than average to complete college. Merit based education policies counteract this adverse selection problem but at the cost of a muted enrollment response. Our last policy experiment highlights an important interaction between the labor-supply margin and borrowing. A significant decrease in enrollment is found to occur only when borrowing constraints are severely tightened and the option to work while in school is removed. This result suggests that previous models that have ignored the student's labor supply when analyzing borrowing constraints may be insufficient. Education - Economic aspects; College costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{project is}} based on whether the students’ {{motivation}} to study {{is influenced by the}} demands of the government with regard to faster completion of the program and the objective of ‘the best-educated generation ever’, at the same time, as they must meet the requirements of the labor market, which requires that you have a good CV with relevant qualifications and skills, and labor market opportunities after graduation and whether there are paradoxes that arise around these requirements. In response to this issue, we want to examine whether the students are being made into ‘soldiers’ in society’s quest for competitiveness, and how they experience these requirements, that the government has for the educational system. According to the requirements which the students have to take into account, both from the government and educational institutions, we will examine whether they experience recognition or lack thereof, by implementing ‘The Recognition Theory’ by Axel Honneth, to investigate if this leads to demotivation. Further, we will also investigate where the students' motivation is based, in connection with their study. Based on our choice of direction in scientific theory, which is Hermeneutics, we have chosen a qualitative method, {{in the form of a}} focus group interview. On the basis of our prior understanding of the topic, as well as our first and second-hand empirical data, we will interpret and thereby gain a deeper understanding of the problem. In our analysis, we discovered that the students from the focus group are very focused on whether they will have job opportunities after graduation, and therefore they support the ‘competition state theory’ that says, that you have to see the community associated to work. We can therefore see that the students, in a certain degree, are in fact ‘soldiers’ for the nation. In terms of the ‘recognition theory’, we see that the students have a lack of recognition as the government reforms and regulates in public services in the form of <b>student</b> <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans,</b> as well as depriving them of their freedom to shape their education at their own request and wishes. In the focus group, we see that the students are still motivated to educate themselves, even though there are many disincentives. These disincentives are expressed when we ask them questions about the reform of the educational funding program also known as ‘SU-reformen’, and the financial crisis. This is seen especially when they express themselves about the paradox with regard to the government's desire for faster implementation of the education, and labor market requirements that you have to have a good CV and how they think the possibilities for getting a job after graduation are. This creates uncertainty among the students and they cannot see the benefit of hurrying through the education system, but the students are actually motivated by the fact that the new reform is increasing the control of study activity. Finally, we can conclude that the students' motivation to study is in fact influenced by the government and the labor market requirements, as they are aware of the paradoxes in educational system...|$|E
