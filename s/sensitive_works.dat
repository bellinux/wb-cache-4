5|$|There is {{no record}} of Goya's {{thoughts}} during this period. He completed the series during a period recuperating from illness, possibly lead poisoning, {{when he was in}} considerable mental and physical pain, and withdrew from public life. Witches' Sabbath is believed to be a rather bitter, but silent, protest against the royalists and clergy who had retaken control of Spain after the Peninsular War of 1807–14. Advocates of the Enlightenment had sought to redistribute land to the peasants, to educate women, publish a vernacular Bible and, by replacing superstition with reason, {{put an end to the}} Inquisition. Witch hunting, seen during the Logroño Inquisition, was an appalling regression to liberals such as Goya. As court painter Goya was a part of the established order; surviving evidence indicates he was acquiesced to the wishes of his patrons. Yet numerous paintings and etchings have emerged since, suggesting he had convictions favouring liberalism, enlightenment, and reason. He seems to have kept such beliefs private, only expressing them in his private art; his more <b>sensitive</b> <b>works</b> were not published at the time, probably for fear of reprisal or persecution. In Witches' Sabbath Goya mocks and ridicules the superstition, fear and irrationality of the ignorant placing their faith in ghouls, quack doctors and tyrants.|$|E

40|$|In an {{electrical}} installation {{at the work}} location de-energizing is {{only one part of}} creating {{an electrical}}ly safe work condition {{for the duration of the}} work. Unexpected sources can occur, specially when working on overhead lines. Some activities are sensitive to the unexpected sources and in these cases, depending on the electrical energy available, these sources could cause injury or death. The paper relates about an fatal injury occurred working on a de-energized overhead line. Generally there is uncertainty about exposure to the unexpected sources. When there is suspect on the electrical energy not negligible, it is wise to add temporary protective measures. Many times, it is a decision made in the field and entrusted to the person performing the work. An essential progress of the safety procedures should be to set concrete guiding criteria at the standard level for detecting by conventional tests at least the steady unexpected sources. This integrative rule could be added to the canonical requirements of de-energized work like last one in order of execution. Consequently in the cases of <b>sensitive</b> <b>works</b> this integrative rule could help for decision making on choosing temporary protective measures additional to the dead working procedure or on adopting the live working procedure. © IEEE 2010...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 As a `cornerstone' of American {{anthropology}} (McFeely, 2001), the A:shiwi, the Pueblo {{people of}} Zuni, New Mexico, have long experienced unsolicited and unwanted documentation of our everyday and ceremonial activities by outsiders. This research explores legal and theoretical applications {{of intellectual property}} rights to protect Indigenous knowledge and examines three projects initiated by the Pueblo aimed at protecting and documenting Zuni history. The cases are tribal resolutions passed by the elected body of the Pueblo, the Map Art Project, and the "Morning Prayer" mural in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Each case represents actions decided upon by groups within the community and are juxtaposed with YouTube videos of Hopi social dances posted by individuals without community discussions prior to the postings. The cases were analyzed using the Peoplehood Model (Holmes, Pearson and Chavez, 2005) consisting of interconnected elements (land, language, ceremonial cycle and sacred history) as analytic tools to answer the research questions of "how is Zuni Pueblo documenting its knowledge?" and "how is Zuni Pueblo protecting its knowledge?" The findings of this research include a set of tribal protections employed by several different Indigenous communities not dependent on outside or mainstream legal mechanisms, instead the protections {{are based on the}} customary laws (RaoRane, 2006) and traditions of that particular community. The findings of this research also include observations of the methods Indigenous communities employ to address breeches of protocol, whether the breech occurs in a traditional, ceremonial space or in an online environment such as in the comment pages of a YouTube video. Three general principles have emerged from the analysis of the cases and from observations of Indigenous methods of protecting ceremonial activities. These principles are infrastructure, discussion and awareness. Infrastructure refers to community based cultural advisors who can help determine culturally appropriate actions when questions arise related to potentially culturally <b>sensitive</b> <b>works</b> or actions. Community-wide discussions help communities to build upon previous and current work already done by fellow community members. Community-wide discussions help build awareness within Indigenous communities that equip and prepare community members as ambassadors for documentation and protection efforts being pursued by the community. ...|$|E
