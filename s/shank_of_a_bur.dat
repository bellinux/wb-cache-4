40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading <b>a</b> tapered <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drill bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drill spindle.

The end <b>of</b> the tapered <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> the drill bit has a transverse tang adapted {{to engage in the}} slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader is in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the <b>shank</b> projecting out <b>of</b> the outer end of the cylinder.

The spindle is lowered to extend the <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> the drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws.

40|$|Background. Monolimb is a transtibial {{prosthesis}} {{having the}} socket and shank molded into {{one piece of}} thermoplastic material. If properly designed, the <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monolimb can have a controlled deflection during walking which simulates the ankle joint motions to some extent.

Finite element analysis was used to simulate structural tests based on ISO 10328 on monolimbs of different configurations. Statistics-based Taguchi method was employed to identify the significance of each design factor in controlling the deformation and stress within monolimbs. The design factors considered were the thickness of the thermoplastics, anteroposterior and medialateral dimensions <b>of</b> the elliptical <b>shank,</b> and depth <b>of</b> the posterior seam line. By progressively fine-tuning the design factors, the monolimb configuration was optimized giving offering appropriate flexibilities <b>of</b> the <b>shank</b> and would not structurally fail in normal uses.

40|$|SummaryHistone-lysine {{methylation}} {{is linked}} to transcriptional regulation and the control of epigenetic inheritance. Lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, {{and it has been}} suggested that each methylation state <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given lysine may impart a unique biological function [1, 2]. In yeast, histone H 3 lysine 4 (K 4) is mono-, di-, and trimethylated by the Set 1 histone methyltransferase [3, 4]. Previous studies show that Set 1 associates with RNA polymerase II and demarcates transcriptionally active genes with K 4 trimethylation [5]. To determine whether K 4 trimethylation might be selectively regulated, we screened <b>a</b> library <b>of</b> yeast deletion mutants associated with transcriptional regulation and chromatin function. We identified <b>BUR</b> 2, <b>a</b> cyclin for the Bur 1 / 2 (BUR) cyclin-dependent protein kinase, as <b>a</b> specific regulator <b>of</b> K 4 trimethylation [6]. Surprisingly, BUR also regulated H 2 B monoubiquitylation, whereas other K 4 methylation states and H 3 lysine 79 (K 79) methylation were unaffected. Synthetic genetic array (SGA) and transcription microarray analyses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>BUR</b> 2 mutant revealed that BUR is functionally similar to the PAF, Rad 6, and Set 1 complexes. These data suggest that BUR acts upstream of these factors to control their function. In support, we show that recruitment of the PAF elongation complex to genes is significantly impaired in <b>a</b> <b>BUR</b> 2 deletion. Our data reveal a novel function for the BUR kinase in transcriptional regulation through the selective control of histone modifications...|$|R

The patient presented with a fractured screw and a severely damaged implant hex connection that corresponded to the second premolar, upper left, stating that she unsuccessfully tried to remove the prosthetic screw, which was {{most likely to have}} been loose. After clinical and radiographic review, it was decided to remove small fragments of the fractured prosthetic screw inside the implant head. Removal by conventional methods was unsuccessful but was eventually achieved through use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bur.</b> Then it was possible to make a cast post (gold-palladium) and develop a fixed prosthesis (silver-palladium), which were attached with luting cement. A cast post (gold-palladium) was made and a fixed prosthesis was developed (silver-palladium), which were attached with luting cement, the same ones that can present mechanical complications such as fractures between the third and fourth thread of the implant, loosening of the abutment, and/or the prosthetic screw in individual crowns, most frequently in partially edentulous patients, mainly in the premolar and molar regions of the maxilla.

40|$|Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) were {{originally}} identified as regulators of eukaryotic cell cycle progression, but several Cdks were subsequently shown to perform important roles as transcriptional regulators. While the mechanisms regulating the Cdks involved in cell cycle progression are well documented, much less is known regarding how the Cdks {{that are involved}} in transcription are regulated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bur 1 and <b>Bur</b> 2 comprise <b>a</b> Cdk complex that is involved in transcriptional regulation, presumably mediated by its phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II.

Cak 1 is known to activate two other Cdks in yeast by phosphorylating a threonine within their conserved T-loop domains.

Additional tests establish a direct functional interaction between Cak 1 and the Bur 1 -Bur 2 Cdk complex: Bur 1 is phosphorylated in vivo, both the conserved Bur 1 T-loop threonine and Cak 1 are required for phosphorylation and Bur 1 function in vivo, and recombinant Cak 1 stimulates CTD kinase activity of the purified Bur 1 -Bur 2 complex in vitro.
