This study is an investigation into the factors affecting coordination for <b>sustainable</b> disaster <b>recovery.</b> It uses the case-study of Eden district Municipality in South Africa which has been continuously impacted by floods. The paper provides a background on disaster risk management, response and recovery in South Africa to understand the legal instruments available for coordination within the government. The study is structured around the theoretical themes of coordination within the public sector and <b>sustainable</b> disaster <b>recovery.</b> This paper also aims to make suggestions for coordinating <b>sustainable</b> disaster <b>recovery.</b> According to the respondents, the study highlights that (1) much attention paid to response oriented disaster risk management; (2) government departments working in independent silos; and (3) funding and political will are factors that affect coordination for <b>sustainable</b> disaster <b>recovery.</b> Though, the study is limited to a single case study, the results presented may be important considerations in other recovery settings...|$|R

They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters and are bottom-dwelling carnivores. Most species possess grinding, molar-like teeth.

50|$|EGM note 9 However, they {{highlighted}} the enormous costs {{violence against women}} and girls entails to States and societies as a whole, in terms of reduced human capital, decreased productivity, exacerbated social inequalities, lowered overall educational outcomes, and broad strains on public services. Violence diminishes women’s and girls’ ability to gain an education, earn a living and participate in public life, and live a life free of fear. It has significant health impacts, including psychological consequences, physical injuries, sexual/reproductive health issues and death. In war-affected settings, violence against women and girls inhibits efforts towards peace-building and <b>sustainable</b> <b>recovery,</b> contributing {{to the risk of}} resurgent conflict. In development settings, it hinders progress towards achievement of several of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including those relating to education, HIV/AIDS, maternal health and child mortality. It has intergenerational impacts, given that women use disproportionately more of their income toward supporting their families, and because violence diminishes their ability to fully participate in their societies (for example in politics, work or education) they are less able to invest in their children’s futures. One study in Chile found that women’s lost earnings alone as a result of domestic violence cost US$1.56 billion or more than 2 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product.|$|E
