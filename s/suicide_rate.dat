40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Suicide</b> <b>rates</b> {{generally}} {{increase with}} age. A recent cross-national study, using one-year cross-sectional data on <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> identified regional and cross-national patterns for elderly <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> However, findings from studies using one-year cross-sectional data on <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> may {{be open to}} bias because of random year on year fluctuations in elderly <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> METHODS: One-year average of <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> for both sexes in the age-bands 65 - 74 and 75 + years were calculated from data on <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> for five consecutive years ascertained from the World Health Organization. Cross-national variations were examined by segregating different countries into four quartiles of <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> RESULTS: There was wide cross-national variation in elderly <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Elderly <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> were the lowest in Caribbean and Arabic/Islamic countries, and the highest {{in central and eastern}} European, countries emerging from the former Soviet Union, some oriental and some west European countries. CONCLUSIONS: The regional and cross-national patterns for elderly <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> observed in this study were almost identical to a similar earlier study using one-year cross-sectional data on <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> This suggests that the findings of both studies were accurate and robust, and potential explanations for the observed cross-national variations in elderly <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> requires further study...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{calculate}} the <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> (for males and females) in Malta and other European countries with {{long series of}} suicide mortality as recorded in the WHO (World Health Organization) database, and compare the Maltese <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> with European <b>rates.</b> Method: <b>Suicide</b> <b>rates</b> were computed from the WHO database as <b>rates</b> (<b>suicides</b> per 100, 000 persons) using the reported suicide and population counts in Malta and ten other European countries for a common period 1955 - 2009. <b>Suicide</b> <b>rates</b> were age standardized following the WHO recommendations. These calculations were carried out separately for both sexes. Results: Compared to other European counties, the <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> (both male and female) in Malta have remained at considerably low level as calculated over the full period. Maltese <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> have however multiplied since the 1980 s. European data exhibit clear decrease in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> towards the present consistently in several countries. Malta is the only European country showing its highest <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> during the 2000 s. Conclusions: Although the <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in Malta remain at considerably low level, they have exhibited a notable increase towards the present, whereas the European <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> are in decline.

The relationship between socio-economic status, income inequality, healthcare expenditure, child mortality rates and life expectancy and countries with an increase, a decline and no change in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> with ageing was examined {{using data from the}} United Nations. RESULTS: In males and females there was a decline in 5 and 10 countries, an increase in 33 and 37 countries and no change in 59 and 50 countries respectively in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> with ageing.

40|$|Background. High {{occupational}} <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> {{are often}} linked to easy occupational {{access to a}} method of suicide. This study aimed to compare <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> across all occupations in Britain, how they have changed over the past 30 years, and how they may vary by occupational socio-economic group. Method. We used national occupational mortality statistics, census-based occupational populations and death inquiry files (for the years 1979 – 1980, 1982 – 1983 and 2001 – 2005). The main outcome measures were <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> per 100 000 population, percentage changes over time in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates,</b> standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs). Results. Several occupations with the highest <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> (per 100 000 population) during 1979 – 1980 and 1982 – 1983, including veterinarians (ranked first), pharmacists (fourth), dentists (sixth), doctors (tenth) and farmers (thirteenth), have easy occupational access to a method of suicide (pharmaceuticals or guns). By 2001 – 2005, there had been large significant reductions in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> {{for each of these}} occupations, so that none ranked in the top 30 occupations.

40|$|Background: Suicides may be misclassified as {{accidental}} {{deaths in}} countries with strict legal definitions of suicide, with cultural and religious factors leading to poor registration of suicide and stigma attached to suicide. Methods: The concordance between four different definitions of suicides was evaluated by examining the relationship between pure suicide and accidental death rates, gender differences, age-associated trends and potential distil risk and protective factors by conducting secondary analysis of the latest World Health Organisation data on elderly death rates. The four definitions of suicide were: (i) one-year pure suicides rates; one-year combined <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> (pure <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> combined with accidental death rates); (iii) five-year average pure suicide rates; and (iv) five-year average combined <b>suicides</b> <b>rates</b> (pure <b>suicides</b> <b>rates</b> combined with accidental death rates). Results: The predicted negative correlation between pure suicide and accidental death rates was not observed. Gender differences were similar for all four definitions of suicide. There was a highly significant concordance for the findings of age-associated trends between one-year pure and combined <b>suicide</b> <b>rates,</b> one-year and five-year average pure <b>suicide</b> <b>rates,</b> and five-year average pure and combined <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> There was poor concordance between pure and combined <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> for both one-year and five-year average data for the 14 potential distil risk and protective factors, but this concordance between one-year and five-year average pure <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> was highly significant.

40|$|Regional {{disparity}} in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> {{is a serious}} problem worldwide. One possible cause is unequal distribution of the health workforce, especially psychiatrists. Research about the association between regional physician numbers and <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> is therefore important but studies are rare. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between physician numbers and <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in Japan, by municipality. The study included all the municipalities in Japan (n = 1, 896). We estimated smoothed standardized mortality ratios of <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> for each municipality and evaluated the association between health workforce and <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> using a hierarchical Bayesian model accounting for spatially correlated random effects, a conditional autoregressive model. We assumed a Poisson distribution for the observed number of suicides and set the expected number of suicides as the offset variable.

40|$|Introduction: Mental health laws {{limiting}} involuntary {{admission to}} psychiatric hospitals to those assessed {{to be dangerous}} or at risk of harm to themselves or others (obligatory dangerousness criteria, ODC) have been introduced in almost every jurisdiction in the United States of America. Some mentally ill patients, {{who might have been}} admitted for treatment under previous laws, but who were not admitted because they were not considered 'dangerous', could subsequently have committed suicide. In order to investigate whether or not <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> increased after the introduction of ODC, we examined suicide statistics from 48 states and the District of Columbia. Methods: We aligned suicide statistics according to the year in which ODC were introduced in each jurisdiction. We then examined <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in the 15 years before and after the introduction of ODC and trends in national and state <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> between 1960 and 1990. Meta-analysis was used to examine differences in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in the year immediately before and in the year immediately after the introduction of ODC. Results: Between 1968 and 1977, the decade in which ODC were introduced in the majority of jurisdictions, national <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> increased from under 11 per 100, 000 per annum to over 12. 5 per 100, 000 per annum. The increase in many jurisdictions occurred in the years immediately before the introduction of ODC. The introduction of ODC was associated with a non-significant increase in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in the 49 jurisdictions. There was a significant increase in <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> after the introduction of ODC in the 19 jurisdictions that introduced ODC prior to 1976.
