40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Expanded perlite is a porous, lightweight, fire {{resistant}} and moisture retaining material with sound and thermal insulation properties. In this research, acoustical behaviour of plates made of expanded perlite was studied experimentally. Since these plates {{are used for}} <b>sound</b> <b>absorption,</b> the acoustical parameter selected for this study is "sound absorption coefficient". Preliminary experiments indicated that moisture reduced the <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient on <b>plates</b> {{and there is not}} much significant difference between the dry and 50 % humid conditions. However, there is a significant difference in acoustical properties for the 50 - 95 % humid conditions. Thus, this interval was studied in detail. A number of expanded perlite plates having different mixtures were prepared and tested. It was observed that, coating the expanded perlite particles with sodium silicate increased the moisture resistance. and the addition of mineral fibres into the mixtures increased the strength and <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient of the plates...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} optimization of the vibroacoustic computational effort towards perceptual constraints. This is carried out considering the academic case of a vibrating plate coupled with a damped cavity. The study looks into a particularly restrictive parameter inherent in the computation in frequency of prediction tools: the maximum limit frequency. This parameter is aimed at being adjusted to an optimal value which allows the qualitative trends concerning the optimal structural design of the system to be kept. These qualitative trends are originally obtained from the auditory evaluation of real sounds. The real sounds correspond to the noise radiated from the plate inside the cavity, recorded in different structural configurations of the system. These configurations involve the controlled variation of three structural parameters: the cavity <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> properties, the <b>plate</b> thickness and tightening conditions. The real sounds are first pairwise submitted to listeners who are asked to give dissimilarity and preference judgments. The reference qualitative trends are then established, in terms of perceptual space, preference space and preference ranking. Afterwards, the adjustment process consists in finding out, from a low-pass filtering applied to the recorded sounds, an optimal cut-off frequency which allows the reference qualitative trends to be preserved. 1...|$|R

The results show {{that only a small}} amount of carbon black will increase the damping performance, and the addition of carbon black will result in a decrease in <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> performance. The more carbon black added, the more obvious the <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> performance decreases. At the same time, this study discussed the effect of filler types on the damping properties of carbon black reinforced foamed EPDM rubber.

This study investigated the effect of filler loading on the <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> properties of carbon black reinforced foamed EPDM rubber.
