We simulated the receiver multipath pseudorange error with different navigation signals under signal conditions resulted from the use of the adaptive antenna.

30|$|Each {{receive channel}} {{streamed}} input echo samples to the delay calculation block, forming an M× 1 vector of <b>delayed</b> <b>echo</b> samples as its output. The {{purpose of the}} delay calculation block was to align the input ultrasonic echoes based on the delay information among the receive channels. The <b>delayed</b> <b>echo</b> vector must subsequently be multiplied by the adaptive apodization weights. Hence, while the adaptive weight calculation block was calculating the adaptive weights, the echo vector was stored in the data storage buffer for later usage, which was built with GPU shared memory. The purpose of data storage buffer was to let the <b>delayed</b> <b>echo</b> vector wait until the adaptive weight calculation block finished its workload.|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{observed}} the daily repetitions of an autistic six-year-old {{in order to}} examine the differences between triggers for delayed versus immediate echolalia. Researchers further distinguished immediate echos by the sequential context in which they occur: after corrections, after directives, or in indiscernible sequential positions. <b>Delayed</b> <b>echos</b> are distinguished on the basis of ownership: self-echos, other-echos, and impersonal echos. The results showed that nearly all immediate echos produced by the six-year-old were found in sequential contexts, while the <b>delayed</b> <b>echoes</b> also occurred in the basis of ownership.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposed}} an echo canceller {{to reduce the}} computational complexity of the long <b>delay</b> <b>echo</b> cancellation. Two adaptive filters were used for constructing this echo canceller. One {{was designed as a}} delay estimator, which used down-sampled sub-band signals to estimate the <b>echo</b> <b>delay</b> time. The other was designed as a short-tap filter to subtract the echo from the recorded signal with delay compensation. Experimental results showed that the output signal-to-noise ratio from the proposed canceller with low complexity is similar to that from the conventional canceller based on a long-tap filter.

40|$|The {{auditory}} cortex is {{an essential}} center for sound localization. In echolocating bats, combination sensitive neurons tuned to specific delays between call emission and echo perception represent target distance. In many bats, these neurons are organized as a chronotopically organized map of <b>echo</b> <b>delay.</b> However, it is still unclear to what extend these neurons can process directional information and thereby form a three-dimensional representation of space. We investigated the representation of three-dimensional space in the auditory cortex of Phyllostomus discolor. Specifically, we hypothesized that combination sensitive neurons encoding target distance in the AC can also process directional information. We used typical echolocation pulses of P. discolor combined with simulated echoes from different positions in virtual 3 D-space and measured the evoked neuronal responses in the AC of the anesthetized bats. Our results demonstrate that combination sensitive neurons in the AC responded selectively to specific positions in 3 -D space. While these neurons were sharply tuned to <b>echo</b> <b>delay</b> and formed a precise target distance map, the neurons' specificity in azimuth and elevation depended on the presented sound pressure level. Our data further reveal a topographic distribution of best elevation of the combination sensitive neurons along the rostro-caudal axis i. e., neurons in the rostral part of the target distance map representing <b>short</b> <b>delays</b> prefer elevations below the horizon. Due to their spatial directionality and selectivity to specific <b>echo</b> <b>delays</b> representing target distance, combination sensitive cortical neurons are suited to encode three-dimensional spatial information...|$|R
