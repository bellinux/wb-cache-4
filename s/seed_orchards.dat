50|$|In first {{generation}} <b>seed</b> <b>orchards,</b> the parents usually are phenotypically-selected trees. In advanced generation <b>seed</b> <b>orchards,</b> the <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> are harvesting the benefits generated by tree breeding {{and the parents}} may be selected among the tested clones or families. It is efficient to synchronise the productive live cycle of the <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> with the cycle time of the breeding population. In the seed orchard, the trees can be arranged in a design to keep the related individuals or cloned copies apart from each other.Seed orchards are the delivery vehicle for genetic improvement programs where the trade-off between genetic gain and diversity {{is the most important}} concern. The genetic gain of seed orchard crops depends primarily on the genetic superiority of the orchard parents, the gametic contribution to the resultant seed crops, and pollen contamination from outside <b>seed</b> <b>orchards.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>orchards</b> for {{important}} wind pollinated species start to produce seeds before the seed orchard trees start to produce much pollen. Thus {{all or most}} of the pollen parents are outside the seed orchard. Calculations indicates that seed orchard seeds are still to be expected to a superior alternative to older and more mature <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> or stand seeds. Advantage of early seeds like absence of selfing or related matings and high diversity are positive factors in the early seeds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>orchards</b> {{are usually}} managed to obtain {{sustainable}} and large crops of seeds of good quality. To achieve this, the following methods are commonly applied: orchards are established on flat surface sites with southern exposure (better conditions for orchard maintenance and for seed production), no stands {{of the same}} species in close proximity (avoid strong pollen contamination), sufficient area to produce and be mainly pollinated with their own pollen cloud, cleaning the corridors between the rows, fertilising, and supplemental pollination. The genetic quality of <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> can be improved by genetic thinning and selective harvesting. In plantation forestry with southern yellow pines in the United States, almost all plants originate from <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> and most plantations are planted in family blocks, thus the harvest from each clone is kept separate during seed processing, plant production and plantation.|$|E

50|$|Seed {{production}} and gene diversity {{is an important}} aspect when using improved materials like seed orchard crops. <b>Seed</b> <b>orchards</b> crops derive generally from {{a limited number of}} trees. But if it is a common wind-pollinated species much pollen will come from outside the seed orchard and widen the genetic diversity. The genetic gain of the first generation <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> is not great and the seed orchard progenies overlap with unimproved material. Gene diversity of the seed crops is greatly influenced by the relatedness (kinship) among orchard parents, the parental fertility variation, and the pollen contamination.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>orchards</b> are {{a common}} method of mass-multiplication for {{transferring}} genetically improved material from breeding populations to production populations (forests) and in this sense are {{often referred to as}} [...] "multiplication" [...] populations. A seed orchard is often composed of grafts (vegetative copies) of selected genotypes, but seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> also occur mainly to combine orchard with progeny testing.Seed orchards are the strong link between breeding programs and plantation establishment.

40|$|Introduction As {{a forest}} species, genetic {{variability}} {{is high in}} teak (Tectona grandis) and domestication of the species is very recent. The selection effect among qualitative and quantitative traits is therefore expected to be strong. Native provenances and clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families were compared in this study. & Materials and methods Forty-one genetic origins of teak, including 26 open-pollinated families from a clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> in Ivory Coast, were planted in 1997 in a replicated trial at Taliwas, Sabah, East Malaysia. & Results and discussion The mortality rate and early measurements of height, and diameter at breast height varied substantially between treatments. The largest height (> 18 m) and diameter (> 21 cm) values recorded after 104 months were mostly from the clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families, while the lower performances were mainly observed for the native provenances. Narrow sense heritabilities, assessed for the clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families only, increased gradually with age, reaching relatively high values, especially for height at 104 months (h 2 = 0. 76). There were also some highly {{significant differences between the}} 41 genetic origins for six qualitative traits observed from 25 to 104 months. Overall, the clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families were marginally less crooked and grew more vertically than the other sources. & Conclusions These findings provide further evidence of the usefulness of a clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> phase in the genetic improvement of teak and the beneficial influence of a wet tropical climate on major economic traits.

40|$|Establishment of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> {{is aimed}} at {{producing}} good quality seeds which is an important activity for breeding program. <b>Seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is also a base population, thus its genetic diversity is depending on its design and composition (provenance, family and individual tree). Selection of an individual tree in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is needed for the enhancement of retaining good-character trees. However, selection of individual tree can change the genetic diversity of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> and the degrees to which the genetic diversity will change depend on the used selection methods. In order to investigate the effects of selection methods, 4 simulations of selection methods based on height, diameter and stem performance of individual trees were used. The differences among the 4 methods were the ranking of individual trees those selected, and families and provenances those have been represented. Seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> of Acacia mangium in Wonogiri, Central Java was used as materials. Analysis of genetic diversity was carried out using AFLP markers. Nine primer combinations were used to produce 1025 AFLP banding patterns. Among those banding patterns, only 109 were polymorphic markers. No significant effect of individual tree selection was revealed in this study. Even though the selection was done intensively, only 7. 1 % of genetic diversity was reduced. In other words, the selection activity did not reduce the genetic diversity of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> significantly. The result is important for developing future tree improvement of A. mangium, including development of hybrid between A. mangium and A. auriculiformis...|$|R

This paper evaluates fertility variation, effective population size and genetic diversity among cajuput trees in seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> at Paliyan, Gunungkidul for optimizing <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> management. A total of 160 trees were observed in three flowering periods of 2011 - 2013. The fertility {{based on the number}} of flowers and fruits were registered for each tree at the age of 12, 13 and 14 years. Results show that there are similar patterns of fertility after three years observation. Sibling coefficients (Ψ) which show fertility variation during three flowering periods are 1. 39, 1. 25 and 1. 43 respectively. They show deviation from random mating, because of individual imbalance for producing flowers and fruits. However, the number of fertile trees was comparatively higher at 2011. More than 15 families of effective population size were recorded each year and supported more than 75 % individuals in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> to contribute flowers and seeds. High value of genetic diversity was calculated based on fertility variation (0. 965, 0. 967 and 0. 957, respectively). Fertility variation led to consequence on seed deployment, including seeds of fertile families which should be collected equally and mixed to compose equal proportion of seeds and to avoid domination of highly fertility families and genetic drift. Silvicultural treatments in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> management were indispensable to promote fertility uniformity and to increase effective population size in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> for obtaining maximal genetic gain...|$|R

On {{the period of the}} survey (1998 and 1999), the outcrossing rate estimated to 0. 97 and 0. 96 varies weakly between the two years. The high level of the outcrossing rate show that pollinations are realized between trees of different genotypes. The fixation index (FIS) decrease from the parental population to the descendantʼs one where it is not significantly different from zero. So crossings are panmictics, and the fertilizations between the related trees are practically inexistent. The rate of self-fertilization is mostly due to the real self-fertilizations between the ovuls and the pollen coming from the same origin. Thus, considering the results, the pollination in the <b>seeds</b> <b>orchard</b> would be favorable to the realization of substantial genetic progress in the wild rubber trees population...|$|R
