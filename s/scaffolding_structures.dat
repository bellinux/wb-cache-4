50|$|During {{embryonic}} development angiogenesis is initiated as mesoderm mesenchyme {{cells are}} specified to differentiate into angioblasts, expressing the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR-2). As embryonic tissue utilizes more oxygen than it receives from diffusion, it becomes hypoxic. These cells will secrete the signaling molecule vascular endothelial factor A (VEGFA) which will recruit the angioblasts expressing it's partnering receptor {{to the site}} of future angiogenesis. The angioblasts will create <b>scaffolding</b> <b>structures</b> which form the primary capillary plexus from where the local vasculature system will develop. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation, resulting in underdeveloped vascular structures. This gene is also upregulated in many tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor development and is a target in many developing cancer therapeutics. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome which is a hemangioblastic proliferative disorder.

In many instances, over-activation of sensory receptors results in the desensitization and subsequent increased threshold for activation of receptors. In other cases, receptor sensitization can occur following tissue injury and/or inflammation. In both cases, signaling mechanisms that control alterations in receptor activities can significantly affect organism response to sensory stimuli, including thermal, mechanical, and chemical. Due to the homeostatic nature of somatosensory recognition, dynamic changes in receptor response can negatively affect an individual’s way of life, as well as alert individuals to tissue damage.

30|$|In summary, {{the results}} of {{experiment}} 2 replicated those of experiment 1 with some minor differences. They thus help to rule out incidental explanations for the benefits of cuing event boundaries, and support the proposal that <b>scaffolding</b> event <b>structure</b> during encoding improves memory. The fact that recall memory after the event middle condition was again intermediate between the event boundary condition and the control condition, and was {{not significantly different from}} either, is a little vexing. This pattern is most consistent with the possibility that the event cuing manipulation was effective for two reasons: first, for the reason just stated, that <b>scaffolding</b> event <b>structure</b> facilitates memory; and second, because pauses during encoding are beneficial wherever they occur. From {{the point of view of}} practical implications, either mechanism supports the use of the event boundary cuing procedure to improve memory. From the point of view of psychological mechanisms, more work is needed to tease apart these two potential contributions.|$|R

40|$|The {{double-stranded}} DNA bacteriophages {{are good}} model systems to understand basic biological {{processes such as}} the macromolecular interactions that take place during the virus assembly and maturation, or the behavior of molecular motors that function during the DNA packaging process. Using cryoelectron microscopy and single-particle methodology, we have determined the structures of two phage T 7 assemblies produced during its morphogenetic process, the DNA-free prohead and the mature virion. The first structure reveals a complex assembly {{in the interior of}} the capsid, which involves the scaffolding, and the core complex, which {{plays an important role in}} DNA packaging and is located in one of the phage vertices. The reconstruction of the mature virion reveals important changes in the shell, now much larger and thinner, the disappearance of the <b>scaffolding</b> <b>structure,</b> and important rearrangements of the core complex, which now protrudes the shell and interacts with the tail.

40|$|Chemical synapses are the {{fundamental}} units that mediate communication between neurons in the mammalian brain. In {{contrast to the}} enormous progress made in mapping out postsynaptic contributions of receptors, <b>scaffolding</b> <b>structures</b> and receptor trafficking to synaptic transmission and plasticity, {{the small size of}} nerve terminals has largely precluded direct analyses of presynaptic modulation of excitability and transmitter release in central synapses.

In the end-user programming arena the fundamental challenges have gradually shifted from basic syntactic challenges towards semantic challenges including the need to convey an understanding of design and engineering principles relevant to end-users. Visual programming has significantly lowered the threshold of programming [1] mostly by sharply reducing or even completely eliminating syntactic programming challenges. Visual programming languages using drag and drop mechanisms as programming approach make it virtually impossible to create syntactic errors. Even traditional textbased end-user programming approaches nowadays provide useful tools such as syntax coloring, symbol completion and wizards to reduce syntactic problems quite effectively.
