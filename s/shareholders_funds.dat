40|$|A {{company s}} main {{objective}} is creating shareholder value. International expansion {{is a strategy}} employed by companies in pursuit of growth and value creation. South Africa has been characterised by economic growth lower {{than the rest of}} Africa and developed countries. This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Internationalisation becomes imperative for companies seeking growth and value creation. The objective was to investigate the impact of multinationality on value creation of multinational companies from South Africa. Geographic location and the degree of internationalisation were considered. Previous studies focussed on developed country multinationals, while this research study focused on South African multinationals to provide an emerging market perspective. Generalised linear models with fixed effects and t-tests were conducted to measure the effect multinationality, geographic location and degree of multinationality has on the return of <b>shareholders</b> <b>funds</b> and market capitalisation. Market capitalisation demonstrated statistically significant results when tested against multinationality, degree of internationalisation and geographic location. However the effect of geographic location on market capitalisation was negative. Return on <b>shareholders</b> <b>funds</b> had statistically significant results with negative effects when tested against multinationality and exhibited no significance with geographic location of investment and degree of internationalisation. Multinationality, geographic location and the degree of internationalisation do affect company value creation.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} the competitive and operational capabilities of banks in Nigeria with a view towards returning global and public confidence to the Nigerian banking sector and the economy in general, the Central Bank of Nigeria instituted a banking reform which saw most of the then existing 89 banks merging with each other. It was earlier speculated in some financial analysis quarters that the exercise {{might turn out to}} be one of those overblown hypes of an ailing economy. This, however, has turned out to be the opposite as most post-merger results tend to highlight that financial synergies exist. This paper tries to evaluate the authenticity of this assertion. To do this, pre-merger and post merger financial statements of 4 consolidated banks were obtained, adjusted, carefully analyzed and compared. The result revealed that all the four merger groups produced in addition to operational and relational synergy, financial gains far more than the 2 + 2 = 5 synergistic effects.

Over 90 banks with state governments participation and privately owned failed in the 1990 s {{and the level of}} bad loans grew sharply in the 1990 s when compared to previous years. The study intended to evaluate the relationship between poor management and failed banks in Nigeria in the 1990 s. The survey research design was employed. Data were collected through the questionnaire designed on a 5 – point Likert scale. Personal interview was also used. Probabilistic sampling method was used and the sample size was derived by the famous Yamane’s formula. Reliability of the data collection instrument was calculated by test-retest technique. Data generated were organized, filtered, and coded before they were classified. Pearson’s correlation technique was used for data analysis where correlation coefficient was 0. 883. Hence, it was concluded that poor management has strong positive relationship with bank failures. This is the crux of the study. Five recommendations were made based on the result of the study...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the major {{factors contributing to}} marketing success, as measured by average annual Return on <b>Shareholders</b> <b>Funds,</b> within the Australian corporate finance market, during the period 1983 to 1987. The study&# 039;s findings {{are based on the}} analysis of the responses to a detailed mail questionnaire, and several follow-up in-depth interviews. The questionnaire was mailed to nearly five hundred of the most senior executives working in the corporate finance market in late 1987. A total of ninety one completed, useable questionnaires were received, representing a response rate of 19. 2 per cent. This sample was representative of the several different types of organisations then competing within the chosen market. The main findings of this thesis, based on an extensive analysis of the respondents&# 039; questionnaires, are that the organisations which were most successful in terms of their marketing activities were smaller in size than their competitors, had a more systematic approach to their marketing, and were primarily involved in providing either stock broking or investment banking services to their customers. The other major finding is that modern marketing concepts and management practices {{did not appear to be}} fully understood, or implemented, within the responding organisations, despite the deregulation of the Australian capital market and the consequent intenSification of competition...|$|E
40|$|Capital {{adequacy}} {{standards for}} banks that operates internationally is of major concern for bank regulators worldwide. In consequence, the Bank for International Settlements, (BIS) established {{a framework for}} measuring capital adequacy for banks {{in the group of}} ten (G 10), industrialized nations of the world. The adoption of the standards in the city of Basle came to be referred as the Basle Capital Accord on Capital Adequacy Standard. The Capital adequacy Standard under the Basle accord has been widely accepted worldwide by bank regulators and was implemented by the Central Bank of Nigeria, effective December 2005. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of the adoption of the Capital Adequacy Standards on the performance of Nigerian banks. The study involved the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation technique to examine and determine the effect of the independent variables – loans and advances, <b>shareholders</b> <b>funds,</b> total assets and customer deposits – on the dependent variables – Earnings per share (EPS) and profit after tax. The results of the analysis showed that capital adequacy standards, exert a major influence on bank performance. In addition the impact of the Nigerian monetary authority on the new capital requirements was found to be complemented with the adoption of the Basle accord framework. The study concludes with the recommendation that the CBN should not rely soly on the capitalization of banks as a determinant of bank performance but also should concentrate on efficient and effective bank supervision and risk management...|$|E
40|$|To date, in vivo {{studies of}} the process {{involved}} in the negotiation of industry contracts has been scarce. This research {{was an attempt to}} rectify this point. As such, the research aims were three fold. Firstly, to provide an integration of the many negotiation elements purported to influence negotiation success. Secondly, to develop a set of scales based on the negotiation literature, that would effectively discriminate between negotiators. Thirdly, to validate the derived scales against reality based information. Seventy-five Managers involved in the negotiation of contracts in industry, from twenty-three of New Zealand's top Companies, comprised the research sample. Each subject completed a 50 item questionnaire, based on current negotiation literature relating to the negotiation of contracts in industry. Information obtained from the completed questionnaires was factor analysed to 10 factors. These 10 factors were used in two discriminant analyses. The first discriminant analysis related to company size, with each participating company classified, via a composite criterion of Net Profit, Ordinary <b>Shareholders</b> <b>Funds,</b> and Total Tangible Assets into groupings of Top, Middle and Bottom companies. The relevant information pertaining to this classification was drawn from the 1979 Edition of the New Zealand Economist. The second discriminant analysis was conducted between the four Managerial functions of Production, Purchasing, Marketing and Chief Executives. Information relating to this classification was drawn from the completed questionnaires. The results demonstrated that the 10 derived factors effectively discriminated between companies of various sizes and between managerial functions in terms of negotiation style and orientations adopted toward negotiation...|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. The {{success of}} organisations has {{traditionally}} been measured based on profits and contribution to <b>shareholders</b> <b>funds.</b> However, recent literature indicates that the human factor has become {{a key element in}} achieving success. Widely described as soft issues, these human factors potentially {{have a profound effect on}} the success of the organisation (Business Report, 7 November 1999 : 6). The aim of this study was to icentify which soft issues were prevalent within the organisation, and also to determine what influence these soft issues have on the success of the organisation. The focus was thus on the phenomenon of soft issues within the organisation. In order to realise this aim, it was required to do research to establish which human factors are described in recent literature in order to establish their VI influence on the success of an organisation. Chapter two dealt with this aim and the research revealed a whole spectrum of soft issues including values, emotional intelligence, ethics and many more (See Table 1, Page 28) The research indicated that emotional intelligence and values were regarded as having a profound effect on the success of the organisation. Chapter three analised these two concepts in more detail with specific focus on the origin and nature of emotional intelligence and values as well as their effect on the success of the organisation. The study was motivated by the quest to find the co-ordination between the soft issues found within the organisation and the influence it had on the success of the organisation. The study was done from the paradigm of personal and professional leadership which has as main trait, the believe that change should happen from within the individual, and not from the outside (Covey, 1992 : 42) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The paper's aim is {{to assess}} {{performance}} of firms in the UK retail sector. Design/methodology/approach – Economic efficiencies of 41 retail companies working in the UK between 2000 and 2005 are {{examined in this study}} using three related methodologies: data envelopment analysis (DEA), Malmquist productivity index (MPI), a bootstrapped Tobit regression model. DEA is used to calculate technical and scale efficiencies of companies. Two outputs (turnover, profit before taxation) and three inputs (total assets, <b>shareholders</b> <b>funds,</b> and number of employees) are employed for the efficiency measurement. MPI is used to analyze the patterns of efficiency change over the six year period 2000 ‐ 2005. DEA efficiencies are then used to test important hypotheses on the impact of environmental variables, namely head office location, type of ownership, years of incorporation, legal form and retail characteristic, on the functioning of the UK retail sector using bootstrapped Tobit regression. Findings – DEA analysis has shown that only ten retail companies are considered as efficient under CRS assumption, and 16 firms under VRS assumption in 2005. MPI results have indicated that about 50 percent of retail companies have registered progress in terms of MPI during 2000 and 2005. Twenty out of 41 retail companies have adopted advanced and efficient retailing technologies during this period. Three environmental variables, namely the type of ownership, legal form and retail characteristic, have been found to play significant roles influencing retail efficiency using bootstrapped Tobit regression. Research limitations/implications – Data availability has limited the level of analysis in some parts of this study, especially in the bootstrapped Tobit regression. Originality/value – This study seems to be the first in applying productivity analysis using DEA for the UK retail sector...|$|E
