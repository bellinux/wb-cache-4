40|$|The various {{assessments}} {{of the effects of}} a liberalization of world sugar markets are inconsistent with each other. One cause seems to be the modeling of the EU supply response. We investigate three possible linkages between <b>sugar</b> production <b>under</b> <b>quota</b> and the out-of-quota or "C" sugar supply: i/ the existence of fixed costs covered by the in-quota sugar; ii / the "overshooting" behavior as prevention against poor yields; iii/ the production of C sugar as "reference building" in view of expected reforms. Modeling these effects results in the introduction of an implicit crosssubsidy between in-quota sugar and C sugar. The resulting specification is included in a detailed model of the EU agricultural sector so as to account for intersectoral linkages. We simulate the effects of the 2005 reform of the sugar sector and the effects of a ban on sugar export subsidies.

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{estimate}} the impact of establishment of CAFTA on the United States sugar market. We use the United States sugar demand elasticity {{and the amount of}} increase in the U. S. <b>sugar</b> import <b>quota</b> <b>under</b> CAFTA agreement {{to estimate the}} magnitude of this effect. This study shows that these increased imports will result in a decrease in the U. S. domestic sugar price of about 1. 7 cents, or approximately 8. 6 percent. Although it amounts to only pennies per pound, this decrease in the domestic price could result in the incursion of significant U. S. government expenditures given the current structure of the U. S. non-recourse loan program. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{is a major}} {{participant}} in the world sugar market, {{being one of the}} top producers, importers and exporters in the world. The reform of the EU sugar regime will affect not only the EU member states and candidates, but also countries that are associated with the EU through the preferential, regional and multilateral trade agreements. For several decades, the EU has supported and protected the EU sugar sector. Sugar from developing countries {{will not be able to}} enter the EU sugar market without preferential trade agreements. In the EU sugar regime, the unique features of the trade concessions are that <b>sugar</b> <b>under</b> preferential import <b>quotas</b> can enter the EU market duty-free and the price paid for sugar equals to the high EU price for sugar. This paper attempts to analyse the complex hierarchy of trade arrangements between the EU and specific groups of countries. It compares the different trade agreements – including those achieved under the WTO – and explores the impact of these upon both the EU and the other countries involved. ...|$|R

50|$|Japan's quotas also dropped. From 490 items <b>under</b> <b>quota</b> in 1962, Japan {{had only}} twenty-seven items <b>under</b> <b>quota</b> in the mid-1980s, {{and that number}} dropped again late in the decade to twenty-two with further {{agreements}} scheduled to come into effect in the early 1990s, which would reduce the number again. But those products still <b>under</b> <b>quota</b> proved to be highly visible and were the object of complaints by exporting countries. The reduction of controlled items in the late 1980s resulted from Japan's loss of a GATT case brought by the United States concerning import restrictions on twelve agricultural products. In addition, heavy pressure from the United States led to an agreement that Japan would end import quotas on beef and citrus fruit in 1991. The one restricted product that continues to prompt objections from other countries is rice, imports of which until 1994 were prohibited. Rice has traditionally been the mainstay of the Japanese diet, and farm organizations played upon the deep cultural importance {{as a reason for}} prohibiting imports. Farm organizations also had a disproportionate political voice because of the shift of the population to the cities without any significant redistricting for seats in the Diet. Despite such entrenched political and cultural opposition, foreign rice gradually found its way into Japanese markets and even on to the emperor's dining table by 1994.|$|R

40|$|The {{authors are}} {{particularly}} interested in evaluating the concern that efficiency or policy-induced changes in the supply of exports of primary commodities, such as cocoa, coffee, and tea, may lead to such a large decline in the prices of those commodities that export revenues and incomes of the exporting countries actually decline. This paper focuses on the implications of quantitative restrictions. It compares the implications of optimal Nash quotas and taxes when two or more countries compete {{against each other in}} the world market and finds that the outcome under taxes is less restrictive than <b>under</b> <b>quotas</b> but that the countries'profits are higher <b>under</b> <b>quotas</b> than <b>under</b> taxes. In simulations undertaken for the world cocoa market, it finds that for most countries optimal Nash taxes yield lower profits than the initial taxes or quotas. It also finds that even if countries choose taxes or quotas optimally, growth in a country can lead to a decline in the combined real income of the exporting countries. The simulations also cast doubt on the hypothesis that a market with five or more players can be regarded as roughly perfectly competitive.
