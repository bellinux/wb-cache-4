40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} the determination of three synthetic sweeteners(sodiumcyclamate, <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium,</b> and acesulfame) in fruits by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Methods The synthetic sweeteners were extracted with water, separated on a reversed phase C 18 column using acetonitrile- 0. 02 mol/L ammonium acetate as mobile phase, and then detected by UPLC-MS/MS under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Results The method showed a good linearity for all the analysts over the range of 10 ~ 600 μg/L with r≥ 0. 995. The detection limits of sodium cyclamate, <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> and acesulfame were 0. 8, 5. 0 μg/kg and 1. 0 μg/kg, respectively.

The chromatographic zones corresponding to the saccharin spots were scanned in the reflectance/absorbance mode at l= 230 mm. For the standard curves, two series of <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt solutions were prepared: in methanol (solvent 1) and in ethyl acetate–acetic acid (9 : 1, v/v) mixture (solvent 2).

Consumption of a 5 % (w/v) <b>sodium</b> <b>saccharin</b> solution for 7 weeks prevented {{the development of}} hyperglycaemia, improved glucose tolerance (area under curve decreased by 51 %), reduced the extent of hyperinsulinaemia (by 21 %), and reduced excessive weight gain (by 18 %) in ob/ob mice. Consumption of 5 % (w/v) <b>sodium</b> <b>saccharin</b> temporarily decreased hyperphagia {{at the beginning of}} treatment, decreased hepatic glycogen content (by 47 %), increased abdominal muscle glycogen content (by 82 %), but did not significantly alter the hypoglycaemic response to exogenous insulin in ob/ob mice.

Normal lean +/+ mice consuming 5 % (w/v) <b>sodium</b> <b>saccharin</b> solution showed a marginal decrease (by 8 %) in glycaemia, and glucose tolerance was improved (area under curve decreased by 30 %) without a significant change in the insulin response to glucose or the hypoglycaemic effect of exogenous insulin.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop and {{evaluate}} orodispersible tablets of domperidone by direct compression method. Sodium starch glycolate (SCG), Kollidone CLSF and sodium bicarbonate were used as disintegrants to achieve the desired disintegration time required for orodispersible tablets. To mask the bitter taste of drug, impart sweetness and to offer a better feeling in mouth, <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium,</b> aspartame, citric acid, menthol and lemon flavor were also added. Mannitol and lactose were used as sugar based multifunctional diluents. The prepared tablets were evaluated for their physical (hardness, friability, weight variation), organoleptic (taste, mouth-feel, color) and functional (disintegration time) properties and for the drug content. The excipients were used in various concentrations in order to optimize the desired properties. SCG and Kollidone CLSF, used in 5. 5 % and 4 % respectively, gave satisfactory disintegration time using BP instrument and within the mouth. Combination of <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> (1. 5 %) and aspartame (3 %) along with mannitol (40 %) and other excipients effectively masked the bitterness and provided satisfactory sweetness level. Incorporation of 0. 05 % menthol provided excellent mouth feeling as assessed by a panel of volunteers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES We {{aimed to}} {{describe}} administration of eight potentially harmful excipients of interest (EOI) -parabens, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, benzoates, <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium,</b> sorbitol, ethanol and benzalkonium chloride-to hospitalised neonates in Europe {{and to identify}} risk factors for exposure. METHODS All medicines administered to neonates during 1 day with individual prescription and demographic data were registered in a web-based point prevalence study. Excipients were identified from the Summaries of Product Characteristics. Determinants of EOI administration (geographical region, gestational age (GA), active pharmaceutical ingredient, unit level and hospital teaching status) were identified using multivariable logistical regression analysis. RESULTS Overall 89 neonatal units from 21 countries participated. Altogether 2095 prescriptions for 530 products administered to 726 neonates were recorded. EOI were found in 638 (31 %) prescriptions and were administered to 456 (63 %) neonates through {{a relatively small number}} of products (n= 142; 27 %). Parabens, found in 71 (13 %) products administered to 313 (43 %) neonates, were used most frequently. EOI administration varied by geographical region, GA and route of administration. Geographical region remained a significant determinant of the use of parabens, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol and <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> after adjustment for the potential covariates including anatomical therapeutic chemical class of the active ingredient. CONCLUSIONS European neonates receive a number of potentially harmful pharmaceutical excipients. Regional differences in EOI administration suggest that EOI-free products are available and provide the potential for substitution to avoid side effects of some excipients...|$|E

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in taste perception have been explained {{in part by}} variations in peripheral innervation associated with the genetic ability to taste the bitter substances PTC and PROP. In the present study we report evidence of another source of indi-vidual differences that is independent of taste stimulus, taste quality, or gustatory nerve. Individuals who perceived taste from thermal stimulation alone (thermal taste) gave significantly higher taste ratings to chemical stimuli—often by a factor of> 2 : 1 —than did individuals who perceived no taste from thermal stimulation. This was true for all taste stimuli tested (sucrose, <b>saccharin,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride, citric acid, quinine sulfate, MSG and PROP), for all three gustatory areas of the mouth (anterior tongue, posterior tongue and soft palate) and for whole-mouth stimulation. Moreover, the same individuals reported stronger sensations from the olfactory stimulus vanillin, particularly when it was sensed retronasally.
