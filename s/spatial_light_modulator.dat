25|$|To {{accurately}} {{control the}} pulse, a full {{characterization of the}} pulse spectral phase is a must {{in order to get}} certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a <b>spatial</b> <b>light</b> <b>modulator</b> can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the <b>spatial</b> <b>light</b> <b>modulator,</b> MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).|$|E
2500|$|A typical setup uses one laser {{to create}} one or two traps. Commonly, two traps are {{generated}} by splitting the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized beams. Optical tweezing operations with more than two traps can be realized either by time-sharing a single laser beam among several optical tweezers, or by diffractively splitting the beam into multiple traps. With acousto-optic deflectors or galvanometer-driven mirrors, a single laser beam can be shared among hundreds of optical tweezers in the focal plane, or else spread into an extended one-dimensional trap. Specially designed diffractive optical elements can divide a single input beam into hundreds of continuously illuminated traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations. The trap-forming hologram also can specify the mode structure of each trap individually, thereby creating arrays of optical vortices, optical tweezers, and holographic line traps, for example. When implemented with a <b>spatial</b> <b>light</b> <b>modulator,</b> such [...] also can move objects in three dimensions.
