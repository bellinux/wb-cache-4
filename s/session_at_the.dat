He nearly {{missed out on}} the tournament after tearing the medial {{collateral}} ligament during a training <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM), this caused his feud with technical director Morten Frost, as Frost was not receptive to his complaint, asking for the slippery mats to be replaced. Lee lost to Lin Dan for two consecutive tournaments, {{the first in the}} final of Malaysia Open, and the second in semifinals of Badminton Asia Championships.|$|E
5|$|In February 1968, the Beatles {{travelled}} to Rishikesh {{in northern}} India {{to attend an}} advanced Transcendental Meditation (TM) training <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Their visit {{was one of the}} band's most productive periods and received widespread media attention. The Beatles' interest in the Maharishi was led by George Harrison's commitment, and it changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of Transcendental Meditation.|$|E

5|$|On 23 August 1995, {{exactly one}} year after the burning, Drummond and Cauty {{returned}} to Jura for the premier screening of the film, now known as Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. The film was then toured around the UK {{over the next few months}} (plus one showing in Belgrade), with a Q <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of each screening where members of the audience asked Drummond and Cauty why they burnt the money and also offered their own interpretations.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{contemplated}} recording more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Record Plant with session players. The basic idea was to create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E

5|$|Before {{pre-production}} began, songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber {{were commissioned}} {{to integrate the}} film's soundtrack. In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show {{the progress of the}} repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted in a hotel room by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room door with a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Chuuk Governor Johnson Elimo {{issued a}} state of {{emergency}} on April1 and stated that international assistance was necessary. Immediate concerns included the possibility of residents starving with most of the state's crops ruined. Yap Governor Tony Ganngiyan also issued {{a state of}} emergency on April1. On April9, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia held a special two-day <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> request of President Manny Mori, which included determination of typhoon relief funds. They allocated $1.5million toward relief for Chuuk and Yap States on April11. The president also issued a price freeze to pre-storm levels to prevent price gouging.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in <b>session.</b> (<b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E

5|$|Since the College of Cardinals {{is a small}} body, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} that the electorate should be expanded. Proposed reforms include a plan to replace the College of Cardinals as the electoral body with the Synod of Bishops, which includes many more members. Under present procedure, however, the Synod may only meet when called by the pope. Universi Dominici gregis explicitly provides that even if a synod or an ecumenical council is in <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of a pope's death, it may not perform the election. Upon the pope's death, either body's proceedings are suspended, to be resumed only upon {{the order of the}} new pope.|$|E
5|$|The BT49's racing career {{got off to}} an {{unsettled}} {{start when}} Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, abruptly quit the sport after 10 laps of the first practice <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> penultimate race of the 1979 season, the Canadian Grand Prix. The car soon showed promise: Piquet ran third in the race on the high speed Circuit Île Notre-Dame before retiring with a broken gearbox. Lauda's replacement, Argentine novice Ricardo Zunino, was seventh of the nine who completed the race. At the season finale in wet conditions at the Watkins Glen International circuit, Zunino spun off although Piquet set the fastest lap before a driveshaft failed, putting his {{car out of the}} race.|$|E
5|$|The Board of Supervisors met in {{a special}} <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of June 1939 and Middleton was {{directed}} {{to take over the}} business management of the university. The school's finances were in a state of chaos, and it would take effort and time to dig out of the mess. The dean of the Law School, Paul M. Hebert, became the acting president, and Middleton became acting vice president and comptroller. Middleton chose two accounting professors, Dr. Daniel Borth and Dr. Mack Hornbeak, to work with him, and a New York firm was hired to come in and establish sound business procedures.|$|E

Late June, TNA President Dixie Carter stated via Twitter that Bound for Glory would {{take place in a}} city not yet visited by the company and be revealed during the telecast of the July 5 edition of Impact Wrestling. During the show, an official video announcement confirmed the event would transpire at the Grand Canyon University Arena in Phoenix, Arizona on October 14, 2012. Before the tickets went on sale on July 27, 2012, Rob Van Dam promoted the event and signed autographs during a pre-sale <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> GCU Arena Box Office the day prior.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} won by Australian driver Will Power for Team Penske. Power {{was making his}} race return after an {{incident}} during a practice <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma, which left him with two broken vertebrae in his back. Second place went to Ryan Hunter-Reay, who was making his first start for Andretti Autosport, and third place went to another returnee, A. J. Foyt Enterprises' Vitor Meira. Meira was making his first start since suffering similar injuries to Power, during the 2009 Indianapolis 500.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} his {{appointment}} Granby resigned the leadership in the Commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without {{a leader in the}} Commons {{for the rest of the}} parliamentary <b>session.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and John Charles Herries—indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted him. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.|$|E

5|$|All {{pleas for}} {{financial}} help are in vain, including {{a private school}} play performed in front of Mr. Burns at his mansion, until Jim Hope, {{the president of a}} company named Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. The school's staff is replaced, and classes now focus on toys and marketing. Lisa soon discovers that the company that bought Springfield Elementary is a toy company, using students for research to make a new popular toy in time for the Christmas shopping season. She is then frightened by the appearance of a robotic figure. When Bart and Lisa are back at home, watching television, they see an advertisement for a toy named Funzo. It has many features suggested by Springfield Elementary students during a brainstorming <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school. They visit Jim Hope's office to complain, and he apologetically gives them a free Funzo toy. Bart and Lisa later discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Monza circuit {{and concentrated on}} optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the fastest}} time in Q2 at 1:06.228, the fastest time set in any <b>session</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Red Bull Ring. However, both Ferrari and Red Bull set their fastest times in Q2 on the supersoft tyres, unlike Mercedes, {{who used the}} ultrasoft compound, meaning that both teams were able to start the race on the harder tyre. Realizing this, Mercedes tried to counter the move and sent their cars back out on supersoft tyres, but were unable to improve on their times due to rain {{starting}} to fall. Jenson Button moved into Q3, while his teammate Fernando Alonso did not, ending up 14th on the grid. In 12th place, Wehrlein equalled Manor's highest ever qualifying result, being between the two Haas drivers Esteban Gutiérrez and Romain Grosjean on the grid. Following their problems in Q1, Pérez and Sainz were unable to set a time and were thus eliminated.|$|E
