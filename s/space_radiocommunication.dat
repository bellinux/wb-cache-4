5000|$|Space {{radio system}} (also: space system) is - {{according}} to article 1.110 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as «Any group of cooperating earth stations and/or space stations employing <b>space</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> for specific purposes.» ...|$|E
5000|$|Space {{research}} service (short: SRS &#124; also: <b>space</b> research <b>radiocommunication</b> service) is - according to Article 1.55 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as «A radiocommunication service in which spacecraft or other objects in space {{are used for}} scientific or technological research purposes.» ...|$|R
5000|$|Space {{operation}} service (short: SOS also: <b>space</b> operation <b>radiocommunication</b> service) is - {{according to}} Article 1.23 of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR)- defined as «A radiocommunication service concerned exclusively with {{the operation of}} spacecraft, in particular space tracking, space telemetry and space telecommand. These functions will normally be provided within the service in which the space station is operating.» ...|$|R

For example, the {{land mobile service}} {{can be thought of}} as a branch of the mobile service which encompasses the land, maritime and aeronautical mobile services. For many terrestrial radiocommunication communication services, there is a parallel <b>space</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> service e.g., the broadcasting service and the broadcasting-satellite service.|$|E
