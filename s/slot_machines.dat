5|$|In 1994, the Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> for the state's three racetracks, and {{the first}} racino opened in December 1995. This helped the horse racing industry in Delaware, as approximately 10 percent of all gross revenue is used to increase the purses. This drew competition away from Maryland. Rosecroft could not fill up a 12-race card for its opening night during the 1996 season. An estimated $80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware's casinos. Throughout the years, various politicians tried to bring <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> or table games to Rosecroft, but all were unsuccessful.|$|E

5000|$|Slot Variance [...] At {{the heart}} of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{gameplay}} {{is the concept of}} slot variance (or slot volatility) that is fundamental to how a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> ‘feels’ to play. Slot variance is a measure of risk associated with playing a <b>slot</b> <b>machine.</b> A low variance <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> has regular but smaller wins and a high variance <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> has fewer but bigger wins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first true}} video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> was {{developed}} in 1976 in Kearny Mesa, California by the Las-Vegas based Fortune Coin Co. This <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> used a modified 19 in Sony Trinitron color receiver for the display and logic boards for all <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> functions. The prototype was mounted in a full size show-ready <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> cabinet. The first production units went on trial in the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel. After some [...] "cheat-proofing" [...] modifications, the video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{was approved by the}} Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown casinos. Fortune Coin Co. and their video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> technology were purchased by IGT (International Gaming Technology) in 1978.|$|R

5|$|The Maceo empire soon {{extended}} beyond Galveston Island and gradually expanded throughout Galveston County {{with the family}} owning more than 60 businesses, as well as <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> throughout the county. Investments in oil speculation helped to diversify the Maceos' portfolio and add to their wealth. Law enforcement sources accused them of running the narcotics trade {{as far north as}} Dallas and Sam was even charged, but authorities were never able to make the charges stick, and indeed some sources claim that they were genuinely false.|$|E

In 2005, compacts between the state and various tribes allowed facilities to offer table card games and <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> Another popular gambling draw, Horse racing events are housed by the Fair Meadows Race Track and Will Rogers Downs in nearby Claremore.|$|E
5|$|Wheel {{has also}} been {{licensed}} to International Game Technology for use in its <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> The games are all loosely based on the show, with contestants {{given the chance to}} spin the wheel to win a jackpot prize. Since 1996, over 200 slot games based on the show have been created, both for real-world casinos and those on the Internet. With over 1,000 wins awarded in excess of $1,000,000 and over $3 billion in jackpots delivered, Wheel has been regarded as the most successful slots brand of all time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{games have}} become the most popular form of {{gambling}} worldwide. In Finland, their pervasiveness in public spaces and popularity makes them {{one of the most}} common form of gaming. However, in game studies, gambling games are often regarded as borderline games due to the player’s lack of control. In this thesis I ask whether modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games can be considered as games and if so, what similarities there are between them and contemporary video games. To find out if modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games are in fact games, I compare their features with influential definitions of game and play. After this, I utilize an analysis framework derived from the method of close reading to analyze a popular Finnish video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game Emma. The comparison between modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games and the various definitions of game and play reveals that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games fit very well into these definitions, and thus they can be considered as games. This notion enables them to be analyzed with game analysis methods. The analysis showed that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games feature many elements that are commonly found in traditional video games, such as contextual aesthetics, narratives, interaction, as well as some form of player control via choices. Research regarding <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games as games is scarce despite their many intriguing elements that cross disciplinary borders. Modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games have evolved into a form of complex digital entertainment, which calls for open-minded collaboration of game studies and gambling studies in particular, but many other disciplines as well...|$|R

5|$|In January 2011, Penn National Gaming bought Rosecroft for $10.25 million. Penn National said it {{planned to}} return live racing and {{simulcast}} wagering {{to the track}} as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing slots and table games. Penn National said it was hoping to convince the state to allow <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> at the track, even though voters did not approve Prince George's County as a gambling location. On July 28, 2011, the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $1.4 million line of credit to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Penn National said it was likely to incur $2.3 million in losses through 2013.|$|E
5|$|Penn National wanted Rosecroft {{to begin}} {{simulcasting}} races in late August 2011. Disputes between tracks and simulcasters about revenues, however, {{led to a}} delay in reaching new agreements on broadcast rights. In the 2011, the Maryland legislature passed a bill that required all parties to enter into mediation. If mediation was not successful by October 1, 2011, then an arbitrator was required to help. To resolve a conflict of interest, Penn National sold its financial stake in the Maryland Jockey Club's in July 2011. In August 2011, Rosecroft made public its plans for adding a casino at Rosecroft. It planned to destroy the grandstand and build a casino with approximately 4,700 <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> alongside the track.|$|E

5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall. Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough votes to pass the measure {{even if it were}} brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills to deal with the shortfall. The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused substance abusers to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E
5|$|Casinos {{offering}} illegal {{gambling and}} drinking were the largest tourist {{draws on the}} island. Though the Maceos operated the island's biggest casinos, they generally were very tolerant of competing clubs and casinos, provided their owners understood and respected the Maceos' authority. By the 1930s Seawall Boulevard was filled with lavish casinos; other areas of town also had pockets of gambling. As late as 1950, there were approximately 300 businesses, ranging from grocery stores to barber shops, operating <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> The red-light district, centered on Postoffice Street and kept entirely separate from the nightclubs and other entertainment venues, was so successful that the island for a time had the highest concentration of prostitutes in the world (1 of every 62 residents). The financial success of these vice industries attracted mobsters such as New York's Albert Anastasia and Chicago's Al Capone, who tried to enter Galveston's market without success. Capone's enforcer Frank Nitti, in fact, had been a former partner of Galveston Downtown Gang leader Jack Nounes before the Maceo era.|$|E
25|$|In January 1951 it was {{reported}} that the industry manufacturing <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> in the United States, then almost entirely based in Chicago, Illinois, had suffered a major blow. A bill had been signed which banned <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> from federal property and prohibited their shipment in commerce between states. At that time <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> were allowed only in the states of Nevada, Montana and Maryland (where they were allowed in only four counties) but were operated illegally throughout the country.|$|E

50|$|The {{break-even point}} cannot be easily {{calculated}} on a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game, because the payback percentage {{for the game}} is normally unknown to the player. The break-even point in poker-based games can be calculated because the payback percentage for the game {{is a function of}} the paybacks and odds of the poker hands, which is based on a standard 52-card deck. The return of a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> is based on the published paytable, but also on the normally unpublished reels. For a five-reel <b>slot</b> <b>machine,</b> the player would need to know each symbol on each of the <b>slot</b> <b>machine's</b> five reels in order to calculate the odds. For a three-reel slot, the reels are normally weighted, and this would not be possible. However, in some circumstances the manufacturer may publish the payout of their machines.|$|R
