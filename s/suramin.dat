5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by <b>suramin.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Suramin</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Oskar Dressel and Richard Kothe in 1916 for Bayer. It {{was introduced in}} 1920 to treat {{the first stage of}} the disease. By 1922, <b>Suramin</b> was generally combined with tryparsamide (another pentavalent organoarsenic drug), the first drug to enter the nervous system and be useful in the treatment of the second stage of the gambiense form. Tryparsamide was announced in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in 1919 and tested in the Belgian Congo by Louise Pearce of the Rockefeller Institute in 1920. It was used during the grand epidemic in West and Central Africa on millions of people and was the mainstay of therapy until the 1960s. American medical missionary Arthur Lewis Piper was active in using tryparsamide to treat sleeping sickness in the Belgian Congo in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening {{the population at}} risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or <b>suramin.</b> Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine {{or a combination of}} nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
25|$|In {{doing this}} Phase I trial, they built on their {{experience}} in doing an earlier trial, with <b>suramin,</b> another drug that had shown effective anti-HIV {{activity in the}} laboratory. This initial trial of AZT proved that the drug could be safely administered to patients with HIV, that it increased their CD4 counts, restored T cell immunity as measured by skin testing, and that it showed strong evidence of clinical effectiveness, such as inducing weight gain in AIDS patients. It also showed that levels of AZT that worked in vitro could be injected into patients in serum and suppository form, and that the drug penetrated deeply only into infected brains.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Suramin</b> is not orally {{bioavailable}} and {{is given}} intravenously. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administration {{could result in}} local tissue inflammation or necrosis. <b>Suramin</b> is approximately 99-98% protein bound in the serum and has a half-life of 41-78 days average of 50 days however, the pharmacokinetics of <b>suramin</b> can vary substantially between individual patients. <b>Suramin</b> does not distribute well into cerebral spinal fluid and its concentration in the tissues is equivalently lower than its concentration in the plasma. <b>Suramin</b> is not extensively metabolized and about 80% is eliminated via the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action for <b>suramin</b> is unclear, however, {{it is thought that}} parasites are able to selectively uptake <b>suramin</b> via receptor-mediated endocytosis of drug that is bound to low-density lipoproteins and to a lesser extent, other serum proteins. Once inside parasites, <b>suramin</b> combines with proteins, especially trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes to inhibit energy metabolism.|$|E

50|$|The P2X7 {{receptor}} current can {{be blocked}} by zinc, calcium, magnesium, and copper. P2X7 receptors {{are sensitive to}} pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) and relatively insensitive to <b>suramin,</b> but the <b>suramin</b> analog, NF279, is much more effective. Other blockers include the large organic cations calmidazolium (a calmodulin antagonist) and KN-62 (a CaM kinase II antagonist).|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} small number of primase inhibitors likely reflects the inherent difficulty of primase assays rather than a lack of potential binding sites on the enzyme. The short length of products synthesized and the generally slow rate of the enzyme compared to other replication enzymes make developing high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches more difficult. Despite the difficulties, there are several known inhibitors of DnaG that are not NTP analogues. Doxorubicin and <b>suramin</b> are both DNA and NTP competitive inhibitors of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis DnaG. <b>Suramin</b> is also known to inhibit eukaryotic DNA primase by competing with GTP, so <b>suramin</b> is likely to inhibit DnaG via a similar mechanism.|$|E
