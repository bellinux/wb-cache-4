5|$|Shortly {{before a}} TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a {{physical}} <b>scuffle</b> with Teddy Hart {{outside of a}} restaurant that was broken up by Sabu. The <b>scuffle</b> reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed three unplanned spots putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around {{the time of the}} <b>scuffle,</b> Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows, leading to speculation he was fired for the incident. Punk, however, said the <b>scuffle</b> had no bearing on his TNA career. He said the reason he and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA pay-per-views was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not connected with the fans as villains, having turned against the popular Raven and instead formed a villainous tag team managed by James Mitchell. The officials decided that since the team was not working as villains, the storyline would be put on hold indefinitely, and thus had no work for Punk or Dinero. Punk officially quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.|$|E
