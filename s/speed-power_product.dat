In the past, the throughput has been increased by increasing the clock rates, but synchronization can become increasingly more difficult. Recently there has been renewed interest in designing asynchronous digital systems. In an asynchronous system, there is no global clock, and all modules communicate through handshaking. In this thesis we demonstrate an implementation of an FIR filter using asynchronous digital circuit techniques. These asynchronous design techniques are used to test whether a practical signal processing filter can be implemented with asynchronous logic. A third-order four-bit filter is developed and simulated with SPICE, comparing favorably with other available technologies in speed and power consumption. Although in practice 8 - 16 bits are needed, this work is sufficient to demonstrate the feasibility of asynchronous circuits for filtering applications. A chip is laid out in 2 micron CMOS, and testing shows {{that it has a}} <b>speed-power</b> <b>product</b> comparable with asynchronous designs fabricated by others. Redacted for privac...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} and refinement of sophisticated fabrication {{techniques such as}} the Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Electron Beam Lithography have introduced {{a new era of}} structural architecture in semiconductor devices. Electron transport in modern sub-micron devices is often governed by principles that are not amenable to the drift-diffusion formalism. This thesis explores two such cases where the drift-diffusion description fails; viz. hot-electron phenomena and quantum effects. A Monte Carlo simulation program has been developed to study hot-electron transport. This has helped to establish an analytical technique for evaluating hot-electron transport parameters and also a scheme for coupling Monte Carlo and drift-diffusion models in order to obtain the advantages of each. Additionally, a model for analyzing quantum effects in the ballistic (collisionless) regime has been developed which is presently being used to study many interesting features of quantum transport. ^ On the experimental side, this thesis was involved with the first demonstration of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in semiconductor microstructures. Based on this effect a novel Quantum Interference Transistor (QUIT) has been proposed which is capable of operating with an extremely low <b>speed-power</b> <b>product</b> of about 10 (2 Ì† 7 - 20) Joules. ...|$|E
