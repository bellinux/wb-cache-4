40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{proliferation}} of the activity, construction management is not a much studied or systematized subject. There are still only pockets of excellence {{in a sea of}} <b>seat-of-the-pant</b> and ad-hoc working. Most second level construction firms do not have systematic recording, documenting, planning and quality control procedures. While the tier- 1 firms have evolved and practice sophisticated systems based on advances in civil engineering and project management, the others are not yet ready to embrace modern practices. The BCA (Buildings Construction Authority) Singapore made efforts to bring some order into the entropy. They codified a simple construction management process which could be easy to adopt by the second and third tier construction companies too. This system is named as CONQUAS, which has been in vogue since the late eighties. Beginning with Singapore, it has spread to the rest of Asia. Larsen and Toubro is an Asian giant corporation. A division of this company, after a lot of study, thought and discussions, decided to adopt the CONQUAS method of construction management. This paper describes how these efforts have borne fruit and the company is planning to adopt the system in more projects. ...|$|R

She developed six-month and one-year student internships that awarded college credits for on-site living and study. According to a 1999 article in the Indianapolis Business Journal: [...] "Pennsylvania State University students in Parks and Recreation Management trek to Maine every January to cut ice". Gammon also created three-day-weekend programs for teachers and students, as well as for paying tourists, in which participants experienced historical living and study. Each weekend group was divided into two families, the Waters and the Prays, and each participant took on the identity of a historical personage. Gammon herself enjoyed playing these historical roles; one of her favorite characters was that of Mercy Lovejoy, an early nineteenth-century Maine pauper. Thousands of Maine schoolchildren also engaged in role-playing during annual field trips to the site. By the time of Gammon's retirement in 1991, over 40,000 people were visiting The Norlands each year.|$|E

They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby Oakland where he began writing lyrics for the band's third album, 24 Hour Revenge Therapy. Jawbreaker travelled to Chicago in May 1993 and recorded {{the bulk of the}} album with engineer Steve Albini, though the album's production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini's cat.

Music journalist Andy Greenwald and Alternative Press Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band's fans. [...] "24 Hour Revenge Therapy is arguably Jawbreaker's best album," [...] writes Greenwald, [...] "but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach's innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of the Replacements with the loose, <b>seat-of-the-pants</b> attitude of Gilman Street punk."

As a result, consumption forecasting remains very much a <b>seat-of-the-pants</b> enterprise. I will argue that if the representative agent assumption is replaced with a model that generates wealth heterogeneity that matches the empirical data, the improved model can provide a sensible analysis of economic questions like “What might the consumption response be to economic stimulus payments?...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{collaborative}} European research project ‘Simulation of UPset Recovery in Aviation’ (SUPRA) is to develop breakthrough simulator technologies for teaching pilots to detect and recover from adverse flight upsets {{that could lead to}} unusual attitudes and loss-of-control. In the project, the high-performance research simulator DESDEMONA is utilized, which integrates a flight simulator having a six-degrees-of-freedom motion platform with a sustained acceleration capability up to 3. 0 g. These characteristics result in improved simulation of motions encountered in upset conditions, compared to conventional fixed base or hexapod simulators. This paper describes a study consisting of two experiments to determine how accurate pilots can judge and reproduce a specific G-level in the DESDEMONA simulator, and respectively, how their control behavior depends on G-forces during unusual attitude recovery. In total seventeen civil pilots, without previous G-maneuvering experience, participated in the study. The results show that pilots without previous G-exposure tend to overestimate G-levels based on their <b>seat-of-the-pants,</b> resulting in performance below the target G-level. With minimum training, their performance instantly improved up to adequate level. However, a retest after six months showed that this improvement did not endure. With respect to aircraft control during recovery from a nose-low unusual attitude, the pilots showed significantly better performance with G-cueing simulation, in terms of deviation from the target G-load, compared to fixed-base simulation in which they tend to ‘over-G’. It can be concluded that G-cueing simulation results in improved upset recovery performance of civil pilots compared to Fixed-base simulation. Hence, simulation of upset recovery with G-cueing may result in more realistic and adequate recovery training...|$|E
40|$|The Union of Northern Workers, {{known as}} the Northwest Territories Public Service Association prior to 1987, is the largest labour union in the Northwest Territories. Northern labour is a little {{explored}} field in Canadian history, and as such, this work surveys new ground. Trade unionism in the North's private sector began {{at the close of}} the Second World War. The UNW, however, like most public sector unions in Canada, had its roots in the 1960 s. This study examines issues pertaining to the union's leadership and staff from 1967, when correctional workers in Yellowknife first organized, until the 1996 convention, when the union took steps to divide into two separate unions in anticipation of the creation of Nunavut in 1999. [...] From its start, the union's geographic jurisdiction distinguished the UNW as unique among Canada's public service unions. It and its predecessor, the NWTPSA represented workers in Canada's most northern reaches. The challenges of life in the North were as real for the union as they were for its members. A relatively small membership spread across such a huge land mass presented obstacles with regards to leadership and service. Also, cultural factors differentiated the organization from others. With an increasing native membership, mostly Inuit, Inuktitut became the union's second language. Distinguishing the union institutionally was its component status within the Public Service Alliance of Canada. The quality of the relationship between these two bodies regularly fluctuated between excellent and belligerent. Similarly, the union's relationship with the Northwest Territories Federation of Labour degenerated from founding member to pariah status, in spite of the UNW comprising the overwhelming majority of the Federation's membership. [...] As the union grew from a fly-by-night, <b>seat-of-the-pants</b> organization of less than 100 members at its inception, to over 5, 000 when it divided, leadership and staffing gained increasing importance. To meet the challenges of representing northern workers, the union increasingly attempted to professionalize its leadership cadre. The effect of this was an increasing distance between members and leaders which ultimately resulted in the secession of the Nunavut membership...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{consumers}} have {{at their disposal}} a plethora of information to access about any given product or service, typically they are well informed, individualistic and demanding. Because their buying habits are frequently difficult to isolate and {{are not limited to}} one market, predicting customer-purchasing habits, switching habits or brand preferences is becoming more like a lottery than a science. All too frequently, small businesses rather than engaging in customised market research to address the changing consumer will use a <b>seat-of-the-pants</b> approach in which to segment their market and target the customer (Boyle 2003). Another related area in which small businesses frequently have trouble addressing is that of attracting suppliers and investors – as many entrepreneurs find that part of their job entails telling the brand story – a short story that ‘sums it up’ and attracts prospective customers, suppliers and investors ([URL] The brand story is the history about the brand and an explanation of what the brand is about, stands for, and its meaning which may be different for each of the brand stakeholders (Holt, 2004). The brand story is built on reputation, should be clear, consistent and have a touch of character exuding a personality, which matches the SME’s preferred prospective client, supplier and investor (Boyle 2003; Matthiesen & Phau 2010). The idea of creating a brand story for many entrepreneurs and small business owners may seem daunting (Berthon, Ewing & Napoli 2008). Typically, as many entrepreneurs are also the HR manager, the investment manager, the financial controller, the sales person, the administration person, the channel manager and the family breadwinner – charged with building a family business that can sustain employment for the next few generations of the family. With high uncertainty and shortness of time and the plethora of roles that many entrepreneurs face, often means that the task of building the brand story typically takes a back seat to other task-oriented roles (Berthon et al 2008; Inskip 2004). This is because, usually building a brand story involves finding a quiet place to sit and think about the business in a longer-term overarching way and then to develop a way in which to articulate this notion that 'sells'. Too often, the day-to-day activities of the business take precedence over strategy development and the building of a brand story (Boyle 2003; Inskip 2004). ...|$|E
40|$|The art environments of Spain – {{like those}} {{the world over}} – display an astounding {{conceptual}} creativity and a vernacular, <b>seat-of-the-pants</b> approach to construction that makes use of locally available found, natural, and recycled objects as well as fabricated components built from scratch. Each result is unique, revealing each creator-builder’s interests, challenges, and concerns as they have developed {{over the course of}} a lifetime; as such, it is easy to understand why art environments are so complex. And because we are able to physically enter into and explore the constructions as visitors, we complete the artworks in the same way as an audience completes a work of theatre. At the same time, we also begin to understand the time-based element that is central to their essence: unlike a painting that is in process until it is finished and is then studied and understood solely on the basis of that final product, art environments are constantly evolving at the same time that they are constantly complete. Yet they are typically neither entirely comprehensible nor clearly viewable from a single perspective; what may at first seem rather chaotic or disordered will often evolve, after multiple viewings from multiple perspectives, into a patterned, rhythmic milieu that is akin to those gestures found in improvisational jazz. In this article, Jo Farb Hernández discusses her encyclopedic project researching Spanish art environments, through which she discovered and thoroughly documented and analyzed dozens of these sites, mostly unknown by the larger world, over the course of more than 14 years. Here she provides short vignettes about twelve of those artists from across the mainland, out of the 45 that were published in her groundbreaking book, Singular Spaces: From the Eccentric to the Extraordinary in Spanish Art Environments. In so doing, she argues for elimination of the negative stereotypes typically invoked in describing these monumental artworks as the work of “outsiders,” and urges those who appreciate the creativity of these self-taught artists to stand with them, via political advocacy and action, to resist the often existential hazards that threaten their safety and stability. Securing ongoing protection for each of these art environments not only enables the artists to continue to explore and extend their visions while safeguarding these sites for future generations to enjoy, but it also serves as another step toward breaking down theoretical art historical barriers between genres, thus leading us to a more expansive understanding of what art can be...|$|E
