30|$|It is a {{landscape}} consisting of fluffy filaments, of gaps and filled parts, concretions {{of pieces of}} ancient cities and deserted, silent <b>spaces.</b> <b>Pieces</b> that draw near to each other moving at different rhythms and in different ways, which contemporary man is recovering possession of, re-using, modifying and renewing the immobile containers from the inside and giving new immaterial meanings to the deserted, silent spaces by weaving new relations once more between the parts with invisible threads.|$|R
5000|$|Liberian Queah is a two-player {{abstract}} strategy {{game from}} Liberia. It is specifically from the Queah tribe. The {{game is played}} on a slanted or diagonal square board with only 13 <b>spaces.</b> <b>Pieces</b> move [...] "orthogonally" [...] along these slanted or diagonal square boards. Another unique feature is that each player must have four (and only four) pieces on the board. Each player's captured piece is resupplied {{at the beginning of}} their next turn with a piece from their reserve (unless of course the player has no more pieces to resupply with).|$|R

5000|$|In Denmark {{and some}} other {{countries}} the board has eight spaces marked with a globe and eight with a star. The globes are safe <b>spaces</b> where a <b>piece</b> cannot be captured. The exception is that a player who has not yet entered all pieces, can always enter a piece on a roll of 6. If the entry space is occupied by another player's piece, that piece is captured. Otherwise the entry spaces work like the other globe <b>spaces.</b> A <b>piece</b> which would have landed on a star instead moves to the next star.|$|R

40|$|The {{program of}} {{understanding}} Shape Theory layer by layer topologically and geometrically [...] proposed in Paper I [...] is now addressed for 4 points in 1 -$d$. Topological shape space graphs {{are far more}} complex here, whereas metric shape <b>spaces</b> are (<b>pieces</b> of) spheres admitting an intricate shape-theoretically significant tessellation. Metric shapes covers a far wider range of notions of inhomogeneity: collisions, symmetric states, mergers and uniform states are all distinctly realized in this model. We furthermore provide quantifiers for {{the extent to which}} various ways which configurations maximally and minimally realize these. Some of the uniform states additionally form cusps and higher catastrophes in the indistinguishable-particle and Leibniz shape spaces. We also provide shape-theoretically significant notions of centre for the indistinguishable-particle and Leibniz shape spaces. 4 points in 1 -$d$ constitutes a useful and already highly nontrivial model of inhomogeneity and of uniformity (both topics of cosmological interest) and also of background independence (of interest in the foundations of physics and in quantum gravity). We finally give the automorphism groups of the topological shape space graphs and the metric shape <b>space</b> (<b>pieces</b> of) manifolds, which is a crucial preliminary toward quantizing the indistinguishable-particle and Leibniz versions of the model.

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{concentrates}} on building and projection of literary space in literature {{for children and}} youth. This work has literary interpretive character and the interpretation {{is based on the}}oretical works devoted to literary space. This thesis is divided in two parts. First part covers the theoretical conception of literary space and is focused mainly on the area of literary topology. Second part is focused on interpretation of individual pieces (The Brothers Lionheart by Astrid Lindgren, The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, Through a Glass, Darkly by Jostein Gaarder, Prince and the Lark by Valja Stýblová). The choice of interpreted books is based on the literary <b>space.</b> <b>Pieces</b> that form the representative sample of possible spaces were chosen. The selection is also limited by the topic the books are addressing. Topics are connected by introducing serious issues of human life to children. This work is devoted to the question, how are these topics projected to literary space and how does the space support them. This work concludes that represented topics are significantly projected in the literary <b>space</b> in these <b>pieces</b> and that the literary space supports their importance, or it alleviates their eeriness...|$|R

5000|$|The board {{consist of}} two triangles {{connected}} {{together at a}} common vertex. Players play {{on opposite sides of}} the board with the base of each triangle forming the first rank of each player. Two lines cross the breadth of each triangle forming the second and third ranks respectively of each player. The common vertex and two line segments one on each side of the common vertex but exterior to both triangles form the fourth rank of each player. The common vertex is also the central point of the board. A single line perpendicular to the base of each triangle runs through the common vertex. There are a total of 19 intersection points and 2 endpoints for a total of 21 points or <b>spaces.</b> <b>Pieces</b> are situated on the intersection points and endpoints (both here-in-forth referred to as [...] "points"), and move along the lines.|$|R
40|$|A chip {{arrangement}} has {{a connection}} system consisting of several individual <b>spaced</b> diamond <b>pieces</b> (12) connected between two chips or between a chip (10) and a substrate (14) preferably by thermo-compression bonding or by soldering with a 80 / 20 Au/Sn or 37 / 63 Pb/Sn solder. Preferably, the substrate is a cooled substrate (14) of Si, AlN, Cu, W-Cu or Mo-Cu and the chip {{is a high}} power chip (10), especially a high power laser rod of AlGaAs/GaAs or InGaAs/GaAs. Also claimed are methods of: (i) bonding a chip (10) to a substrate (14) by applying a diamond layer over the entire surface of a substrate (14), structuring the layer to define individual <b>spaced</b> diamond <b>pieces</b> (12) and bonding the diamond pieces to a chip (10); and (ii) bonding a first chip (10) to a second chip or substrate (14) by applying individual <b>spaced</b> diamond <b>pieces</b> (12) onto the first chip (10) or the second chip or the substrate (14) and then bonding the diamond pieces to the other chip or the substrate. USE - Especially in die-bond or flip-chip technology for producing multi-chip modules or in opto-electronics. ADVANTAGE - The connection system has good thermal conductivity, ensures long life of the chip arrangement and allows mounting of high power laser rods (e. g. of 10 mm x 0. 6 mm x 100 mu m size and 50 W loss power) on a heat sink...|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a {{treasure}} is randomly selected, and the players have to get to the square representing the treasure. On his/her turn, a player throws a die deciding how many <b>spaces</b> his/her <b>piece</b> can move. If the player's piece hits a wall, the metal sphere underneath the board falls off, audible to the player. When this happens, the player forfeits his/her turn, having to move his/her piece back to the starting corner.|$|R
50|$|The Annunciation of the Cartuja de Miraflores {{is notable}} for the detail in objects and {{interesting}} set of perspectives, which creates a perfect illusion of <b>space.</b> This <b>piece</b> incorporates a northern influence with contemporary Spanish style in an interior scene and was supposedly commissioned by Queen Isabel.

5000|$|A {{blockade}} {{is formed}} when {{two pieces of}} a single player occupy the same <b>space.</b> No <b>piece</b> of any player may move through a blockade, including pieces of the blockade owner. Blockade pieces may not be moved forward together with the roll of a double. Another player's piece cannot land in a space occupied by a blockade, even to leave its nest. Local rules may {{limit the number of}} turns that a blockade can stay in place.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} spatial density matrices, which are {{singularly}} {{important in the}} study of quantum entanglement, encode the electronic fluctuations and correlations responsible for covalent bonding. From these density matrices, we develop tools that allow us to analyse how many body wave functions can be broken up into real <b>space</b> <b>pieces.</b> We apply these tools to the first row dimers, and in particular, we address the conflicting evidence in the literature about the presence of an inverted fourth bond and anti-ferromagnetic correlations in the C_ 2 molecule. Our results show that many body effects enhance anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations but are not related to the formation of an inverted fourth bond. We identify two inverted bonds in the C_ 2 molecule and establish their correspondence to the bonds in the Be_ 2 molecule. Additionally, we provide a new interpretation of the Mayer index, introduce partial bonds to fix deficiencies in molecular orbital theory, and prove the Hartree-Fock wave function for C_ 2 is not a triple bond. Our results suggest that entanglement-based methods can lead to a more realistic treatment of molecular and extended systems than possible before. Comment: 22 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
