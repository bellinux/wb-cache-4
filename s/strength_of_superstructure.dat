40|$|Abstract:—Road {{transport}} is {{the most}} commonly used way of transportation in India and in many countries. The passenger bus {{plays an important role in}} public transport. The capacity of carrying more passengers compared to other road transport medium is unfavourable in the event of major bus accident. The rollover crash accident of passenger bus, although occurs less frequently than any other type of accident, the fatality rate and severe injuries are highest in rollover crash. Hence the structure of the bus needs to be strong enough to ensure the minimum damage and at the same time it should absorb maximum impact energy. Safety regulations are in force defining minimum structural rigidity under rollover crash. The Automotive Industry Standard (AIS- 031) is implemented in India since October 2008 which specifies the requirements and methods to calculate the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> of buses during and after rollover. The AIS- 031 specifies four different test methods viz. physical rollover test on a complete vehicle, rollover test on a body section, pendulum test on a body section, and verification of <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> by calculation (numerical simulation). In this work numerical simulation of rollover test using finite element method is followed. First the numerical model is build according to the guidelines provided in AIS- 031 and validated by the experimental testing. A validated numerical model is used to evaluate the rollover performance of the superstructure of the bus. Keywords: — Bus rollover, Occupant safety, AIS- 031, Numerical simulation, RADIOSS I...|$|E

Abstract: The design <b>of</b> <b>Superstructure</b> constructed with aluminum alloy {{do not have}} to follow the traditional standard design method. It can be designed by applying strength theory and ANSYS program or MSC Patran / Nastran program, which can ensure the strength requirements with the selected aluminum alloy components and make the weight of the ship lightest. In this paper, the 42. 4 m catamaran sightseeing boat is used as an example. The structural <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> constructed with aluminum alloy is calculated by MSC Patran / Nastran program. The distribution <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> stress is obtained, which proved the size of the selected components <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> can meet the requirements <b>of</b> the local <b>strength</b> and can be the reference of selecting the structure size. As the other conditions are unchanged, the the local thickness of the junction of the front wall and the side wall of the compass deck is changed. the relationship between plate thickness and stress is obtained. It is found that as The plate thickness is thicker, the stress there decreases; and as the thickness is smaller, it is obvious to reduce stress as the plate thickness Increase. when the thickness increases to a certain extent, the effect of the plate stress decreases is not obvious...|$|R
40|$|The superyacht {{manufacturing}} industry is currently facing big challenges, mainly {{related to the}} present economic crisis. Manufacturers are then competing on the ground of better and more aesthetic external and interior designs. This trend often leads to structural strength related issues, which can compromise the static or dynamic stability of superyacht hull. In several instances, the aforementioned fact is met, as in large openings and docks to recover tenders, the enlargement of windows to allow for better lighting of internal living spaces. So, for what the hull is concerned, large windows replaced small portholes on the yacht sides at mid length, rising non trivial problems about longitudinal strength. The same trend appeared on superstructures sides where traditional windows have been enlarged till to became glass doors extended from deck to deck which allow passengers to enjoy full sea landscapes. Despite the {{positive effect on the}} general design performance, this nice innovation implies serious structural problems. In fact in side areas where these doors are fitted the only structural elements are represented by very slender vertical stiffeners. The combined action of bending and compressive loads, together with the fact that superstructures are usually made by aluminium light alloy, can be the cause of buckling phenomena with severe consequences on structure and glass integrity. In this paper the contribution to steel hull <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> light alloy <b>superstructures</b> with large openings is studied by the finite element approach. A deep investigation <b>of</b> local <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> has been assessed as well...|$|R

The number of fatalities and serious injured passengers proved that although this type of accident is rear, {{it is the most}} serious bus accident. Data can be found in this statistics about the small buses and double decker (high buses and coaches) too which are not covered yet by ECE Regulation 66. The different kind of rollover accidents (turn on side, roll dawn from the road into a ditch, falling into a precipice, combined rollover accident, etc.) may be studied. The standard accident – which is the basis of the approval test in an international regulation – is analysed {{on the basis of the}} accident statistics. The paper shows the development of the standard rollover test used in the ECE Regulation 66 (required <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> bus <b>superstructure</b> in rollover) and points out the problem of the “limited deformation”. The limited deformation is an existing problem of the Regulation 66 created by the used standard rollover test.

Testing is guided by the standards that apply to a state. One of the standards used at many countries in the word is ECE-R 66 (Economic Commission for Europe-Regulation 66) which regulates the construction and design of many types of passenger vehicles. In this research, methods of testing are the pendulum test and it was simulated by Finite element software soft ware. The purposes of this study are evaluating compatibility this software, determining energy absorption capacity and the deformation that occurs in the superstructure when a loads subjected from the outside <b>of</b> <b>superstructure.</b> In the pendulum test simulation the maximum deformation value is 520 mm at time is 0. 45 s, and 466 mm at time is 1. 5 s.

Beside it, the simulation show the energy is absorbed by the superstructure at rollover test simulation equal to 66. 23 % [...] Base on simulation result, it can be concluded that the modeling vehicle is indicated safety for passenger if occure rollover accident...|$|R
40|$|<b>Superstructure</b> <b>of</b> a RO-RO ship {{plays an}} {{important}} role to allocate things inside the ship, for instance passengers, cars, goods and so on. <b>Superstructure</b> consists <b>of</b> transversal and longitudinal deck beam to support the structure.

The earthquake ground motion is modeled as a uniformly modulated non-stationary random process. The stochastic response of isolated structure is obtained using the state variable approach. An equivalent linearization technique is used for the approximate response of isolated structure with non-linear isolation systems. The mean square superstructure acceleration and bearing displacement of the system are plotted under different system parameters and compared with the corresponding response of rigid sup erstructure condition to study the influence <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> flexibility. The comparison of response is made under various isolation system parameters (i. e. isolation period, damping, yield <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> elastomeric bearings and friction coefficient of sliding systems).

40|$|Stochastic {{response}} of buildings isolated by lead-rubber bearings (LRB) is investigated. The earthquake excitation is modelled by non-stationary random process (i. e. uniformly modulated broadband excitation). The stochastic {{response of}} isolated building frames is obtained using the time-dependent equivalent linearization technique as the force-deformation behaviour of the LRB is highly non-linear. The nonstationary response of isolated structure is {{compared with the}} corresponding stationary response in order to study the influence of non-stationary characteristics of earthquake motion. For a given isolated building system and excitation, {{it is observed that}} there exists an Optimum value <b>of</b> the yield <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> LRB for which the root mean square absolute acceleration <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> attains the minimum value. The optimum yield <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> LRB is obtained under important parametric variations such as isolation period and damping ratio of the LRB and the frequency content and intensity of earthquake excitation. It is shown that the above parameters have significant effects on the optimum yield <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> LRB. Finally, closed-form expressions for the optimum yield <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> LRB and corresponding response of the isolated structure are proposed. These expressions were derived based on the model of isolated structure with rigid superstructure condition subjected to stationary white-noise excitation. It was observed that there is a good comparison between the proposed closed-form expressions and actual optimum parameters and response of the isolated building system. These expressions can be used for initial optimal design of LRB for building system. Copyright (C) 2008, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{torsional}} coupling, due to isolator parameters, on the seismic response of base-isolated buildings are presented. The isolated building is modelled as a single-storey structure mounted on different isolation {{devices such as}} elastomeric and sliding systems involving non-linear restoring forces. The governing equations of motion for the uncoupled and torsionally coupled system are derived and solved in time domain by Newmark's method of integration to obtain lateral-torsional displacement response. The displacement response of the isolated system with different combinations of structural configurations, isolation systems and the ratio of uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency {{of the system is}} investigated. A comparison of the response of the torsionally coupled base-isolated building is made with the corresponding response obtained from torsionally uncoupled base-isolated building. In addition, a parametric study is conducted to observe the effect <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> flexibility on the displacements in torsionally coupled base-isolated building. The eccentricities arising due to the asymmetries in the isolation stiffness and/ or yield <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the isolators are compared with the eccentricity in the system as specified by the Uniform Building Code (UBC 1997).
