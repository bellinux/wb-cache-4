The location on the 78th parallel north is favorable to communication with satellites in low polar orbits. The facility consists of 31 antenna systems, both multi-mission and customer dedicated, making SvalSat the world's largest commercial ground station. They are variously capable of communication in the C, L, S and X bands. SvalSat makes use of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems' <b>Space</b> <b>Link</b> Extension protocols, an international standard for ground station to satellite communication.

50|$|A {{benefit of}} {{implementing}} multiple services over a message abstraction layer {{is that it}} is easier to bind these to different underlying technologies and protocol encodings.

Hence the same service can be implemented over ground-based network technologies and middleware, or it could even be carried across the <b>space</b> <b>link</b> itself.The services themselves provide the ‘plug-and-play’ interface for applications, allowing them to be integrated and deployed wherever is appropriate for the mission.|$|E

Automated data transfer methods have been developed for the terrestrial Internet.

5000|$|The {{evolution}} of space data system standards {{has gone on}} in parallel with the {{evolution of}} the Internet, with conceptual cross-pollination where fruitful, but largely as a separate evolution. Since the late 1990s, familiar Internet protocols and CCSDS <b>space</b> <b>link</b> protocols have integrated and converged in several ways, for example, the successful FTP file transfer to Earth-orbiting STRV 1B on January 2, 1996, which ran FTP over the CCSDS IPv4-like Space Communications Protocol Specifications (SCPS) protocols. [...] Internet Protocol use without CCSDS has taken place on spacecraft, e.g., demonstrations on the UoSAT-12 satellite, and operationally on the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.
