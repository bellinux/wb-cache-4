First, climate change: without government intervention to jump-start massive private investment in clean technologies, governments, by default, encourage investment in dirtier technologies.

40|$|Partnerships {{for rural}} {{development}} are often presented as powerful ways of promoting 'integration'. This paper examines {{the reality of}} this claim, first by analysing what 'integration' means and then presenting {{a case study of}} a Dutch rural partnership that shows how 'integration' was diluted by the 'politics of sectoring'. In this case study, 'integration' was taken to mean harmonizing <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies</b> for the physical environment and to imply the integration of competing land-use claims. Representatives of different policy sectors sought to safeguard and advance their sectoral objectives through a number of strategies, including expanding conflicts to other playing fields and containing conflicts through private settlement. The interplay of these interests created a paradoxical outcome. The existing <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies</b> were maintained and 'integration' was achieved through the spatial separation of the most conflicting land uses, those of intensive husbandry farming and protecting nature. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture sees such partnerships as a good example of 'integrated rural policy' but the example shows that the integration of existing <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies</b> for the physical environment {{has little to do with}} the achievement of wider socio-economic objective...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has provided significant {{insights into the}} impact which policy networks, or institutionalised patterns of state-society relations have on the policy process. One branch of this literature highlights how achieving {{a high degree of}} sectoral embeddedness can enhance the state’s capacity to achieve industrial transformation and bolster economic competitiveness (Evans 1995, Weiss 1998). This paper builds on this research by assessing the impact of dense <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> networks on the political dynamics of economy-wide, as opposed to sectoral business mobilisation. In the case of the recent politics of tax reform in Japan it would appear that concentrated <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> networks may actually compromise the state’s reformative capacity. The argument here is that dense industry specific policy networks exacerbate sectoral differences over tax reform and tend to create factional cleavages among state agencies and policy makers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{engages with}} {{a debate in}} the {{literature}} on the political economy of China’s industrial reforms about the determinants of major policy trajectories in that country’s strategic industries. A common approach understands central-level policy processes and their structural outcomes in strategic sectors to be subject to active and effective central government guidance, often applied via control over state-owned industry. A less common perspective, on the other hand, has argued that policy formulation and implementation in a number of strategic industries are often dominated by large central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) capable of imposing their own preferences on <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy.</b> Addressing these partially opposing perspectives, this thesis analyses political processes underlying major policy developments in China’s electricity supply industry since 2002, finding that neither approach sufficiently accounts for the complexity of interactions between government and SOEs during the formulation and implementation of <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy.</b> ‘Government-centred’ accounts were found to have exaggerated the effectiveness of central government’s policy guidance while underappreciating SOEs’ considerable <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> impact. ‘SOE-centred’ accounts, on the other hand, have similarly overstated their claims while furthermore giving a distorted perspective of the mechanisms through which SOEs’ policy influence occurs. Building on findings from the case of electricity supply, this thesis establishes an alternative account of the political interplay between both sides and its relevance for sectoral policy-making in China’s strategic industries. It illustrates that central SOEs autonomously pursue their own industrial reform agendas which often deviate from government’s sectoral preferences and from existing <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy.</b> However, it contends that these firms are only able to realise contentious sectoral objectives by tactically ‘synchronising’ them with cross-sectoral policy agendas pursued by central government. When sectoral reform goals diverge and ‘synchronisation’ is absent, policy gridlock often ensues. Overall, this thesis finds that central government’s sectoral guidance over strategic industries is subject to substantial interference by central SOEs, but that this interference largely takes place within the confines of government-sanctioned cross-sectoral policy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Theoretical {{studies of}} EU {{enlargement}} have mainly {{focused on the}} macro-level of enlargement, namely under which conditions the EU decides to enlarge. We still miss a conceptual framework to analyse the sectoral dynamics of enlargement that specifies under which conditions the preferences of the candidate countries are accommodated in EU policy. I argue that an accommodation of the candidates ’ preferences depends crucially on policy advocates in the EU. The influence of these policy advocates is structured {{by the nature of}} enlargement as a composite policy, in which sectoral decisions are negotiated between the group of policy-makers with primary responsibility for enlargement as such, and various groups of <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> makers. The policy advocates ’ impact on sectoral policies thus depends (1) on their access to decision-making, which is shaped by the structure of the policy process, as well as (2) their ability to build alliances with sectoral policy-makers. Crucially, alliance-building does not only depend on the strength of sectoral interest groups, but also on the compatibility between the candidates ’ preferences and the <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> paradigms that shape the preferences of the sectoral policy-makers...|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper has}} as purpose the {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} way in which sustainable development is approached within EU and Romania. By this analysis it is aimed to identify ways and solutions for improving the future strategy of sustainable development in Romania. Most quoted definition of sustainable development is found in the Bruntland report, where sustainable development is described as „development meeting the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their own needs”. In order to make this concept operational, the greatest challenges for sustainability within EU and Member States were taken into consideration. Several of the evolutions contrary to sustainable development have as starting point the choices made in the past regarding technology and infrastructure, use of land, etc. Many of these issues have common roots. Companies and individuals often face motivations triggering production and consumption in a way contrary to sustainable development. They may be insufficiently informed about chain effects generated by their actions, or about the available alternatives. Institutional hindrances make difficult the remedy to these inadvertencies. The most acute menaces facing sustainable development originate, as a rule, from some areas of <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies.</b> For instance, the attempt to face challenges facing population health might require enforcement of active actions in industry, agriculture, fiscal policy. When the policies are enforced sector by sector, disregarding effects on other sectors, the discrepancy between <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies</b> inevitably shows. The Strategy for Sustainable Development (SSD) allows for the identification of actions to be undertaken in order to remedy the situation. sustainable development, <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies,</b> strategy for sustainable development...|$|R
