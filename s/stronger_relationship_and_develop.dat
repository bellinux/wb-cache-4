40|$|Introduction The {{proportion}} {{of older adults}} throughout the world has increased significantly {{over the last decade}} and continues to rise. Such substantial growth highlights the importance of facilitating older people 2 ̆ 7 s wellbeing. This research aimed to identify enablers and barriers to participation in community-based activities experienced by active older adults. Method This qualitative study employed the evidence-based paradigm of occupation and Model of Human Occupation to underpin protocol and discussion. Ten participants (females = 9, males = 1) who were aged 64 - 83 years and actively engaged in their community took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants reported mixed health levels including chronic/terminal illnesses and normal degenerative changes. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Analysis identified four themes of enablers and barriers to community participation. These were: relationships; interests; personal knowledge and awareness towards health and wellbeing; and resources and the environment. Conclusion Intrinsic factors such as <b>developing</b> or maintaining <b>strong</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> interests were identified as enabling community participation. Barriers identified within this study included unappealing group cultures or structures, such as having limited opportunity to develop friendships or explicitly targeting 2 ̆ 7 seniors aged 60 + years 2 ̆ 7 and accessibility limitations. Recommendations were established to inform the development of programmes to increase community participation among this group. © The College of Occupational Therapists Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to examine the {{mediating}} role of relationship quality in the online context. By investigating this major tenet of customer relationship management theory in this nascent service setting, this paper clarifies the interaction between service quality <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> quality, as they impact on customer loyalty. The findings reveal some fundamental differences in the way that <b>strong</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>and</b> loyalty <b>develop</b> in the online setting vis-a-vis the offline setting. The findings of this empirical research support the existence of a partial mediating relationship. While effective service delivery was found to enhance the quality of customer-firm <b>relationships,</b> <b>and</b> consequently, the customer 2 ̆ 7 s perceived loyalty to their main financial institution; there was also evidence of a concurrent link between service quality and loyalty. This finding suggests that a <b>strong</b> <b>relationship</b> does not make customers immune to poor future services, and that firms operating in the online environment should maintain high service standards if they are to enjoy continued loyalty from their customers...|$|R
40|$|The {{older adult}} {{population}} in Western Australia (WA) has significantly {{increased over the}} last decade and continues to grow, highlighting the importance of maintaining their health, wellbeing and independence. This may be achieved by facilitating active ageing, enabling older adults to continue to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, contribute positively to society, and lower the demand on costly health and human services. Conversely, a lack of social engagement and community participation may hinder healthy ageing and lead to social isolation, which is adversely related to the quality of life and health status of older adults. Occupational participation is critical to active ageing and occupational therapists have the capacity to facilitate older adults’ continued connection with their community. To date, there appears a paucity of occupational therapy research exploring the factors contributing to the community and social participation of community dwelling older adults living in WA. Research indicates that programs and activities encouraging community and social engagement are more successful when they have been developed with the input of the participants they are targeting. Therefore, this research aimed to identify barriers and enablers to participation in community-based activities experienced by older adults living in the northern suburbs of metropolitan Perth, WA. This generic qualitative exploratory study employed the Theory of Human Occupation and the Model of Human Occupation framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 older adults, and transcripts analysed using thematic analysis. Analysis identified four reoccurring themes of meaning that were enablers and/or barriers to community participation. These were: relationships; interests; personal knowledge and awareness; and resources and the environment. It was concluded that intrinsic factors such as <b>developing</b> or maintaining <b>strong</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> interests enabled community participation. Barriers identified within this study included group culture and group structure (e. g. over 60 years specific) and difficulty accessing transport. Recommendations were established to inform the development of future programs aimed at increasing community participation amongst this grou...|$|R

Such initiatives are regarded as pivotal for survival and achieving competitive advantage (Porter 1998).

The study evaluates the best practice relationship with service quality (SERVQUAL), using descriptive and inferential statistics.

We accept the hypothesis that best practice initiatives are positively associated with service quality.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an early childhood Professional Development School (PDS) partnership between an all kindergarten elementary school and,a comprehensive state university, {{focusing on the}} process of collaboration between partners. The process began in the spring 2002 semester, with the school principal inviting the university faculty and PDS coordinator to meet with school faculty and discuss the. PDS. School faculty members supported the idea and were invited to attend a PDS summer workshop. They met with university faculty to discuss and plan for the PDS. The school faculty, principal, and university faculty agreed to meet monthly to discuss relevant literature of interest to the group. The early childhood curriculum course is taught in the elementary school art room. University interns are in the kindergarten classrooms twice a week, and university faculty visit classrooms each Tuesday and Thursday. The interns plan, implement, and assess lessons in collaboration with the classroom teachers. The PDS partnership has set and is meeting several goals to promote teacher, intern, and student achievement (e. g., increasing public school student achievement, <b>developing</b> <b>strong</b> collaborative professional <b>relationships,</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> teachers in leadership roles).
