40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the English Jesuit Father Thomas Stephens used a language full of Hindu connotations for conveying a Christian message in his Marathi epic Kristapurāṇa, written in Goa {{in the early}} years of the 17 th century. Specifically it seeks to analyse (1) which words Stephens used for speaking about salvation, (2) which ideas about salvation he thereby conveyed, and (3) how he dealt with connotations of such words that are difficult to accommodate in a Christian worldview. Stephens’ strategies for handling such words is analysed by means of Saussure’s understanding of a language as a system of differences and a word as a sign, composed of a signal (sound pattern) and a signification (concept), where the relation between signal and signification is arbitrary. Stephens’ work is described as fearlessly adopting signals borrowed from Hinduism but sometimes altering the signification, thereby forming a sign which looks identical to that used in Hindu context, but with a signification that fits in a Christian worldview. The altering of important signs, such as mukti/mokṣa, leads to a reshaping of the language into a system where e. g. mukti/mokṣa <b>significates</b> salvation as liberation, but not from rebirth, and where punarjanma stands not for rebirth as a hindrance for liberation, but a new birth which liberates. In this way Stephens is found to present a message about salvation that in all essentials mirrors Catholic theology of his time, but giving it a distinctly Indian flavour...|$|R

The remainder of cotton stalk in farms is an illness-causing agent and leads to yield reduction in the next cultivation stage, an event which requires burial. So the usage of cotton stalk in the pulp and paper industry,which faces a shortage of raw material, results in a reduction intillage costs, thus, fiber and stalk yield potential gain importance. In this study, we investigated the effect of variety and harvesting time on cotton yield and its components, which was obtained from experiments of the plot of the 2009 cultivation year. An amount of dry material of each part of the components was also obtained. Experiments on factors containedfive varieties: Sepid, Sahel, Armaghan, Golestan and number 200.

40|$|Introduction:The periimplant probing, as parodontal probing, it's {{a common}} {{practice}} to check the health status of both soft and hard tissues sorrounding the implant. The aim of this work is to evaluate, by the relevations made by two independent operators, how the periimplant probing deeph could be influenced, or not, by the presence, or not, of an implant supported prosthetic crown. Materials and methods:The sample was formed by 7 patients, (5 females and 2 males, including 6 non-smokers and 1 smoker) {{with at least one}} implant. A total of 18 implants were evaluated. For each implant has been executed 4 probings: with and without prosthetic crown, and then, after at least 15 days, by a second "blind" operator. Four probing points were set (m-b-d-p/l). The accuracy of probings misurations indipendently done by the two operators has been calculated by the Paerson's correlation test. The unilateral Student's statistic T-test was utilized to evaluate the presence of statistically significant differencies between the probings done with and without prosthetic crowns (p< 0. 05). Results: By the data obtained with the periimplant probings recorded by the two operators clearly appears that there isn't any statistically significant difference between the probing made with the crown inserted and without the crown inserted, becouse the p values are all superior to the significancy level of the test (a = 0. 05). Discussion: Many studies have been recorded in literature regarding the confrontation of periimplant and parodontal probings, but a study regarding the influence of the prosthetic manufact was never done. This study tried to verify if differences between the sample implants with and without crown were present, but the limit of the study was the little amount of clinical cases. Conclusion: This preliminary clinical study underlined that probings made when the implant is supporting the prosthetic crown, or not, is not presenting statistically <b>significating</b> differences...|$|R

40|$|The theme {{we intend}} to discuss deals with the archaeological landscapes; we propose to inves-tigate a method of intervention, {{starting}} from both acquiring knowledge {{about the history of}} archaeological landscapes and setting a theoretical frame to point out the relationship between the archaeology fragments and the landscape as a whole, and its changing during the time. According with Farinelli (1991), “landscape” isn’t a summary of things, but it’s a way to represent and look at the things in the world, when only through the landscape the things of the world stay together and it’s possible perceive them in their entirety. Therefore the ar-chaeological ruins represent a treasure of sense, because if they certainly mark an absence - for their state of fragmentation that doesn’t allow to recognize their functionality – they all repre-sent a presence that testifies their eternity; when they are part of our landscape, they allow us to individuate the spatial relations between the several existing tracks of the ancient architec-ture. The local archaeological heritage in Italy is an element that strongly characterize the land-scape; therefore we can’t consider landscape just as the natural environment but we have to understand how it has been modified according to human activity and construction, and try to find out historical, physical and geographical characters, to preserve it and to plan improve-ments in its usability, accessibility and enhancement. Archaeological landscape as common good could be the key-word to synthesize our point of view. The archeological landscape is going to be analyzied in its dual character, defined by Hum-boldt (Il cosmo, 2008) as “double sense with allusion”, meaning that a some world has two senses: its aesthetic nature, in which take place change of cultural <b>significates</b> related to hu-man being’s activities, and scientific meaning, that is measurable, universal and objective. Starting from these two different points of view, our paper intends to deal with the coast of Vesuvian territory, a very complex built environment which is very rich in terms of archaeo-logical fragments, as the several roman villas as Villa dei Papiri, Villa dei Misteri, Villa di Oplontis and Villa Sora. The different tracks can be red and understood not only as historical ruins, but in their en-tirety and completeness in our nowadays landscape; to this aim we need a reformulation of new interpretating and designing items on this palimpsest, that need to communicate to fu-ture generations the ruins’ significance in the contemporary landscape and city...|$|R

The notion of investment is extremely complex, perceived with different meanings and <b>significates.</b> In a general, wider meaning the investments represent a capital placement which is made with the purpose of obtaining profit bearing incomes in the future. In a narrower meaning, investments mean the totality of expenses made for obtaining capital assets which are future potential factors in the formation of incomes. Investments represent the most important factor in the development strategies of the national economy as well as in all the business fields and branches. The investment strategy represents an important element in the management of the investments and a component of the general strategy of the entity. The use of investment strategies in the management activity implies the application of scientific techniques and methods. The great number of studies carried out shows that there were no certain answers formed, very often the option for a form of financing or the other is influenced only by the “level of accessibility” of the resources available on the financial market and the financing policy of many companies is guided rather by the constraints of the financial market than a coherent company strategy In order to ensure a constant economic growth it is necessary to prepare investment projects. In practice the predominant one is the investment activity based on real investments performed for the modernising of assets, in order to ensure their physical and moral wear and tear.

40|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} in studying human values: the macro-global approach and the micro or individual approach. Within the first approach there are three major models. The first views values as absolute universals that should be: the second views values as the actual relative patterns of behavior: and the third scales values to natural self-actualizing, modern or urban humans. Within the micro-approach, there are four models. The first places more focus on the affective psycho-dynamic part of values: the second views values as cognitive representations. The decision making model views values as independent dimensions which guide decisions, and the action model reveals the built-in discrepancy between the espoused values and values in use. Most of these models lack the dynamic and the comprehensive perspective which combines the micro and macro analytic levels. The alternative model proposed in this thesis suggests three levels for rediscovering value dynamics and four approaches to measure them. The first level is the signification process that triggers global activation spreadings with intensity equal to {{the significance of the}} perceived object to the individual's survival and growth values or their derivatives. There are three kinds of signification: object-signification, values-signification, and self-signification. Self-signification is the core of valuation dynamics at this level and the source of valuepathy and psychological health. The second level in addressing value dynamics may be performed by analyzing the value system as self programming mechanisms. Values and their derivatives, which are the reference criteria in the signification process, are materialized in micro, or intrasystem, and macro, or inter-system, programming. On the micro-processing level {{there are two kinds of}} dynamic processes: the valuative states formation, like anticipation and familiarity and their specific derivatives, such as attitudes, preferences, and likings. The second is the value programming and packaging mechanisms. Within these packaging mechanisms there are different kinds of internal processing subroutines and algorithms. Within these programming mechanisms there are two kinds of statements: declarative, or non-executable, statements, which are these kinds of abstract universal values, and executable, or command, statements, which are either negative or positive, imperative or conditional self-orders. At this level, values are selfprescriptive programs and algorithms that function to secure a base line of readiness for effective coping. The third level of addressing value dynamics is the level of real time macro-processing. The individual develops through <b>significating</b> and coping to outside events his network of automated and non-automated personal survival and growth strategies which are dependent on both his valuative competencies and environmental availabilities. Flexibility, which is characterized by the selectivity syndrome inherent in it, is the source of different valuative competencies to plunge, to transcend, to balance, and to automate. Four measurement approaches have been proposed to check the validity and practicality of this model. The first centers on the assessment of valuative maturities and competencies. The second focuses on examining value processing dynamics. The third emphasizes evaluating valuepathy and its manifestation. The fourth combines all the available techniques in a value contextual analysis through task and case studies. Four extensions, or clarifications, of this model have been proposed to extend it to cover and explain macro-analysis, value contents, supernatural and natural belief systems, and to develop it to be more specific through sub-modeling of the specific areas of behavior...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{systems of}} {{nonlinear}} equations appear in many applications. In various applications, {{the solution of}} the nonlinear equations should also be in a certain interval. A typical application is a discretized system of reaction diffusion equations. It is well known that chemical species should be positive otherwise the solution is not physical and in general blow up occurs. Recently, a projected Newton method has been developed, which can be used to solve this type of problems. A drawback is that the projected Newton method is not globally convergent. This motivates us to develop a new feasible projected Newton–Krylov algorithm for solving a constrained system of nonlinear equations. Combined with a projected gradient direction, our feasible projected Newton–Krylov algorithm circumvents the non-descent drawback of search directions which appear in the classical projected Newton methods. Global and local superlinear convergence of our approach is established under some standard assumptions. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate that the new projected Newton method is globally convergent and is a <b>significate</b> complementarity for Newton–Krylov algorithms known in the literature.
