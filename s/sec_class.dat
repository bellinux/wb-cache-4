40|$|Three pigeons pecked {{for food}} in an {{experiment}} in which reinforcements were arranged for responses terminating sequences of interresponse times. Each reinforced interresponse time belonged to a class extending either from 1. 0 to 2. 0 <b>sec</b> (<b>class</b> A) or from 3. 0 to 4. 5 <b>sec</b> (<b>class</b> B). Reinforcements were arranged by a single variable-interval schedule and a random device that assigned each reinforcement to one of four sequences of two successive interresponse times: AA, AB, BA, or BB. Throughout the experiment, half of the reinforcements were delivered for interresponse times in class A and half for those in class B. Over conditions, the interresponse time preceding a reinforced interresponse time always, half of the time, or never, belonged to class A. The duration of the interresponse time preceding a reinforced one had a pronounced effect on response patterning. It also had a pronounced effect on the overall response probability, which was highest, intermediate, and lowest, when the interresponse time preceding a reinforced interresponse time always, half of the time, or never, belonged to class A, respectively. In no case were successive interresponse times independent, so that overall response probability was not representative of momentary response probabilities...|$|E
40|$|Participants in the U. S. {{capital markets}} can be sued for {{securities}} fraud by a mishmash of enforcers, including the <b>SEC,</b> <b>class</b> action plaintiffs, and state regulators. Does this multi-enforcer approach make sense from a deterrence perspective? This Article {{suggests that the}} answer is probably no. Although in theory there are conditions under which a multi-enforcer approach would promote optimal deterrence, it is unclear at best that those conditions exist in the United States. And further empirical research, while warranted, is unlikely to resolve the issue definitively. The status quo tends to persevere {{in the face of this}} sort of irreducible uncertainty. But this Article argues that a better response would be to grant a federal agency, like the SEC, exclusive authority to prosecute national securities frauds, while at the same time enacting reforms designed to better align the agency’s enforcement incentives with the public interest (thus protecting against the risk that it would under-deter). In addition to conferring the benefits of simplicity, a unitary-enforcer approach would allow the United States to capture important enforcer-based efficiency gains that are unattainable in the current regime...|$|E

40|$|A preparative {{method was}} {{developed}} to sample dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and heavy metals (Ni, Mn) from polluted surface waters. Main focus was set on the preparative production of freeze-dried samples mainly composed of organic ligands from heavy metal complexes. First characterizations were done in the aqueous phase. Finally, freeze-dried samples provide stable organic matter for multiple characterizations. Acid mine drainage of the former mining area of Ronneburg (Germany) hold elevated concentrations of heavy metals and low concentrations of DOC. Municipal wastewater, passing the spoil pile, held elevated concentrations of DOC and low concentrations of heavy metals. Dissolved components smaller than 0. 45 mu m and larger than 1 nm were concentrated by nanofiltration. Organic heavy metal complexes were isolated from this solution by size-exclusion chromatography (<b>SEC).</b> Different size <b>classes</b> of molecules were collected from the column effluent, depending on their elution time, and were characterized by UV spectroscopy, ICP-OES, and DOC measurements. All samples held organic heavy metal compounds with different retention times. The organic heavy metal complexes in acid mine drainage had higher retention times than complexes from municipal wastewater. Most interestingly, we found different affinities of heavy metals to different size classes of DOC. This affinity of the heavy metals differs with size and origin of the DOC. [References: 47...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Health care {{delivery}} is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} various levels of government in Nigeria {{where most of the}} populace earn less than one dollar a day. The total expenditure on Nigerian health care as a percentage of gross domestic product, and the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is far below the World Health Organization recommended standard. Thus, caregivers pay out of their pockets to settle health care expenses of their children thereby creating a negative microeconomic impact on parents, households and health workers. Herein, we report the case management of newly diagnosed Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) in an eight-year-old boy from a low socioeconomic <b>class</b> (<b>SEC),</b> and the costs implication of the child’s hospital care. After forgoing indirect costs like opportunity cost which is difficult to determine, the direct total cost involved in patient’s hospital care for DKA was forty eight thousand eight hundred naira only (N 48, 800. 00) equivalent to three hundred and ten United States Dollars and eighty three cents (310. 83 USD).

40|$|AbstractThe AB 2 C model (Activity-Based {{modeling}} {{framework for}} Black Carbon exposure assessment) {{was developed to}} assess personal exposure to air pollution, more specifically black carbon. Currently the model calculates exposure in Flanders, an urbanized region in Western Europe. This model {{is characterized by the}} use of time-activity patterns, and air pollution concentrations with a high spatial and temporal resolution, including indoors and in the transport microenvironment. This model can be used for disaggregated exposure assessment or the evaluation of policy scenarios. In this paper, exposure of people from a lower socioeconomic <b>class</b> (<b>SEC)</b> is compared to the exposure of people from a higher SEC. In most North American studies, it is reported that poorer people are exposed to higher concentrations and suffer more from health effects associated with elevated exposure to air pollution. In Europe, fewer studies exist in this field, and results are not always conclusive. In this study, people from a lower SEC were found to be exposed to higher concentrations at home, but ‘richer’ people travel more, especially in traffic peak hours. This results in an average exposure that is higher for members of a lower SEC, but inhaled doses are similar in both groups. This analysis suggests that differences in health impact between the groups are almost completely explainable by increased susceptibility to air pollution health effects, and not by increased air pollutant intake...|$|R
40|$|Background. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a {{heterogeneous}} condition {{that is well}} known to cause impairments {{with varying degrees of}} severity. The gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) is widely used to assess ambulatory function in CP, but {{little is known about the}} factors that account for the variations in gross motor function in children. The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between the severity of gross motor dysfunction (GMD) and certain factors such as the type of CP, aetiology of CP, nutrition, socioeconomic <b>class</b> (<b>SEC),</b> and the frequency of these accompanying impairments like visual, auditory, cognitive and speech impairments. Methods. This was a cross-sectional observational study of 100 consecutively recruited CP patients aged 9 - 96 months, who attended the paediatric neurology clinics (PNCs) in Enugu between April and October 2010. Each patient’s clinical history was recorded, a neurological examination conducted and GMFCS level ascertained. Statistical analyses were done to determine the association between the categorical variables. Results. The type of CP (p= 0. 000), aetiological factors (p= 0. 016), the presence of malnutrition (p= 0. 004) and the frequency of accompanying impairments (p= 0. 001) were significantly associated with the severity of GMD, while SEC (p= 0. 649) had no significant association.

40|$|Stochastic {{computing}} (SC) is {{an unconventional}} computing approach that processes data represented by pseudo-random bit-streams called stochastic numbers (SNs). It enables arithmetic functions {{to be implemented}} by tiny, low-power logic circuits, and is highly error-tolerant. These properties make SC practical for applications that need massive parallelism or operate in noisy environments where conventional binary designs are too costly or too unreliable. SC has recently come {{to be seen as}} an attractive choice for tasks such as biomedical image processing and decoding complex error-correcting codes. Despite its desirable properties, SC has features that limit its usefulness, including insufficient accuracy and an inadequate design theory. Accuracy is especially vulnerable to correlation among interacting SNs and to the random fluctuations inherent in SC’s data representation. This dissertation examines the major factors affecting accuracy using analytical and experimental approaches based on probability theory and circuit simulation, respectively. We devise methods to quantify the error effects in stochastic circuits by means of probabilistic transfer matrices and Bernouilli processes. These methods make it possible to compare the impact of errors on conventional and stochastic circuits under various conditions. We then analyze correlation in detail and show that correlation-induced errors can be reduced by the careful insertion of delay elements, a de-correlation technique called isolation. Noting that different logic functions can have the same stochastic behavior when constant SNs are applied to their inputs, we show how to partition logic functions into stochastic equivalence <b>classes</b> (<b>SECs).</b> We derive a procedure for identifying SECs, and apply SEC concepts to the synthesis and optimization of stochastic circuits. While addition, subtraction and multiplication have well-known and simple SC implementations, this is not true for division. We study stochastic division methods and propose a new type of stochastic divider that combines low cost with high accuracy. Finally, we turn to the design of general stochastic circuits and investigate a desirable property of SNs called monotonic progressive precision (MPP) whereby accuracy increases steadily with bit-stream length. We develop an SC design technique which produces results that are accurate and have good MPP. The dissertation concludes with some ideas for future research...|$|R

However, no HAV seroprevalence study has been conducted in India over the past decade. This prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 928 children (aged 18 months to 10 years), to estimate the age-related seroprevalence of HAV across different regions of India. The present study also evaluated the impact of various factors such as age, socioeconomic <b>class</b> (<b>SEC),</b> education, source of drinking water, and excreta disposal on HAV seroprevalence. Overall, 348 (37. 5 %) children were seropositive for anti-HAV antibodies. Seroprevalence of HAV in the 6 - to 10 -year age group (50. 3 %) was higher (P= 0. 000) than in the 18 -month to 6 -year age group (30. 3 %). SEC and educational status of the parents were significantly associated with HAV seropositivity (P= 0. 000 for both). An increase in seroprevalence was observed with an increase in age in all SECs (P< 0. 000 – 0. 001 for all) except upper SEC (P= 0. 124). Fewer subjects using a private toilet within the house (33. 1 %) were seropositive than subjects using an open field (75 %) for excreta disposal. In conclusion, the present study observed a transition in the seroprevalence of HAV, with a higher seropositivity in older children.

40|$|Computer Aided Design (CAD) {{has become}} the {{standard}} practice for engineering work, particularly in design of architecture and structural engineering. Many CAD software tools are available in different engineering disciplines to achieve various design objectives. Indeed, the use of CAD tools can improve designers' efficiency, thus raise their productivity. With the rapid advance in IT and Web technologies, there is a stringent demand, from the AEC (Architecture-Engineering-Construction) industry, for more effective coordination in design processes and design collaborations. Such a demand has driven the advances in CAD systems from single to multi-taskings, from fragmentation to system integration, and from a single user to multi-user web-based environments. Information modelling {{is critical to the}} development of a new generation of CAD systems to represent knowledge, exchange data, and integrate CAD tools. In this thesis, two information models - process model and building product models for structural engineering applications have been developed. The main challenges in the present development are to specify a process and building product models for design of building structure, and to explore model-based applications. In the process modelling, an initiative process model for structural design is proposed by reengineering the traditional structural design process. In the product modelling, a building product data model, which is primarily a <b>SEC</b> (Structural Engineering <b>Class)</b> object model, is specified by employing use case-driven object-modelling approach. Implementation approaches of the proposed object model are also addressed. To promote the application of the proposed information models, the research in this thesis is extended to explore a new generation of CAD information systems, such as computer-integrated structural design, web-based structural data model server and online checking (e-checking) systems. All the aforementioned systems make use of generic information models as the basis for the further development. Based on the proposed process and product models, TBCAD II is developed as a prototype system for the computer-integrated structural design of tall buildings. In TBCAD II, the proposed process model and SEC-object model, as well as the component technology are utilised to provide a common software platform for integrating structural engineering CAD tools. A practical example is presented to demonstrate the functional capability of TBCAD II for structural design of tall buildings. Furthermore, a web-based structural data model server is developed, which allows for data sharing and model translation via Internet. Finally, the framework of an online code-compliance checking system is proposed to conduct automated check for structural design plans...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Worldwide, bacteriocins, {{particularly}} those produced by food-related lactic acid bacteria, are receiving attention {{due to the}} possible use of these peptides as natural preservatives in food, replacing potentially harmful chemical preservatives. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized proteins or peptides that inhibit closely related microorganisms. Most bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria are small, heat resistant peptides that inhibit other Gram-positive bacteria, including food-borne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus, but do not inhibit Gram-negative bacteria, molds or fungi. Bacteriocins are produced as inactive prepeptides that become active after the N-terminal leader peptide is cleaved off. Small heat resistant bacteriocins are either lantibiotics (Class I), containing unusual posttranslationally modified amino acids, or peptides that are non-Ianthionines (Class II). The Class II bacteriocins are further divided into four different groups: Class lIa, the anti-listerial bacteriocins containing the YGNGV consensus sequence in the N-terminal of the protein, Class lib, bacteriocins consisting of two peptides, Class IIc, bacteriocins that are secreted via the <b>sec</b> pathway, and <b>Class</b> lid, bacteriocins that do not belong in the previous three subgroups. A bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacterium was isolated in our laboratory from traditionally home fermented South African sorghum beer. The producing bacterium {{was found to be}} a facultative heterofermentative Lactobacillus sp. and was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus pentosus by using the API 50 CHL carbohydrate fermentation system and numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. RAPD-PCR analysis identified the strain as L. plantarum, but 16 S rRNA sequencing confirmed its identification as L. pentosus. The bacteriocin, first designated plantaricin 423 and later bacteriocin 423, was identified as a Class lIa small heat resistant anti-listerial bacteriocin containing the YGNGV consensus motif. Bacteriocin 423 inhibited a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Oenococcus oeni, Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp. and Listeria spp. The bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes and active over a wide pH range (pH 1 - 10). Bacteriocin 423 lost 50 % of its activity after autoclaving for 15 min at 121 °C, but was not affected by lesser heat treatments. Bacteriocin production was increased by optimizing the growth medium, which consisted of glucose, tryptone, yeast extract, potassium phosphate, sodium acetate, ammonium citrate, manganese sulphate, Tween 80 and casamino acids. The bacteriocin was found to be plasmid-encoded. Genetic analysis of the bacteriocin operon indicated a high percentage of homology to the operon of another Class lIa bacteriocin, pediocin PA- 1, although the structural genes of the two bacteriocins were markedly different. The structural gene of bacteriocin 423 was amplified by PCR and cloned into a yeastJE. coli vector between the ADH 1 promoter and terminator sequences and fused in-frame to the MFa 1 secretion signal sequence. Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformed with this plasmid expressed the bacteriocin. The sequence of prebacteriocin 423 (MMKKIEKL TEKEMANIIGGKYYGNGVTCGKHSCSVN WGOAFSCSVSHLANFGHGKC) is similar, but not identical to any other reported Class lIa anti-listeria I peptide. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Bakteriosiene, veral dié wat deur melksuurbakterieë geproduseer word, wek belangstelling as gevolg van die moontlike gebruik van hierdie natuurlike antimikrobiese proteiëne as preserveermiddels in voedselprodukte, in plaas van potensieël gevaarlike chemiese preserveermiddels. Bakteriosiene is ribosomaal-vervaardigde proteiëne wat naverwante bakterieë inhibeer. Die meeste bakteriosiene wat deur melksuurbakterieë geproduseer word, is klein en hittebestand. Hierdie bakteriosiene inhibeer ander Gram-positiewe bakterieë, insluitend patogene soos Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens en Staphylococcus aureus, maar inhibeer nie Gram-negatiewe bakterieë, giste of swamme nie. Bakteriosiene word as onaktiewe prepeptiede geproduseer, wat ge-aktiveer word wanneer die N-terminale leierpeptied afgesplits word. Klein hittebestande bakteriosiene is óf lantibiotika (Klas I), met ongewone aminosure, óf normale peptiede (Klas II). Laasgenoemde klas kan verder in vier groepe verdeel word. Klas lIa is anti-listeriese bakteriosiene met fn YGNGVaminosuurvolgorde in die N-terminale kant van die peptied. Klas lib sluit in bakteriosiene wat uit twee peptiede bestaan. Klas lie is sec-afhanklike bakteriosiene, en Klas lid sluit in al die bakteriosiene wat nie in die eerste drie groepe geklassifiseer kan word nie. 'n Bakteriosien-produserende melksuurbakterie is uit tradisionele tuisgefermenteerde Suid- Afrikaanse sorghumbier geïsoleer. Die bakterie is as 'n fakultatief heterofermentatiewe Lactobacillus sp. geïdentifiseer. Die bakterie is verder as 'n Lactobacillus plantarum of Lactobacillus pentosus geïdentifiseer deur middel van die API 50 CHL-koolhidraat fermentasiesisteem en numeriese analiese van totale oplosbare selproteiënprofiele. Met RAPD-PCR analiese is die organisme as L. plantarum geïdentifiseer, maar 168 rRNA nukleotiedopeenvolging het die identiteit van die organisme as L. pentosus bevestig. Bakteriosien 423, aanvanklik geklassifiseer as plantaricin 423, is fn klein Klas lIa, hittebestande en anti-listeriese bakteriosien met die YGNGV motief, wat verskeie Grampositiewe bakterieë inhibeer. Bakteriosien 423 het verskeie Gram-positiewe organismes geïnhibeer, onder andere Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Oenococcus oeni, Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., en Listeria spp. Proteolitiese ensieme inaktiveer die bakteriosien. Die peptied was oor 'n pH reeks van 1 - 10 aktief. Outoklavering vir 15 min by 121 °C het die aktiwiteit van die peptied halveer, maar die bakteriosien is nie geïnaktiveer met ander hittebehandelings nie. Produksie van die bakteriosien is verhoog deur die groeimedium te optimiseer. Die groeimedium het bestaan uit glukose, triptoon, gisekstrak, kaliumfosfaat, natriumasetaat, ammoniumsitraat, mangaansulfaat, Tween 80 en casaminosure. Die bakteriosien se genetiese determinante is op In plasmied gesetel. Genetiese analiese van die bakteriosien operon het 'n hoë homologie met In ander Klas lIa bakteriosien, pediocin PA- 1, getoon, maar die strukturele gene van die twee bakteriosiene verskil merkbaar. Die strukturele geen van bakteriosien 423 is met PKR ge-amplifiseer en in 'n gistE. coli-vektor tussen die ADH 1 promotor- en termineerderopeenvolgings, in leesraam met die MFa 1 sekresiesein, gekloneer.
