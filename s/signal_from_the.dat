5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not.

5|$|Among {{its other}} uses, in 1880, {{measurements}} {{from the site}} were used {{as part of the}} effort to develop standard time. The observatory remained the official timekeeper for Canada until 1905, when that responsibility was transferred to Ottawa's Dominion Observatory. At exactly 11:55am the clocks in Toronto fire halls were rung by an electrical <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The Hessians, in {{the center}} {{under the command of}} General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines {{stationed}} at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan.

40|$|Auscultation {{has been}} widely {{regarded}} as one of the most important noninvasive diagnostic tools for clinical diagnosis of the respiratory tract. The purpose of this thesis was to develop a software application capable of extracting the key features of respiratory sound <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lungs and trachea of healthy persons. The efficacy of the program was evaluated by the verification of the important features of <b>the</b> sound <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left and right lungs and the trachea such as 1) right and left lung symmetry and 2) dissimilarity between the trachea and both lungs. The program was developed in LabView and was designed to capture <b>the</b> respiratory sound <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lungs and the trachea in real-time and process them in the time and frequency domains for further analysis. The features compared were 1) signal amplitude in the time domain and 2) power spectra in the frequency domain. Results of the study had shown that the program had been able to verify that 1) the key features of <b>the</b> breath sound <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left and right lungs were similar and 2) the features of <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trachea and both lungs were different...|$|R
5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal {{looked like a}} strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{combination}} {{flew through}} poor weather conditions {{and managed to}} reach Norway and fly towards its objective. During the flight over Norway the Rebecca receiver, {{which was supposed to}} pick up the transponder <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Eureka beacons being used by the Norwegian SOE agents, developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up the signal. This left the aircrew with only map-reading available to locate the landing zone, but the poor weather made this almost impossible.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E

He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E
5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sync {{head of one}} tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E

40|$|Sensorimotor {{responses}} (e. g [...] eye movements, spinal reflexes, etc {{depend upon}} the interpretation of <b>the</b> neural <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sensory systems. Since neural <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> otoliths may represent either tilt (gravity) or translation (linear inertial force), sensory <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> otolith organs are necessarily somewhat ambiguous. Therefore. the neural responses to changing otolith signals {{depend upon the}} context of the stimulation (e. g- active vs. passive, relative orientation of gravity, etc.) as well as upon other sensory signals (e. g., vision. canals, etc.). This session will focus upon the -role -played by <b>the</b> sensory <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> otolith organs in producing efficient sensorimotor and behavioral responses. Curthoys will show the influence of the peripheral anatomy and physiology. Tomko will discuss the influence of tilt and translational otolith signals on eye movements. Merfeld will demonstrate the rate otolith organs play during the interaction of sensory <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> canals and otoliths. Watt will show the influence of the otoliths on spinal/postural responses. Guedry will discuss the contribution of vestibular information to "path of movement"' perception and {{to the development of a}} stable vertical reference. Sensorimotor responses to the ambiguous inertial force stimulation provide an important tool to investigate how the nervous system processes patterns of sensory information and yields functional sensorimotor responses...|$|R

5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.|$|E

In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Dæmons. Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E

Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E
