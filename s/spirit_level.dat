500|$|Perry was {{succeeded by}} John Grundy, Sr., {{who had arrived}} in the region in 1731 {{at the request of the}} Duke of Buccleuch, who wanted his estates surveyed. Perry was {{building}} the Spalding sluice at the time, and Grundy's work allowed him to study drains, banks, sluices and outfalls. He formed the opinion that mathematical and philosophical principles should be applied to the drainage of low-lying regions. In 1733, he surveyed the parish of Moulton, a little further downstream, to assess how drainage could be improved for the Commissioners of Sewers. He demonstrated the use of a telescopic <b>spirit</b> <b>level,</b> which enabled him to achieve accurate levels, with errors of less than 1 inch per mile (2cm per km). Next he addressed the issue of flow in open drains. Using his mathematical principles, he calculated that water in a drain which was [...] long, and had a fall of [...] over its length should travel at around , taking 1 hour and 28 minutes to travel the length of the drain. Observations in the field showed him that other factors, such as fluid friction, resulted in the actual flow rate being less than half of this. He published a paper of his findings in April 1734, and insisted that accurate mapping and levels, together with physical observation of drains and rivers, were essential to deciding how fenland could best be drained. In the same month, he began working for the Adventurers of Deeping Fen, to produce a drainage scheme. He spent some time mapping [...] of the Welland, and his chief recommendation was for a reservoir and sluice at the outfall of the River Glen, which would enable the outfall to be scoured at low tide, by releasing water from the reservoir.|$|E
