5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the <b>staff</b> <b>room,</b> all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the <b>Staff</b> <b>Room</b> and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E
25|$|The station {{building}} annex {{was extended}} in 1964 {{to make way}} for a restaurant. The former telegraph room was converted to a kitchen and parts of the extension were converted to a <b>staff</b> <b>room.</b> An interlocking system became operational on 17 July 1969, allowing the station to become remotely controlled from 19 August 1969. The technical room for the interlocking was installed in the basement. The station retained ticket sales and in 1981 the <b>staff</b> <b>room</b> was renovated. The station became unmanned from 1 February 1997.|$|E

25|$|Built in 1885 of masonry and timber, the Simms {{building}} {{exhibits a}} combination of Gothic and Georgian features; the projecting central tower and wings are reminiscent of Georgian designs, while the façade's soaring verticals, griffins, and pointed arch openings, are Gothic. The building at Hope was designed {{at the time to}} accommodate boarders as well as day students, and was large enough to hold the whole school without difficulty. It now houses the administrative offices, <b>staff</b> <b>room</b> and sixth form classrooms. For over a hundred years, Simms Hall has been the core of the Jamaica College buildings, its strength and durability repeatedly demonstrated by its resistance to hurricanes and earthquakes, including the disastrous Kingston earthquake of 1907.|$|E

25|$|Ja'mie and {{her friends}} go on to form a student {{representative}} council and organise a Year 11 formal. Ja'mie plans to have it at a popular nightclub with an expensive DJ, but at $450 a ticket, the student council faces cancelling the event because students can't afford tickets. Instead, Ja'mie arranges a day {{to raise money for}} AIDS in Africa, which is enough to cover formal expenses. The Head of Senior School learns that the reason for this fundraiser is actually to fund the expensive formal. As a compromise, Ja'mie is offered to hold the formal in the school's <b>staff</b> <b>room,</b> with no DJ and cheap hand-made decorations. She invites lesbian student Tamsin to the formal to make a big impression, but when Tamsin finds out that Ja'mie is not lesbian, she declines by SMS, forcing Ja'mie to take Sebastian; they stay together this time, although she still checks his phone messages.|$|E
25|$|Terminal A {{completed}} {{construction in}} 2007. It is used solely as a departures and arrivals facility for domestic flights. The terminal was 19,600 m² {{and had a}} capacity of 1,000 pax/hour. Later the 2005 International terminal was joined to Terminal A, making the total area of the terminal 35,000 m² and the capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal is 2 floors in height. The ground floor contains check-in desks, baggage claim areas (with carousels), currency exchange centers, a <b>staff</b> <b>room,</b> and several coffee shops. The second floor has several restaurants, including Grenki Pub, a children's nursery room, and the domestic business lounge which opened on June 13, 2013. The lounge is accessible by passengers with business class tickets or for a fine of 1960 rubles. The terminal has 5 jet bridges and several other bus gates. renovations to the domestic terminal were made as early as of February 18, 2014, with the stylistic and congestion reductional changes. The renovations began in 2012 with NefaResearch design studies winning the bid for the reconstruction, with Phase I completed on December 27, 2012, and Phase II on February 18, 2014. The total price of the renovations was listed at 141,000,000 rubles.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 {{plans were}} {{submitted}} by the then landlords Capital & Regional to redevelop the site. It proposed a collection of family friendly cafes & restaurants, with Aquasplash closing down, with a brand new play area, gym and bowling alley with the ice rink and cinema. The Leisure World complex would be demolished {{as soon as the}} new unnamed project is completed. This was expected to begin construction in summer 2012 and be completed in early spring 2013. However, no developments took place for a couple of years. The ice rink was also proposed to close, a move seen as controversial by many locals. But after a lengthy campaign from activists, the ice rink was saved. Finally, in July 2014, demolition of the old nightclubs and the Aquasplash began, {{to be replaced by a}} new plan from new landlords featuring new restaurants and a gym, which opened between December 2014 and June 2015. The cinema continued to operate while the ice rink went under refurbishment. The cinema then revealed it was planning to expand from 8 screens to 17, with the old bowling alley, arcade, snooker & pool, bowls, Burger King and play area were becoming a new set of cinemas, while 6 of the original screens would become new restaurants. The remaining originals were converted into 3 screens, with Screens 8 becoming one of the cinema's own brand IMPACT screens, Screen 7 being used for the foyer and toilets, and Screen 6 becoming one large 281 IMAX auditorium. There is also a conference room and a children's party room added to the complex as well, with new staff toilets, offices and a <b>staff</b> <b>room.</b> The IMAX opening on 17 December 2015 and the IMPACT Blue opening on 26 February 2016, while the others opened in late October the same year. As well as the new screens, A new Prezzo restaurant opened in July where the former Pizza Hut was located. On August 12, the cinema transferred ownership from Empire to Cineworld. Under them, the entrance was refurbished with a Baskin Robbins kiosk in March 2017, with a Starbucks opened also opened as part of the cinema in May 2016. At the same time, the new 'Superscreen' Screen 2 was opened.' Most recently, the Coast To Coast restaurant that opened there in 2015 has shut down.|$|E

500|$|Funding {{was running}} low {{towards the end}} of filming the first series. Moffat {{contrived}} an episode, [...] "The Staff Meeting", where all of the main cast would be locked in the <b>staff</b> <b>room</b> to avoid paying for any guest actors. To reduce expenditure further, crew members were enlisted to provide the voices for the television news report {{at the end of the}} episode: producer Andre Ptaszynski played the broadcast journalist, whilst second assistant director Sarah Daman voiced the protesting student Gail Bennett.

2500|$|The {{last term}} at the City of Bath Technical School {{concluded}} in July 1970. In February 1971 it was renamed Culverhay School. Over the summer break of 1973 its Brougham Hayes facilities were decommissioned and the buildings converted for subsequent use as the lower {{school of the}} newly created Hayesfield Girls' School. Former pupils of the City of Bath Technical School and a contingent from the smaller Bath Art School were amalgamated with the larger body of the former Secondary Modern, Westhill Boys' School (founded in 1956) to become Culverhay Comprehensive School. In preparation the West Hill Boys' School buildings, originally constructed in 1956 at Rush Hill, were joined on an adjacent site by purpose-built 1970s science, mathematics and sixth form blocks, and the existing Victorian premises of a former GP practice became an additional <b>staff</b> <b>room.</b> The closure of the City of Bath Technical School took place despite a [...] protest letter to the Bath Education Authority in 1970 (from the then headmaster F.T. Naylor and the teaching staff) that the proposal to introduce {{a new system of}} technical education in Bath would possibly result in a lowering of educational standards.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 November 1953 {{a larger}} chapel was blessed and opened by Archbishop Liston. This was built {{mainly on the}} {{initiative}} of the Chaplain of the School, Father Reginald Delargey. Funds were raised by the Old Boys, Men's and Ladies' Committees and the pupils. The chapel cost £3,300. £3,000 was raised by an appeal (£1,400 from parents, friends and Old Boys, and £750 from the pupils including £200 {{as a result of}} [...] "self-denial" [...] days). [...] "The opening of the chapel was all the more satisfying because of the involvement of the pupils." [...] This chapel was located between the Brothers' House and the main school building (now called the [...] "Br O'Driscoll Building"). The chapel was rectangular. It had two aisles between which there were approximately ten pews which could accommodate a class or two for Mass or Benediction. On the other side of each aisle were the Brothers' chairs and prie-dieus at which they recited their office each day, heard Mass and kept their own devotional books. The chapel was dominated by a crucifix and a large altar fixed against the south end wall in those pre-Vatican II days. A free-standing altar later replaced this so that Mass could be said facing the congregation. On the left was also a shrine to Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, a devotion much encouraged by the Christian Brothers. On the South side of this icon was the door to a small sacristy which also served as a confessional for the school, where the school chaplain was available regularly. This sacristy issued onto a small cloister which connected the Brother's House with the school building. On the North side of the icon a door led from the chapel to the Brother's Common room and library in the Brothers' House. This also served as the general <b>staff</b> <b>room</b> for the college which was most useful to the lay teachers. There were folding doors along the northern or entrance end of the chapel. These doors could be opened so that extra congregants could be accommodated outside. From time to time Masses were celebrated al fresco there. Other events were also held there such as school prizegivings. At the 1955 prizegiving, Archbishop Liston [...] "presided on a decorated balcony" [...] in front of the chapel. [...] "The chapel became a focal point and the good habit of a visit to the Blessed Sacrament before and after school [...] maintained over 60 years". This chapel was demolished to free up access to the Brother L. H. Wilkes Technology Block which was opened in 2001.|$|E
