5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} should be done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting {{would need to be}} done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E

Despite the resemblance, Dromaeosauroides is not considered part of that genus. It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous.

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide.

To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E

Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant.

Soil <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette.

5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Michigan State Highway Department petitioned AASHO {{to again}} {{make the change}} it had {{requested}} back in 1958, moving I-96 over I-196 to end at Muskegon and renumbering I-96 west of Grand Rapids to I-67. The state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints from the public about confusion caused by the numbering. At their October 21, 1963 meeting, AASHO approved the relocation of I-96, but rejected I-67, stating that the number <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> for a more major route in case the system is expanded, and instead assigned I-196 to the not-yet-complete Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids highway.
