5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a <b>spheroplast.</b> β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
2500|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{is composed}} of the plasma membrane and cell wall. As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall {{is to protect the}} cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as Mycoplasma) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics. [...] For both these types of bacteria, particles of approximately 2nm can pass through the peptidoglycan. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast while if it's partially removed, it is called a <b>spheroplast.</b> β-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillin inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall.

The serotype of S. marcescens had no effect on the <b>spheroplast</b> induction rate. Monocations (Na+ and K+) had little effect on <b>spheroplast</b> induction...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the conversion of}} Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells to <b>spheroplasts</b> using Novozym 234, a commercially available enzyme preparation. Both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells can be quantitatively converted to <b>spheroplasts</b> on a large scale. A means of disrupting these <b>spheroplasts</b> is described which gives an efficient release of organelles. The resulting homogenate is suitable for subcellular fractionation. The sphero-plasts can also be regenerated to give dividing cells, thus providing an approach to genetic manipulation in S. pombe...|$|R
40|$|Heterokaryons of Mucor racemosus were {{produced}} by fusion of <b>spheroplasts</b> from two auxotrophic {{strains of the}} fungus. Germinated sporangiospores were converted to <b>spheroplasts</b> by using commercial chitinase and Myxobacter AL- 1 chitosanase. <b>Spheroplasts</b> from the auxotrophic strains were mixed in a buffered Ca(NO 3) 2 solution and fusion occurred. After cell wall regeneration, prototrophs were isolated. The frequency of heterokaryon formation was 1. 45 X 10 (- 4). Prototrophic isolates segregated parental nuclei at a high frequency, indicating that heterokaryons had formed...|$|R

Lysis of {{bacterial}} protoplasts and <b>spheroplasts</b> by staphylococcal α-toxin and streptolysin S. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 1387 – 1392. 1965. —Protoplasts of Bacillus megaterium, Sarcina lutea, and Streptococcus pyogenes, and <b>spheroplasts</b> of Escherichia coli were lysed by staphylococcal α-toxin, whereas <b>spheroplasts</b> of Vibrio metschnikovii and V. comma were not. In {{the spectrum of}} its lytic action, streptolysin S qualitatively resembled staphylococcal α-toxin except for failure to lyse S. pyogenes protoplasts. In contrast to the two foregoing agents, streptolysin O did not lyse protoplasts and <b>spheroplasts.</b> The observations are interpreted in relation to similarities and differences in lipid composition {{of bacterial}} and mammalian cell membranes...|$|R
