5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is a <b>subset</b> of edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including {{an edge in}} the <b>subset</b> when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper <b>subset</b> of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, <b>subset,</b> etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a <b>subset</b> of B and B equivalent to a <b>subset</b> of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

40|$|We {{start an}} {{investigation}} into the complexity of variations of the Equal Sum <b>Subsets</b> problem, a basic problem in which we are given a set of numbers and are asked to find two disjoint <b>subsets</b> of the numbers that add up to the same sum. While Equal Sum <b>Subsets</b> is known to be NP -complete, only very few studies have investigated the complexity of its variations. In this paper, we show NP -completeness for two very natural variations, namely Factor-r Sum <b>Subsets,</b> where we need to find two <b>subsets</b> such that the ratio of their sums is exactly r, and k Equal Sum <b>Subsets,</b> where we need to find k <b>subsets</b> of equal sum. In an effort to gain an intuitive understanding of what makes a variation of Equal Sum <b>Subsets</b> NP -hard, we study several variations of Equal Sum <b>Subsets</b> in which we introduce additional requirements that a solution must fulfill (e. g., the cardinalities of the two sets must differ by exactly one), and prove NP -hardness for these variations.
