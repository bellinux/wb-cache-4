5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the {{advanced}} platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived {{on top of}} Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. Some of the engineers fired on the E Company men before the latter identified themselves. The E Company platoon went into position {{on the right of}} Vandygriff, and Kennedy turned over command of the combined force to the E Company commander. Kennedy then assembled 12 wounded men and started down the mountain with them. The party was under small arms fire most of the way. A carrying party of Korean A-frame porters led by an American officer had <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain during the morning with supplies. North Korean fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> B Reactor, {{the first of}} its three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, semicommercial {{production}} of ethylene glycol via ethylene chlorohydrin started in 1917. The first large-scale commercial glycol plant was erected in 1925 at South Charleston, West Virginia, by Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Co. (now Union Carbide Corp.). By 1929, ethylene glycol {{was being used}} by almost all dynamite manufacturers. In 1937, Carbide <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> first plant based on Lefort's process for vapor-phase oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide. Carbide maintained a monopoly on the direct oxidation process until 1953, when the Scientific Design process was commercialized and offered for licenses.|$|E

500|$|The day before, E Company {{had been}} delayed in {{following}} D Company to Hill 755. Soon after the Engineer company had <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> trail on September 4, E Company arrived at Holley's command {{post at the}} base of the mountain. North Korean mortar fire was falling on the trail at the time and the company commander said he could not advance because of it. Holley radioed this information to Palmer who designated another company commander. This second officer was soon wounded in the leg and Holley then designated a third officer, who <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain with E Company that evening about 20:00. North Korean fire stopped the company [...] short of the crest before dawn. It was this same company that the NK 13th Division had cut off when it launched its attack the evening of September 2 and overran the 2nd Battalion north of Tabu-dong. Tired and dispirited from this experience and their roundabout journey to rejoin the regiment, E Company men were suffering from lowered morale.|$|E

At the peak they found an abandoned trench, the Turks having withdrawn inland. Soon the Australians reached Plugge's Plateau, the edge of which was defended by a trench, but the Turks had withdrawn to the next summit [...] inland, from where they fired at the Australians coming onto the plateau. As they arrived, Major Edmund Brockman of the 11th Battalion started sorting out the mess, sending the 9th Battalion's men to the right flank, the 11th Battalion's to the left, and keeping the 10th Battalion in the centre.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} September, 1,700 {{additional}} {{troops were}} landed from the fleet arriving at New York. On October 3, Sir Henry <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River with 3,000 men in three frigates {{and a number of}} smaller vessels. [...] The next day, he landed some troops near Tarrytown as a feint to draw Putnam's troops from Peekskill. [...] These troops marched about and then reboarded the ships, which continued north. [...] He then made a similar feinting maneuver at Verplanck's Point, just three miles (4.8km) south of Peekskill on October 5, where he dislodged a poorly manned American outpost. [...] These feinting maneuvers completely fooled Putnam, who drew his troops back into the eastern highlands and sent messages across the Hudson for reinforcements.|$|E
