40|$|Textile {{discharge}} printing {{is the most}} versatile and important of {{the methods used for}} introducing design to textile fabrics. In discharge styles, the pattern is produced by the chemical destruction of the original dye in the printed areas. The discharging agents used can be oxidising or reducing agents, acids, alkalis and various salts. However, the most important methods of discharging are based formaldehyde <b>sulphoxylates</b> and thiourea dioxide. Recently, environmental and industrial safety concerns have increased the potential for the use of enzymes in textile processing to ensure eco-friendly production. Formaldehyde sulphoxylate (NaHSO 2. CH 2 O. 2 H 2 O) {{is one of the most}} powerful discharging agents; however, it is quite toxic and produces formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen associated with nasal sinus cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. In this work, a hazardous chemical has been replaced with eco-friendly horseradish peroxidase enzyme in textile {{discharge printing}}. Enzymatic discharge printing was carried out with a phenol oxidising enzyme system such that the reactive dye was selectively discharged from the cotton fabric in selected areas, creating a printed surface. The effects of enzyme concentration, pH of the printing paste, treatment time and the temperature of enzymatic treatment were studied. The optimum conditions for enzymatic discharge printing were found to be pH 8. 5 at 70 °C with a dye concentration of 80 g/L and 60 min as the treatment time. Key words...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} publications (1, 2) we {{have reported}} favorable results {{with the use}} of formaldehyde <b>sulphoxylate</b> as an anti dote for acute poisoning with mercuric chloride in dogs, rats, and humans. Brown and Kolmer (3) working with rabbits have partially confirmed these results but have raised the questions of the toxicity of <b>sulphoxylate</b> and of the necessity for the intra venous method of administering the drug. From a considerable amount of experimental work on animals poisoned by mouth with mercuric chloride it is our belief that the best results from this therapy can only be obtained when both oral and intravenous administration of the drug are given. The time factor is of the greatest importance in the prevention of kidney damage, for our experiments have shown that after cellular injury has taken place little benefit can be expected from <b>sulphoxylate.</b> Oral medication with <b>sulphoxylate</b> will immediately reduce the mercuric chloride present in the stomach and upper intestinal canal but the factors of vomiting and of the time required for the <b>sulphoxylate</b> to reach the lower intestinal canal make it inad visable to rely upon this method of therapy alone. Also there will undoubtedly be mercury in the tissues which has not exerted its damaging effect upon the kidneys, and the principal advantage of suiphoxylate over other methods of therapy is that it can, when injected intravenously, act in the body upon such mercury to prevent kidney damage. Experiments upon rabbits reported below will further demonstrate this effect...|$|R
40|$|Sodium {{formaldehyde}} <b>sulphoxylate</b> {{because of}} its strong re-ducing properties, stability {{in the body and}} relatively low toxic-ity has been suggested recently by Rosenthal as an antidote in cases of mercurial poisoning. Experimenting with the com-pound in dogs, {{he has been able to}} save the majority of them from a fatal oral or intravenous dose of mercuric chloride by the ad-ministration of the antidote (either orally, intravenously or both) within one and one-half hours after the animal had been poisoned (1). Later he reported 10 cases of acute mercuric chloride poisoning in human beings all of whom recovered after treatment with sodium formaldehyde <b>sulphoxylate</b> (2). A noteworthy feature in the treatment of these cases as well as of the treated animals was the entire absence of any evidence of appreciable kidney damage, the blood urea nitrogen showing but little rise above normal at any time. As a tentative procedure in the treatment of human cases, Rosenthal proposed the following: 1. Gastric lavage with a 5 per cent solution of <b>sulphoxylate,</b> about 200 cc. being left in the stomach. 2. Ten grams of the compound in 100 to 200 cc. of distilled water to be injected intravenously. 3. In severe cases, this injection to be repeated four to six hours later. 4. Colitis to be treated by high colonic irrigation with a 0. 1 per cent solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{oxidation}} state of structural iron greatly influences the physical-chemical properties of clay minerals, {{a phenomenon that}} may have significant implications for pollutant fate in the environment, for agricultural productivity, and for industrial uses of clays. Knowledge of redox mechanisms i fun-damental to understanding the underlying basis for iron's effects on clays. Past studies revealed that the extent of Fe reduction varied depending on the reducing agent used, but this variation {{may not have been}} a simple function of the reduction potential of the reducing agent. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the relationship between the Fe reduction mechanism and free radical activity in the reducing agent. Several reducing agents and their mixtures with the Na-saturated, 0. 5 to 2 #m size fraction of ferruginous mectite (SWa- 1) were analyzed by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to determine the presence of unpaired electrons or free radicals. Only NazS 204 exhibited paramagnetic free-radical behavior with a signal at about g = 2. 011, which was attributed to the <b>sulphoxylate</b> (SO 2 -.) free radical. The free radical was labile in aqueous olution, and the ability of NazSzO 4 solution to reduce structural Fe in the smectite decreased with age of the solution and paralleled the disappearance ofthe free radical signal in the ESR spectrum. The paramagnetic species was preserved and enhanced ifNa 2 SzO 4 was added to the clay suspension, indicating that either the clay surface stabilized the SO 2 9 radical or the additional unpaired electrons were produced in the clay structure...|$|R
