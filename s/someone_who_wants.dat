[...] "The Priest and Used Cars" [...] talks about clockwork theory and how it put the fear of death into Butler when he was younger. [...] "Pheromone Cvlt" [...] was about how tired he was with women telling him how broken he is and how he needs to be fixed, and how he wants to find <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to find someone who was not with him because he was a [...] "fucking mess". Butler commented how the lyrics of [...] "27 Club" [...] focus on [...] "when people assume I'm pumped full of drugs or a Christian. I'm misidentified all the time".|$|E
500|$|Attorney {{and author}} Roberta A. Kaplan {{described}} Davis as [...] "the clearest example of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> {{to use a}} religious liberty argument to discriminate", while law professor Eugene Volokh maintained that an employer must try to accommodate religious employees' beliefs, pointing out that Davis wished only to remove her name from the marriage licenses of same-sex couples. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said that Davis' imprisonment {{was part of the}} [...] "criminalization of Christianity", while columnist Jennifer Rubin compared Davis' refusal to obey the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] in 1963. A few weeks after her release from jail, Davis met with Pope Francis in Washington, D.C. The Holy See Press Office later noted that the pope met with many others as well, and said that the meeting was not a form of support for Davis's actions. Davis has been satirized in popular culture: after the same-sex marriage license controversy, she was parodied in a Funny or Die video, as well as on Saturday Night Live.|$|E

500|$|... "Drunk on Love" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "trancey" [...] and Europop-influenced power ballad. The song last for a duration of three minutes and 32 seconds. Instrumentation consists of [...] "a storm of drums" [...] and [...] "clattering synths." [...] Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust described the song's percussion as [...] "huge." [...] The song samples the melody of The xx's song [...] "Intro", which was included on their debut album xx. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy noted that Rihanna describes herself as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to be loved in the lyric [...] "I just wanna be in love" [...] as she sings about being a [...] "hopeless romantic". He also described the lyric [...] "I wear my heart on my sleeve/ Always let love take the lead" [...] as Talk That Talks [...] "most thoughtful" [...] line. St. Asaph described the lyric [...] "I love the way you taste on my lips when we kiss" [...] as [...] "PG-13 at best," [...] and wrote that {{it is not possible to}} be [...] "lovelorn" [...] as well as filthy at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to believe what she likes... but as a public servant, she does {{not have the right to}} pick and choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Journalist David Wild {{writes that}} the 1927 movie The Jazz Singer, would mirror Diamond's own life, [...] "the story of a Jewish kid from New York who leaves {{everything}} behind to pursue his dream of making popular music in Los Angeles". Diamond says it was [...] "the story of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> {{to break away from}} the traditional family situation and find his own path. And in that sense, it 'is' my story." [...] In 1972, Diamond gave the first solo concert performance on Broadway since Al Jolson, and starred in the 1980 remake of Jazz Singer, with Laurence Olivier and Lucie Arnaz.|$|E

In this vein, Alpert himself concedes, [...] "A Maven is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to solve other people's problems, generally by solving his own". According to Gladwell, Mavens start [...] "word-of-mouth epidemics" [...] due to their knowledge, social skills, and ability to communicate.

2500|$|The {{violent and}} {{aggressive}} Morales {{had begun to}} take over Los Zetas' assets and depose Lazcano in early 2010. In the beginning, Lazcano was happy to have Morales in his ranks, but he underestimated him and gave him too much power. They rarely met, probably once a month. As tensions grew they spoke only via mobile phone. Morales' active role got him the loyalty and respect of many gang members and eventually many stopped payments to Lazcano. They lived {{in different parts of}} the country and aside from work, they had little in common. Morales preferred violence, while Lazcano was more business-like. Lazcano reportedly wanted Los Zetas to be less of a problem for the Peña Nieto government; in contrast, [...] " [...] is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to fight the fight."

2500|$|Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {{responded to}} the debate, in {{particular}} Abbas' speech, in saying: [...] "The world watched a defamatory and venomous speech that was full of mendacious propaganda against the Israel Defense Forces and the citizens of Israel. <b>Someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> peace does not talk in such a manner. The way to peace between Jerusalem and Ramallah [...] is in direct negotiations, without preconditions, and not in one-sided U.N. decisions. By going to the U.N., the Palestinians have violated the agreements with Israel and Israel will act accordingly." [...] Israeli critics of the resolution, said it enshrined the principle of a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders, a position rejected by the Israeli government, while upholding the Palestinian claim for refugees' right of return. An unnamed official said: [...] "They got a state without end of conflict. This sets new terms of reference that will never allow negotiations to start. [...] " [...] Ynetnews suggested Netanyahu and Israel would accept the resolution in return for U.S. support in regards to joint opposition to the Iranian nuclear programme.|$|E
2500|$|He {{also argues}} that some alchemists resort to fraud, either openly by {{applying}} {{a thin layer of}} gold/silver on top of silver/copper jewelry, or secretly using an artificial procedure of covering whitened copper with sublimated mercury, though only skilled experimenters can carry out the latter. He admits, however, that most alchemists are honest and carry out their investigations in good faith with the belief that the transmutation of metals is possible, but on the basis that there has never been any successful attempt to date, he argues that transmutation is an implausible theory without any reliable scientific evidence to support it. He reports the earlier opinions of al-Farabi, Avicenna and al-Tughrai on alchemy, and then proceeds to advance his own arguments against it. One such argument is that [...] "human science is powerless even to attain what is inferior to it" [...] and that alchemy [...] "resembles <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to produce a man, an animal or a plant." [...] Another sociological argument he uses is that, even if transmutation were possible, the disproportionate growth of gold and silver [...] "would make transactions useless and would run counter to divine wisdom." [...] He ends his arguments with a restatement of his position: [...] "Alchemy can only be achieved through psychic influences (bi-ta'thirat al-nufus). Extraordinary things are either miracles or witchcraft... They are unbounded; nobody can claim to acquire them." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} ways that an {{individual}} could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person {{could go to a}} nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. [...] Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> to become a nurse in Japan. [...] They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students {{to be able to make}} critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.|$|E

The article was in turn subject to critical analysis: Matt Lewis who wrote, [...] "Friedman's apparent wish for a 'benign' dictator is utopian, inasmuch as it ignores Lord Acton's warning that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'" [...] and William Easterly who quotes Friedman's one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that, [...] "Formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story" [...] and that, [...] "economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them." [...] However, in a July 2012 article in the NYT, he also wrote that the current Chinese leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that, [...] "Corruption is as bad as ever, institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent." [...] When asked if he had [...] "China envy" [...] during a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman replied, [...] "You detect the envy of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that China can do autocratically." [...] Likewise, in a 2011 interview with the BBC Friedman says that he wants his children {{to live in a world}} where [...] "there's a strong America counterbalancing a strong and thriving China, and not one where you have a strong and rising China and an America that is uncertain, weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did." ...|$|E
