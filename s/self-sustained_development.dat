The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use the waste in the construction ceramic, because it does not degrade in nature due to its chemical composition and a contribution to the reduction of this waste in landfills and visual pollution. Thus, a sample of this material was selected so that their characteristics regarding chemical composition, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis could be studied. Mixtures were prepared containing 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % by weight of waste, and sintered at a temperature of 850 ° C. After water absorption, linear shrinkage and mechanical strength tests were performed. The physical-mechanical properties were determined according to the % of waste added. The results revealed a series of phase transformations during sintering. Moreover, the sintered bodies containing residual construction are likely use in red ceramic, contributing to waste minimization and <b>self-sustained</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E

Molecular profiles of light- induced genes indicate that the individual white collar- 1 and white collar- 2 mutants utilize distinct pathways, despite their similar appearance in all aspects. Titration of fluence rate also demonstrates different light sensitivities between the two strains. The data require the existence of an as-yet-unidentified photoreceptor. Furthermore, the extant circadian clock machinery in these mutant strains supports the notion that the circadian system in Neurospora involves components outside the WC–FRQ loop...|$|E

It is a first-generation new town that adheres nearly {{entirely to the}} British planning principle that a balanced allocation {{of public and private}} housing units (leading to mixed social composition of community dwellers), as well as enough social and recreational facilities, green spaces, and secure pedestrian social space, is essential for people-friendly communities and <b>self-sustained</b> <b>development</b> (den Hartog 2010). Our analysis shows the low SVI score is particularly derived from an easier and better access to primary care, as well as a healthier group of elderly residents in terms of less disability and institutionalization. We can deduce that town planning is successful as the district’s ageing population does not pose a critical challenge to the area’s level of social vulnerability. This calculation also reflects the fact that a good economic profile may not be necessarily linked with a low SVI ranking. For example, communities in the southern district reflect a high-level SVI score. But poverty plays a minimal role in the high SVI areas in the southern district.|$|E

The theoretical material is then applied to two farmer cooperatives operating in the Po Delta, Italy, one on the Venetian bank, {{and the other in}} the Emilia-Romagna bank, with the aim of verifying whether rural development is an aim of these local actors.

40|$|Ten {{years have}} passed since CTA's first staff members were appointed. In the history of what we {{nowadays}} call 'development', and of the young nations of the ACP Group, ten years is a relatively long period. What changes and events have characterized development issues during that period, and what might the future hold in store? In terms of both technology and ideology the last decade has seen vigorous debate and steady progress: such words as sustainability, biotechnology and CD-ROM were not in common parlance ten years ago. But the light provided by these developments has so far failed to overcome the darkness created by other events that were not then on the agenda: the AIDS epidemic, global warming and the more immediate consequences of structural adjustment among them. Much of Africa in particular has had an extraordinarily difficult decade. Only in Africa do we find population growth rates that continue to increase whilst food production per head is falling. The continent has suffered from severe drought and desertification, not to mention civil warfare. Over the last decade technologies and policies which could help to advance development in ACP countries have been refined and adapted, and development issues have often been addressed with more wisdom and maturity than {{was the case in the}} past. The Lagos Plan of Action, which was drawn up in 1980 by the Organization of African Unity, set forth the African perspective on what steps need to be taken to solve Africa's complex food crisis and put the continent on a proper development path; its twin themes were self-reliance and <b>self-sustained</b> <b>development.</b> The implementation of the plan has been beset by many problems, among them a crisis of continental proportions, the debt crisis and a prolonged world economic recession. In the sixties and seventies the debate within the aid agencies had often been led by those with experience of government in a colonial context. In the early days of independence the requirement for industrialization was sometimes over-estimated; large projects became the order of the day. Then came the laudable attempts to promote the difficult concept of integrated rural development. Crop improvement policies were beginning to use Asia's Green revolution as a model, but the successes could not easily be repeated in other situations. Crop improvement methodologies focused on plant architecture (ideotypes), induced mutations and protein quality improvements. With fewer needs, and fewer technical possibilities, relatively little attention was paid to the information component of agricultural development. But some concepts from those years really have taken root; among them the need to identify and promote intermediate technologies whenever it is appropriate to do so. Environmental concerns The first decade of CTA's existence has seen momentous developments affecting agriculture in the ACP States. Much of the progress has centred around issues which we have come to call 'environmental'. Landmark events in this context have included the publication in 1986 of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development entitled Our common future which stimulated the debate on the concept of sustainability, and last year's UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro which gave rise to 'Agenda 21 '. Linked to this is the growing awareness of the need to conserve biodiversity in its broadest sense. Changes affecting the world's ozone layer, first reported in 1983, and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of industrial activity, were identified as the main factors behind global warming. Global warming has particular implications for tropical forest management and the maintenance of soil fertility. Concern for the environment is one factor that has led to the interest in low external input agriculture; it has also been a driving force behind the organic agriculture movement. The decade has been much influenced by the growing appreciation of the role played by women in the development process; the World Conference on the UN Decade for Women, held in Nairobi in 1985, was a turning point. In most ACP countries social issues have received higher profiles than before; nowadays there are often lower expectations from the 'technological fix' approach to development problems, whilst socio-economic considerations receive higher priority. This, together with decreasing financial resources available to national governments, has favoured the growth of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). A number of development matters that were previously the concern of the formal sector are now being addressed, through NGOs, at the community level. The role of government in the development process is rapidly changing. This is partly a consequence of the collapse of the former Soviet empire, which has affected official aid flows, has assisted the process of privatization and has led to increased calls for more open, democratic government. In many countries these calls have been heeded. Attitudes to research aimed at improving farming systems have changed quite remarkably. The pre-independence administrations preferred monocultures; they had reason to do so. Nowadays we not only approve of mixed cropping, we actively encourage it: nowhere is this trend more evident than in the interest shown in agroforestry. These developments have revolutionized farming systems research (FSR), as have other attitudinal questions. Two kinds of knowledge We nowadays recognize the need to encourage the farmer to participate in FSR and are putting behind us the concept that extension must be a top-down process. Researchers and extension workers have realized that farmers' knowledge may be as relevant as their own. Although they tend to exist in isolation from each other, successful development often comes through a marriage of these two knowledge bases. From the point of view of raising agricultural production potentials, the technology which has dominated the decade has beef biotechnology. Despite some early, unrealistic expectations which misled and disappointed many, significant advances are now being made in this area. Another area in which there is real progress is Integrated Pest Management (IPM). If it was concern for the environment that revitalized interest in the concept of IPM, then it is progress in biotechnology that is often helping the concept to become a reality. CTA's first decade has coincided with al era that has been characterized by a new dynamism with regard to issues affecting agricultural and rural development. But these achievements have too often been masked by difficulties, threats and problems. The demands of structural adjustment programmes have sometimes raised the cost of external inputs to prohibitive levels. Agricultural commodity prices on world markets have been depressed, forcing farmers to diversify their activities; and the success rate of diversification programmes has generally been disappointing. The shadows cast by the AIDS epidemic will have profound effects on the labour resources available for agriculture. The present era has been described as being unlike any other, as the direction of technical change is influenced not just by farmers, engineers, technicians and artisans at the local level, but also by bureaucrats, economists, far-away corporate planners, aid agencies and charities. Never before in history have so many non-technical people exerted so much influence on the advancement and movement of technology. This has had implications for the ways in which CTA has set about its task of improving access to technical information for agricultural development in the ACP States: the relevant information must now be made available to people at many different levels and in many different types of organization. Books still in demand What of the changes to the ways in which information is disseminated? Despite the substitution of electronic technologies for tedious typesetting procedures, books and periodicals remain expensive to produce. Yet they are still the most popular format for disseminating information. In CTA's early days it was widely predicted that electronic media would significantly displace books and journals over a period of about five years. That has not happened. It was expected that very few books would be published on tropical agriculture, in view of the unattractiveness of the market to commercial publishers. This prediction has also proved false - thanks, to a greater or lesser extent, to CTA and others who have fought to ensure that such books continue to be published. In fact, the number of new publications on tropical agricultural development must be close to the all-time high. Future historians may consider one of the most revolutionary figures of the late twentieth century to be Ted Hoff, who developed the micro-processor. This device has revolutionized the ways in which we handle information. Without it the personal computer would not be the ubiquitous item it is today, and there would be no CD-ROM technology. CD-ROM technology, and CTA itself, belong to the same generation. This technology has enabled CTA to help revolutionize the way information, particularly databases on abstracts of research papers, is made available to ACP States. The personal computer, meanwhile, has facilitated the development of another of the decade's growth areas, information networking. The relationship between the events of the past decade and the activities which CTA has supported (such as technical meetings, conferences, studies, study visits, rural radio, question-answer services, preparation of directories and bibliographies, production of publications and co-publications including Spore, and strengthening ACP documentation and publishing capabilities) will be illustrated at length in a forthcoming CTA publication. Where next? It seems probable that the populations of cities and towns in ACP States will continue to grow apace. With limited economic prosperity, interest may focus increasingly on urban deprivation. This may lead to a growing awareness of the interdependence of the towns and the rural areas which surround them. Unless remarkable changes in attitudes and understanding can be brought about, agricultural land will continue to be lost at an alarming rate as a consequence of soil degradation. In much of Africa, it seems probable that there will be less and less state intervention in agricultural development; and various factors, among them higher demands from the health sector, may dictate that less money will be available for agricultural projects. Conflicts of interest affecting agricultural production, on the one hand, and the concerns of tourism and environmental protection on the other, will give rise to much soul-searching. The road to recovery New technical developments can be expected, which will bring real benefits; and the cost of some existing technologies may continue to fall, sometimes dramatically. This will certainly apply to information technologies, and should encourage ACP States to step up their own documentation and publishing activities. Indeed, it seems that circumstances will require them to adopt a more self-centred attitude to almost all aspects of development. There is every indication that the agricultural sector will still be required to play a dominant role in the economies of ACP countries, but it will have to do so with a heavier reliance on indigenous resources. ACP States will need access to more and more technical information if they are to increase their self-reliance, and CTA's role will be to make this information easier for them to obtain. The cost of doing this will be of a far lower order of magnitude than the investments that were made in the agricultural projects of those early years, but the returns will be far greater. There are few reasons to doubt that this kind of assistance is becoming ever more appropriate to the needs of ACP countries as time progresses.

Based {{on the results of}} the pilot project already conducted, habitat restoration efforts can be scaled up to restore cheetah habitat on an ecologically appropriate scale. This would also provide a long-term income-generating, <b>self-sustaining</b> conservation <b>development</b> project for the CCF.|$|R
50|$|Dependency theory {{originates}} {{with two}} papers published in 1949 - one by Hans Singer, one by Raúl Prebisch - {{in which the}} authors observe that the terms of trade for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer manufactured goods from the developed countries {{in exchange for a}} given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the Prebisch-Singer thesis. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the United Nations Commission for Latin America (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of protectionism in trade if they were to enter a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development</b> path. He argued that import-substitution industrialisation (ISI), not a trade-and-export orientation, was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries. The theory was developed from a Marxian perspective by Paul A. Baran in 1957 with the publication of his The Political Economy of Growth. Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of imperialism by Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin, and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Matias Vernengo, a Bucknell University economist, identifies two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, Celso Furtado, and Aníbal Pinto at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by Paul A. Baran, Paul Sweezy, and Andre Gunder Frank.|$|R
40|$|Aim of this study. The {{problem of}} poverty, {{especially}} in rural S. A., {{formed the basis}} for the questions and hypotheses posed in this study. Poverty stricken communities, with the accompanying suffering, the immobilizing effect of poverty and the present climate of urgent changes in S. A., were also apparent in Wartburg (study area). The problem was to initiate development {{in such a way that}} the chances of failure and therefore the wasting of already scarce resources is minimized. The manner in which development is initiated and what are viewed as desirable elements of development should culminate into achieving <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development</b> in the long term. It became clear therefore that a complete data base needs to be established in order to initiate such a development process. In this study the aim was to investigate the role which research plays in the process of development. Method. This study can be divided into two sections, viz an investigation into the theoretical basis for achieving a <b>self-sustaining</b> process of <b>development</b> and how research should be done within such a process. Secondly, the practical application of such a theoretical basis was tested and forms the empirical section of this study. The first section was completed by undertaking a literature study. The conditions set for the development process guided the researcher increasingly to a holistic perspective, Community Development and the state of the art of Social Work Practice. The second part of this study was done through empirical research. The questionnaire method was utilized where structured interviews were conducted by properly trained field workers who were of similar cultural background as the community involved in the survey. The data was processed by using the B. M. D. P. programme and recorded in section B of this report. From section A and B of this report conclusions were drawn regarding the development process, the role research has in this process and the task of the Social Work Profession in this regard. Findings. From the theory it seemed that the state of the art regarding social Work Practice upholds a holistic perspective and views community practice and development as an important function within this perspective. It seems that a unitary approach to Social Work is increasingly becoming a reality in the pursuit of a holistic perspective as well as by stressing the importance of community practice. The integrated approach to Social Work Practice seems to collaborate with these views. The role of research is equally important to social Work Practice as it is to Community Development and should be viewed as an integral part of the Social Work Process/Practice. The empirical section of this study is a clear example of what can be achieved by a properly planned and executed research project which forms an integral part of a development process. Together with the community valuable data were drawn from the data base. These conclusions were directly employed to identify priorities and in planning specific projects. Conclusions. This study concludes, firstly, that Social Work Practice has an obvious task in the field of community development. This profession can contribute to a large extent toward making development more human and to acknowledge the importance of both man and his environment when considering development. The study also showed that research is an integral part of a development process, especially where the aim is that of a perpetuating, <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development</b> process. In short, it seems that the Socio-economic research meets the requirements set by the aforementioned development process, but that refining seems necessary in order to make it more effective and useful as an instrument for initiating such a process of development as discussed in the above paragraphs. ...|$|R

These {{policies and the}} imple-mentation of programs also have impacted research and have led to several development strands supporting regional change. Diverse concepts, like learning regions, creative milieus, network approaches, transdisciplinary case studies are targeting socio-economic and environmental adaptation. These approaches are focusing on informal cooperation and interaction, voluntary participation of stakeholders and the wider public, best practice applications etc., but are not tackling question of regional identities and values, and are using more casual methodologies in terms of structured learning and knowledge transfer. Therefore, our concept tries to initiate change {{on the basis of}} a common set of values and beliefs, which is directing the endogenous, self-organizing and <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development</b> measures/actions to achieve value-led results. The introduction of two social theory approaches, adapted from Neuro-Linguistic-Programming (NLP), namely the concept of logical levels and the concept of regional modeling will result in a value-led and participatory regional development. On the one hand, logical levels will be used as natural hierarchies in com-munication, learning, project development and transfer processes, but are also necessary to integrate social, economic, ecological and institutional sustainability along these levels, resulting in value-led logics of sustainability. On the other hand, the application of the modeling concept in connection with logical levels will bring about a structured and appro-priate transfer, and implementation of best practice examples from model regions, mainly by focusing on the compati-bility of transferred ideas, innovations, imitations with the environmental, social and economic value system of the modeling region...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{of finance}} across {{national}} boarders {{is not an}} exclusively twentieth century phenomenon (Korner, Maass et al. 1987). In the Middle Ages and later, in the early modern era, when credit operations and modern banking were gradually beginning to develop, state spending was often financed with foreign money (Korner, Maass et al. 1987). While countries such as England, the USA, Canada and Australia were able to initiate <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development</b> based on foreign loans, the developing countries were already caught in the debt trap in the 19 th century (Korner, Maass et al. 1987). The acquisition of foreign loans by developing countries to reduce poverty and underdevelopment has often plunged them into debt crises. As a consequence, debtor countries were subjected to international financial control by IMF and the World Bank. Since the mid- 1970 s {{an increasing number of}} developing countries have turned to IMF and negotiated an economic stabilization program in order to receive loans from IMF and the World Bank. In the early 1980 s public debt in developing countries raised questions concerning the ability of developing countries to service their debt, and Ghana was not an exception. Public debt had grown exponentially and the budget deficit continued to increase. Debt servicing continued to absorb significant public revenue. It became apparent that public debt posed serious threats to socio-economic development. Unsustainable public debt and poor economic growth in the 1980 s necessitated the implementation of a Structural Adjustment Program by the IMF and the World Bank. As the economy of Ghana recovers from the economic decline to the path of economic growth, public debt continues to increase considerably. It is imperative to understand the policy roots and structural mechanism that caused high public debt and its impact on socio-economic development in Ghana...|$|R
40|$|If {{states would}} {{interact}} more synergistically with communities, they could tap local energies {{and resources for}} development [...] and help create a development-oriented society and polity in the process. The authors analyze experience in several countries to identify the actions required for state-community synergies in development. Two actions that seem especially important: 1) Broadening the distribution of power within communities, to facilitate collective action and reduce the potential for local capture. In rural areas, much {{can be done by}} expanding access to credit, strengthening tenants'rights, and expanding non-crop sources of income. 2) Creating state-community alliances toimprove the effectiveness of local public sector institutions and the delivery of services. Case studies from East Asia and Latin America show that such alliances can effect rapid improvements in local institutions, benefiting not only communities but also politicians seeking support and legitimacy. Local bureaucratic reform, combined with more egalitarian community social organizations, allows the creation of powerful coalitions and synergies for rapid, <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development.</b> This model has been used to achieve outcomes ranging from better health care and drought relief to the generation of agrarian and industrial economic growth. In China and Taiwan, China, these state-community synergies helped produce not only for local consumption but for a rich export market. The cases show that with creative political thinking it is possible to effect rapid change even in poor institutional settings. The Brazilian experience shows how difficult institutional change is in highly inegalitarian settings, but also how such obstacles can be overcome by changes designed to bring grassroots electoral pressure to bear on local government. Experience elsewhere shows, however, how fragile such efforts can be if political support from above is prematurely withdrawn.

40|$|Haiti {{was struck}} by a heavy {{earthquake}} in 2010 and international aid poured into the country. News reports in 2011 were not very positive about the results of post-disaster reconstruction: “The relief efforts are only putting Haiti on lifesupport instead of evolving into the next stage of development”. One of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) involved in Haiti was Cordaid, implementing a ‘transitional shelter strategy’ to support the transformation of neighbourhoods from a state of life-support into a state of <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>development.</b> The strategy was implemented in both a rural and an urban area. The main feature of the strategy was the provision of structures that could be adapted from simple shelters to permanent houses. Since the results of the strategy were mixed and ambiguous, a comparative case study was conducted to evaluate the shelter strategy in both areas. The objective was to draw lessons about what has {{to be taken into account}} when formulating future urban shelter strategies. The case study is discussed in this article. The main finding from the case study is that producing the intended number of shelters within the financial and time budgets that were set (efficiency), was more difficult in the urban area than in the rural area. But the conditions for linking relief and development (effectiveness) are more favourable in the urban context. NGOs may achieve long-term (effective) results in the urban context when a lower efficiency can be justified. That is why NGOs need to engage in a debate about the extent to which they are able to focus on long-term shelter or housing strategies. The important element in the debate is communication with the donors who are often focused on short-term relief measures. However urban areas cannot be rebuilt with only short-term interventions. The link between relief and development has to be made by a process-orientated approach focusing on capacities of local participants. Real Estate & HousingArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
