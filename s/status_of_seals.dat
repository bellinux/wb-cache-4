40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{is one of}} today’s most {{rapidly growing}} technologies in the automatic data collection industry. Although commercial applications are already widespread, {{the use of this}} technology for managing nuclear materials is only in its infancy. Employing an RFID system has the potential to offer an immense payback: enhanced safety and security, reduced need for manned surveillance, real-time access to status and event history data, and overall cost-effectiveness. The Packaging Certification Program (PCP) in the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of Environmental Management (EM), Office of Packaging and Transportation (EM- 63), is developing an RFID system for nuclear materials management. The system consists of battery-powered RFID tags with onboard sensors and memories, a reader network, application software, a database server and web pages. The tags monitor and record critical parameters, including the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals,</b> movement of objects, and environmental conditions of the nuclear material packages in real time. They also provide instant warnings or alarms when preset thresholds for the sensors are exceeded. The information collected by the readers is transmitted to a dedicated central database server that can be accessed by authorized users across the DOE complex via a secured network. The onboard memory of the tags allows the materials manifest and event history data to reside with the package...|$|E
40|$|An {{index for}} the {{condition}} of a population should include {{a measure of the}} recuperative power or resilience of the population in question. This measure needs to cover both the demographic and physiological condition of the population. Applied to the harbour seal population in the Wadden Sea we therefore address respectively the population development and distribution, and its health condition, and relate these to environmental conditions. The harbour seal population has been severely depleted by hunting {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century. After hunting was stopped in the mid- 1970 s the population recovered gradually. This recovery was twice interrupted by Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) outbreaks in 1988 and 2002. These PDV-epizootics reduced the population by 57 % and 50 % respectively. They also lead to changes in age and sex structure of the population, which gradually returned to a stable age-structure. Despite the reduction in population size by respectively 57 % and 50 %, the population showed a strong recovery with a growth rate close to the considered maximum possible for this species. The observed changes in the distribution of the population over the 4 sub-regions indicate that distribution is not a static phenomenon. Long term field and pathological investigations point out that the general health status of the population has improved, particularly that of newborn seals (0 - 6 months old). The increasing prevalence of parasites in lungs and intestine warrants continued monitoring of the health <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals.</b> This is especially relevant in view of the exponential increase of the population, which may finally approach the carrying capacity of the area. Concluding, we can state that {{the condition of}} the population in terms of demographic and health parameters is satisfactory. The best guarantee for maintaining such a favourable conservation status is to abstain from human interferences (e. g. rescue, rehabilitation and release) with natural population processes. However, in practice there is increasing exploitation of marine waters. This requires a continuous monitoring of the potential impacts on the population, particularly of the effect on foraging and migratory behaviour. </div...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} {{a long-term}} data {{set of the}} body condition <b>of</b> Baltic gray <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grypus) over time and investigated how average subcutaneous blubber thickness of different age groups <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> corresponds to environmental factors. Blubber thickness of pups declined until 2010. The decreasing weight of 5 – 6 -year-old herring (Clupea harengus),the main prey fish for Baltic gray seals, explained well the decline. In the Gulf of Finland, the blubber thickness of pups declined also in recent years (2011 – 2015) with declining number of days with permanent ice cover. In other regions, the blubber thickness of pups increased during recent years with increasing weight of herring. The blubber thickness of subadults in Baltic Proper and that of hunted adult females in the Bothnian Bay also increased during recent years, {{and the weight of}} age 6 + or 7 -year-old herring best explained the increase. The blubber thickness of all age groups <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> was thinnest in the Bothnian Bay where also herring weight was lowest. There was a negative correlation between blubber thickness <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> and herring catch size (an index of herring abundance) suggesting that herring quality, not the quantity, is important for the nutritional <b>status</b> <b>of</b> Baltic gray <b>seals.</b> Nutritional <b>status</b> <b>of</b> gray <b>seals</b> may thus reveal changes in the marine food web which affect herring quality.

40|$|The {{abundance}} <b>of</b> harbor <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina richardii) {{has declined}} {{in recent decades}} at several Alaska locations. The causes of these declines are unknown, but there is concern about the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the populations, especially in the Gulf of Alaska. To assess the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> harbor <b>seals</b> in the Gulf of Alaska, we conducted aerial surveys <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> on their haul-out sites in August-September 1996. Many factors influence the propensity <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> to haul out, including tides, weather, time of day, and time of year. Because these “covariates” cannot simultaneously be controlled through survey design, we used a regression model to adjust the counts to {{an estimate of the}} number <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> that would have been ashore during a hypothetical survey conducted under ideal conditions for hauling out. The regression, a generalized additive model, not only provided an adjustment for the covariates, but also confirmed the nature and shape of the covariate effects on haul-out behavior. The number <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> hauled out was greatest {{at the beginning of the}} surveys (mid-August). There was a broad daily peak from about 1100 - 1400 local solar time. The greatest numbers were hauled out at low tide on terrestrial sites. Tidal state made little difference in the numbers hauled out on glacial ice, where the area available to seals did not fluctuate with the tide. Adjusting the survey counts to the ideal state for each covariate produced an estimate <b>of</b> 30, 035 <b>seals,</b> about 1. 8 times the total of the unadjusted counts (16, 355 seals). To the adjusted count, we applied a correction factor of 1. 198 from a separate study of two haul-out sites elsewhere in Alaska, to produce a total abundance estimate of 35, 981 (SE 1, 833). This estimate accounts both for the effect of covariates on survey counts and for the proportion <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> that remained in the water even under ideal conditions for hauling out...|$|R

The known primary breeding habitats for this species are in the White Sea, the south-western part of the Barents Sea, and in the coastal waters of the Kara Sea, which are seasonally covered by shore-fast ice. The main sealing sites are situated in the same areas. Female ringed seals become mature by the age of  6, and males by the age of 7.

Objectives: This article presents possible strategies for improving some of the operations in this sector.

40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} health {{assessment}} of wild-caught and stranded seals {{were used to}} describe the disease <b>status</b> <b>of</b> harbor <b>seals</b> in California. Clinical chemistry, infectious disease prevalence, immune function, and contaminant data were collected to evaluate harbor seal health with data collected from three groups <b>of</b> <b>seals.</b> Wild-caught <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> all ages were sampled at two locations: San Francisco Bay (a heavily urbanized estuary) and Tomales Bay (a less developed control site). Stranded seals entered rehabilitation from a more extensive portion of the California coast which included the locations where seals were caught. Hematology reference intervals were generated to provide a baseline for health assessment among the seals. Individual variability in blood variables among seals was affected by age, sex, location, and girth. Disease surveillance focused on pathogens known to cause lesions in harbor seals, zoonoses, and those with terrestrial sources. Specific pathogens of interest were E coli, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio spp, Campylobacter spp, Salmonella, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, avian influenza virus, Brucella, Leptospira spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis neurona, and Neospora caninum, Leptospira spp, and phocine and canine distemper virus. There was evidence of exposure to all pathogens except for phocine distemper virus. Simple measures of immune response were used to evaluate the immune function <b>of</b> harbor <b>seal</b> pups in rehabilitation that had evidence of previous bacterial infection. The swelling response to a subcutaneous injection of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was positively associated with growth rate, possibly illustrating the energetic trade-offs between growth and immunity. Blubber contaminant concentrations (PCBs, DDTs, PBDEs, CHLDs, and HCHs) in harbor seal pups were grouped by extent of suckling and strand location. The ratio of PCB:DDT was increased in San Francisco Bay and decreased in Monterey Bay compared with other locations along the coast. Pups that weaned in the wild, lost weight and then stranded had the highest contaminant levels, equivalent to the concentrations detected in stranded adult harbor seals. Dispersal and survival were monitored by satellite telemetry in harbor seal pups released from rehabilitation and recently weaned wild-caught pups to assess the effect of condition, health, and contaminant levels on survival probability. Increased contaminant levels and decreased thyroxine (T 4) were associated with decreased survival probability. Increased mass, particularly among the rehabilitated pups, was associated with increased survival probability. This study demonstrates that health and survival <b>of</b> harbor <b>seals</b> pups along the central California coast are impacted by human activities such as contaminant disposal, pathogen pollution and boat traffic, although the variability in individual health measures requires carefully designed studies to detect these effects.
