25|$|Hermit crabs {{are more}} closely related to <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> and {{porcelain}} crabs than they are to true crabs (Brachyura). However, the relationship of king crabs to the rest of Paguroidea is a highly contentious topic. Many studies based on physical characteristics, genetic information, and combined data, support the longstanding hypothesis that the king crabs in the family Lithodidae are derived hermit crabs and should be classified as a family within Paguroidea. Other researchers have challenged this, asserting that the Lithodidae (king crabs) should be placed with the Hapalogastridae in a separate superfamily Lithodoidea. Six families are formally recognized in the superfamily Paguroidea, containing around 1100 species in total in 120 genera.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are benthic, spending {{their lives on}} the sea-floor. A few, however, spend part of their lives living in the water column, often forming dense pelagic swarms of juveniles, especially in areas with high densities of plankton; this behaviour is seen in the species Pleuroncodes planipes (off Baja California, Mexico), P.monodon (Peru and Chile) and Munida gregaria (Otago, New Zealand and southernmost South America). Although Munida quadrispina also has pelagic juveniles, they have not been observed to form swarms. As well as these pelagic swarms, many species form dense aggregations on the sea floor. This is particularly prominent around hydrothermal vents, where species such as Shinkaia crosnieri are particularly abundant.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{mostly on}} marine snow—the {{continuous}} shower of mostly organic detritus falling from surface waters—little {{is known about}} the complicated food web connecting the organisms of the deep. Because of the harsh environment, there is a low density of organisms observed. Despite the low density, there is a fairly diverse community living on the abyssal plain. Installation and maintenance work has enabled a number of these organisms to be observed. The main groups of organisms observed include fish (skates and rattails), echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, and crinoids), molluscs (octopus and squid), sea pens, crabs, and <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters.</b> A number of pelagic (living in the water column) organisms were observed such as squid, jellyfish, ostracods, ctenophores, and salps.|$|E

2500|$|In Central America, {{the primary}} species of squat lobster {{targeted}} by fisheries is {{a species of}} Pleuroncodes. There {{is a great deal}} of confusion over both scientific names and common names, and the exact species is often unknown. In El Salvador, the commercial catch is generally referred to as [...] "P.planipes", but is in fact P.monodon, for instance. Commercial fishing for <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> in El Salvador began in the early 1980s; production increased markedly in the 2001 season, and has continued to grow, now making up 98% of the demersal resources landed in El Salvador, with annual catches peaking at 13,708t in 2005. In Costa Rica, aggregations of <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are avoided, as the fishermen fear the <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> will clog their nets. In Nicaragua, <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are heavily exploited, especially following a large increase in fishing effort in the 2007 season. In Panama, production reached 492t in 2008. Chilean squat lobster fisheries initially targeted Cervimunida johni, beginning in 1953. By the mid-1960s, effort had largely switched to P.monodon. In an effort to conserve stocks, the Chilean government instituted quotas for <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and the fishery is closely monitored. In New Zealand, Munida gregaria has been considered as a potential fisheries resource, particularly to feed farmed Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> feed on {{a variety}} of foods, with some species filter feeding, while others are detritus-feeders, algal grazers, {{scavengers}} or predators. Some are highly specialised; Munidopsis andamanica is a deep-sea species that feeds only on sunken wood, including trees washed out to sea and timber from ship wrecks. <b>Squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are large enough to be caught by top predators, and can thus form a [...] "direct trophic shortcut" [...] between the primary producers {{at the bottom of the}} food web, and the carnivores at the top.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two main}} groups of <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> share most {{features}} of their morphology. They resemble true lobsters in some ways, but are somewhat flattened dorsoventrally, and are typically smaller. <b>Squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> vary in carapace length (measured from the eye socket {{to the rear}} edge), from [...] {{in the case of}} Munidopsis aries, down to only a few millimetres in the case of Galathea intermedia and some species of Uroptychus. As in other decapod crustaceans, the body of a squat lobster may be divided into two main regions: the cephalothorax (itself made up of the cephalon, or head, and the thorax), and the pleon or abdomen.|$|E
2500|$|They {{contain a}} total of around 60 genera, divided into over 900 {{recognised}} species; more than 120 undescribed species are also thought to exist. The centre of diversity for <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> is the [...] "coral triangle", or Indo-Australian Archipelago, especially {{in the region of}} New Caledonia (with more than 300 species) and the region of Indonesia and the Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are dorsoventrally {{flattened}} crustaceans {{with long}} tails held curled beneath the cephalothorax. They {{are found in}} the two superfamilies Galatheoidea and Chirostyloidea, which form part of the decapod infraorder Anomura, alongside groups including the hermit crabs and mole crabs. They are distributed worldwide in the oceans, and occur from near the surface to deep sea hydrothermal vents, even occurring above water in caves [...] More than 900 species have been described, in around 60 genera. Some species form dense aggregations, either on the sea floor or in the water column, and a small number are subject to commercial fishery.|$|E

2500|$|Among the Anomura, {{there is}} {{considerable}} variation {{in the number of}} larval stages. In the South American freshwater genus Aegla, the young hatch from the eggs in the adult form. <b>Squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> pass through four, or occasionally five, larval states, which have a long rostrum, and a spine {{on either side of the}} carapace; the first post-larva closely resembles the adult. Porcelain crabs have two or three larval stages, in which the rostrum and the posterior spine on the carapace are [...] "enormously long". Hermit crabs pass through around four larval stages. The post-larva is known as the glaucothoe, after a genus named by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1830. The glaucothoe is [...] long in Pagurus longicarpus, but glaucothoe larvae up to [...] are known, and were once thought to represent animals which had failed to develop correctly. Like the preceding stages, the glaucothoe is symmetrical, and although the glaucothoe begins as a free-swimming form, it often acquires a gastropod shell to live in; the coconut crab, Birgus latro, always carries a shell when the immature animal comes ashore, but this is discarded later.|$|E
2500|$|Lobsters {{have long}} bodies with muscular tails, {{and live in}} crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, {{including}} the first pair, which are usually {{much larger than the}} others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate. Commercially important species include two species of Homarus (which looks more like the stereotypical lobster) from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi (which looks more like a shrimp, or a [...] "mini lobster") – the Northern Hemisphere genus Nephrops and the Southern Hemisphere genus Metanephrops. Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word [...] "lobster" [...] in their names, the unqualified term [...] "lobster" [...] generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae. Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters.</b> The closest living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cephalothorax}} {{is made of}} 13 body segments (somites), {{although the}} divisions are not obvious and are most easily inferred from the paired appendages. From front to back, these are, the two pairs of antennae, six pairs of mouthparts (mandibles, maxillae, maxillules and three pairs of maxillipeds), five pairs of pereiopods. The cephalothorax {{is covered with a}} thick carapace, which may extend forwards in front of the eyes to form a rostrum; this is highly variable among <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters,</b> being vestigial in Chirostylus, wide and often serrated in some genera, and long, narrow, and flanked with [...] "supraorbital spines" [...] in others. The degree of ornamentation {{on the surface of the}} carapace also varies widely, and there are almost always at least a few setae (bristles), which can be iridescent in some members of the Galatheidae and Munididae. A pair of compound eyes also project on stalks from the front of the carapace; these are made up of ommatidia with square facets, which is typical of the [...] "reflecting superposition" [...] form of eye. Many deep-sea species have reduced eyes, and reduced movement of the eyestalks. In the families Munididae and Galatheidae, there is often a row of setae close to the eyes, forming [...] "eyelashes".|$|E
