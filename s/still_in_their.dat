5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|RAF night fighter defences were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> infancy. Most fighters lacked {{radar and}} in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, they flew outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences would be highly sophisticated. But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E
5|$|Whatever Tiberius's motives, the {{withdrawal}} was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There {{was no longer}} a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of princeps survive.|$|E

25|$|In June, 1865 {{the members}} of the free black {{community}} of Norfolk, Virginia petitioned the federal government to abolish the restrictive literacy and assembly laws that were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> place <b>in</b> <b>their</b> community. The law was abolished in 1867.|$|R
5|$|Another {{location}} in the city used for large productions is the Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. At the time, {{it was one of}} the largest stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating 1576 persons, the Temple is used year-round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, Hamasa Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies.|$|E
5|$|Until the Indians {{have sold}} their lands, and removed {{from them in}} pursuance of the treaty stipulations, {{they are to be}} {{regarded}} as <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> ancient possession, and are in under their original rights, and entitled to the undisturbed enjoyment of them. This was the effect of the decision in the case of Fellows v. Blacksmith. The time for the surrender of the possession, according to their consent given in the treaty, had not expired when these taxes were levied. The period within which the removal was to take place, under the treaty of 1838, was five years from the time it went into effect. It was not proclaimed till 1840, and under that of 1842 the time did not expire till 1846. The taxation of the lands was premature and illegal.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Auerbach relinquished {{his general}} {{managing}} duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 {{hero in the}} finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|In mid-February 1944, the 37th Battalion, {{as part of}} 14th Brigade, was {{involved}} in the Battle of the Green Islands, codenamed Operation Squarepeg. The aim was to secure an airfield for use in further advances in the Solomon Islands. On 15 February, the battalion was landed on the western side of Nissan Island, largely a coral reef, along with 35th Battalion. The 30th Battalion was landed on {{the eastern side of the}} island; collectively, the landings were the largest amphibious operation mounted by New Zealand forces in the war. Although the Japanese were present on the island, the landing was unopposed. Initially positioned to the north of the island's airstrip, it later moved to the village of Sior. Although the Japanese were reported to be in the south of the island, the battalion still carried out patrols to ensure none were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sector. Later in the month, soldiers from the battalion carried out landings on Sau, a small island to the northeast of Nissan Island, to deal with Japanese there. Four were wounded in exchanges of gunfire but this operation effectively ended any meaningful Japanese resistance in the area. With Nissan Island secure by 28 February, the battalion switched to a defensive mode of operations, monitoring for Japanese counterattacks and assisting in the building of the facilities necessary to allow the island to be used for air and sea operations.|$|E
5|$|Most of Rainilaiarivony's {{children}} {{failed to}} achieve their full potential. One son, Rafozehana, died young of delirium tremens, and sons Ratsimandresy and Ralaiarivony both met violent ends while <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> youth. Randravalahy, to whom Rainilaiarivony later ascribed the name Radilifera, was sent to France to study but returned before earning his diploma and faded into obscurity among the upper classes of Imerina. Ramangalahy studied medicine and {{was on his way}} to becoming a successful doctor, but died of illness in his twenties. Three brothers turned to crime: Rajoelina, who violated the laws of his country to enrich himself by selling contraband gold to an English company; Penoelina, who studied in England before health issues recalled him to Madagascar, where he and his friends engaged in sexual assault and theft; and Ramariavelo (Mariavelo), who organized a group of bandits to rob the houses of common citizens. One of Rainilaiarivony's daughters died in her twenties following a self-induced abortion, and the rest married and lived quiet lives out of public view.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E

After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village. While searching {{for a way to}} stop the Vambees, Musashi finds the Water Scroll and defeats its crest guardian in the basement where the Vambees originate. While Musashi searches for the Fire Scroll, Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and makes his way to the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands. Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind Scroll, and defeats its crest guardian in an ants' nest.|$|E
