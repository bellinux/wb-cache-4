5|$|If the Governor General of Canada {{is unable}} to give assent, {{it can be done}} by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not {{actually}} necessary for the governor general to <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Davíð's {{government}} became {{embroiled in}} controversy, when he {{introduced a bill}} which {{would have made it}} impossible for large private companies to own more than 15% of any one media company, and under which newspapers and television stations could not be owned by the same company. Davíð argued that this was to prevent concentration of the media {{in the hands of a}} few people, and to enable the media to remain independent and critical not only towards politicians, but also towards financial moguls. His critics maintained, however, that the proposal was directly aimed at Baugur Group which they claimed Davíð regarded as a political enemy. By then, Baugur had bought another newspaper, the television station from Jón Ólafsson and a few radio stations, and controlled more than half of the media market. The Alþingi passed a much-softened version of the media bill. But in summer 2004, for the first time in the history of the Icelandic Republic, the president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, refused to sign the bill into law. Davíð criticized this, pointing out that the director of the television station formerly owned by Jón Ólafsson and recently bought by Baugur, Sigurður G. Guðjónsson, had been Ólafur Ragnar's campaign manager in his first presidential campaign, and that Ólafur's daughter was employed by Baugur. However, Baugur enjoyed considerable goodwill in Iceland because their shops offered lower prices than competitors, while their owners, Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson and Jóhannes Jónsson, were seen as an embodiment of an Icelandic dream of rags-to-riches. Many people agreed that the media bill seemed to be a part of a political duel rather than an attempt to make general law. The conclusion of the long struggle was that Davíð Oddsson withdrew the bill instead of holding a national referendum on it, as required by the Icelandic constitution in the event that the president refuses to <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> into law.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Hoosac Tunnel was a {{significant}} issue within the state during Andrew's tenure. [...] The state had loaned its builder, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, $2 million in the 1850s to support the construction. [...] In 1861, both outgoing Governor Banks, and Andrew, after he took office, refused to <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> authorizing additional funding to the financially troubled project. [...] Andrew lacked confidence in Herman Haupt, the tunnel's chief engineer, and withdrew the state engineer overseeing the project. [...] These actions cost Andrew votes in the 1861 election in the towns on the railroad route, {{but not enough to}} cost him the election. [...] The state took over the tunnel project in 1862, and it was finally completed at great expense in 1875.|$|E

[...] On June 1, Haslam <b>signed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> requiring voters to present photo identification at polling places, a measure supporters argue prevents voter fraud, but detractors have derided {{as an attempt to}} disenfranchise traditionally-Democratic voting blocs. On June 2, Haslam <b>signed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> replacing public school teachers' collective bargaining rights with a process called [...] "collaborative conferencing", effectively bypassing the teachers' union, the Tennessee Education Association.|$|R

500|$|After easily {{winning the}} Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic {{incumbent}} Governor Ann Richards. In {{the course of}} the campaign, Bush pledged to <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor. According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race [...] "featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs". The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove, but Rove denied being involved. Bush won the general election with 53.5percent against Richards' 45.9percent.|$|E
500|$|Vane {{attempted}} to appeal his conviction, {{and tried to}} get the magistrates to <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bill</b> of Exclusion in which Vane catalogued all the problems he saw with his trial. [...] However, the magistrates refused. [...] Informed of Vane's conduct before and during the trial, Charles II now felt that Vane was too dangerous a man to be left alive, and retracted his clemency. [...] (Unlike Vane, John Lambert at his trial had thrown himself on the mercy of the court, and was consequently exiled to Guernsey after his conviction.) [...] Although Vane had been sentenced to the commoner's death of being hanged and then drawn and quartered, Charles was persuaded to grant him the gentleman's death of beheading. [...] On 14 June 1662 Vane was taken to Tower Hill and beheaded. Noted diarist Samuel Pepys was there and recorded the event: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Article 109 of the constitution: [...] "The King {{sanctions}} and promulgates laws". In Belgium, the royal assent is called sanction royale / koninklijke bekrachtiging (Royal Sanction), and is {{granted by the}} King signing the proposed statute. The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives. The monarch promulgates the law, meaning {{that he or she}} formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In 1990, when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the Council of Ministers, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers [...] "on behalf of the Belgian People". In a joint meeting, both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.|$|E

2500|$|The Governor-General, Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, was a stern imperialist who openly {{associated}} with the David Lloyd George government in England and was influential behind the scenes in pushing for conscription to aid the Empire's war effort. Realising the impasse, Munro Ferguson promised Hughes upon his return that he would <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> for conscription, and grant a double dissolution if the parliament could not pass it. However, Hughes quickly realised that the issue could destroy the party, especially if taken to a general election, {{and that there were}} few options except to take the question directly to the people. This route was advised by high court Justices Edmund Barton and Griffith. At least one close associate felt that the prospect of a referendum on the issue also appealed to Hughes self-perception of his popular status. [...] "Hughes reveled in his own success as a charismatic leader, and it appealed strongly to his romantic nature {{to be able to talk}} directly with the people".|$|E

2500|$|Until 2013, Dayton {{opposed the}} legalization of medical {{cannabis}} and drug policy reform, adopting {{the same position as}} his Republican predecessor Tim Pawlenty. The Marijuana Policy Project called Dayton [...] "no more favorable" [...] to drug policy reform than the last Republican governor. Dayton was reported to have become more favorable to {{the legalization of}} medical cannabis in 2014, but advocates for medical marijuana called the position [...] "smoke and mirrors," [...] and claimed he was deliberately stalling progress on a bill to legalize medical marijuana that would otherwise have enough votes to pass. In a meeting with advocates, Dayton allegedly told a mother of a child with severe epilepsy to buy the drug illegally because he would not <b>sign</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to legalize it, but he denied having said that. When Dayton posed a $2 million study on medical marijuana with the Mayo Clinic instead of signing a bill to legalize medical marijuana, advocates [...] "bashed" [...] Dayton for not allowing suffering patients to have access to the drug. City Pages reported that the Governor could lose the vote of the many supporters of medical marijuana, 65% of Minnesotans, to the 3/5 of Republican candidates for governor in 2014 who [...] "strike a more liberal tone on marijuana reform" [...] than the Democratic incumbent.|$|E
