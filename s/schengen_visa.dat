25|$|The <b>Schengen</b> <b>Visa</b> is a visa for the Schengen Area, which {{consists}} of the European Economic Area, plus several other adjacent countries. The visa allows visitors {{to stay in the}} Schengen Area for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. The visa is valid for tourism, family visits, and business.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a report}} from April 2015, the Commission {{dismissed}} notifications by both Bulgaria and Romania of a general visa requirement by Australia. It concluded that the Australian electronic visa 'manual processing' treatment {{should not be considered}} as equivalent to the <b>Schengen</b> <b>visa</b> application procedures and consequently will not be covered by the reciprocity mechanism. In its previous report, the Commission also committed to assessing certain provisions of the US electronic visa system — such as the application fee.|$|E
25|$|Monaco has an open {{border with}} France. Schengen laws are {{administered}} {{as if it}} was part of EU, and <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> are accepted. Both French and Monégasque authorities carry out checks at Monaco's seaport and heliport.|$|R
50|$|The Embassy issues <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> for Norway, Finland and Iceland. It is {{mandatory}} for visa applicants to apply online through Application Portal Norway. In Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, visas to Norway are {{issued by the}} respective German embassies.|$|R
25|$|The visa {{exemption}} {{also applies to}} Green Card holders, but {{does not apply to}} holders of C1 visas issued by the U.S. Holders of U.S. or <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> must ensure their visa is valid for at least 180 days from their arrival date.|$|R
25|$|A {{family member}} of an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen who is in {{possession}} of a residence permit indicating their status is exempt from the requirement to hold a visa when entering the European Union, European Economic Area or Switzerland when they are accompanying their EU/EEA/Swiss family member or are seeking to join them. However the UK requires family members to obtain a special permit in order to enter the United Kingdom. Non-EU family members will need a <b>Schengen</b> <b>Visa</b> before they travel to Switzerland even if they possess a UK residence permit that clearly mentions that they are the family {{member of an}} EEA Citizen.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand Government {{has signed}} {{bilateral}} visa waiver agreements {{with a number}} of the individual countries who are Schengen signatories, which allow New Zealand citizens to spend up to three months in the relevant country, without reference to time spent in other Schengen signatory states. Since these agreements continue to remain valid despite the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the European Commission has confirmed that in practice if New Zealanders visit Schengen countries which have signed these types of bilateral agreements with New Zealand, then the terms of these agreements override the conditions normally imposed {{as a result of the}} <b>Schengen</b> <b>visa</b> exemption agreement.|$|E
25|$|Svalbard {{is part of}} Norway and has {{a special}} status under {{international}} law. It {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area. There is no visa regime in existence for Svalbard either for entry, residence or work, but it is difficult to visit Svalbard without travelling through the Schengen Area, although there are charter flights from Russia. Since 2011, the Norwegian government has imposed systematic border checks on individuals wishing to enter and leave Svalbard, requiring a passport or national identity card for non-Norwegian citizens. As a result, the border between Svalbard and the rest of Norway is largely treated like any other external Schengen border. A <b>Schengen</b> <b>visa</b> must be multiple entry to allow returning to Norway. There is no welfare or asylum system for immigrants on Svalbard, and people incapable of supporting themselves may be sent away.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Germany {{opened a}} {{consulate}} general in Kaliningrad. This consulate allows Kaliningrad residents to get <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> {{without having to}} travel to Moscow. An agreement between Gerhard Schröder, Chancellor of Germany, and President of Russia Vladimir Putin established the consulate in light of Lithuania and Poland, which surround Kaliningrad, joining the EU. Russian concerns with Germany wanting the former Königsberg back had stifled earlier plans for a German consulate.|$|R

(Although both the UK and the Republic {{are members of}} the European Union, neither {{are members of the}} Schengen Area so <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> are not valid for travel to the Common Travel Area. Air and sea passengers travelling between the Common Travel Area and the Schengen Area are subject to systematic passport/identity checks.) ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{run up to}} {{accession}} to the European Union, Croatia aligned its visa policy {{with that of the}} European Union. As a result of the new visa regime, some third-country nationals (such as Russian and Turkish nationals) who were previously temporarily exempt from having to obtain a visa to visit Croatia were now subject to a visa requirement. However, to mitigate the effect of the re-imposition of a visa regime on tourist numbers, the Croatian government has introduced a 'facilitated entry of aliens' procedure, exempting travellers who have a <b>Schengen</b> <b>visa</b> or residence permit from having to obtain an additional Croatian visa to visit Croatia until 31 December 2013. In addition, the Croatian government has extended the working hours and capacity of its foreign missions in countries such as Russia and Ukraine to ensure that applications for Croatian visas are processed more efficiently.|$|E
25|$|The French {{overseas}} departments of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion, and the overseas collectivity of Saint Martin {{are part of}} the European Union but do not form part of the Schengen Area. The EU's freedom of movement provisions apply, but each territory operates its own visa regime for non-European Economic Area (EEA), non-Swiss nationals. While a visa valid for one of these territories will be valid for all, visa exemption lists differ. A <b>Schengen</b> <b>visa,</b> even one issued by France, is not valid for these territories. A visa for Sint Maarten (which is valid for travelling to the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin) is also valid for the French side. France also has several territories which are neither part of the EU nor the Schengen Area. These are: French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, New Caledonia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna.|$|E
25|$|People born in Kosovo or {{otherwise}} legally settled in Kosovo are by law considered Serbian nationals {{and as such}} {{they are entitled to}} a Serbian passport. However, these passports are not issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior. Instead they are issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate. These particular passports do not allow the holder to enter the Schengen Area without a visa for a stay of less than three months within half a year, while Serbian citizens with passports issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior enjoy such a privilege. Bearers of passports issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate require <b>Schengen</b> <b>visa</b> for travel to Schengen area since they are not covered by the Annex II list of countries allowed visa free entry to the Schengen Area. The European Union considered it impossible for Serbia to evaluate the issuing of breeder documents needed to apply for a passport and the integrity of the procedures applied by Serbia to check the authenticity of documents provided by applicants for that purpose.|$|E

50|$|Ukrainians began {{arriving}} in Portugal {{in the late}} 1990s, {{and there was a}} tremendous growth {{in the early years of}} the twenty-first century. In the initial phase, between 1999 and 2002, immigration was processed either in an organized manner, based on intermediaries, or through international networks of illegal recruitment of workers, disguised as travel agencies. The earliest immigrants entered the country with <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas,</b> valid throughout the Schengen Area, and remained undocumented until they were granted permanence permits.|$|R
25|$|A {{predecessor}} of the <b>Schengen</b> common <b>visa</b> was the Benelux visa. Visas {{issued by}} Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg were valid {{for all the}} three countries.|$|R

25|$|The Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> are not valid. However, the islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Agreement {{provides}} that travellers passing between the islands and the Schengen Area are not to be treated as passing the external frontier of the Area. This means that there is an identity check at air or boat travel to the islands where Nordic citizens on intra-Nordic travel need no passport, only showing the ticket plus identity card.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> can {{be issued}} by {{any country in}} the Schengen area. Travellers must apply to the country's embassy which they are visiting. In cases of {{travellers}} visiting multiple countries in the Schengen area, travellers must apply to their main destination's embassy. [...] If the main destination cannot be determined, the traveller should apply for the visa at the embassy of the Schengen country of first entry. Often, external service providers are contracted by certain diplomatic missions to process, collect and return visa applications.|$|R
2500|$|Andorra retains border {{controls}} with both France and Spain. [...] Citizens of EU countries {{are required to}} have either their national identity cards or passports to enter Andorra, while anyone else requires a passport or equivalent. <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> are accepted, [...] but those travellers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area need a multiple-entry visa to visit Andorra, because entering Andorra means leaving the Schengen Area. There are {{border controls}} {{in the other direction}} also, but more focused on customs control (Andorra is a tax haven with 4% VAT).|$|R

He notes that applications from Russia make up the largest share of all <b>Schengen</b> <b>visas</b> issued and that Russia {{has one of the}} lowest visa refusal rates in Schengen states. He argues that taking a harder line on visa applications from Russia could therefore offer a natural route to exert pressure over Ukraine, however such a policy would also carry a significant cost for EU countries...|$|R
