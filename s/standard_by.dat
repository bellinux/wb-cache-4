5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to {{the same}} {{dysfunctional}} managerial attitude as did {{the rest of the}} American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> which progress was measured.

5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E

5|$|When the French Government first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of universality was put into practice in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an international <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies. However, these early overtures failed and the custody of the metric system remained {{in the hands of the}} French government until 1875.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} {{purpose of the}} bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving {{them out of their}} bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No.1 Squadron and one by English Electric Canberra jet bombers of No.12 Squadron RAF on 21February 1956, was considered the most successful of the more than 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops. By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. Its service was recognised with the presentation of a Squadron <b>Standard</b> <b>by</b> the Commander-in-Chief Far East Air Force, Air Marshal The Earl of Brandon. Until 2014, the Malayan Emergency had marked the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations.|$|E
5|$|During Ezana's reign a {{major change}} in both the Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took place {{as a result of the}} change of the {{official}} religion to Christianity, one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the Cross on his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I's weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately. Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins. Later Christian coins reflect the adoptment of the 4.54 g <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> Constantine, with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1.70 g for the gold coins.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the {{navigation}} {{was the subject}} of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> deepening the channels and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. Conisbrough lock was removed altogether, and the two Eastwood locks were combined into one. The new lock was initially named the Sir Frank Price Lock, after the chairman of the British Waterways Board who formally opened it on 1 June 1983. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however. At Kilnhurst and Long Sandall, the new larger locks were built alongside the original locks, and so a comparison of the relative sizes can be made.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, the Southern Railway {{ordered a}} final batch of 15 {{locomotives}} (Nos.14001414) to expand class availability on the Southern Railway's network. These were built at Ashford works and {{differed from the}} previous 65 {{in a number of}} ways. The cabs of the final eight locomotives (Nos.14071414) were fitted for left-hand driving, which was adopted as <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> the Southern Railway. The original Nclass chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1class, which increased route availability by allowing the locomotives to pass under lower bridges and tunnels. Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927, which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke deflector design for the Southern Railway. A smaller version was fitted to Nos.14001414 during building.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 2002, the {{regiment}} {{was presented with}} its current <b>Standard</b> <b>by</b> the then Governor General, Dr. Peter Hollingworth. On 26 July 2007, after 31 years of service the Leopard was replaced by 59 M1A1 Abrams AIM, with 41 being delivered to {{the regiment}} and the remaining vehicles issued to the School of Armour for use for training purposes. Seven M88A2 Hercules Armoured Recovery Vehicles were also acquired, two being delivered to the regiment. The Leopards never saw operational service, although during the 1999 East Timor crisis the regiment was placed on standby to deploy in the event the conflict escalated, while the regiment was not deployed during Australia's involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Members of the unit later deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as Bushmaster PMV crews, while others have also served in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. During this period the regiment was the only main battle tank unit in the Australian Army and was based at Robertson Barracks, in Darwin. Until 2013 it {{provided the basis for}} one of three battlegroups within the mechanised 1st Brigade, which included two mechanised infantry battalions, one cavalry regiment, one tank regiment, and a medium artillery regiment.|$|E
