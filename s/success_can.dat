5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic <b>success</b> <b>can</b> not be measured only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income {{is not sufficient to}} evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their <b>success</b> <b>can</b> {{be attributed to}} the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E

During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at Cattistock in Dorset, {{and it was in}} the south west that he chose to play his cricket. On completion of his studies at Repton, he attended Oriel College, Oxford.|$|E

5|$|The Cook Islands compete {{as a part}} of netball's Oceania region. More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the sport. Participation in the game grew during the 1970s. Much of this is possible because of the national governing organisation, the Cook Islands Netball Association which is a member of Oceania Netball Federation. Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament.

5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching <b>success</b> <b>can</b> drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions.

About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E

Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Monomorium {{species is}} {{particularly}} successful. This fact is particularly curious {{because of the}} presence of a very aggressive ant family, Iridomyrmex, which is quite proficient at interference competition. Iridomyrmex ants are able to quickly seek out food sources and prevent other ant species from reaching them. However, unlike other ant species, Monomorium species, despite their unaggressive nature and small size, are able to thrive even in areas where Iridomyrmex dominates. This <b>success</b> <b>can</b> be attributed to their efficient foraging strategy, and their novel use of venom alkaloids, repellant chemical signals. With these two behaviors, Monomorium species can rapidly monopolize and defend food sources.|$|E
25|$|The spin quartet {{played a}} {{combined}} 231 Tests for India from 1962 to 1983, and grabbed 853 wickets, with 43 five-wicket inning hauls. Much of this <b>success</b> <b>can</b> {{be attributed to}} the different bowling styles these bowlers possessed. Bedi was an orthodox left arm-spinner, while Chandrasekhar an attacking leg-break bowler. On the other hand, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan were both off-spinners. This way, they could target all kinds of batsmen in the opposition and give their captains plenty of options. It was Chandrasekhar and Bedi who were the leaders of the attack. The two played 42 Tests alongside each other and had almost similar figures, of 184 wickets each. Bedi averaged 27.22, while Chandra averaged 28.70 in these games.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the recent stream of literature on NK Model’s applications {{to the field of}} technological evolution. It is argued that while the model has a great explanatory potential in economics proper, its behavioral foundations are still maladapted for treatment of purportive decision-making strategies for technological innovation. Concentrating on the decision rule for accepting novelties, we first analyze the consequences of intentional and unintentional imprecision in following hill-climbing strategy, highlighting the interplay between rigidity and deliberate experimentation. Building on Simon’s insights on satisficing behavior and designing without final goals we build a simulative model that provides a possibility to compare strategies differing in the desired level of imprecision. Secondly, we shift our attention to the question of organizational memory, analyzing in a simulation setting a fully memory dependent and a fully memory independent innovation-related strategies. The results confirm that from the one hand up to a certain level “imperfection ” of rule-following behavior is a virtue rather than a threat, while from the other, that past <b>successes</b> <b>can</b> preclude adaptability of the firm, while disregarding such <b>successes</b> <b>can</b> be very risky...|$|R

25|$|Part of this {{relative}} lack of <b>success</b> <b>can</b> be attributed to President Colgate Darden's de-emphasis of football after the 1952 season, leading the program to turn down {{an invitation to the}} 1953 Cotton Bowl Classic against the Texas Longhorns in the first televised football game. Most significantly, Darden also reduced the number of football scholarships by 80% relative to competing teams when joining the Atlantic Coast Conference later that year, leading Art Guepe to resign and coach Vanderbilt. While future Presidents would allow the same number of scholarships as its rivals after Darden retired in 1959, Virginia would remain a shadow of its former football self until the 1981 hiring of Welsh some twenty-two years later.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the credit}} for Smith's <b>success</b> <b>can</b> also be {{attributed}} to batting coach Trent Woodhill, who coached Smith as a junior and noted his abundant talent. He has also defended Smith's unique batting style, and has long argued that in Australia, many naturally talented cricketers who may not necessarily have an orthodox technique are let down by over-coaching; in the years between leaving school and his elevation into international cricket, Smith had his technique picked apart by a number of well-intentioned coaches. Since re-establishing his working relationship with Woodhill, Smith appears to have regained calm and confidence in his cricket, which has since produced results over the last few seasons. He tends to play more to the leg side and look to pull the ball more.|$|E
25|$|More than 60 years later, Bateman’s Principle has {{received}} considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success {{may result from}} random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive <b>success</b> <b>can</b> be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies {{are subject to change}} depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances. An example of a species that flouts Bateman's principle is the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides. Female pseudoscorpions that mated with more than one male had higher reproductive success.|$|E

25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} {{are those that}} argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic <b>success</b> <b>can</b> be at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences. Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in educational levels {{of men and women}} is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics. STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.|$|E
