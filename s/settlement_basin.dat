50|$|The {{government}} of New Caledonia has evolved strategies, technologies and policies {{to maintain the}} balance between environmental conservation measures and mining industry. The new legislation has ensured enforcement of installing pollution abatement equipment followed by re-plantation of vegetation after mine is exploited, and technological improvements for efficient economic extraction concomitant with environmental friendly pollution control measures. The government regulations have been effectively adopted by mine inspectors and through environmental impact assessments since 1992, even though regulations have been existence for 15 years prior to that. Apart from introducing new techniques, other measures adopted for environmental abatement are: 14 zones covering 19430 ha have been declared protected areas from prospecting or mining, construction of sedimentation barriers, catchment area treatment, creation of <b>settlement</b> <b>basin</b> and terraces to reduce silt flow into streams and rivers, minimum road building activity {{in the area of}} mining, creation of a vegetation barrier along roads and {{in the vicinity of the}} mines, adopt satellite remote sensing techniques for mapping and locating mining areas which would avoid road building for the purpose and completely re-vegetate the closed or fully extracted mines. In addition, a monitoring team of inspectors of mines is also instituted to check and ensure that pollution abatement measures are fully implemented. In 1994, a mining centre was set up at Nepoui-Kopeto not only to increase productivity levels by adopting modern mining methods but also to develop pollution control capabilities at mining sites.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of double-sided friction on the deformation performance of geomembranes in different liner structures was examined {{with the aid}} of subsidence tests, tensile tests and shear tests. Subsidence test results show that strain distribution in the <b>settlement</b> <b>basin</b> is very uneven. The tensile tests prove that in the geomembranes there is only a narrow deformation range and little strain where high loads, coarse-grained soil and soft textured geomembrane material are present. Equipment with a 500 mm x 1000 mm shear area was used for the shear tests. The angle of friction was found to be between about 7 and 28 depending on the geomembrane surface structure and that of the supporting and protective layers. The angle of friction between the geomembrane and protective non-woven fabrics corresponds closely to that determined in small shear apparatus (100 mm x 100 mm shear box.) (orig.)

Before Kikafu <b>basin</b> <b>settlement</b> there was no Machame as the latter was a later development based on what happened around the Kikafu basin. The ancestors who migrated to the Chagga at that time settled along the Kikafu river basin in an area today close to where the main road from Moshi to Arusha passes. Narrations identify two leaders of the populace; Mshami and Lemireny (popularly known as Nrwo). Lemireny means 'path finder'; the one believed to be endowed with insights to discern the right direction, and Mshami, whose leadership was {{by virtue of being}} the eldest son of Lemireny's elderly brother Nyari who had died while en route from their earlier settlement. It is not clear for how long they settled along the lower plain of Kikafu river near today's village of Kwa Sadala, but what is recalled is that after sometime they resolved to part with Lemireny (either also known as Mbise or was his son) choosing to go to settle on the plains of Mount Meru. However, some narrations claim that Mbise the lesser, chose the junior Meru as Mshami the elder settled with the senior, i.e. Kilimanjaro.|$|R

40|$|A multiproxy paleolimnological {{study of}} Douglas Lake, Michigan, was {{undertaken}} to elucidate {{the history of}} productivity and oxygen depletion in three basins of this multi-depression lake. Indicators investigated in three dated cores included chlorophyll a, Fe and Mn stratigraphy, and fossil chironomid assemblages. The coring sites were chosen to correspond to modern studies of oxygen depletion rates, and to determine if conclusions reached in these studies were supported by paleolimnological evidence.

Nevertheless, pollution problems discussed earlier in the article concerning the Guarapiranga river basin continue largely unabated. The water quality of the reservoir and its rivers, creeks and other tributaries is declining by the year given that only half of the dwellings have some sort of solid waste collection system and most of the solid waste collected continues to be disposed of in the reservoir as many poor households still have no formal wastewater collection and disposal at all.|$|R

The earliest documentary evidence discovered so far appears in the kiinokuni-zaiden-gungi-ge (紀伊国在田郡司解) written in 854. Its origin apparently coincides with a period of time when private ownership of land was beginning to be permitted and the reclamation of hitherto undeveloped lands was being encouraged. Although some scholars feel the kaito may have preceded the myoden, in the aforementioned respect it was similar to the myoden. However, in contrast to the latter, the areal distribution of the kaito phenomena generally seems {{to be associated with the}} less desirable agricultural areas, whereas the mydden are found in the plains and basin areas. Further study on this difference in areal distribution might prove to be significant in the analysis of these two seemingly similar phenomena, especially as the two are found within the same general areal extent of the distribution of the jori system.

40|$|Drained {{thermokarst}} {{lake basins}} (DTLBs) are ubiquitous landforms on Arctic tundra lowland. Their dynamic states are seldom investigated, despite their importance for landscape stability, hydrology, nutrient fluxes, and carbon cycling. Here we report results based on high-resolution Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements using space-borne data {{for a study}} area located on the North Slope of Alaska near Prudhoe Bay, where {{we focus on the}} seasonal thaw settlement within DTLBs, averaged between 2006 and 2010. The majority (14) of the 18 DTLBs in the study area exhibited seasonal thaw settlement of 3 – 4 cm. However, four of the DTLBs examined exceeded 4 cm of thaw <b>settlement,</b> with one <b>basin</b> experiencing up to 12 cm. Combining the InSAR observations with the in situ active layer thickness measured using ground penetrating radar and mechanical probing, we calculated thaw strain, an index of thaw settlement strength along a transect across the basin that underwent large thaw settlement. We found thaw strains of 10 – 35 % at the basin center, suggesting the seasonal melting of ground ice as a possible mechanism for the large settlement. These findings emphasize the dynamic nature of permafrost landforms, demonstrate the capability of the InSAR technique to remotely monitor surface deformation of individual DTLBs, and illustrate the combination of ground-based and remote sensing observations to estimate thaw strain. Our study highlights the need for better description of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape-scale processes for regional assessment of surface dynamics on Arctic coastal lowlands...|$|R
