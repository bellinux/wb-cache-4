5000|$|In the UK only, {{a special}} 2x 7" [...] vinyl {{gatefold}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>pack</b> was released, featuring the bonus 7" [...] vinyl, with an extended remix {{of the previous}} 1983 hit single [...] "That's Love That It Is" [...] and [...] "Game Above My Head (Extended Remix)", a remix of an album track from the band's 1983 album Mange Tout.|$|E
40|$|Italic fibre {{calligraphy}} pens {{in clear}} plastic packet with yellow, green, {{red and white}} designs on <b>sleeve.</b> <b>Pack</b> contains six pens with four medium nibs with black, blue, red and green ink and one fine and one large nib with black ink [...] Maker: Sanford.

50|$|It {{compiled}} tracks {{from various}} other compilations and splits from 1991-2001, {{most of which}} are out of print. It came as 3 CDs in individual full-colour <b>sleeves,</b> <b>pack</b> in a bronze coloured slipcase. The set was limited to 1000 copies.|$|R
60|$|The request, then {{five days}} after his {{farewell}} visit to Mrs. Noel--for the elephant-hide trunk which accompanied his rovings, produced her habitual period of seclusion, followed by her habitual appearance in his sitting-room bearing a note, and some bags of dried rose--leaves on a tray. She found him in his shirt <b>sleeves,</b> <b>packing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Each disc {{comes in}} its own full-color <b>sleeve,</b> all <b>packed</b> in a {{hardcover}} box. The art edition includes a bonus CD with a recording from 1979 and a signed postcard.|$|R
50|$|Prior to this, 1D retail {{barcodes}} {{were used}} that only offered limited protection {{as they did}} not cover all packaging on products. 2D barcodes meant that lids, <b>sleeves,</b> <b>pack</b> could all be identified by a barcode scanner to check that the product is packaged and dated correctly. In 2009, Marks and Spencer introduced a code of practice for the labelling of products that stipulated an autocoding system must be used on every production line. In 2013, {{it was estimated that}} autocoding software protects over 1500 lines in the United Kingdom; the largest supplier is Olympus Automation, which protects 723 food production lines.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1968, {{the album}} Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins was released. The album was {{distributed}} by Track in the UK and Tetragrammaton in the US after EMI refused {{to produce the}} cover or sleeve the record because of the cover photo, unless it was changed. EMI, however, pressed the record in Britain, while the album cover was printed by Technik. Apple got around the <b>sleeve</b> <b>packing</b> problem by hiring several Apple scruffs to package the album. Apple employee Jack Oliver had the Apple scruffs packing the record into sleeves [...] "in {{the basement of the}} old Apple shop".|$|R
50|$|Bearings {{may also}} be packed with other materials. Historically, the wheels on {{railroad}} cars used <b>sleeve</b> bearings <b>packed</b> with waste or loose scraps of cotton or wool fiber soaked in oil, then later used solid pads of cotton.|$|R
5000|$|Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins was {{released}} by Apple Records in the US in stereo on 11 November 1968, and in the UK in mono and stereo on 29 November 1968. The mono version was available only in the UK by mail order. The album was distributed by Track Records in the UK and Tetragrammaton Records in the US after EMI refused to produce the cover or sleeve the record, unless it was changed. EMI, however, pressed the record in Britain, while the album cover was printed by Technik.

5000|$|Most hoppers hold about 200 paintballs, {{and many}} modern {{electropneumatic}} markers can empty a full hopper in 10 seconds of sustained fire. In woodsball, {{and especially in}} scenario paintball, a player may be away from a base at which they can reload {{for an extended period}} of time. In speedball, the necessity of suppressing fire requires a very large amount of paint for a single game or match. In both cases, a harness with pods allows a player to have a portable supply of paint, without weighing down his or her marker with an enormous hopper. Harnesses capable of carrying a tank in addition to pods are usually labeled with a +1 (e.g. A harness capable of carrying four pods and a tank would be labeled 4+1). In addition, newer harness design make use of collapsible [...] "expansion sleeves" [...] in between the [...] "main" [...] <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Packs</b> with expansion <b>sleeves</b> are generally labelled X+Y, for instance 4+5, and indicate the number of main sleeves followed by the number of expansion <b>sleeves.</b> Some <b>packs</b> have multiple [...] "tiers" [...] of expansions or extra sleeves in very different locations on the harness, and may be labelled 4+3+2 where the last number is the additional set of expansions.|$|R
50|$|About half of {{the large}} {{photographic}} glass plate negatives exposed on the telescope, some 19,000 in all, had been accumulating in the sub-basement of the Robinson building at the California Institute of Technology since 1949. In 2002, astronomer Jean Mueller approached Richard Ellis, {{the director of the}} Caltech Optical Observatories, to volunteer to the task of organizing the Oschin Telescope plate archive. Given the go-ahead, she recruited eleven volunteers from the Mount Wilson Observatory Association (MWOA) and the Los Angeles Astronomical Society (LAAS), and the team then spent 13 weekends (more than one thousand hours) poring over the stacks, placing plates in protective <b>sleeves,</b> and <b>packing</b> them in more than 500 boxes that were transported to Palomar.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} interim results Earth Observing System AM- 1 project (EOS-AM- 1) nickel {{hydrogen}} cell life test being conducted {{under contract to}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) at the Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space (LMMS) facility in East Windsor, NJ; and at COMSAT Labs., Clarksburg, MD. The purpose of the tests is to verify that the EOS-AM- 1 cell design can meet five years of real-time Low Earth Orbit (LEO) cycling. The tests include both real-time LEO and accelerated stress tests. At LMMS, the first real-time LEO simulated 99 minute orbital cycle started on February 7, 1994 and the test has been running continuously since that time, with 18202 LEO cycles completed as of September 1, 1997. Each cycle consists of a 64 -minute charge (VT at 1, 507 volts per cell, 1. 06 C/D ratio, followed by 0. 6 ampere trickle charge) and a 35 minute constant power discharge at 177 watts (22. 5 percent DOD). At COMSAT, the accelerated stress test consists of 90 minute orbital cycles at 60 percent DOD with a 30 minute discharge at 60 amperes and a 60 minute charge at 40 amperes (VT at 1. 54 volts per cell to 1. 90 C/D ratio, followed by 0. 6 ampere trickle charge). The real-time LEO life test battery consists of seven, 50 AH (nameplate rating) Eagle-Picher, Inc. (EPI) Mantech cells manufactured into three, 3 -cell pack assemblies (there are two place holder cells that {{are not part of}} the life test electrical circuit). The test pack is configured to simulate the conductive thermal design of the spacecraft battery, including: conductive aluminum <b>sleeves,</b> 3 -cell <b>pack</b> aluminum baseplate, and honeycomb panel all mounted to a liquid (minus 5 deg) cold plate. The entire assembly is located in a thermal chamber operating at plus 3 deg. The accelerated stress test unit consists of five cells mounted in machined aluminum test sleeves and is operating at plus 10 deg. The real-time LEO life test battery has met all performance requirements through the first 18, 202 cycles, including: end of charge and discharge cell voltages and voltage gradients; end of charge and discharge cells pressures; within cell and between cell temperature gradients dischare capacity; current and power levels; and all charge parameters. The accelerated stress test battery has completed 11998 cycles when the test was terminated. The stress test unit met all test parameters. This paper reports battery performances as a function of cycle life for both the real-time LEO and the accelerated life test regimes...|$|R
