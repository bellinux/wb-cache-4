5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of Arad {{is made up of}} Loess land, while the eastern part is made up of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> {{including}} chalk, flint and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|Interbedded <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> {{makes up}} 93% {{of the surface}} rock in the Catawissa Creek watershed, while the {{remaining}} 7% is sandstone. South of Mainville, the Catawissa Creek river valley is made of red shale. There is also conglomerate, greenish-gray sandstone, olive-colored shale, and anthracite coal near Catawissa Creek.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> can be {{subdivided}} into four {{groups based on}} the processes responsible for their formation: clastic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> biochemical (biogenic) <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> chemical <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> and a fourth category for [...] "other" [...] <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> formed by impacts, volcanism, and other minor processes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Rocks</b> is {{a course}} handout that accompanies the {{discussion}} of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The objectives of the handout are: to explain the formation of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{in terms of the}} rock cycle; explain and give examples of the various sedimentary depositional environments; discuss the textural characteristics of sediments; explain why <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are important in the study of Earth history; contrast the basic groups of sedimentary rocks; describe the principle characteristics of common sedimentary rocks; and describe the ways in which <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are lithified. There are many photos, which show examples of different types of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> Links are provided to the online Physical Geology resources at Georgia Perimeter College.

5|$|The {{geologic}} {{story of}} the Kootenay is strongly connected to the geology of the Columbia, Selkirk and Rocky Mountains. The mountains {{in much of the}} Kootenay River catchment are composed of Precambrian <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> of the Belt Supergroup, in turn stratified into several subgroups with slightly different characteristics and ages.|$|E
5|$|The surface rock in Catawissa Creek largely {{consists}} of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> such as sandstone and shale. However, {{there is also}} coal in the watershed. Major soils in the creek's watershed include the Leck Kill soil and the Albrights series. Most of the steeper hills in the watershed are situated near {{the headwaters of the}} creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland than it does today. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods that hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the park}} is {{underlain}} by Triassic diabase, an igneous rock, and the many large, rounded boulders within the park are made of this material. Approximately 180 million years ago, the diabase intruded into older Triassic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Gettysburg Formation, consisting of red sandstone and shale. Along the contacts of the diabase and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> the molten diabase heated the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> to metamorphic rocks.|$|R
50|$|The Newport Formation (NSW) are <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{occurring}} in the Sydney Basin in eastern Australia. This stratum is up to 49 metres thick. Formed in the mid-Triassic, {{it is part of}} the Narrabeen Group of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
5|$|When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. Over millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E
5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.|$|E
5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in {{a substantial part of}} the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
40|$|Instrumental neutron {{activation}} analysis was carried out for eight sandstones and four shales from the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Shimanto terrane of Satsuma Peninsula, Kagoshima Prefecture, southern Kyushu, Japan. Fission-track dating of zircons was also tentatively applied to granitic cobbles derived from the basement <b>rocks</b> to the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> These data are useful to clear not only the characterization of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> but also the sedimentary history in the Shimanto terrane of this area. ...|$|R
50|$|Iron-rich <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{which contain}} 15% or more iron. However, most <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> contain iron in varying degrees. The {{majority}} of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 570 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago). Overall, they make up a very {{small portion of the}} total sedimentary record.|$|R
5000|$|Energy: {{petroleum}} geology {{relies on the}} capacity of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> to generate deposits of petroleum oils. Coal and oil shale are found in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> A {{large proportion of the}} world's uranium energy resources are hosted within sedimentary successions.|$|R
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle {{onto the surface of}} the Earth and later lithify into <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E
5|$|Soils in the San Juan {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> and are highly erosive, resulting in large alluvial deposits along floodplains. Soil {{types in the}} San Juan watershed {{can be divided into}} the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations. Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{program is}} {{considering}} {{options for the}} siting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal, and for low & intermediate level wastes. Construction of a repository is not foreseen until well into this century. Research on <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> (especially Opalinus Clay) is carried out at the Swiss Mont Terri rock laboratory; the Grimsel Test Site, an older facility in crystalline rock is also still active.|$|E
25|$|Siliciclastic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> are dominantly {{composed}} of silicate minerals. The sediment {{that makes up}} these rocks was transported as bed load, suspended load, or by sediment gravity flows.

40|$|Scarce {{contacts}} between magnetic and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{have been investigated}} on the Mt. Kalnik. Magmatic rocks are in contact with shales, limestones, dolomites, and lithic greywackes. Some contacts are characterized by the tectonic nature. The primary contacts are either without contact metamprphic changes, or with them, whereas some contacts are characterized by close space relationship between magmatic and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> and also with contact phenomena in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The observed textural and chemical contact phenomena are the pronounced schistosity of sediments grading to the cleavage, contact extrusive breccias, limestone enclaves,wedge shaped denting, cracked sediments, the transformation of matrix, secondary minerals in veinlets and nests in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> recrystallization, dolomitization, skarn paragenesis, silification, hematitization and the occurrence of ferrocalcite. Mentioned phenomena point to the synsedimentary and/or postsedimentary repeated extrusions and shallow intrusions of basic lavas. The diversity of contact phenomena indicates variable rates of extrusion, quantity and temperatures of lavas as also different grade of consolidation of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the ash is evidenced by its distinctive mineralogy–the ash was deposited directly upon the water, so its angular quartz grains differ from the clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea. As the volcanic ash settled to the bottom, it was admixed with these terrigenous components, producing a distinctive lithology in the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E
30|$|Volcanic rocks, {{the product}} of a series of {{volcanic}} activities after cooling, solidification and consolidation, are significantly different from <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> in formation conditions, development environment and distribution pattern. Consequently, characteristics of hydrocarbon reservoirs in volcanic rocks are quite different from those in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Magnesian {{escarpment}} is {{the most}} westerly of three prominent escarpments that run north-south in Wisconsin.All three escarpments are formed by the edges of layers of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The easternmost and most prominent escarpment is the Niagara escarpment formed where younger and harder layers of dolomite overlay softer <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The Black River Escarpment is capped by another layer of relatively harder rocks, overlay older softer rocks. The rocks of the Magnesian layer overlay rocks of the Cambrian Period, the oldest <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> that contain fossils.|$|R

5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff {{range in age from}} Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and over top younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Staircase is {{an immense}} {{sequence}} of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park {{and into the}} Grand Canyon. Within this sequence, the oldest exposed formation in the Zion and Kolob canyons area is the youngest exposed formation in the Grand Canyonthe Kaibab limestone. Bryce Canyon to the northeast continues where the Zion and Kolob areas end by presenting Cenozoic-aged rocks. In fact, the youngest formation seen in the Zion and Kolob area is the oldest exposed formation in Bryce Canyonthe Dakota Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
