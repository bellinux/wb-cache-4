40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} typical feelings associated with <b>being</b> <b>undecided</b> in an academic major as well as the social and academic effects of <b>being</b> <b>undecided</b> on Ball State University freshmen who entered Fall 2003. The research focused on providing a detailed perspective on the impact <b>being</b> <b>undecided</b> had on students academically, socially, and professionally. As well as offering insight on how external and internal factors influenced freshmen who were undecided. A qualitative approach was used and nine matriculating freshmen from Ball State University were individually interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. The interviews were transcribed, analyzed and reviewed in order to identify recurring themes. The findings indicated that relationships existed between parental pressure and undecideness as well as between academic majors and academic success. The findings also revealed that undecided students were poor decision makers, identity development and academic major were related, and Ball State University resources were unhelpful or unnecessary. These findings indicated that undecided students were uncomfortable with <b>being</b> <b>undecided.</b> However, students' level of comfort varied which indicated that it was necessary to asses each student on case by case basis and treat them as an individual in order to meet their personal needs. In order to do this, it was imperative that advisors, faculty and staff recognized and understood what experiences undecided students had and the effect of <b>being</b> <b>undecided.</b> Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (M.

Nevertheless, vaccination coverage rates of HCWs in European countries have been low. AimTo investigate the relative and combined strength of sociocognitive variables, from past research, theory and a qualitative study, in explaining the motivation of HCWs to receive the influenza vaccine. MethodsAn anonymous, online questionnaire was distributed among HCWs in hospital settings in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands between February and April 2013. FindingsAttitude and past vaccination uptake explained {{a considerable amount of}} variance in the intention of HCWs to receive the influenza vaccine. Moreover, low perceived social norms, omission bias, low moral norms, being older, having no patient contact, and being Belgian or Dutch (compared with German) increased the probability of having no intention to receive the influenza vaccine compared with <b>being</b> <b>undecided</b> about vaccination. High intention to receive the influenza vaccine was shown to be more likely than <b>being</b> <b>undecided</b> about vaccination when HCWs had high perceived susceptibility of contracting influenza, low naturalistic views, and lower motivation to receive the vaccine solely for self-protection. ConclusionCountry-specific interventions and a focus on different sociocognitive variables depending on the intention/lack of intention of HCWs to receive the influenza vaccine may be beneficial to promote vaccination uptake...|$|R
