5|$|After the {{generally}} failed assaults on the bridges, the German divisions began crossing attempts over the rivers IJssel and Maas. The first waves typically were destroyed, due to insufficient preparatory {{fire on the}} pillboxes. At most places a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges; but at <b>some,</b> <b>as</b> Venlo, the attempt was aborted. At Arnhem, Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the assault and that day advanced to the Grebbe Line, followed by 207. Infanteriedivision.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E

However, Scar's violence, dark color palette and allegedly effeminate mannerisms were initially met with mild controversy, perceived by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> racist and homophobic.

5|$|Chronicles mention more castes {{than the}} four {{commonly}} known castes in the Hindu social system, <b>some</b> <b>as</b> many as seven castes. One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudras.

Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> a lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is seen by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} {{the kind of}} courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during {{the first months of}} the Black Hawk War.

5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. Pittsburgh and Centre–but Pittsburgh especially, were the biggest opponents.

The first game of the year to have direct implications for the Southern championship, it was cited by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> the most interesting southern contest of the week.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party.

John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E
