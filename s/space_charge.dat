25|$|While {{generating}} discharges, {{electrical energy}} from the secondary and toroid is transferred to the surrounding air as electrical charge, heat, light, and sound. The process is similar to charging or discharging a capacitor, except that a Tesla coil uses AC instead of DC. The current that arises from shifting charges within a capacitor is called a displacement current. Tesla coil discharges are formed {{as a result of}} displacement currents as pulses of electrical charge are rapidly transferred between the high-voltage toroid and nearby regions within the air (called <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> regions). Although the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> regions around the toroid are invisible, they play a profound role in the appearance and location of Tesla coil discharges.|$|E
25|$|In general, cloud-to-ground (CG) {{lightning}} flashes {{account for}} only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since {{the base of a}} thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called graupel) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> while the lower level accumulates a negative <b>space</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose Higher {{education}} (HE) in the UK {{has recently}} suffered financial pressure due to reduced central funding, and {{the requirement to}} widen student access. The estate is typically the second highest revenue expense and is an obvious target for efficiency gains. Sector-wide statistics show there are opportunities for improving efficiency and many influential bodies have advocated <b>space</b> <b>charging</b> {{as a way of}} achieving them. This paper aims to investigate space performance indicators for evidence that <b>space</b> <b>charging</b> improves <b>space</b> use efficiency. Design/methodology/approach The approach used is a statistical analysis of space performance indicators for <b>space</b> <b>charging</b> and other higher education institution (HEIs). Findings Approximately one-quarter of HEIs in the UK operated <b>space</b> <b>charging</b> in 2000 - 2001 but only ten out of 31 space-related performance indicators for the period 1998 - 2001 suggest that increased efficiency results. Scrutiny of the background data shows they predominantly reflect differences in institutional wealth and activities, rather than space use management. Efficiency measures relating space to use provide no evidence of efficiency gains, suggesting that the application of <b>charging</b> as a <b>space</b> management tool is ineffective. Research limitations/implications The methodology does not reveal the reasons for the disparity between theory and results of <b>space</b> <b>charging.</b> Qualitative research into the application of charging systems is required to provide an explanation. Practical implications The conclusions are important for HE managers who are considering implementing expensive systems to improve space efficiency. The results also shed light on the usefulness of space performance indicators for HE estates. Originality/value Although there have been many assertions that <b>space</b> <b>charging</b> will improve <b>space</b> use efficiency in the HE sector, this research provides evidence to the contrary...|$|R

25|$|Thomson {{constructed}} a Crookes tube {{with a better}} vacuum. At {{the start of the}} tube was the cathode from which the rays projected. The rays were sharpened to a beam by two metal slits – the first of these slits doubled as the anode, the second was connected to the earth. The beam then passed between two parallel aluminium plates, which produced an electric field between them when they were connected to a battery. The end of the tube was a large sphere where the beam would impact on the glass, created a glowing patch. Thomson pasted a scale to the surface of this sphere to measure the deflection of the beam. Note that any electron beam would collide with some residual gas atoms within the Crookes tube, thereby ionizing them and producing electrons and ions in the tube (space charge); in previous experiments this <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> electrically screened the externally applied electric field. However, in Thomson's Crookes tube the density of residual atoms was so low that the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> from the electrons and ions was insufficient to electrically screen the externally applied electric field, which permitted Thomson to successfully observe electrical deflection.|$|E

25|$|Ionic {{relaxation}} comprises {{ionic conductivity}} and interfacial and <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> relaxation. Ionic conductivity predominates at low frequencies and introduces only losses to the system. Interfacial relaxation occurs when charge carriers are trapped at interfaces of heterogeneous systems. A related effect is Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, where charge carriers blocked at inner dielectric boundary layers (on the mesoscopic scale) or external electrodes (on a macroscopic scale) {{lead to a}} separation of charges. The charges may be separated by a considerable distance and therefore make contributions to the dielectric loss that are orders of magnitude larger than the response due to molecular fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|Dry bone {{exhibits}} some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada et al. {{showed that}} these are not due to the apatite crystals, which are centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to collagen. Collagen exhibits the polar uniaxial orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and can be considered as bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside {{to the surface of the}} specimen. Piezoelectricity of single individual collagen fibrils was measured using piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.|$|E
25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{secondary}} coil's energy (and output voltage) continue to increase, larger pulses of displacement current further ionize and heat {{the air at}} the point of initial breakdown. This forms a very electrically conductive [...] "root" [...] of hotter plasma, called a leader, that projects outward from the toroid. The plasma within the leader is considerably hotter than a corona discharge, and is considerably more conductive. In fact, its properties are similar to an electric arc. The leader tapers and branches into thousands of thinner, cooler, hair-like discharges (called streamers). The streamers look like a bluish 'haze' at the ends of the more luminous leaders. The streamers transfer charge between the leaders and toroid to nearby <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> regions. The displacement currents from countless streamers all feed into the leader, helping to keep it hot and electrically conductive.|$|E

The distribution characteristic of <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> of the specimens under DC voltage of – 50 kV/mm and short-circuit conditions was measured using pulsed electro-acoustic method. The electrical tree aging characteristics of specimens under AC voltage of power frequency were studied using needle-plate electrode structure test platform. The starting voltage of initiation, the triggering rate, and the growth rate of the electrical trees, as well as the breakdown performance of the specimens under AC voltage of power frequency were measured. The inhibitory mechanism of MMT nano-particles on the growth of electrical trees in nano-composites, and the mechanism behind the improvement of the breakdown strength of the LDPE/MMT specimens were illustrated. Experimental results showed that, the addition of MMT can effectively reduce the amount of <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> injected from electrodes and the accumulation amount in the center of samples. Moreover, <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> dissipated more slowly during short-circuit conditions. The speed and the scale of the growth of the electrical tree declined as the initiation conditions of electrical trees growing in LDPE/MMT nanocomposites increased; meanwhile, the breakdown strength increased substantially.

50|$|<b>Space</b> <b>charge</b> is {{a concept}} in which excess {{electric}} charge is treated as a continuum of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when charge carriers have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules {{left behind in the}} solid can form a <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> region. <b>Space</b> <b>charge</b> usually only occurs in dielectric media (including vacuum) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or screened. The sign of the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a metal object when it is heated to incandescence in a vacuum.
