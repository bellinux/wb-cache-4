5|$|The 2004 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was notable in that no tropical cyclone {{of at least}} tropical storm intensity moved ashore, an unusual occurrence. The season officially began on May15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June1 in the central Pacific; it officially ended in both basins on November30. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when a majority of tropical cyclones form. Activity throughout the year fell <b>slightly</b> <b>below</b> the long-term average, with 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The season was reflected by an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 71 units.|$|E

The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven of these storms attained hurricane status, three of them becoming major hurricanes. There were fewer tropical storms than the average of 16, {{while the number of}} hurricanes and major hurricanes were <b>slightly</b> <b>below</b> average.

5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{holds the}} record for being the {{farthest}} northeast forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. The seventh named storm of the <b>slightly</b> <b>below</b> average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October4. It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) and developed an eye-like feature, although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center. The storm lost its tropical characteristics on October 6, though the remnants merged with a separate system near the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Low Fell has a {{population}} of 8,643. 51% of the population are female, <b>slightly</b> <b>below</b> the national average, whilst 49% are male. Only 1% of the population are from a Black or other Minority Ethnic Group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. Of the BME group in the settlement, 40% are from the Asian or AsianBritish ethnic group. Low Fell has a very low proportion of lone parent households at some 4% of all households in the settlement. This is the lowest figure in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead and compares very favourably with a Borough average of 11.5% and a national average of 9.5%. Some 26% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life indicators to indicate deprivation, does not include any part of Low Fell in any of the areas marked as deprived.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates <b>slightly</b> <b>below</b> that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
