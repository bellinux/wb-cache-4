60|$|It {{was indeed}} a {{pleasant}} road, where there were tall trees that often met overhead, and on each side there were bushes, and vines, and wild flowers, and little vistas opening into the woods, and rabbits running across the roadway; a shallow stream tumbling along its <b>stony</b> <b>bed,</b> sometimes {{to be seen and}} sometimes only heard; yellow butterflies in the air; and glimpses above, that afternoon, of blue sky and white clouds.|$|E
60|$|The road at {{the point}} now reached by the {{travellers}} begins to slope in a gentle gradient down {{to the level of}} the Chew, a couple of miles further on: it was midway down this slope that the only sign of living humanity could be perceived in that tiny light which glimmered persistently.

50|$|The Trichomycterinae are a {{subfamily}} of catfishes (order Siluriformes) of {{the family}} Trichomycteridae. It includes six genera, Bullockia, Hatcheria, Rhizosomichthys, and Eremophilus, all monotypic, Silvinichthys with two species, and Trichomycterus, with over 100 species. The former five genera are diagnosed by putatively apomorphic characters, whereas Trichomycterus {{is defined by the}} lack of those specializations and is likely not monophyletic. This subfamily has historically served as much of a wastebasket for trichomycterids that lack the specializations of the other subfamilies.Species of Trichomycterinae dwell in headwaters and small, cold clear water streams running over <b>stony</b> <b>beds.</b> Due to the patchy distribution of their habitats, trichomycterines generally have restricted geographic distributions, thus display a high level of endemism.|$|R

He {{had been trying to}} paint one of my pictures--nothing more than a big water-worn rock tufted with flowers and a snow-capped hill for background. Most naturally he failed, because there happened to be absolutely no perspective in the thing, and he was pulling the lines about to make some for home consumption. No man can put the contents of a gallon jar into a pint mug. The protests of all uncomfortably-crowded mugs since the world began have settled that long ago, and have given us the working theories, devised by imperfect instruments for imperfect instruments, which are called Rules of Art.|$|E

Yoletta led the way, leaping airily from stone to stone, while I, anxious to escape a wetting, followed her with caution; but when I was safe over, and thought our delightful walk was about to begin, she suddenly started off towards the hill at a swift pace, which quickly left me far behind. Finding that I could not overtake her, I shouted to her to wait for me; then she stood still until I was within three or four yards Of her, when off she fled like the wind once more. At length she reached the foot of the hill, and sat down there until I joined her.|$|E

When its own striking scenery is passed, and it trails on through a long line of suburb, lying on the flat sea-shore, to Genoa, then, the changing glimpses of that noble city and its harbour, awaken a new source of interest; freshened by every huge, unwieldy, half-inhabited old house in its outskirts: and coming to its climax when the city gate is reached, and all Genoa with its beautiful harbour, and neighbouring hills, bursts proudly on the view.|$|E

60|$|We were in {{the crest}} of the pass. Broad snow-patched slopes came down from the pure sky; the defile was full of stones, all bare stones, {{enormous}} ones as big as a house, and small ones, pebbles. Through these the road wound in silence, through this upper, transcendent desolation, wherein was only the sound of the stream. Sky and snow-patched slopes, then the <b>stony,</b> rocky <b>bed</b> of the defile, full of morning sunshine: this was all. We were crossing in silence from the northern world to the southern.|$|R
60|$|The {{water was}} doubtless the prime {{attraction}} {{in such a}} neighborhood. Mary Louise made straight for the river bank and found the shallow stream--here scarce fifty feet in width--rippling along over its <b>stony</b> <b>bed,</b> which was a full fifty feet wider than the volume of water then required. When the spring freshets were on perhaps the stream reached its banks, but in the summer months it was usually subdued as now. The banks were four feet or more above the rabble of stones below, {{and close to the}} bank, facing the river on her side, Mrs. Kenton had built a pretty pavilion with ample seats and room for half a dozen wicker chairs and a table, where one could sit and overlook the water. Mary Louise fervently blessed the old lady for this idea and at once seated herself in the pavilion while she examined at leisure the scene spread out before her.|$|E

Except in this <b>stony</b> <b>bed</b> of the stream, {{the scene}} {{possesses}} very little more aspect of mountain character than belongs {{to some of}} the park and meadow land under the chalk hills near Henley and Maidenhead; and if it were faithfully drawn in all points, and on its true scale, would hardly more affect the imagination of the spectator, unless he traced, with such care as is never from any spectator to be hoped, the evidence of nobler character in the pebbled shore and unconspicuous rock. But the scene in reality does affect the imagination strongly, and in a way wholly different from lowland hill scenery. A little farther up the valley the limestone summits rise, and that steeply, to a height of twelve hundred feet above the river, which foams between them in the narrow and dangerous channel of the Strid. Noble moorlands extend above, purple with heath, and broken into scars and glens, and around every soft tuft of wood, and gentle extent of meadow, throughout the dale, there floats a feeling of this mountain power, and an instinctive apprehension of the strength and greatness of the wild northern land.|$|E
60|$|The main {{entrance}} to the church was on the side next to the burial-ground, and the door was screened by a porch walled in on either side. After some little hesitation, caused by natural reluctance to conceal myself, indispensable as that concealment was to the object in view, I had resolved on entering the porch. A loophole window was pierced in each of its side walls. Through one of these windows I could see Mrs. Fairlie's grave. The other looked towards the stone quarry in which the sexton's cottage was built. Before me, fronting the porch entrance, was a patch of bare burial-ground, a line of low stone wall, and a strip of lonely brown hill, with the sunset clouds sailing heavily over it before the strong, steady wind. No living creature was visible or audible--no bird flew by me, no dog barked from the sexton's cottage. The pauses in the dull beating of the surf were filled up by the dreary rustling of the dwarf trees near the grave, and the cold faint bubble of the brook over its <b>stony</b> <b>bed.</b> A dreary scene and a dreary hour. My spirits sank fast as I counted out the minutes of the evening in my hiding-place under the church porch.|$|E

40|$|Picture {{yourself}} {{standing in}} the doorway of a vast, nineteenth-century museum, akin to one of the great Victorian natural history museums, a cathedral to the imperial sciences of collecting, classifying and describing. The ceiling of the cavernous main room is supported by a small forest of pillars and between these are hundreds of alcoves and side rooms, crowded with innumerable objects that trace the history of these sciences. Stuffed birds and animals, glassy eyed and moth-eaten. Preserved specimens, weirdly deformed by their thick glass jars. Endless sheets of pressed flowers, boxes of dried seeds and fruit, and table-sized sections through ancient trees. Mineral samples, rocks and fossils, gigantic dinosaurs sharing their <b>stony</b> <b>beds</b> with delicate, petrified ferns. Thousands of printed pages, from the cheap, steam-printed weeklies to the lush, hand-colored folios that celebrate great expeditions and exhibitions. And, of course, the portraits and marble busts of discoverers, explorers, namers, describers, cataloguers, and specu-lators – mostly grave, bearded, men. But {{it is hard to see}} the details of this astonishing collection, because the museum has only a single light, a dazzlingly bright, almost incandescent beacon that hangs in the very middle of the great hall. Your eyes are drawn to it immediately, but the intense, white light dazzles, and as you turn away to look at the collections, blinking hastily, the after-image of the central lantern floats before you, imprinting itself on everything you try to look at...|$|R

Turning northward from here, it passes through Tilsewischken, Balandßen, Ruddecken, Podßuhnen, Pucknen, Kindschen, Jonienen, Kurschen, Schuppinnen, Woydehnen, Moritzkehmen and Tilsit-Kallkappen. On the partially rather high banks groves and meadows stretch out. Picturesque landscapes are the castle hill between Kurschen and Schuppinnen and the gorge at Kurschen. The Grauden forest was an impenetrable wilderness. In the grove of Kindschen the Tilse takes in the Liepart stream and at Kurschen the Malan stream.|$|R
60|$|From {{the church}} of San Nicolas, {{on the other side}} of the valley, the Alhambra, like all Moorish {{buildings}} externally very plain, with its red walls and low, tiled roofs, looks like some old charter-house. Encircled by the fresh green of the spring-time, it lies along the summit of the hill with an infinite, most simple grace, dun and brown and deep red; and from the sultry wall on which I sat the elm-trees and the poplars seemed very cool. Thirstily, after the long drought, the Darro, the Arab stream which ran scarlet with the blood of Moorish strife, wound its way over its <b>stony</b> <b>bed</b> among the hills; and beyond, in strange contrast with all the fertility, was the grey and silent grandeur of the Sierra Nevada. Few places can be more charming than the green wood in which stands the stronghold of the Moorish kings; the wind sighs among the topmost branches and all about is the sweet sound of running water; in spring the ground is carpeted with violets, and the heavy foliage gives an enchanting coldness. A massive gateway, flanked by watch-towers, forms the approach; but the actual entrance, offering no hint of the incredible magnificence within, is an insignificant door.|$|E
60|$|They {{could not}} have done so at their ease had the river not been humanized. Only a little bit of its <b>stony</b> <b>bed</b> is left; a mill weir, thrown across, stays the water in a {{perfectly}} clear and delicious pool; to show how clear it is, Turner has put the only piece of playing color in all the picture into the reflections in this. One cow is white, another white and red, evidently as clean as morning dew can wash their sides. They {{could not have}} been so in a country where there was the least coal smoke; so Turner has put a wreath of perfectly white smoke through the trees; and lest that should not be enough to show you they burnt wood, he has made his foreground of a piece of copse just lopped, with the new fagots standing up against it; and this still not being enough to give you the idea of perfect cleanliness, he has covered the stones of the river-bed with white clothes laid out to dry; and that not being enough yet, for the river-bed might be clean though nothing else was, he has put a quantity more hanging over the abbey walls.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{listened to}} his words, there came back, fresh upon me, that {{touching}} scene in the great man's life, when he lay upon his couch, surrounded by his family, and listened, for the last time, to the rippling of the river he had so well loved, over its <b>stony</b> <b>bed.</b> I pictured him to myself, faint, wan, dying, crushed both in mind and body by his honourable struggle, and hovering round him the phantoms of his own imagination--Waverley, Ravenswood, Jeanie Deans, Rob Roy, Caleb Balderstone, Dominie Sampson--all the familiar throng--with cavaliers, and Puritans, and Highland chiefs innumerable overflowing the chamber, and fading away in the dim distance beyond. I pictured them, fresh from traversing the world, and hanging down their heads in shame and sorrow, that, from all those lands into which they had carried gladness, instruction, and delight for millions, they brought him not one friendly hand to help to raise him from that sad, sad bed. No, nor brought him from that land in which his own language was spoken, and in every house and hut of which his own books were read in his own tongue, one grateful dollar-piece to buy a garland for his grave. Oh! if every man who goes from here, as many do, to look upon that tomb in Dryburgh Abbey, would but remember this, and bring the recollection home! ...|$|E
50|$|Its {{fuselage}} was rectangular {{in cross}} section, plywood covered and tapered strongly to the tail. The high aspect ratio tailplane and elevators were mounted {{at the extreme}} tail at mid-fuselage and were almost rectangular in plan, as was the narrow, tall rudder, mounted slightly further forward. The pilot had an open cockpit immediately forward of the leading edge. There was a small skid on the forward fuselage underside for landings assisted by a generous wire rear skid. The Tenax made its first flights in 1926, piloted by Umberto Nannini. On some occasions at least, the Tenax was winch launched. Its performance was sufficiently encouraging for an attempt on the Italian distance record, which then stood at 11.5 km, held from December 1926 by Ettore Cattaneo in the Abate GP.1, but Nannini {{had to make a}} rather rough landing on an old, <b>stony</b> river <b>bed</b> after 9 km.|$|R

A wild longing seized him; he would escape up thither; up into those clouds, up anywhere to be alone--alone with his miserable self. That was dreadful enough: but less dreadful than having a companion,--ay, even a stone by him--which could remind him of the scene which he had left; even remind him {{that there was another}} human being on earth beside himself. Yes,--to put that cliff between him and all the world! Away he plunged from the high road, splashing over boggy uplands, scrambling among scattered boulders, across a <b>stony</b> torrent <b>bed,</b> and then across another and another:--when would he reach that dark marbled wall, which rose into the infinite blank,--looking within a stone-throw of him, and yet no nearer after he had walked a mile? ...|$|R
60|$|As a {{consequence}} when I visited it I {{found it very}} little injured--compared, that is, with such other towns as have been fought through. Here and there {{the front of a}} house has been knocked in by an Austrian shell, or a lamp-post prostrated. But the road bridge had suffered a good deal; its iron parapet was twisted about by shell bursts and interwoven with young trees and big boughs designed to screen the passer-by from the observation of the Austrian gunners upon Monte Santo. Here and there were huge holes through which one could look down upon the blue trickles of water in the <b>stony</b> river <b>bed</b> far below. The driver of our automobile displayed what seemed to me an extreme confidence in the margins of these gaps, but his confidence was justified. At Sagrado the bridge had been much more completely demolished; no effort had been made to restore the horizontal roadway, but one crossed by a sort of timber switchback that followed {{the ups and downs of}} the ruins.|$|R
6000|$|I here {{recall a}} lady who {{sat next to me}} on the coach that took me from Minehead to Lynton. The lady resided at Lynton, and finding that I was visiting the place for the first time, she {{proceeded}} to describe its attractions with fluent enthusiasm. When we arrived at the town, and were moving very slowly into it, my companion turned and examined my face, waiting to hear the expressions of rapturous admiration that would fall from my lips. Said I, [...] "There is one thing you can boast of in Lynton. So far as I know, it is the only town in the country where, sitting in your own room with the windows open, you can listen to the song of the wood wren." [...] Her face fell. She had never heard of the wood wren, and when I pointed to the tree from which the sound came and she listened and heard, she turned away, evidently too disgusted to say anything. She had been wasting her eloquence on an unworthy subject--one who was without appreciation for the sublime and beautiful in nature. The wild romantic Lynn, tumbling with noise and foam over its rough <b>stony</b> <b>bed,</b> the vast wooded hills, the piled-up black rocks (covered in places with beautiful red and blue lettered advertisements), had been passed by in silence--nothing had stirred me but the chirping of a miserable little bird, which, for all that she knew or cared, might be a sparrow! When we got down from the coach a couple of minutes later, she walked away without even saying good-bye.|$|E

60|$|High {{up among}} the heather-clad hills which form the broad {{dividing}} barrier between England and Scotland, the little river Esk brawls and bickers over its <b>stony</b> <b>bed</b> through a wild land of barren braesides and brown peat mosses, forming altogether {{some of the}} gloomiest and most forbidding scenery in the whole expanse of northern Britain. Almost the entire bulk of the counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Ayr is composed of just such solemn desolate upland wolds, {{with only a few}} stray farms or solitary cottages sprinkled at wide distances over their bare bleak surface, and with scarcely any sign of life in any part save the little villages which cluster here and there at long intervals around some stern and simple Scottish church. Yet the hardy people who inhabit this wild and chilly moorland country may well be considered to rank among the best raw material of society in the whole of Britain; for from the peasant homes of these southern Scotch Highlands have come forth, among a host of scarcely less distinguished natives, three men, at least, who deserve to take their place in the very front line of British thinkers or workers--Thomas Telford, Robert Burns, and Thomas Carlyle. By origin, all three alike belonged in the very strictest sense to the working classes; and the story of each is full of lessons or of warnings for every one of us: but that of Telford is perhaps the most encouraging and the most remarkable of all, as showing how much may be accomplished by energy and perseverance, even under the most absolutely adverse and difficult circumstances.|$|E

She quite gasped for breath at the very sight, and was told in return {{to wait and see what}} she would yet say to the Adlerstreppe, or Eagle's Ladder. Poor child! she had no raptures for romantic scenery; she knew that jagged peaks made very pretty backgrounds in illuminations, but she had much rather have been in the smooth meadows of the environs of Ulm. The Danube looked much more agreeable to her, silver-winding between its green banks, than did the same waters leaping down with noisy voices in their <b>stony,</b> worn <b>beds</b> to feed the river that she only knew in his grave breadth and majesty. Yet, alarmed as she was, there was something in the exhilaration and elasticity of the mountain air that gave her an entirely new sensation of enjoyment and life, and seemed to brace her limbs and spirits for whatever might be before her; and, willing to show herself ready to be gratified, she observed on the freshness and sweetness of the air.|$|R

60|$|Reaching {{the little}} ravine, {{at the bottom}} of which flowed the branch, now but two or three feet wide, he ran down the rather steep slope and stepped upon the stout plank which bridged the stream. The instant he did so, the plank turned beneath him {{as if it had been}} hung on pivots, and he fell into the <b>stony</b> <b>bed</b> of the branch. It was an awkward fall, for the leg which was undermost came down at an angle, and his foot, {{striking}} a slippery stone, turned under him. In a moment he was on his feet, and scrambled up the side of the ravine, down which he had just come. When he reached the top he sat down and put both his hands on his right ankle, in which he felt considerable pain. In a few minutes he arose, and began to walk toward the house, but he had not taken a dozen steps before he sat down again. The pain in his ankle was very severe, and he felt quite sure that he had sprained it. He knew enough about such things to understand that if he walked upon this injured joint, he would not only make the pain worse, but the consequences might be serious. He was very much annoyed, not only that this thing had happened to him, but that it had happened at such an inauspicious moment. Of course, he could not now go on to the woods, and he must get somebody to help him to the house. Looking about, he saw, at a distance, Uncle Isham, and he called loudly to him. As soon as Lawrence was well away from the edge of the ravine, there emerged from some thick bushes on the other side of it, and at a short distance from the crossing-place, a negro girl, who slipped noiselessly down to the branch; moved with quick steps and crouching body to the plank; removed the two round stones on which it had been skilfully poised, and replaced it in its usual firm position. This done, she slipped back into the bushes, and by the time Isham had heard the call of Mr Croft, she was slowly walking down the opposite hill, as if she were coming from the woods to see why the gentleman was shouting.|$|E
