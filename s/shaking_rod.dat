40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{experimentally}} study how the vibrational acceleration spreads along the branch shaken by PVC tine, steel tine, and nylon tine for citrus canopy shaking harvesting and to compare the difference. PVC tine and steel tine have potential to be used as <b>shaking</b> <b>rod</b> for citrus canopy shaking harvesting. Nylon tine is a commonly used <b>shaking</b> <b>rod.</b> A tractor-mounted canopy shaker was developed to do the trial. The shaking frequency was set at 2. 5 and 5 [*]Hz. Experimental results showed that the vibrational acceleration at the shaking spot is not the highest. Spreading from shaking spot to the stem, it increases evidently. When spreading from stems of the outside subbranch to stems of the nearest inside subbranch, its average decrease percentage is 42 %. The overall vibrational acceleration of shaking at 5 [*]Hz is 1. 85 times as high as shaking at 2. 5 [*]Hz. The overall vibrational acceleration exerted by straight PVC tine and steel tine is 1. 77 and 1. 97 times as high as that exerted by straight nylon tine, respectively. It is indicated that replacing nylon tine with steel tine or PVC tine helps remove the fruits inside the canopy. Replacing with steel tine is more effective than with PVC tine...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{experiments}} where we shear granular rods in split-bottom geometries, {{and find that}} a significant heap of height of least 40 % of the filling height can form at the particle surface. We show that heaping {{is caused by a}} significant secondary flow, absent for spherical particles. Flow reversal transiently reverses the secondary flow, leading to a quick collapse and slower regeneration of the heap. We present a symmetry argument and experimental data that show that the generation of the secondary flow is driven by a misalignment of the mean particle orientation with the streamlines of the flow. For spherical granular media, the main coupling between micro structure and macroscopic mechanics, such as the re-sistance to flow, is through the local packing density 1. For anisometric, rod-shaped granular particles, the local ordering plays an additional prominent role, and recent works have revealed a wealth of new phenomena to arise 2. For exam-ple, dense, <b>shaken</b> <b>rod</b> packings exhibit nematic ordening and wall-alignment 3 – 7. At lower densities, the intricate coupling between local ordering, density and propulsion can lead to large fluctuations in the local density of active rod-like par...|$|R

Up went the cat's back, bristle went her tail, her eyes shot sparks, and she bounded to the top of her mistress's chair. Dandy barked defiance, all the {{children}} shouted or screamed and danced about, and the old woman gasped and shook more. Lizzie alone was almost equal to the occasion. She flew at the cat who was standing on tiptoe on the tall back of the chair, with huge tail and eyes like green lamps, swearing, hissing, and spitting, and, regardless of scratches, caught him up by the scruff of his neck and disposed of him behind the staircase door; while Dora at the same moment secured Dandy by the collar, and rushing out, put him over the garden gate and shut both that and the door. Mary, afraid that the old lady {{was going to have a}} fit, went up to her with soothing apologies, but the unwonted sight seemed to confuse her the more, and she began crying. Lizzie, however, came to the rescue. She evidently had all her wits about her. First she called out: [...] "Order, children. Don't you see the ladies? Sit down, Jem Hewlett, or I'll after you with the stick!" [...] Then, as the children ranged themselves, she stamped at some to enforce her orders, <b>shook</b> the <b>rod</b> at others, and set up the smallest like so many ninepins, handling them by the shoulder on one small bench, interspersing the work with consolations to granny and explanations to the ladies, who were about to defer their visit.|$|R
60|$|The {{author of}} the ensuing discourse--now with God, reaping the fruit of all his labour, diligence, and success, in his Master's service--did {{experience}} in himself, through the grace of God, the nature, excellency, and comfort of a truly broken and contrite spirit. So that what is here written is but a transcript {{out of his own}} heart: for God--who had much work for him to do--was still hewing and hammering him by his Word, and sometimes also by more than ordinary temptations and desertions. The design, and also the issue thereof, through God's goodness, was the humbling and keeping of him low in his own eyes. The truth is, as himself sometimes acknowledged, he always needed the thorn in the flesh, and God in mercy sent it him, lest, under his extraordinary circumstances, he should be exalted about measure; which perhaps was the evil that did more easily beset him than any other. But the Lord was pleased to overrule it, to work for his good, and to keep him in that broken frame which is so acceptable unto him, and concerning which it is said, that 'He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds' (Psa 147:3). And, indeed, it is a most necessary qualification that should always be found in the disciples of Christ, who are most eminent, and as stars of the first magnitude in the firmament of the church. Disciples, in the highest form of profession, need to be thus qualified in the exercise of every grace, and the performance of every duty. It is that which God doth principally and more especially look after, in all our approaches and accesses to him. It is to him that God will look, and with him God will dwell, who is poor, and of a contrite spirit (Isa 57:15, 66:2). And the reason why God will manifest so much respect to one so qualified, is because he carries it so becomingly towards him. He comes and lies at his feet, and discovers a quickness of sense, and apprehensiveness of whatever may be dishonourable and distasteful to God (Psa 38:4). And if the Lord doth at any time but <b>shake</b> his <b>rod</b> over him, he comes trembling, and kisses the rod, and says, 'It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good' (1 Sam 3:18). He is sensible he hath sinned and gone astray like a lost sheep, and, therefore, will justify God in his severest proceedings against him. This broken heart is also a pliable and flexible heart, and prepared to receive whatsoever impressions God shall make upon it, and is ready to be moulded into any frame that shall best please the Lord. He says, with Samuel, 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth' (1 Sam 3:10). And with David, 'When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek' (Psa 27:8). And so with Paul, who tremblingly said, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?' (Acts 9:6).|$|R
5000|$|Preponderance {{of power}} has been {{suggested}} {{as an alternative to}} balance of power since World War II. In his 1940 article, [...] "War, Peace and the Balance of Power", Frederick L. Schuman included a chapter titled [...] "Necessity for Preponderance of Power". It argued: An overwhelming preponderance of power ... will remain wholly unattainable unless the Allies win the present war and the United States assumes responsibilities commensurate with its power—in the war, in the peace after the war and in the maintenance and improvement of the new order after the peace. The necessary preponderance of power is unlikely to emerge from any international combination other than a permanent alliance of the United States, the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the French Republic, with the addition of such Latin American states and such European democracies as may care to join. Such a coalition, if stable and permanent, could {{put an end to the}} world balance of power and oblige outside powers to abandon the game of power politics. No other coalition presently in prospect would seem to offer any comparable hope. In 1941, Alfred Vagts wrote an article, titled [...] "The United States and the Balance of Power," [...] in which he recalled the words of Thomas Jefferson: I wish that all nations may recover and retain their independence; that those which are overgrown may not advance beyond safe measure of power, that a salutary balance may ever be maintained among nations and that our peace, commerce, and friendship, may be sought and cultivated by all.... Not in our day, but at no distant one, we may <b>shake</b> a <b>rod</b> over the heads of all, which may make the stoutest of them tremble. Writing in 1942 in Life magazine, Joseph Thorndike tells about [...] "many observers" [...] seeking [...] "preponderant power in the postwar world" [...] to replace balance of power: Balance of power is indeed the time-honored (or dishonored) policy of the European states. But it is not the only policy which has been historically successful. Rome was not a balance of power. It was a preponderant power. There are many observers who think the US and the British Empire, acting together, can hold preponderant power in the postwar world. At the time of the peace conference this may well be the case. [...] However, Thorndike added in the same 1942 article, many may wonder whether, over the years, Russia and China [...] "will not rival Anglo-America". The following year, the founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, also invoked the example of the two-centuries long “Pax Romana” which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power and inter-regional organization: At the end of the war the crushing superiority of American plane production will be an established fact… The solution of the problem … is by no means ideal, nor even satisfactory. But it is the minor evil, compared with the alternative of several competing air forces fighting each other… wars aimed not at the conquest but at the utter annihilation of all enemy towns and lands… This danger can … only be prevented by the air superiority of a single power … This is the only realistic hope for a lasting peace … The peaceful organization of the postwar world would rest on a double basis: on the working Commonwealth of the World, established on regional grounds, and on the American supremacy in the skies, making international wars almost impossible… This double-method … can lead to a long period of peace and prosperity throughout the globe… The same year, Nathaniel Peffer criticized the idea of preponderance of power: [...] Whatever may be the tendencies and inclinations, it must be emphasized that if America seeks to dictate to other powers their actions and policies, it can do so only by maintaining a preponderance of power manifested in extension of political and economic control … But in the light of all recent history he who would consciously, deliberately elect that course is either unread, incapable of deductions from his reading or perverse. [...] In self-contradiction, Peffer ended the article recommending for the postwar period a preponderance of power of offensive kind backed by total national effort: The United Stataes will need “a larger permanent military establishment,” alliances with other powers having common interests and an alliance with Great Britain that would be not only defensive but also “outright, unconditional offensive.” It means full-scale power politics and to it “must be accommodated and sometimes subordinated everything else in the nation’s life." ...|$|R
