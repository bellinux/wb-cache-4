25|$|IRV has {{the effect}} of {{avoiding}} <b>split</b> <b>votes</b> when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters. As a simple example, suppose there are two candidates with similar views, A and B, and a third with different views, C, with first-preference totals of 35% for candidate A, 25% for B and 40% for C. In a plurality voting election, candidate C may win with 40% of the votes, even though 60% of electors prefer both A and B over C. Alternatively, voters are pressured to choose the seemingly stronger candidate of either A or B, despite personal preference for the other, in order to help ensure the defeat of C. With IRV, the electors backing B as their first choice can rank A second, which means candidate A will win by 60% to 40% over C despite the split vote in first choices.|$|E

2500|$|Issa came to {{national}} prominence in 2003 when he contributed more than $1.6 {{million to help}} fund a signature-gathering drive for the petition to recall California Governor Gray Davis.

Issa later said his mission had been accomplished with Davis' recall and that he wanted to continue to represent his district in Congress and work towards Middle East peace. At one point in the campaign he suggested people [...] should vote against recalling Davis unless one of the two leading Republican contenders dropped out, concerned that Schwarzenegger and fellow Republican Tom McClintock would <b>split</b> <b>votes,</b> resulting in Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante being elected to succeed Davis. Issa endorsed Schwarzenegger in the election.|$|E

40|$|In Mixed Member Proportional systems, {{voters are}} able to <b>split</b> their <b>vote.</b> To what extent do voters use this {{opportunity}}, which voters seem to use this opportunity most {{and what are the}} potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting?</b> These questions are answered by comparatively analyzing motives for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> and factors that facilitate such behavior and apply them to the Dutch situation. Moreover, we employ various simulations based on the last three parliamentary elections in order to assess the potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> under different electoral system proposals. In general, these results indicate that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> will not have substantial effects on the distribution of seats in parliament. " (author's abstract...|$|R

50|$|Raft uses {{randomized}} election timeout {{to ensure}} that <b>split</b> <b>votes</b> problem are resolved quickly.

40|$|High {{levels of}} <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> in {{elections}} usually indicate either an instrumental electorate, or widespread disaffection {{from the major}} parties. Elections to the Russian lower house, the Duma, permit voters both party list options and single-member ballots; as a result, the 1993 and 1995 Duma elections recorded {{some of the highest}} levels of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> ever recorded. Using national survey data collected just after the 1995 Duma election, we test two major explanations for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting,</b> one based on the activities of voters, the other on the strategic behaviour of parties. The results show that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is caused by voters, and more specifically, by their weak attachments to parties. But party strategy also plays a modest role in promoting the phenomenon. In the absence of major reform of the Russian electoral system, <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is likely to remain at high levels...|$|R

50|$|During the Isaac Affair of 1974-1977, {{disagreement}} {{over the future}} of the Reform led to several <b>split</b> <b>votes,</b> which led to schisms, new Councils, {{and the end of the}} practical use of the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, due to the rising number of priests, the difficult logistics of voting, and the tradition of consensus.

50|$|Delegates attend from a {{majority}} of the fifty nations where the church is organized. The largest numbers of delegates are from the United States, Canada and French Polynesia. Translators for more than a dozen languages sit overhead the main conference floor and present real time translations of the conference to any of the delegates on the floor who prefer to participate in a language other than English. Numbered lecterns in the conference chamber are available to those who wish to speak. They gain the floor to make motions or speak by submitting a card to a computer attendant at the lectern who enters the request into a queue. In this fashion, the presiding officer is able to call upon speakers with alternating pro and con viewpoints, as well as give preference to priority motions. According to church bylaws Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised is the parliamentary authority for the conference except where they may be in conflict with the bylaws, adopted rules of order for the conference, and past resolutions.
