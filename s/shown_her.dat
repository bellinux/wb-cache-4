5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> {{father in a}} shop window a few days earlier. Although it was an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front, Frank decided she would {{use it as a}} diary, and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E

25|$|Robin is Eva Kane's son, Evelyn, {{which in}} England {{can be a}} man's name {{as well as a}} woman's. Mrs Upward had not known who was the mother of her adopted son, but he {{realised}} that any scandal would be to his detriment. Mrs McGinty saw the photo of Eva Kane while working at the Upward house and assumed the photo was of Mrs Upward as a young woman. Robin killed her to prevent her from telling anyone who might recognise the photo, and framed Bentley by stealing the £30, correctly assuming Bentley would incriminate himself by panicking. Mrs Upward thought Kane's photograph to be similar to a photo Robin had <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> of his mother, whose back story he made up. She wanted to confront Robin by herself, so she pointed to the wrong photo (that of Lily Gamboll) to put Poirot off the scent.|$|E
25|$|Cavaradossi tells Angelotti of {{a chamber}} {{in an ancient}} Roman well on the {{property}} where he can hide until he makes his escape. It had been used by one of Cavaradossi's ancestors when he fled Rome after stabbing a Medici. Tosca arrives to confront her lover about the fan Scarpia had <b>shown</b> <b>her.</b> Cavaradossi and Angelotti explain everything and she realizes with horror {{that she has been}} duped into leading Scarpia to them. On hearing the arrival of Scarpia and his men, Angelotti seeks refuge in the well. Scarpia demands to know where Angelotti is hidden. When Tosca and Cavardossi refuse to tell, Cavaradossi is taken off to be interrogated by the Procureur and tortured by Scarpia's assistant if he refuses to answer. Scarpia describes the torture device in great detail to Tosca, who is then made to listen to her lover's screams. Unable to bear it any longer, she reveals the hiding place, much to Cavaradossi's fury. Rather than be captured, Angelotti takes poison concealed in his ring. Scarpia orders his men to take Cavaradossi to the Castel Sant'Angelo for execution and orders Tosca to be brought there as well.|$|E

[...] Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy from Noisey Vice noted and complimented Utada's abilities in adapting to different roles through her music videos, specifically highlighting the [...] "mundane" [...] activity of washing dishes. A reviewer from OngakuDB.com noted a contrast between the song and the video, stating that the video had <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> [...] "lonely" [...] and the song more [...] "gracious".|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} on 4 October 2008 that Sam would depart from Holby City in [...] "a blaze of glory {{in a big}} Christmas storyline". A show insider revealed that [...] "Tom’s departure will leave his fans in tears, but Holby bosses are keeping tight-lipped {{about whether or not}} Sam will be killed off." [...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried about telling the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly nice about it. Sam Strachan has gone through so much in the past year with his cancer – it seemed like the perfect time to make the break." [...] Several episodes before the character's departure, his estranged son Kieron played by Misha Crosby, was introduced to Holby City. Father and son both developed romantic feelings for nurse Maria Kendall, leading to Sam asking her to accompany them both to New York, where Kieron was a famous violinist.

500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{her fifth}} year on the court, Sotomayor had become {{especially}} visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity. Sotomayor has <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan. In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that [...] "the way to stop {{discrimination on the basis of}} race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race," [...] by stating, [...] "I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis." [...] In the manufacturer liability case of Williamson v. Mazda, which the court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion. Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached. When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, [...] "Neither of them is a shrinking violet". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: [...] "Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench." ...|$|E

500|$|Rang De Basanti {{received}} its world premiere on 26 January 2006, with high expectations {{that it would}} be a success with western audiences, though it also faced ire from several organizations because of certain controversial scenes. The film contained scenes of a MiG-21, a controversial aircraft in the Indian Air Force, which has a long history of fatal accidents in India. Promptly, the Indian Defence Ministry raised concerns, causing the Indian censor board to urge the filmmakers to seek clearance from the ministry. Accordingly, Khan and Mehra screened the film for the then Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee along with other top officials from the armed forces. One Air Force official reportedly said that it was [...] "not a review, but a preview". After the special screening, the defence ministry did not insist on any cuts, but on their recommendation more names were added to the slide that dedicates the film to deceased MiG pilots. After this clearance, the Animal Welfare Board raised objections on the use of animals in the film. Although the filmmakers had obtained a No Objection Certificate from the board officials, Maneka Gandhi, a well-known animal rights activist and member of the welfare board, found flaws in this certificate. Subsequently, this certificate was revoked and with only a few days left for the world premiere, Mehra personally requested Gandhi to reconsider her objection. After another viewing, the board cleared their objection stating that the use of animals in the film was natural and justified. However, after they recommended the deletion of a 20-second scene that depicted a banned horse race conducted by the Nihang Sikhs, the filmmakers deleted this scene. Mrs. Kavita Gadgil whose son, late Flight Lieutenant Abhijeet Gadgil was killed when his MiG-21 fighter crashed, objected to the film's release because she believed that the film was loosely based on her son's life and the producers should have <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> the film. In response, Kamlesh Pandey, one of the writers of the film, said that the film was not inspired by Abhijeet Gadgil.|$|E

2500|$|The {{works of}} Sien, a 32-year-old prostitute and seamstress, often depict her in {{traditional}} domestic feminine roles: a mother, seamstress, and domestic worker. [...] In the drawing Sorrow (F929, F929a) and a subsequent lithograph (F1655), Sien represents a woman's sorrow and frailty. [...] Some {{of the works}} are iconic, such as Woman Seated (F935, JH143) and Mother with Child. When van Gogh made drawings of Sien sewing, the compositions were simple as was her work. [...] If {{she had been in}} a higher station in life, a painting of her sewing would no doubt have <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> performing embroidery.
