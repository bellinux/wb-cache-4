40|$|Novelty and {{diversity}} are functions of three things: a system’s performance at ad-hoc retrieval, {{its ability to}} order documents diversely, and the collection over which the system is run. Ideally, our diversity evaluation framework (test collections and evaluation measures) would <b>sort</b> <b>systems</b> by their skill at ordering documents. Unfortunately, the current framework as exemplified by TREC is actually dominated by ad-hoc performance and insensitive to document ordering. In this paper, we define a measure of diversity difficulty for a query and subtopics irrespective of any ranked list, and suggest cases for future failure analysis of diversity evaluation frameworks. We conclude with a suggested retrieval task that will <b>sort</b> <b>systems</b> by their ability at ordering documents given a query’s diversity difficulty while controlling {{for their ability to}} perform ad-hoc retrieval...|$|R

One promising direction for the latter approach is to use type or <b>sort</b> <b>systems</b> and type inference with rather complex ty [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{points at}} the retract problem that arises, when using subsorting 1 in a not {{necessarily}} executable algebraic specification language.

We give a simple example which demonstrates this approach in the specification language Spectrum. 1 Subsorting in a Specification Language Statically sorted languages help to increase the perceivability of programs. Many errors can be detected and corrected at compile time. Sometimes, however, the <b>sort</b> <b>system</b> is too rigid and therefore restricts the expressiveness of the language. One concept to weaken the strength of the <b>sort</b> <b>system</b> is to allow subsort relations between sorts.
