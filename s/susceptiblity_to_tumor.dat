In this work, {{two kinds of}} N-containing heterocyclic borate esters were synthesized. Their hydrolytic stability and tribological properties as lubricant additives in rapeseed oil were evaluated. The results showed that these borate esters not only possessed promising tribological properties, but also had high hydrolytic stability. Thermal films and tribofilms were investigated by using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Surface analysis indicated that thermal films were mainly composed of adsorbed films and thermo-chemical reaction products. Tribofilms were mainly constituted by BN, B 2 O 3 and organic...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{resistance}} of C 3 H mice to infection with a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 1 grown in Princeton (PRI) mice (1) apparently resides {{to a large}} extent in the macrophage system, since macrophage cultures from the resistant mice are resistant in vitro while cultures from susceptible mice grown under identical conditions are susceptible (2, 3). This can be tested by culturing macrophages from a group of mice and then backcrossing the mice whose macrophages are susceptible, to the inbred strain of C 3 H mice. Using this method, it has been possible to introduce the gene for susceptibility into previously resistant mice 3 Now, after some 20 backcrosses, a line of susceptible C 3 H mice is available which differs from the resistant C~H mice presumably by only one gene, the gene for <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> mouse hepatitis virus. The gene for susceptibility has remained completely manifest and dominant despite other factors in the genetic background of the C 3 H mice.

Deciphering the mechanisms involved in the immune response <b>to</b> <b>tumors</b> is essential <b>to</b> our understanding of immune recognition and cancer progression. Here we report an innate immune response <b>to</b> <b>tumors</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that circulating blood cells, termed hemocytes, adhere <b>to</b> <b>tumors</b> upon detection of basement membrane disruption, and subsequently counter their growth. Basement membrane components are remarkably conserved throughout the animal kingdom, providing a unique structure for the immune system to sense tissue integrity. Further, we show that tissue damage activates JNK signaling in both tumors and aseptic wounds, causing expression of JAK/STAT-activating cytokines. Cytokine secretion from the injured tissue is amplified into a systemic response through the induction of additional cytokine expression in the hemocytes and the fat body, resulting in hemocyte proliferation. Our findings reveal common mechanisms in the response <b>to</b> <b>tumors</b> and wounds in flies. A similar innate reaction may underlie the response <b>to</b> <b>tumors</b> and tissue damage in vertebrates and humans...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is an increasing}} problem in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) treatment. Presently, third-generation parenteral cephalosporins, like ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, are the first option. Resistance to oral, but not to parenteral, third-generation cephalosporins has been reported previously. We analysed the microbial susceptibility (as minimum inhibitory concentration - MIC) of NG cultures obtained from high-risk visitors of the largest Dutch outpatient clinic for sexually transmitted infections (STI) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Among 1, 596 visitors, we identified 102 patients {{with at least one}} NG isolate with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (0. 125 mu g/ml < MIC <= 0. 5 mu g/ml). The percentage of NG isolates with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime rose from 4. 8 % in 2006 to 12. 1 % in 2008 (chi(2) 17. 5, p< 0. 001). With multivariate logistic regression, being a man who has sex with men (MSM) was significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (p< 0. 001). Compared to susceptible NG isolates, those with decreased <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> cefotaxime were more often resistant also to penicillin (16. 5 % vs. 43. 3 %), tetracycline (21. 5 % vs. 68. 9 %) and ciprofloxacin (44. 4 % vs. 90. 0 %, all p< 0. 001). The increased prevalence of NG strains with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime among MSM may herald resistance to third-generation parenteral cephalosporins. A considerable proportion of these strains show resistance to multiple antibiotics which could limit future NG treatment options...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of therapeutic vaccination {{for the treatment}} of cancer is limited by peripheral tolerance <b>to</b> <b>tumor</b> antigens. In vivo blockade of CTLA- 4, a negative regulator of T cell function, can induce the regression of established tumors and can augment the tumor rejection achieved through therapeutic vaccination. These outcomes may reflect enhanced tumor-specific T cell priming and/or interference with the development of tolerance <b>to</b> <b>tumor</b> antigens. We examined the effect of CTLA- 4 blockade on the fate and function of T cells specific for a model tumor antigen in the tumor-bearing host. We found that while CTLA- 4 blockade enhanced the priming of responsive T cells, it did not prevent the induction of tolerance <b>to</b> <b>tumor</b> antigens. These results demonstrate that there is a critical window in which the combination of CTLA- 4 blockade and vaccination achieves an optimal response, and they point to mechanisms other than CTLA- 4 engagement in mediating peripheral T cell tolerance <b>to</b> <b>tumor</b> antigens...|$|R
