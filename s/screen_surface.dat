25|$|One common {{application}} of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma display, or {{organic light emitting diode}} (OLED) display such as a television, a computer’s monitor, or a large scale screen. Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources. At common viewing distance, the separate sources are indistinguishable, which tricks the eye to see a given solid color. All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular <b>screen</b> <b>surface</b> conforms the color image.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} offered which yields the solar {{irradiation}} {{at the ground}} of a single-span greenhouse fitted with screens, {{in terms of the}} outside solar irradiation, the position of the sun, the optical properties of the cladding and <b>screening</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the geometry of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> and orientation of the axis of the greenhouse. The model is mathematically exact. From the physical point of view it is founded on the assumption that both the cladding and the <b>screening</b> <b>surfaces</b> are fully diffusive and the radiation diffused through the atmosphere and by the ground is fully isotropic. The importance of the geometry and of the optical properties of the screen in blocking the admission of solar irradiation inside are indicated. It is found that the solar irradiation inside a greenhouse, with any given cladding material, with any orientation and fitted with shading screens, is mainly determined by the transmittance of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} by its reflectance. The collected radiation increases with the transmittance of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> and for a given transmittance, with the reflectance of both the bottom side and topside of the screen. It is also found that a <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> forming a closed cavity with the inside ground is always more efficient in blocking the admission of solar irradiation than any other shape...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} offered which yields the net thermal {{radiation}} {{at the ground}} of a single span greenhouse fitted with thermal screens, {{in terms of the}} outside radiative environment, the properties of the cladding and <b>screening</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the temperatures of the ground, screen and covering. Radiation is assumed to be diffusely emitted, transmitted and reflected, both by the cladding and the <b>screening</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The importance of the geometry and temperature of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface,</b> and of the radiometric properties of the screen in determining the radiative environment inside are indicated. On the basis of this model, together with the outside radiation fluxes, temperature of the ground, screen and cover and data on the properties of the cladding and <b>screening</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the net thermal radiation inside the greenhouse can be determined, both in clear and overcast night sky conditions. These results are found to be in fairly good agreement with the measured net thermal radiation at ground level inside the greenhouse...|$|R

Moreover, without good maintenance, long-term using may cause wearing of <b>screen</b> <b>surface</b> which lead to oversize particles fall through screen.The efficiency of tumbler screening machine η can be express as: η = Mp÷MF, where Mp is the mass of fine particles which pass through the <b>screen</b> <b>surface</b> during the operation of tumbler screening machine, and MF is the mass of fine particles which in the initial feed of material to the tumbler screening machine.|$|E

50|$|Vertical screen scroll {{is built}} {{with the main}} {{components}} of screen, scroll, basket, housing, and helical screw. Feed containing liquid and solid materials is introduced into vertical screen scroll centrifuge from the top. This is sped up by centrifugal acceleration produced from the rotating parts contacted. As such, centrifugal force slings liquids through the openings, while solids are held on the <b>screen</b> <b>surface</b> as they cannot pass through because of granular particles larger than the screen pores or due to agglomeration. Movement of solids across the <b>screen</b> <b>surface</b> is manipulated by flights.

30|$|The {{understanding}} of screening process is incomplete regarding {{the intricacies of}} particle-particle and particle-machine interactions. But the influence of these interactions on the screening process effects on both the efficiency {{and the value of}} the product (Soldinger 2000; Zhao et al. 2000; Jiao et al. 2006). We divide the screening process into four parts as follows: (1) looseness: the void space that occurs between particles which are rebounded by the sieve plate. A sufficient void space contributes to particle stratification (Zhang and Tong 2012). (2) Stratification: the ability of the fine particles to penetrate the coarse granules, when all particles are scattered. In other words, stratification relates to the ability of the fine particles to approach the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> (Xiao and Tong 2012). (3) Collision: once close to the <b>screening</b> <b>surface,</b> some particles impact the sieve wires and some pass through the sieve mesh. These particles that are near the mesh are referred to as the collision particles (Wei et al. 1999). (4) Penetration: the penetration rate is the fraction of the collision particles which penetrate the mesh. It has a direct effect on screening performance.|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the case}} of {{graphical}} computer displays, contrast depends on the properties of the picture source or file and the properties of the computer display, including its variable settings.

50|$|It is {{important}} when incorporating video into live performance that {{you consider the}} effect of lights on the <b>screen</b> <b>surface.</b> One difficulty in setting lights {{is that they can}} significantly degrade the brightness and colour of the screen images if there is light either directly hitting or bouncing from the floor onto the screen.|$|E
