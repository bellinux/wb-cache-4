25|$|In many areas, regular {{avalanche}} tracks can {{be identified}} and precautions {{can be taken to}} minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (<b>snow</b> <b>fence)</b> and may be constructed of steel, wood or pre-stressed concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.|$|E

50|$|Snow {{farming is}} the use of obstacles, {{equipment}} and knowledge about management of snow in order to strategically manipulate snow coverage. Often this is done for the purpose of skiing or even preventing snow drift in certain areas like roads. The most popular obstacle is the <b>snow</b> <b>fence,</b> which is used to create drifts and collect more snow in a given area than would otherwise naturally occur. The snow can be moved to other areas and groomed {{with the use of a}} snow groomer. Sometimes the <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> is readily movable in order to maximize the collection of blown snow, despite wind direction changes.|$|E

The fences are placed so as to cause a snow drift where it is beneficial, or not harmful so that the snow does not drift onto undesired areas such as roads or among buildings.|$|R

50|$|The {{dominance}} of the region's evergreen sagebrush is a critical habitat {{for a variety of}} wildlife ranging from pronghorn which browse its leaves year round to small insects. However, habitat is constrained by oil and gas roads along with drilling and mining. Sagebrush also provides cover for animals such as elk and the pygmy rabbit. Elk depend upon tall brush near Steamboat Mountain for shelter during spring calving season and elsewhere for shade during the heat of summer. Yet the broader impact of sagebrush upon the ecology is its function as a living <b>snow</b> <b>fence.</b> Windblown snow builds up on the lee side of the brush during winter. This effectively stores moisture that is released into the soil in late spring and early summer.|$|E

50|$|Temporary {{snow fences}} are usually {{one of two}} varieties: {{perforated}} orange plastic sheeting attached to stakes at regular intervals (the type usually used for construction site fencing or temporary sports field fencing), or a cedar or other lightweight wood strip and wire fence, also attached to metal stakes. A permanent <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> usually consists of poles with horizontal planks running across {{them so that they}} cover just over one-half of the total fence area. The bottom 10% to 15% of the fence should be left open so that snow does not settle directly under the fence, which would reduce its effective height. Taller fences trap more snow. Taking the height of the fence as one unit, it should be placed thirty-five units or more to windward of the road or building that it is meant to protect. Permanent snow fences can also consist of lines of closely spaced shrubs, conifer trees or maize stalks.|$|E

Here, we present a numerical simulation of snow transport by wind, which is a phenomena involving many complex processes. Predicting the location of snow deposit after a wind period is a crucial question to protect roads against snow drift or control the formation of wind-slab (responsible for about 80 % of accidently caused avalanches). Placing <b>snow</b> <b>fences</b> at appropriate locations can substantially modify {{the shape of the}} deposit, by screening out the wind. <b>Snow</b> <b>fences</b> are also used to store snow on some ski trails.

40|$|Winter {{respiration}} in snow-covered ecosystems strongly influences annual carbon cycling, underlining {{the importance}} of processes related to the timing and quantity of <b>snow.</b> <b>Fences</b> were used to increase snow depth from 30 to 150 cm, and impacts on respiration were investigated in heath and mesic meadow, two common vegetation types in Svalbard. We manually measured ecosystem respiration from July 2007 to July 2008 at a temporal resolution greater than previously achieved in the High Arctic (campaigns: summer, eight; autumn, six; winter, 17; spring, nine). Moisture contents of unfrozen soil and soil temperatures throughout the year were also recorded. The increased snow depth resulted in significantly higher winter soil temperatures and increased ecosystem respiration. A temperature‚Äìefflux model explained most of the variation of observed effluxes: meadows, 94 (controls) and 93 % (fences); heaths, 84 and 77 %, respectively. <b>Snow</b> <b>fences</b> increased the total non-growing season efflux from 70 to 92 (heaths) and from 68 to 125 g CO 2 -C m- 2 (meadows). The non-growing season contributed to 56 (heaths) and 42 % (meadows) of the total annual carbon respired. This proportion increased with deeper snow to 64 % in both vegetation types. Summer respiration rates were unaffected by <b>snow</b> <b>fences,</b> but the total growing season respiration was lower behind fences because of the considerably delayed snowmelt. Meadows had higher summer respiration rates than heaths. In addition, non-steady state CO 2 effluxes were measured as bursts lasting several days during spring soil thawing, and when ice layers were broken to carry out winter efflux measurements...|$|R
