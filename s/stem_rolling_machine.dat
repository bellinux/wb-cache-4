In this paper, the change rule {{of the speed of}} cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> was inferred according to the work principle of the machine. And then the model of the cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> was designed, and imported it into the ADAMS software. At last, have a simulation analysis of the cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> with the ADAMS software. From the simulation analysis can know that the characteristic of motion of the cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> is reasonable...|$|R

50|$|The {{least amount}} of {{supplies}} needed to roll one's own cigarettes includes tobacco and rolling papers. However, some prefer to use equipment to aid them in rolling. These can include mechanical <b>rolling</b> <b>machines</b> and cigarette injectors (both mechanical and electric). Filters can also be added when using a <b>rolling</b> <b>machine,</b> and filter tubes are used when making cigarettes with an injector.|$|R

40|$|Normally in {{circular}} <b>rolling</b> <b>machine,</b> the {{stud bolt}} is threaded in one side at a time. In {{order to improve}} the production cycle of circular <b>rolling</b> <b>machine,</b> {{we are going to}} redesign the existing die setup, in which simultaneously to make thread in both sides of stud bolt. The stud bolt to be manufactured has two varying shank diameter, which cannot be balanced while threading operation in normal machine setup. So this new experimental setup gives a balanced rolling operation and hence improves productivity of the machine in making stud bolt...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} to discuss to design and {{fabrication}} of a manual spring <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> by a simple mechanism arrangement {{for the production of}} closed and open coil helical springs. This machine is operated by manual method. This machine produces closed coil helical spring of different diameter and different length. Rolling is the process of bending metal wire to a curved form. The article in the shape of round is made by spring roller shaft. Rolling operation can be done on hand or power operated <b>rolling</b> <b>machine.</b> It can make a spring from a shaft. A shaft is a rotating machine element which is used to transmit power from one place to another. A bearing is machine element which supports another moving machine element. Guider is used to guide the raw material (spring wire). This guider moves on the shaft automatically. This self-movement is achieved by the lead of spring. Handle is used to operate the <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> manually, without electric power frame is carries an all parts of the machine, it is made up of mild steel. A work holding mechanism is used to hold the mandrel; it is attached to the main shaft of machine. Mandrel is fitting in the work holding mechanism, the mandrel’s outer diameter is known as internal diameter of the sprin...|$|R
