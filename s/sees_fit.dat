5|$|The second series {{takes place}} {{some time after}} the events of series one. It is {{mentioned}} that John, Medley and Lioba help lead an uprising of the rogue avatars which resulted in Planet B declaring all rogues to be outlaws. Lioba has changed her appearance and voice and is currently {{on the run from}} the Planet B corporation. The whereabouts of John are unknown, and it is implied that Medley has been killed by Cerberus, who has since lost his job and is now killing both rogue and human controlled avatars as he <b>sees</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} reason to think that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she <b>sees</b> <b>fit.</b> Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E

25|$|The Courts of Montana are {{established}} by the Constitution of Montana.

25|$|The House {{generally}} {{adheres to}} the following order of priority as outlined in the House Rules, specifically Rule XIV during the 114th Congress, but variations exist to this order {{as a result of}} House Rules or parliamentary rules that take precedence. The House may suspend this order and conduct itself as it <b>sees</b> <b>fit</b> consistent with House Rules and with Parliamentary procedure.|$|E
25|$|While these Indians are {{essentially}} an agricultural people, I believe {{them to be}} as capable of learning the mechanical trades as the average white youth. The foregoing facts suggest {{the character of the}} educational institution that should be established for them, in case Congress <b>sees</b> <b>fit</b> to make the necessary appropriation, namely the establishment of an agricultural and mechanical school, in which domestic science shall also be taught.|$|E
25|$|Lou's {{affinity}} {{and ties}} with the area mean that she tends to view Albert Square as her own and thinks that gives her an excuse to intrude into people's business as she <b>sees</b> <b>fit.</b> She is great friends with Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), her lifelong neighbours. She also has {{a good relationship with}} the local general practitioner, Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) and an old Jewish pawnbroker known only as 'Uncle' (Leonard Maguire).|$|E

25|$|Calling no witnesses, Roark {{addresses}} the court {{on his own}} behalf. He makes a long and eloquent speech defending his right to offer his own work on his own terms. He is found innocent {{of the charges against}} him. A guilt-stricken Wynand summons the architect to his office. He coldly presents him with a contract to design the Wynand Building, to be the greatest structure of all time, with complete freedom to build it however Roark <b>sees</b> <b>fit.</b> As soon as Roark leaves, Wynand pulls out a pistol from his desk drawer and kills himself.|$|E
25|$|The final {{argument}} {{was that the}} principle of stare decisis bound the Appellate Division to follow the precedent of the Ndlwana case, in which it had ruled that Parliament can adopt any procedure it <b>sees</b> <b>fit</b> and the courts have no power to question the validity of its acts. The court ruled that it was entitled to overrule its own previous decisions if they were clearly wrong. In Ndlwana {{there had been no}} discussion of the Statute of Westminster nor any argument for or against the conclusion drawn by the court, and the court therefore felt free to overrule it.|$|E

25|$|The Bill of Rights Act 1990 {{does not}} provide express {{remedies}} for {{when one of the}} rights contained in the Act has been breached. Despite this, the New Zealand Court of Appeal has held on several occasions that it has the jurisdiction to develop remedies as it <b>sees</b> <b>fit.</b> The focus of Bill of Rights Act remedies is to provide vindication {{in such a way that}} upholds the importance of the right, rather than invokes punishment for its breach. As such, court decisions can often include a combination of remedies in order for the breached right to be properly vindicated.|$|E
25|$|Paper {{money is}} a form of {{currency}} that is physically printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, under authority of the Federal Reserve System. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is part of the U.S. Treasury Department, whereas the Federal Reserve is not. In contrast to paper money, coins are physically produced by the U.S. Mint, within and under authority of the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve System can authorize as much paper money as it <b>sees</b> <b>fit,</b> but the U.S. Treasury is restricted by law to a certain maximum amount of coinage in circulation.|$|E
25|$|Constitutionally, {{the monarch}} may {{nominate}} anyone he <b>sees</b> <b>fit</b> as his prerogative. However, it remains pragmatic {{for him to}} nominate the person most likely to enjoy {{the confidence of the}} Cortes and form a government, usually the political leader whose party commands the most seats in the Cortes. For the Crown to nominate the political leader whose party controls the Cortes {{can be seen as a}} royal endorsement of the democratic process, a fundamental concept enshrined in the 1978 constitution. By political custom, the king's nominees have all been from parties who hold the most seats in the Cortes. The king is normally able to announce his nominee the day following a General Election.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} decades of the 19th century, Federal {{architecture}} and Greek Revival architecture were dominated by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas U. Walter, and Samuel Sloan. Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century, but his contemporaries included John McArthur, Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it <b>sees</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Where {{it appears}} to the tax {{inspector}} that the beginning or end of any accounting period is uncertain, he may make an assessment on the company for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as appears to him appropriate. In that event, that period is treated for all purposes as an accounting period unless the inspector <b>sees</b> <b>fit</b> to revise it {{as a result of}} receiving further facts, or on an appeal against the assessment in respect of some other matter the company shows the true accounting periods. If on an appeal against an assessment made under this rule the company shows the true accounting periods, the assessment appealed against has effect as an assessment or assessments for the true accounting periods, and assessments may be made for any such periods as might have been made at the time when the assessment appealed against was made.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Brazil {{passed an}} affirmative action law {{in an attempt}} to {{directly}} fight the legacy of slavery. Through it Brazilian policy makers have forced state universities, regarded very highly because it is free and of high quality, to have a certain quota of Afro-Brazilians. The percentage of Afro-Brazilians to be admitted, as high as 30% in some states, causes great social discontent that some argue furthers racial tensions. It is argued that these high quotas are needed because of the unequal opportunities available to Afro-Brazilians. In 2012 Brazil’s Supreme Court unanimously held the law constitutional. However, in sectors like education, political representation, and overall quality of life, opportunities and capabilities for Afro-Brazilians will continue to increase. Brazil's government will continue to provide for all of its people as it <b>sees</b> <b>fit,</b> but the issue of slavery and its legacy may forever be felt in all facets of Brazilian life.|$|E
