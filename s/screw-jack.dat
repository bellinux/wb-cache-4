6000|$|... (Their breakfast {{was stopped}} while the <b>screw-jack</b> and hammer Tore waxcloth, split teak-wood, and chipped out the dammer;) ...|$|E
60|$|The man in {{question}} stood up just then. He {{was big and}} gaunt and pale, but he wore ordinary city clothes, and when {{he and the others}} had inserted the <b>screw-jack</b> contrivance on a strip of thick planking under the sawn-off tree, he turned to the assembly.|$|E
60|$|I got {{on board}} the ship as before, and {{prepared}} a second raft; and having had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful to me: as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I found two or three bags of nails and spikes, a great <b>screw-jack,</b> a dozen or two of hatchets; and, above all, that most useful thing called a grind-stone. All these I secured together, with several things belonging to the gunner; particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder more; a large bag-full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet-lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up {{to get it over}} the ship's side.|$|E
50|$|The stairs are {{adjustable}} {{to within}} 1/16 inch by manually activating <b>screw-jacks</b> {{at the top}} of the launching truss.|$|R
50|$|A {{drawing of}} the tractor in the patent {{document}} shows a number of refinements which were considered at the time but not actually fitted to the Dennis tractor prototype, such as a six-cylinder engine, steerable rear wheels for use when reversing on the rail and a power-operated <b>screw-jacking</b> system to raise the front road wheels to obviate the use of ramps.|$|R
5000|$|R101 used pre-doped linen panels {{for much}} of its covering, rather than lacing undoped fabric into place and then {{applying}} dope to shrink it. In {{order to reduce the}} area of unsupported fabric in the covering R101 alternated the main longitudinals with non-structural [...] "reefing booms" [...] mounted on kingposts which were adjustable using <b>screw-jacks</b> in order to tension the covering. The pre-doped fabric proved unsatisfactory from the start, with panels splitting because of humidity changes before the airship had even left its shed.|$|R
60|$|Barbison, {{who watched}} the {{proceedings}} with the rest, was aware of this, {{but he did not}} know that the man who sat smoking on a big mechanical appliance of the <b>screw-jack</b> order was the Shasta's engineer. It was also somewhat curious, since he had contrived to mention her several times, that his companions had not thought it worth while to acquaint him with the fact, but left him to suppose the gentleman in question was traveling the country on behalf of the manufacturers of the American stump-grubber. In the meanwhile Barbison discoursed glibly about fruit-trees and produce prices, and pointed now and then to a big tin case partly filled with desiccated fruits and pictures which lay on a chair beside him. He was a little, dapper man, evidently from the cities, and by no mean disingenuous, though he was apparently young. He turned when a big quiet rancher picked up and gravely munched a fine Californian plum.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{instrumental}} errors {{could be}} averaged out by reversing the telescope on its mounting. A carriage was provided, which ran on rails between the piers, and {{on which the}} axis, circles and telescope could be raised by a <b>screw-jack,</b> wheeled out from between the piers, turned 180°, wheeled back, and lowered again.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1905. It has two main spans and a smaller one on the east side. It also has a <b>screw-jack</b> lifting system to allow the bridge to be lifted during floods. It was used until 1972, when the Kansas City Stockyards closed down, Kemper Arena was built right {{in the path of}} the tracks, and Rock Island {{abandoned}} the line to the bridge later that year. The bridge's rails were cut off at each end and a levee for the Kansas River was built at the east end. It no longer carries railroads, but carries electrical wires in a rack. It is located just north of Kansas Avenue over the Kansas River.|$|E
2500|$|After the gun {{was placed}} in a firing {{position}} with the gun pointing in the desired direction, the trails were lowered to the ground and the limber was removed. The carriage wheels would then be raised using built-in ratcheting <b>screw-jacks,</b> lowering the gun carriage to the ground. Once on the ground, the limber-end of the trail legs were separated to form a wide [...] "vee" [...] with its apex {{at the center of the}} carriage pivot point. A recoil spade at the limber-end of each trail leg required a correctly positioned hole to be dug for the spade, which was attached to the trail end, to transmit the recoil from gun carriage through the trails and into the earth. This made the gun very stable and assisted its accuracy. [...] The removable spades were transported in brackets on the trail legs.|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand SAFE Air moved {{rail freight}} from Wellington (the North Island) across the Cook Strait to Blenheim (the South Island) and back, using Bristol Freighters, {{starting}} in 1951. The airline later reconfigured its aircraft to accept palletised cargo loaded on patented [...] "cargons". This {{was a first}} anywhere in the aviation world.Cargons were loaded near the rail yards and their load was calculated and arranged to remain within the aircraft's load and centre of gravity limits. They were then trucked {{to the airport and}} placed on the Freighter using a mechanical loading device. The loader accepted cargons from horizontal-tray road vehicles and then raised them {{to the level of the}} aircraft's cargo deck on electrically powered <b>screw-jacks.</b> The pallets could then be rolled into the nose of the aircraft. Other adaptations allowed the carrying of horses and other high-value large animals.|$|R
60|$|The engine-room {{stores were}} unearthed, and Mr. Wardrop's face, red with the filth of the bilges and the {{exertion}} of travelling on his stomach, lit with joy. The spare gear of the Haliotis had been unusually complete, and two-and-twenty men, armed with <b>screw-jacks,</b> differential blocks, tackle, vices, and a forge or so, can look Kismet {{between the eyes}} without winking. The crew were ordered to replace the holding-down and shaft-bearing bolts, and return the collars of the thrust-block. When they had finished, Mr. Wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound engines {{without the aid of}} the shops, and the men sat about on the cold machinery. The cross-head jammed in the guides leered at them drunkenly, but offered no help. They ran their fingers hopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supporting-column, and picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores, while Mr. Wardrop's voice rose and fell echoing, till the quick tropic night closed down over the engine-room skylight.|$|R
50|$|The {{carriage}} {{was also}} used by the 4.5 inch Gun M-1. It went {{through a number of}} minor changes over time. The original Warner electric brakes were replaced by Westinghouse air brakes on the M1A1. Both the M1 and M1A1 carriages used a mid-axle firing pedestal that was extended by a ratchet mechanism. The M1A2 replaced the ratchet with a <b>screw-jack</b> system and also modified the traveling lock. The M1A1E1 carriage was intended for use in jungle and muddy terrain and replaced the wheels of the M1A1 with a free-wheeling tracked suspension, but the project was terminated after V-J day without having reached production. The T-9 and T-10 carriages were projects using low-grade steel alloys that were canceled when no longer needed. The T-16 was a light-weight carriage using high-grade steel that was estimated to save some 1200 lb; work began in July 1945 and continued after the war, although nothing seems to have come from it.|$|E
50|$|Martin {{immediately}} began to abuse his authority, since {{with the power to}} purchase supplies, separately from Carver and Cushman, Martin began to purchase whatever goods he wished and without considering what was a fair price to pay for such goods. Martin, along with Carver and Cushman, was required to purchase supplies and foodstuffs such as beer, wine, hardtack, salted beef and pork, dried peas, fishing supplies, muskets, armor, clothing, tools, trade goods for Indians, and the <b>screw-jack</b> which would prove to be useful in ship-structure support prior to their arrival in America. Carver and Cushman collected provisions in London and Canterbury with Martin doing as he wished in Southampton, the major port on England’s south coast, contrary to the others wishes. He did not ask for (or take) advice and when funds began to run short, just prior to the sailing for America, he was questioned about his financial records and became quite enraged over suspicions that the Leiden church had and refused to show his records to anyone.|$|E
40|$|Two mechanisms, both of <b>screw-jack</b> type are described. The {{scanning}} mechanism, an oil lubricated {{and sealed}} unit drives and accurately positions the telescope of the METEOSAT radiometer. The dry lubricated focusing mechanism {{is used to}} adjust {{the focus of this}} telescope. The METEOSAT program is nearly completed, and the first flight model will be launched {{at the end of the}} year...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} appropriate agricultural extension technological needs of users in cassava processing activities in Nigeria. Purposive sampling technique {{was used in}} selecting 160 participating and non-participating users making a total of 320 users in Oyo state. Data was collected with Interview Schedule and analysed using chi-square and t-test. (58 %) of women (users) use traditional processing equipments in cassava processing. Improved processing technologies used include vibrating sieve, abrasive peeler, motorised grater, drum drier, and <b>screw-jack.</b> Processed cassava products include “gari,” “lafun,” starch, and “fufu. ” Significant relationships exist {{between the use of}} improved technologies for processing and age (X 2 = 6. 15, p= 0. 05), educational Status (X 2 = 5. 80, p= 0. 05), religion (X 2 = 12. 20, p= 0. 05) and type of technology utilized. Significant difference exists between mean adoption scores of participating and nonparticipating users (t= 6. 53, p= 0. 05). Problems encountered by the users include high cost of processing equipment, transportation difficulties, poor infrastructural facilities, shortage of labour, poor access to market, lack of fund and poor shortage facilities. Time-saving and simpler prototype processing equipment should be introduced to the users of cassava processing technologies during extension training...|$|E
