5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E

In {{the view of}} the optimum conditions establishment of heavymetals removal from the residual waters we used different neutralisation agents (sodium hydroxide solution 30 %, <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonates</b> 10 %, calcium oxide, mixture of sodium hydroxide and <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> and <b>sodium</b> hydroxide with aeration) ...|$|R

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves {{the extraction of}} selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.|$|E
5|$|The anode sludges {{contain the}} selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in {{compounds}} with the formula M2Se or M2Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 °C the anode sludges are roasted with <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> under air. The metal ions {{are reduced to}} the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining industry of Chad produced <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E

50|$|The Solvay {{process or}} ammonia-soda {{process is the}} major {{industrial}} process {{for the production of}} <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>carbonate</b> (<b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>carbonate).</b> The ammonia-soda process was developed into its modern form by Ernest Solvay during the 1860s. The ingredients for this process are readily available and inexpensive: salt brine (from inland sources or from the sea) and limestone (from mines). The worldwide production of baking powder in 2005 has been estimated at 42 million metric tons, which is more than six kilograms per year (6 kg) for each person on Earth. Solvay-based chemical plants now produce roughly three-quarters of this supply, with the remainder being mined from natural deposits.|$|R
25|$|Variations in the Solvay process {{have been}} {{proposed}} to convert carbon dioxide emissions into <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> but carbon sequestration by calcium or magnesium carbonates appears more promising. However, {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide exhausted by mankind as compared to the amount which can be used for carbon sequestration with calcium or magnesium is very low. Moreover, variation on the Solvay process will most probably add an additional energy step, which will increase carbon dioxide emissions.|$|R
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E

50|$|Caesium {{carbonate}} or cesium carbonate {{is a white}} crystalline solid compound. Caesium carbonate has a high solubility in polar solvents such as water, {{alcohol and}} DMF. Its solubility is higher in organic solvents compared to other carbonates like potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> although it remains quite insoluble in other organic solvents such as toluene, p-xylene, and chlorobenzene. This compound is used in organic synthesis as a base. It also appears to have applications in energy conversion.|$|R

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the glass}} was melted using local raw materials, {{including}} sand from neighbouring villages, <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide. Nowadays, recycled glass {{is often used}} instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, glass production has suffered a decline.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E

The manufacture of <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> from common salt was first developed in France in the 1790s and known as the Leblanc process. Muspratt was attracted towards manufacturing it, but could not raise the capital for the relatively expensive Leblanc plant and also considered that Dublin was not a suitable location for this. He perceived Merseyside as better because of the neighbouring coal fields, the proximity to the salt district of Cheshire, and the proximity to glassmaking industry. The glassmakers were the main prospective customer base for the <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> alkali.|$|E
