40|$|Bisphophonates (BP) {{were first}} named diphosphonates. They are potent inhibitors of osteoclastic {{activity}} and so reduce bone remodeling. Additionally they have anti-angiogenic properties {{and contribute to}} progressive disappearance of bony micro-vascular blood supply. Administrated orally, BP are generally used to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Injectable BP are used in patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic solid tumors. Scientific evidence dealing with a potentially devastating side effect of BP, osteochemonecrosis of the jaws, is growing rapidly. Clinical signs and symptoms include absent or delayed soft tissue healing with bony exposure following dental extraction or spontaneous gum dehiscence. Patients are usually asymptomatic but may develop pain if the bone becomes secondarily infected. At the beginning, no radiographic manifestations are seen, {{but in some cases}} a vast zone of necrotic bone can be seen on MRI, larger than what could be expected.

ObjectivesThe goal {{of this study was}} to systematically search for the POEs of present and potentially new episodes of IEs. MethodsPatients were systematically seen by a <b>stomatologist,</b> an ear, nose, and throat specialist, and a urologist; women were systematically seen by a gynecologist; patients were seen by a dermatologist when there were cutaneous and/or mucous lesions. Colonoscopy and gastroscopy were performed if the microorganism came from the gastrointestinal tract in patients ≥ 50 years of age and in those with familial histories of colonic polyposis. Treatment of the POE was systematically considered. ResultsThe POEs of the present IE episodes were identified in 74 % of the 318 included patients. The most frequent POE was cutaneous (40 % of identified POEs). It was mainly (62 % of cutaneous POEs) associated with health care and with intravenous drug use. The second most frequent POE was oral or dental (29 %). A dental infectious focus was more often involved (59 % of oral or dental POEs) than a dental procedure (12 %). POEs were gastrointestinal in 23 % of patients. Colonic polyps were found in one-half of the patients and colorectal adenocarcinomas in 14 %. Performance was good regarding the search for an oral or dental or a colonic potential POE, which were found in 53 % and 40 % of patients, respectively. ConclusionsOur search for the POEs of present IEs was often successful, as was searching for an oral or dental or a gastrointestinal POE of a new IE episode.

Oral complications can be divided in three groups. Primary lesions are induced by the infiltration of the oral structures by malignant cells: gingival infiltration and infiltration of bony oral structures. Secondary lesions are the result of the myelophthisic character of the disease. This group contains symptoms of anemia, increased bleeding tendency and increased susceptibility to infections. Tertiary lesions are induced by the antileukemic treatment patients receive. Direct and indirect cytotoxic effects can be distinguished.

40|$|AbstractHyaline ring {{granuloma}} (HRG) is {{a comparatively}} rare inflammatory condition occurring {{mainly in the}} oral region, and is characterized by hyaline rings (HRs) formed in the granulation tissue. This study describes a case of HRG occurring in the mandibular periosteum of an 18 -year-old male. Histopathologic, histochemical and electron microscopic studies were performed on surgically excised materials. Histopathologically, ovoid bodies(OBs) surrounded by thin hyaline walls and HRs showing pale-stained eosinophilic thick hyaline walls were both detected. Histochemical study revealed that the OBs contained many granules chiefly composed of starch. Ultrastructurally, the HRs presented a stratiform structure due to the accumulation of cross-banded collagen fibrils with a basement membrane-like lining containing cellulose microfilaments. These results suggest that HRs are formed as follows: the exogenous vegetable materials are encapsulated by collagen, then the component is gradually degraded; the residual cellulose fraction adheres to the inner surface of the collagenous capsules, and the continuous deposition of collagen at the outer surface of the capsules increases its thickness. Finally, thick hyaline walls of HRs are formed. The possible pathogenesis of this curious lesion is discussed for <b>stomatologists...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the usual}} {{university}} curricula of stomatology, the aspects {{related to the}} education and preservation of manual skills are not thoroughly and sufficiently studied, which explains {{the theme of the}} present study, dedicated to the reorganization of the curricula content of the disciplines involved in the development of practical competences in the field. Each student possesses a certain individual manual skill, understood by the teacher only superficially, which is also the case of his natural aptitudes and deficiencies. That is why, the training developed during student years should be prolongued along the whole professional career of the <b>stomatologist,</b> which requires changing of one’s usual attitude versus his own performances, along with a conscious and continuous education for maintaining and developing the expected practical competences. Special attention should be paid to avoiding physical and psychic fatigue, by a corresponding dosage of the intensity of one’s activity, along with a suitable prophylaxy of occupational pathology by practising of relaxation exercises adapted to such a specific profession. An important premise of the implementation of the concept of manual skill refers to the fact that instrumentalized parctising of dental medicine, always influenced by the continuous technological development, assumes the utilization of a large range of medical apparata and devices, in the absence of which stomatology would be a wholly different thing. Organization of an ergonomic stomatological system represents another important objective of the program of skill education as, in itself, it does not cover the shortcomings of a disordered activity. Essential in such situations is the sequential knowledge of the execution times for the various restorative dental, endodontic, periodontal, surgical, prosthetic procedures, on categories of age, the realization of which maintains the manual skills, by their execution on electro-mechanical and haptic simulators and by the development of practical competences on the pacient, under the direct supervision of the didactic staff, after practical demonstration...|$|E

40|$|U prikazu rada zagrebačkog stomatologa dra Matića iz g. 1926. možemo ustanoviti, da su njegove koncepcije endodontskog postupka bile samo u principu pravilne. Autor je širio kanale zuba do apeksa, a dezinficirao ih je najčešće trikrezolformalinom, gdje mu je koagulacija proteina bila poželjna, a gnojnu je sekreciju ispirao sa H 202. Svakako je loša strana njegovog postupka bila punjenje kanala. On to čini u donjem dijelu korijena i to samo vatom namočenom u trikrezolformalin. Tvrdi, da je imao izvrsne uspjehe te je mogao iz liječiti sve fistule. To mu se može vjerovati, jer se fistule brzo zatvaraju poslije širokog otvaranja kanala i dezinfekcije. Međutim, trajnost takvih punjenja vatom kao i uspjeh je manje vjerojatan. Referent je vidio i takva punjenja bez periapikalnih promjena, ali i čiste egzarcerbacije. Za ono vrijeme bio je dr Matić napredan, mada se danas ne možemo složiti s njegovim postupkom, i ovaj prikaz ima samo historijsku vrijednost. On {{reviewing}} {{the work of}} the Zagreb <b>stomatologist</b> Dr Matić of 1926, we may state that his conceptions of endodontic procedures were only correct in principle. The author widened the canals of the tooth as far as the apex, disinfected them most often with tricresolformalin where protein coagulation was desirable, while suppurative secretion was rinsed with H 909. In any case the bad side of this procedure was the filling of the canal. He did it in {{the lower part of the}} root and used only cotton wool dipped in tricresolformalin. Dr. Matić stated that he had excellent results and was able to cure all fistulae. We may believe this statement because fistulae tend to close quickly after the canal have been widely opened and disinfected. However, the duration of such fillings consisting of cotton wool and the alleged success are less credible. The author of this paper had the opportunity to see such fillings without periapical changes but frequently with exacerbation as well. In his time dr. Matić was considered a progressive dentist, though today we cannot agree with his procedures and this review is thus of historical value. Eine Umschau auf die Arbeit des Zagreber Zahnarztes Dr Matić aus dem Jahre 1926 zeigt, dass seine Konzeption nur im Prinzip richtig war. Der Autor hat den Wurzelkanal bis zum Apex erweitert und mit Trikresolformalin wegen der Proteincoagulation desin fiziert. Die eitrige Sekretionspult er mit H 202 aus. Die schwache Seite seines Verfahrens war die WurzelfuIlung; blos im unteren Teil des Wurzelkanals und zwar mit in Trikresolformalin getrankter Watte. Seiner Behauptung, dass er dam it alle Fisteln ausgeheilt hat, kann man Glauben schenken, weil sich Fisteln nach breiter Eroffnung des Kanals und Desinfektion bald schliessen, doch Dauererfolge mit solcher Methode sind sehr zu bezweifeln.

40|$|Acute leukaemia is {{the most}} common form of chilhood cancer. The aim of this paper was to {{underline}} the importance of oral manifestations in children with acute leukaemia. The disease and its treatment can directly or indirectly affect oral health. Oral manifestations are gingival inflammation and enlargement. Leukaemic cells are capable of infiltrating the gingiva and the deeper periodontal tissues which leads to ulceration and infection of oral tissues. Gingival bleeding is a common sign in patients with leukaemia. Symptoms include local lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane Petechiae and ecchymoses. Cytotoxic drugs have direct effects like mucositis, involving atrophy, desquamation and ulceration of the mucosa, with increasing the risk for local and systemic infections. Leukaemia can directly influence dental care and dental treatment, while oral lesions may have life-threatening consequences. Knowledge and skills among dentists may also not be adequate to treat children with acute leukaemia. It is therefore imperative that all <b>stomatologists</b> be aware of dental problems that occur in leukaemia in order to be able to effectively carry out appropriate measures to mitigate these problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of health literature is characterized {{in the province}} of Ciego de Ávila, starting from the articles published by professionals from the territory in 23 Cuban medical journals between 1990 and 1997. During this period, 42 papers were published with a total author/article average of 3. 5 and a men: women ratio of 4 : 1. On considering the population of first degree specialists in this province, in 1996, it was obtained an articles production index of 0. 93 x 100 doctors. On analyzing the type of research study according to its subject and level of analysis, the predominance of articles dealing with clinical research studies, public health and biomedical research were observed. The scientific production was specially low among male nurses, primary care physicians and <b>stomatologists.</b> Most of the authors come from the provincial hospitals of Ciego de Ávila and Morón. Emphasis is made on the necessity of creating data bases with adequate bibliometric indicators that reflect the real situation of health scientific research in this province...|$|R
40|$|The degree work is {{concentrated}} on basic characterization of nosocomial infections, on the prevention thereof {{and on the}} observance of antiepidemical measures {{in the sphere of}} stomatology. Although these infections were largely related to the mortality and morbidity in health service establishments in the past, their occurrence goes down significantly these days. The adoption and observance of fundamental hygienic principles and rules was of decisive importance in this sphare. The neglect of these principles can endanger the health and life of the patient seriously end bring about the increase of costs for further therapy of the patient. It is therefore necessary even at present time ot pay great attention to these diseases and to the prevention thereof. The research part of the work is devoted to the evaluation of preventive measures connected with nosocomial infections in stomatological practice. The literature search in the theoretical part follows therefore this orientation too. The theoretical part deals at first with the most frequent agents of nosocomial infections, that can be encountered. The attention {{is concentrated}} on brief characterization of these diseases, their sources and on the process of spreading. Then, the basic classification of these diseases and the concrete methods of prevention are mentioned. In the sphere of stomatology, the work resumes the basic historical relations and identifies particular sectors of this discipline. In conneciton with nosocomial infections, their impact upon the stomatology as well as the need of protection against these infections are discussed. It means epidemiological measures, importance of hand hygiene, necessity of sterilization, desinfection and of cleaning. The aim of the work is to point out the importance of prevention as to the origin and spreading of these infections and the necessity to observe the epidemical principles at the work in dental surgeries. The performed investigation resumes established facts about the observance of hygienic and epidemiological regimen and that not only as to the general judgement on problems, but in consideration of local differences, of differences in the duration of practice carried out by individual <b>stomatologists</b> and in relation to the frequency of conducted hygienic inspections as well. Problematic areas as to the nosocomial infections and as to the observance of decreed provisions by <b>stomatologists</b> are defined here. It refers also to the influence of the locality and to the frequency of inspections directed to the observance of these hygienic rules by physicians...|$|R
