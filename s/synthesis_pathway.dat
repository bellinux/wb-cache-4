40|$|The vast {{majority}} of chemical products is based on crude oil. On the one hand, crude oil is a limited resource, whose depletion will be more expensive and riskier in the future. On the other hand, using fossil raw materials is at last associated with carbon dioxide emissions. Anthropogenic {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} like carbon dioxide are responsible for the global climate change. An alternative carbon source is biomass. In contrast to crude oil, biomass is a renewable resource and it has functional groups fossil raw materials do not have. These can be used for synthesis. Therefore, biomass is an attractive feedstock for carbon based <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways.</b> With a few exceptions, the development of bio-based <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> is currently only at the beginning. Therefore, it is interesting to know which bio-based <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> promise a high economic potential for managing research and development efforts reasonably. Due to the early stage of development of these routes, only little information about their prospective chemical processes is available. For an evaluation of such <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> - independent of the kind of feedstock -, a combination of material and exergy balances is suitable and applied in this thesis. Compared to energy balances, exergy balances have the advantage that a comparison of the quality of different forms of energy is possible, whereby the significance of the results increases. In this thesis, different approaches and structures of <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> characterised by the chemical exergy of the main components are thermodynamically evaluated and general recommendations for future bio-based <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> are derived. The examinations have shown that, from an exergetical point of view, <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> are favorable if the chemical exergy of their main components are relatively similar. Due to the high oxygen content of biomass, the chemical exergy is low compared to crude-oil. Using biomass as feedstock <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> leading to end products with a high oxygen content are promising to have low exergy losses. For a complete raw material change towards biomass, agricultural land is required to produce biomass. Because of a rising world population and a general increasing demand for agricultural products, agricultural land is a scarce resource. Thus, in this thesis the land use required for a complete raw material change is estimated under various boundary conditions. It has been shown that the structure of <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> that promise low exergy losses have a low land use as well. Since both exergy losses and land use is low, new end products with a high oxygen content and corresponding <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways</b> should be developed if biomass is used as feedstock...|$|R

25|$|Unlike other {{domestic}} species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a {{study found that}} there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathway,</b> with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.|$|E
25|$|Acetyl-CoA {{is formed}} into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA {{carboxylase}}, {{at which point}} malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathway.</b> Acetyl-CoA carboxylase {{is the point of}} regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and allosteric regulation. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and produce energy.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} made by cell culture that involves fusing myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells immunized with the desired antigen. Rabbit B-cells {{can be used}} to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the de novo purine <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathway</b> is also disrupted. Exposing cells to aminopterin (a folic acid analogue, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.|$|E

25|$|IgE, the IgE <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathway,</b> and the IgE-mediated allergic/inflammatory pathway are all {{important}} targets in intervening with the pathological processes of allergy, asthma, and other IgE-mediated diseases. The B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation pathway that eventually generate IgE-secreting plasma cells {{go through the}} intermediate steps of IgE-expressing B lymphoblasts and involves the interaction with IgE-expressing memory B cells. Tanox, a biotech company based in Houston, Texas, proposed in 1987 that by targeting membrane-bound IgE (mIgE) on B lymphoblast and memory B cells, those cells can be lysed or down-regulated, thus achieving the inhibition of the production of antigen-specific IgE and hence a shift of immune balance toward non-IgE mechanisms. Two approaches targeting the IgE pathway were evolved and both are in active development. In the first approach, the anti-IgE antibody drug omalizumab (trade name Xolair) recognises IgE not bound to its receptors and is used to neutralise or mop-up existing IgE and prevent it from binding to the receptors on mast cells and basophils. Xolair has been approved in many countries for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma. It has also been approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U. S. for treating chronic spontaneous urticaria, which cannot be adequately treated with H1-antihistamines. In the second approach, antibodies specific for a domain of 52 amino acid residues, referred to as CεmX or M1’ (M1 prime), present only on human mIgE on B cells and not on free, soluble IgE, have been prepared and are under clinical development {{for the treatment of}} allergy and asthma. An anti-M1’ humanized antibody, quilizumab, is in phase IIb clinical trial.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{studies of}} human lung {{function}} and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease {{have identified a}} highly significant and reproducible signal on 4 q 24. It remains unclear {{which of the two}} candidate genes within this locus may regulate lung function: GSTCD, a gene with unknown function, and/or INTS 12, a member of the Integrator Complex which is currently thought to mediate 3 ’end processing of small nuclear RNAs. Results We found that, in lung tissue, 4 q 24 polymorphisms associated with lung function correlate with INTS 12 but not neighbouring GSTCD expression. In contrast to the previous reports in other species, we only observed a minor alteration of snRNA processing following INTS 12 depletion. RNAseq analysis of knockdown cells instead revealed dysregulation of a core subset of genes relevant to airway biology and a robust downregulation of protein <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways.</b> Consistent with this, protein translation was decreased in INTS 12 knockdown cells. In addition, ChIPseq experiments demonstrated INTS 12 binding throughout the genome, which was enriched in transcriptionally active regions. Finally, we defined the INTS 12 regulome which includes genes belonging to the protein <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways.</b> Conclusion INTS 12 has functions beyond the canonical snRNA processing. We show that it regulates translation by regulating the expression of genes belonging to protein <b>synthesis</b> <b>pathways.</b> This study provides a detailed analysis of INTS 12 activities on a genome-wide scale and contributes to the biology behind the genetic association for lung function at 4 q 24...|$|R
