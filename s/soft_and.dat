30|$|Recently, in 2011, Shabir and Naz [23] and Cagman et al. [24] {{initiated}} {{the study of}} <b>soft</b> topology <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> topological spaces independently. Shabir and Naz [23] defined soft topology on the collection τ of soft sets over X. Consequently, they defined basic notions of soft topological spaces such as <b>soft</b> open <b>and</b> closed sets, <b>soft</b> subspace, soft closure, soft nbd of a point, soft T i spaces, i= 1, 2, 3, 4, <b>soft</b> regular spaces, <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> normal spaces <b>and</b> established their several properties. In [25], we presented further several important properties of notions defined and studied in [23]. On the other hand, Cagman et al. [24] introduced a soft topology on a <b>soft</b> set <b>and</b> defined a <b>soft</b> topological space. They defined basic notions <b>and</b> concepts of <b>soft</b> topological spaces such as <b>soft</b> open <b>and</b> closed sets, <b>soft</b> interior, soft closure, soft basis, soft nbd of a point, soft limit point of a soft set, soft complement, <b>soft</b> difference, <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> boundary <b>and</b> established several properties of these soft notions. The work in both papers is appreciable.|$|R

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E

Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E
