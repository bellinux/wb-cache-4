40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic load tests that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The <b>loads</b> used for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, and to evaluate during the test that the load does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests, a series of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for load testing, load testing for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> testing for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tested in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

This information {{could be related to}} the material (for example, the effect of alkali-silica reaction on the structural capacity) {{as well as to the}} structiu-al system (for example, the effect of restraints at the supports or transverse redistribution capacity). When it is decided to <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> a bridge, the question arises which maximum load should be attained diuing the experiment to approve the capacity of tiie bridge, and which criteria, based on the measiurements during the test, would indicate that the <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> needs to be aborted before reaching the maximum desired load (the so-called stop criteria).

This paper addresses the preparation, execution, and analysis of a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test on a four-span reinforced concrete solid slab bridge, viaduct de Beek. The bridge has one lane in each direction, but was restricted to a single lane, since an assessment showed that the capacity is not sufficient to allow both lanes. For this <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, the bridge was heavily equipped with sensors, so that early signs of distress can be seen. The difficulty in this test was that, for safety reasons, only the first span could be tested, but that the lowest ratings were found in the second span. A direct approval of the viaduct by <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> was thus not possible, and an analysis was necessary after the field test. The result of this analysis is that only by allowing 6. 7 % of plastic redistribution in the second span, sufficient capacity can be demonstrated. Structural and Building Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|<b>Proof</b> pile <b>load</b> {{tests are}} an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional proof test procedures are studied so that the value derived from proof tests can be maximized. Whether or not a proof test is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the proof test can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several load test parameters such as the number of tests, the test load, the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests. A larger test <b>load</b> for <b>proof</b> tests, say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R

40|$|The bridges built {{during the}} {{development}} of the Dutch road network after the Second World War are reaching their originally devised service life. A large subset of the Dutch bridge stock consists of reinforced concrete slab bridges. This bridge type often rates insufficient according to the recently introduced Eurocodes. Therefore, more suitable methods are developed to assess reinforced concrete slab bridges to help transportation officials make informed decisions about the safety and remaining life of the existing bridges. If information about a bridge is lacking, if the reduction in structural capacity caused by material degradation is unknown, or if an assessment shows insufficient capacity but additional capacity can be expected, a bridge might be suitable for a field test. A <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test demonstrates that a given bridge can carry a certain load level. In the Netherlands, a number of existing reinforced concrete slab bridges have been <b>proof</b> <b>loaded,</b> and one bridge has been tested to collapse.

40|$|The {{load testing}} method has {{considerable}} possibilities in bridges {{with the objective}} of their safety assessment. One type of <b>load</b> tests is <b>proof</b> <b>load.</b> <b>Proof</b> <b>load</b> testing is a full-scale and non-destructive examination of load-carrying capacity. Proof-load testing has been applied to various types of structure {{in many parts of the}} world. Originally, it provided a way to check the design assumptions and quality of construction. Later, it became an effective approach to assessing load-carrying capacity of existing structures. The aim of the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test is to discover hidden mechanisms of response that can not appear under “normal” levels of load, but that develop at higher ratios of load and may increase the bridge load capacity. For this reason, in such test, the load introduced in the bridge is relatively high and due to the risks of damaging the structure, this type of tests is restricted to bridges that have failed to pass the most advanced theoretical assessment or when such theoretical assessment is not possible due to the lack of bridge documentation. The objective of this test is to directly obtain the maximum allowable load in the bridge with a required safety level. Acoustic emission has been identified as a useful technique in the follow up of the <b>loading</b> process in <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests in order to stop the load increase before any damage can be inflicted to the bridge.
