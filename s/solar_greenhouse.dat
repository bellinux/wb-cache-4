About 50 kgs of fresh and good quality grapes were loaded into those dryers and it was repeated for three trails. The mass of fuel added to the biomass heater was about 7. 5 kg/hr. The biomass heater was ignited when there is a fall in sunshine (after 5 PM) {{in order to maintain the}} temperature inside the dryer and the fuel used is the remains of the coconuts such as coconut fronts, coconut husk, coconut shell and firewood. The solar tunnel dryer coupled with the biomass heater dried the grapes which has an initial moisture content of 80 % (w. b.) to a final moisture content of 10 % (w. b.) over a time period of 30 hours whereas the <b>solar</b> tunnel <b>greenhouse</b> dryer without the biomass heater took 55 hours for reducing the moisture content of the grapes to the same level. The reduced drying time in the <b>solar</b> tunnel <b>greenhouse</b> dryer coupled with the biomass heater than that of the dryer without the biomass heater is due to the effect of biomass heater that is responsible for the constant increase in temperature inside the dryer which is made possible by supplying sufficient heat during the night time (after 5 PM) where there would be a drop in sunshine. Also, the quality of the grapes obtained from the <b>solar</b> tunnel <b>greenhouse</b> dryer coupled with biomass heater was found to be superior to that of the grapes obtained from the <b>solar</b> tunnel <b>greenhouse</b> dryer without the biomass heater which is due to the high temperature and low relative humidity prevailed all the time inside the dryer irrespective of fall in sunshine.

40|$|The {{extremely}} cold outdoor {{temperatures in}} winter {{continue to be}} a barrier for the greenhouse growers. In Saskatoon, for example, it is less than - 31. 5 ℃ for 1 % of the year (ASHRAE, 2013). This limits the growth of the greenhouse industry in Saskatchewan which has around 250 billion square meters of farmland, and accounts for 38. 5 % Canada’s farm area (Statistics Canada, 2016). Due to this fact, most traditional Canadian greenhouses in the Canadian Prairies shut down during the coldest months (from November to February) because of heavy heating bills. However, the local demand for food in the winter has been increasing in Saskatchewan due to a rise in population and consciousness of healthy food. If compare traditional local greenhouses with other greenhouse production techniques, Chinese mono-slope solar greenhouses do not primarily rely on supplemental heating. They rely on solar energy to maintain the indoor temperature. Fortunately, Saskatchewan has the most hours of sunshine annually in Canada which theoretically provides a favorable environment for the establishment and development of mono-slope solar greenhouses (Environment Canada, 2017). This also greatly reduces heating costs. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the thermal environment and predict the energy consumption of <b>solar</b> <b>greenhouse</b> production in Saskatchewan. This was done using an existing simulation model RGWSRHJ that was developed by Chengwei Ma in China (Ma, 2015). Several modifications were made to make the model SOGREEN that is suitable for the cold climate in Saskatchewan. These modifications included meteorological year data invoking, advanced front roof covering, summer solar screen, and so on. Later, the modified simulation model SOGREEN was validated using field data that were collected in a <b>solar</b> <b>greenhouse</b> in Elie, Manitoba. <b>Solar</b> <b>greenhouse</b> production was simulated under the weather conditions in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Finally, the energy consumption was analyzed using the simulated data to select the most suitable and economical energy resource for <b>solar</b> <b>greenhouse</b> production in cold regions. From the validation results, there were 9. 6 % and 13. 7 % discrepancies in the model’s predictions of indoor temperature and relative humidity, respectively. This has demonstrated that the modified model could simulate the thermal environment of a <b>solar</b> <b>greenhouse</b> with a relatively high accuracy. While the simulation results confirmed that a large amount of energy was used for supplying heat from November to March, there was almost no supplemental heat needed between April and August. This illustrated that solar greenhouses can fully utilize the solar energy, dramatically reducing the annual energy consumption. From an energy cost analysis, $ 26378. 56, $ 2498. 51 and $ 2610. 00 was spent for supplemental heat with electricity, natural gas, and coal. Therefore, among these three energy resources, natural gas was the most affordable and most environmentally friendly option for greenhouse production. Compared with the natural gas expenses of Grandora Gardens, vegetable production in a <b>solar</b> <b>greenhouse</b> can save as much as 83. 6 % in energy costs.
