40|$|International audienceA {{horizontal}} digging of 35 m 2 on {{the archaeological}} deposit of Koussane allowed the excavation of iron-making remains in relation with a direct reduction operation of siliceous iron ore. Two fragments of charcoal {{included in a}} slag give an age C 14 of 1715 ± 55 BP {{in agreement with the}} chronostratigraphy. The furnace used for this operation consisted of a slightly hemispherical shallow pit with a cell built with coils and coated with clay. Both the shape and the height of this superstructure are indeterminable from remains. A nozzle, arranged obliquely through the body of the oven and associated with bellows, favoured the formation of an <b>iron</b> <b>sponge</b> above the liquid slag as revealed by metallographic examinations. This latter solidified in the pit in a 90 kg block, and subequently the construction in elevation was moved two to three meters to allow the removal of the <b>iron</b> <b>sponge.</b> The chemical analyses made on the ore and on the slag lead to an estimate for the mass of raw metal produced of around 11, 5 kg...|$|R

40|$|YesThe {{effects of}} 0 · 5 wt-%Mo {{addition}} on the processing, microstructure, {{and strength of}} PM Fe¿ 3 · 5 Mn¿ 0 · 7 C steel are described. Water atomised and <b>sponge</b> <b>irons,</b> Astaloy 1 · 5 Mo, milled ferromanganese, and graphite were the starting powders. During sintering in 75 H 2 / 25 N 2 or pure hydrogen the dewpoint was controlled and monitored; in particular the effects of improving it from - 35 to - 60 °C were investigated. Faster heating rates (20 K min- 1), sufficient gas flowrates, milling the ferro alloy under nitrogen, a low dewpoint (<- 60 °C), and a getter powder can all contribute to the reduction or prevention of oxidation of the manganese, in particular formation of oxide networks in the sintered steels. For 600 MPa compaction pressure densities up to 7 · 1 g cm- 3 were obtained; these were not significantly affected by sintering at temperatures up to 1180 °C. The sintered microstructures were sensitively dependent on the cooling rate. Irrespective {{of the presence of}} Mo, slow furnace cooling at 4 K min- 1 resulted in mainly pearlitic structures with some ferrite and coarse bainite, whereas fast cooling at 40 K min- 1 produced martensite and some retained austenite, very fine pearlite, bainite, and some ferrite. Young's modulus, determined by tensile and ultrasonic tests, was in the range 110 ¿ 155 GPa. Sintering with - 60 °C dewpoint resulted in tensile and transverse rupture strengths of 420 and 860 MPa for the Mn steel, rising to 530 and 1130 MPa {{as a result of the}} Mo addition. This contrasts with strength decreases observed when processing included use of high oxygen containing ferromanganese and sintering with - 35 °C dewpoint...|$|R

40|$|The two-part {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine currently available H 2 S removal technologies suitable for use with farm biogas systems, and to test the feasibility of utilizing on-farm cow-manure compost as an H 2 S adsorption medium. Integrated farm energy systems utilize anaerobic digesters to provide a waste treatment solution, improved nutrient recovery, and energy generation potential in the form of biogas, which consists mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of water vapor, and trace amounts of H 2 S and other impurities. Hydrogen sulfide usually must be removed before the gas can be used for generation of electricity or heat. Biogas has remained a virtually untapped resource in the United States due to many factors, including relatively high gas processing costs. There are many chemical, physical, and biological methods currently available for removal of H 2 S from an energy gas stream. Dry based chemical processes have traditionally been used for biogas applications and remain competitive based on capital and media costs. <b>Iron</b> <b>Sponge,</b> Media-G 2 ®, and potassium-hydroxide...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of Greek bauxite residue through reduction roasting and magnetic separation is investigated. A sample of Greek bauxite residue, hematite being the predominant iron carrier mineral, {{is subjected to}} reduction roasting to produce a calcine with intensive magnetic properties where magnetite or metallic iron are the main iron mineral phases. The calcine is then subjected to wet magnetic separation so that the magnetic product can be utilized as a feed for <b>sponge</b> or cast <b>iron</b> production. The effect of parameters such as temperature, intensity of reducing conditions, intensity of magnetic field or dispersing agent addition rate on the result of both processes is investigated. It was indicated that reductive roasting at 500 °C followed by wet magnetic separation of the calcine produced at low current intensity (0. 04 A) and simultaneous addition of a dispersant resulted {{in the production of}} a magnetic product with iron content as high as 36 %.

40|$|Hydrogen is {{expected}} to become an important energy carrier for sustainable energy production, transformation and consumption with reduced impacts on the local and global environment. Development of hydrogen based energy and transport systems needs reliable and inexpensive methods of relatively pure hydrogen production, storage and supply. Iron as a common metal was suggested for hydrogen production by reaction with steam at higher temperatures [1]. The basic principle of the cyclic <b>iron</b> <b>sponge</b> process is to reduce iron oxides with the reducing gases (H 2, CO, CH 4 etc.) utilizing metallurgic knowledge of iron oxides reduction and to oxidize the iron by steam for hydrogen supply. In this process a syngas (e. g. from biomass gasification [2]) or a gas mixture from steam reforming of hydrocarbon fuels can be converted into relatively pure hydrogen [3]. The main disadvantage of iron in the redox cyclic process of hydrogen production is, however, the possibility of soot, Fe 3 C and FeCO 3 formation in the reduction process by CO and CO 2 containing gases. Such carbon precursors lead {{to the production of}} hydrogen with carbon containing impurities in the steam oxidation step. Relatively cheap and common alloying elements Cr, Ni and Mn have been chosen for the basic thermodynamic study with respect to compatibility with iron and lower tendency for carbide and carbonate formation.

40|$|Electric {{generation}} and transmission systems {{may not always}} meet peak demands. However, when the total demand {{is more than the}} generation, overall demand must be lowered, either by turning off service to some devices or cutting back the supply voltage in order to prevent uncontrolled service disruptions such as power outages or equipment damage. Utilities may impose load shedding on service areas via rolling blackouts or by agreements with specific high use industrial consumers to turn off equipment at times of system-wide peak demand. However it is quite different when this is applied on microgrids. Since microgrid is normally isolated from the main transmission line, therefore they have their own generation which is the distributed generation (DGs). DGs resources can include fuels cells, wind, solar or other energy sources. Distributed generation allows collection of energy from many sources and may give lower environmental impacts and improved security of supply. The multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power. Therefore, differential evolution (DE) is applied in a microgrid system in order to optimize the load shedding by reducing the total curtailed load. Direct Reduction (DR) Plant in Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd. has its own microgrid system which is used to produce direct reduction <b>iron</b> (<b>iron</b> <b>sponge).</b> Load shedding is one of the security measures which are applied in the plant in to maintain the stability of the system. After the load shedding process, more cost is needed to restore the curtailed load. However, cost will be reduced if the total curtailed loads which are needed to be restored are reduced. Therefore DE is applied to reduce the total curtailed load in the DR Plant microgrid system...|$|R
