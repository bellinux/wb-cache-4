40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa; Pleuronectidae) is {{considered}} the most important flatfish for fisheries in Europe. Overall catches have been reduced drastically throughout the past decades, indicating a severe decline in the natural populations. However, a limited set of genetic tools are available to improve stock assessment and management for the <b>species.</b> Sequences of <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> and its congener, the winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) deposited in the public database were searched for short tandem repeats. Out of 22 loci derived from database sequences, eight were amplified successfully and genotyping of 23 wild-caught individuals showed expected heterozygosities ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 84. The average allele number was 4. 75 per locus (range 2 – 11). Successful cross-species amplification of the markers was demonstrated from two related flatfishes. All eight markers were successfully amplified from the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), a phylogenetically closely related species, whereas three of them worked in Achiroides melanorhynchus, an endemic species of Southeast Asia for which no microsatellites have been described to date...|$|R

40|$|In {{the food}} industry, {{hypochlorite}} {{is used to}} reduce the microbiological load of foodstuffs. Its use may result {{in the formation of}} toxic disinfection byproducts. However it is currently generally accepted that below particular intensities its use does not represent a safety concern even in direct contact with foods. In addition however, the use of hypochlorite in contact with foods should also be considered in the framework of consumer acceptance. The formation of 3 -chlorotyrosine seems a potential analytical target to assess the use of hypochlorite in foods. Firstly, the potency of 3 -chlorotyrosine was evaluated as an indicator for the use of hypochlorite in contact with foods in comparison with the other molecular changes in proteins using casein and whey proteins as a model at various oxidant/protein ratios and at different pHs. Secondly, 3 -chlorotyrosine formation was evaluated in four fish <b>species</b> (whiting, <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> gilthead seabream and Atlantic salmon) as a result of hypochlorite dipping. The last set of experiments studied the formation and occurrence of 3 -chlorotyrosine in ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables on the Belgian market. In addition, the dietary exposure via RTE vegetable consumption for Belgian and Spanish populations, exemplifying Northern European lower RTE vegetable consumption and Mediterranean higher consumption patterns, was estimated. This study has demonstrated, for the first time, that 3 -chlorotyrosine is a potential marker to detect the use of hypochlorite disinfectants in fish fillets and vegetables. The levels of 3 -chlorotyrosine not only depend on the level of hypochlorite used, but also on the pH, the type of protein and its tyrosine content. This study is the very first to assess the dietary exposure of populations to 3 -chlorotyrosine through the consumption of RTE vegetables. Overall, the results indicated that even a small amount of hypochlorite in the washing water can generate relevant concentrations of 3 -chlorotyrosine in the treated vegetable. On the basis of this study, concerns with respect to the impact of the use of hypochlorite on chemical food safety are identified...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) is a right-eyed {{flounder}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. They are a commercially important flatfish which lives on the sandy bottoms of the European shelf. They range geographically from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean. <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> are characterised by their smooth brown skin, with distinctive red spots and bony ridge behind the eyes. They feed on polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves {{and can be found}} at depths up to 200 metres. At night they move into shallow waters to feed, and during the day they bury themselves in the sand. Their maximum recorded length is 100 cm (39.4 inches), and maximum reported age 50 years.|$|R

5000|$|Like the <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> the American plaice {{is a right}} eyed {{flatfish}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. American plaice are an Atlantic species, which range from southern Labrador to Rhode Island. They are also found in Europe, where they are called rough dab or long rough dab. They spawn in the Gulf of Maine, with peak activity in April and May. They are brown or reddish, and are generally smaller than <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> with a rougher skin and larger scales. Their maximum recorded length is 82.6 cm (32.5 inches), and maximum reported age 30 years. They are usually found between depths of 90 metres and 250 metres, on sandy bottoms with temperatures between -0.5 and 2.5°C. They feed on small fishes and invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> is characterised above {{by their}} dark green to dark brown skin, blotched with conspicuous, but irregularly distributed, orange spots.

50|$|The European {{flounder}} is {{used for}} human consumption but is not so highly esteemed as the <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> or common sole (Solea solea). The most important fisheries are in the Baltic Sea and the waters around the Netherlands and Denmark. In 2010, the total world catch was about nineteen thousand tonnes, mostly caught by bottom trawling. The fish is marketed fresh and frozen and can be fried, boiled, steamed, baked or microwaved.|$|R
50|$|The genus Lymphocystivirus {{has only}} one species: Lymphocystis disease virus 1 (LCDV-1), but Lymphocystis disease virus 2 (LCD-2) is another virus that has been {{proposed}} as a second member. LCDV-1 infects European flounder Platichthys flesus and <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa). LCDV-2 infects the common dab (Limanda limanda). A third species Lymphocystis disease virus C has also been proposed based on the relative lack of sequence similarity of an isolate from the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceous) to LCDV-1 and LCDV-2.|$|R
50|$|Hybrids {{are well}} known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have {{the largest number of}} {{reported}} hybrids. Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (Parophrys vetulus) and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.|$|R
50|$|Hediste diversicolor is {{widespread}} and common and is eaten by {{many species of}} birds and fish.

40|$|Since {{about ten}} years DNA microarrays are {{indispensable}} tools for genomic and biomedical research. They are used predominantly for expression profiling but are increasingly employed {{for the analysis of}} complex environmental samples. This thesis presents the development of a DNA microarray prototype for the identification of gadoid and flatfish species from the southern North Sea. First of all partial sequences of mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and 16 S rRNA genes were determined for adult gadoid and flatfish specimens. Based on COI and 16 S rDNA alignments capture oligonucleotide probes were selected, spotted onto glass slides and the resulting DNA microarrays were tested successfully with fish samples. COI DNA sequences showed sufficient sequence variability for the selection of capture probes even for the discrimination of closely related fish species, e. g. flounder and <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> whereas 16 S rDNA sequences were too conserved within the families Pleuronectidae and Gadidae to select species specific probes, but were very suitable for the selection of probes for Soleidae and Scophthalmidae species, due to the presence of highly variable regions. The evaluation of 34 COI probes for the identification of Atlantic cod, whiting, flounder, dab, <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> American plaice, lemon sole and common sole and 10 16 S rDNA probes for turbot, brill, common sole and solenette resulted in 34 species specific, 6 false negative and 4 cross reacting probes. Signal strength varied considerably among all probes and was correlated with the position of the probe binding region and influenced by the concentration of the target DNA and the presence of non target DNA. LNA-modified COI probes showed in some cases improvements concerning the specificity and the sensitivity but altogether increased the proportion of false negative or cross reacting probes. Some probes with HEG 2 spacers exhibited increased signal intensities but spacers also resulted in cross hybridizations...|$|R

A strikingly marked large rock {{on the western side}} of the bay called Cross Rock used to be a popular spot to fish at high tide in the summer months with float and soft crab as bait. Catches included bass, sea bream and dogfish. Langland Point held similar promise, but the use of spinners or feathers here sometimes delivered mackerel as well as bass. Occasional Common dab and <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> were caught with lugworm or ragworm from the beach, although the worm population of the beach has always been small.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Six {{flatfish}} {{species were}} collected by trawling at five locations in the inner and middle Oslofjord between February and December in 2013. In total 386 individuals were sampled. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to identify the infection of Hysterothylacium aduncum and Cucullanus heterochrous. Only three species contained these parasites: American <b>plaice</b> (Hippoglossoides platessoides), <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) and Witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus). Also the condition, age distribution and weight-length relationship was measured on these fish species. There was a geographical difference in the percentage of infected fish between the middle and inner part of the Oslofjord, as most nematodes were found in the middle part of the fjord. American plaice was the most abundant species and also the most infected specie. Two decades ago this species was not a known host, but during the last years this species has become an important host in the fjord. Hysterothylacium aduncum infected all three fish species with large abundances in the middle Oslofjord. It seems that H. aduncum has been in an increasing trend over the last two decades. American plaice starts to mature at 2 and 3 years, and these age groups were most infected. Females were more infected than males. There was no correlation between the length of the nematodes and the condition of the host. Cucullanus heterochrous was found in the inner Oslofjord, and this is only the second time this nematode has been reported in the inner part of the fjord, and both times it was found in <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> and American...|$|R

50|$|Stomach {{sampling}} {{studies have}} discovered that small Atlantic cod feed primarily on crustaceans, while large Atlantic cod feed primarily on fish. In certain regions, the main food source is decapods with fish as a complementary food item in the diet. Wild Atlantic cod throughout the North Sea depend, to a large extent, on commercial fish species also used in fisheries, such as Atlantic mackerel, haddock, whiting, Atlantic herring, <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> and common sole, making fishery manipulation of cod significantly easier. Ultimately, food selection by cod {{is affected by the}} food item size relative to their own size.

40|$|Recent EU {{directives}} {{and regulations}} for quality control and authentication of food products have prompted {{the development of}} new methods for large-scale tests to ensure the protection of consumers. In view of this, an innovative method based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has been developed and successfully applied to fish authentication. Highly specific mass spectrometric profiles from 25 different fish species were obtained. Signals generated from proteins with molecular weights of about 11 kDa have been selected as specific biomarkers for unambiguous discrimination. This method is also suitable for verifying commercial product authenticity and to rapidly discriminate species subjected to fraudulent substitutions, such as those belonging to Gadidae and Pleuronectiformes. For example, biomarkers for fillets of sole (m/z 11975. 21), <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (m/z 11351. 73, 11763. 63) and Greenland halibut (m/z 11432. 38) were defined.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{noise is}} a {{recognized}} global pollutant {{that could potentially}} impact many organisms, including fishes. One of the acoustic sources producing high impulsive noise and vibration is pile driving. However, the potential impacts of real pile driving on fish species has received little attention, mainly due to the logistical challenges involved. Here, we investigated the impact of pile driving on the oxygen uptake (a secondary stress response) of black seabream Spondyliosoma cantharus and <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> Pleuronectes platessa using an experimental pile driver setup in a flooded ship-building dock. Each individual fish was tested in ambient and pile driving conditions using a counterbalanced paired design to control for potential order effects. During pile driving, black seabream increased oxygen uptake compared to the ambient control condition suggesting higher stress levels. Plaice did not show differences in oxygen consumption between the pile driving and ambient treatment. These results show the impact of pile driving on secondary stress responses in fish, highlight species-specific differences concerning acoustical impacts, and showcase the possibility of carrying out large-scale semi-field acoustic experiments...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, a self-sampling {{programme}} {{was organized}} in the Netherlands, fishers sampling ca. 80 kg of discards from randomly selected bottom trawls in the North Sea. A statistical procedure is proposed to highlight samples, trips (with multiple samples), or vessels (which may have multiple trips within a year) where extreme mean lengths of discarded fish were observed. Randomization methods were used to test for evidence of non-randomness in patterns of highlighted discard samples, e. g. repeated observations of extreme mean lengths for consecutive discard samples across trips from the same vessel. <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) were considered because these were the most abundant species {{in most of the}} discard samples. A linear mixed model was used to estimate randomsample effects on the estimated mean lengths by species. These random effects were incorporated into uni- and bivariate procedures to identify extreme samples that were summed for each vessel, and the probability of observing such numbers was estimated.
