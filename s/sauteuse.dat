5000|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, {{numerous}} different waltz forms existed, including versions performed in , [...] or [...] (<b>sauteuse),</b> and [...] time ( [...] waltz, half and half) ...|$|E
50|$|Pan frying, sautéing and stir-frying involve cooking {{foods in}} {{a thin layer of}} fat on a hot surface, such as a frying pan, griddle, wok, or <b>sauteuse.</b> Stir frying {{involves}} frying quickly at very high temperatures, requiring that the food be stirred continuously to prevent it from adhering to the cooking surface and burning.|$|E
5000|$|A {{versatile}} pan {{that combines}} {{the best of}} both the sauté pan and the frying pan has higher, sloping sides that are often slightly curved. This pan is called a <b>sauteuse</b> (literally a sauté pan in the female gender), an evasée (denoting a pan with sloping sides), or a fait-tout (literally [...] "does everything"). Most professional kitchens have several of these utensils in varying sizes.|$|E

No one knows what I {{suffered}} at Madame <b>Sauteuse's,</b> where I learnt to dance and make presentation-curtseys, and other dreadful things--or at least where they tried to teach me. Ma can do it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The Waltz {{was first}} {{imported}} to England around 1810, {{but it was}} not considered socially acceptable until continental visitors at the post-Napoleonic-Wars celebrations danced it in London—and even then it remained the subject of anti-waltz diatribes, caricatures, and jokes. Even the decadent Lord Byron was scandalized by the prospect of people [...] "embracing" [...] on the dance floor. The Regency version is relatively slow, and done up on the balls of the feet with the arms in a variety of graceful positions. The <b>Sauteuse</b> is a leaping waltz commonly done in 2/4 rather than 3/4 time, similar in pattern (leap-glide-close) to the Redowa and Waltz Galop of the later nineteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{contains}} {{the two main}} genres Morrison used on Tupelo Honey: country rock and soul. The introduction features both electric and steel guitars, in what Allmusic reviewer Tom Maginnis calls [...] "a halting country vamp". The song changes tempo many times in its {{six and a half}} minute duration, changing from a fast 4/4 time to a slow 6/8 <b>sauteuse</b> waltz and back to 4/4 time on various occasions. Morrison uses this form of distinct movements within songs later in his career, most prominently on the album Common One. Tom Maginnis concludes {{that at the end of}} the song [...] "the arrangement kicks into a full-scale gospel rave-up complete with call and response backing vocal, group handclaps, pumping piano, and blaring horns all at breakneck speeds before pulling up to a slamming halt." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 16 October 1798, Récamier {{bought two}} vast {{properties}} formerly belonging to Jacques Necker {{on what was}} then rue du Mont-Blanc (corresponding to the present-day 7 rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin) for 37383 silver piastres (equivalent to at least 200000 of that era) to avoid the assignat. His wife Juliette gave her first soirées there, [...] "balls whose luxury is extraordinary: the dancers' fans and bouquets are renewed as often as {{the heat of the}} dance alters their freshness and, what is more, shoes are provided, by foresight, unnoticed, by fairies, prevents anyone changing from a gavotte to a <b>sauteuse</b> with a sagging shoe, or from leaving the ball like Cinderella". At the end of 1798 he and the banker Alexandre Barrillon founded Syndicat du Commerce, a bank based on rue du Mont-Blanc. Barillon was quite close to him and was his partner in various matters related to the Spanish and Montpellier wool trade - they also both supplied the French army.|$|E
