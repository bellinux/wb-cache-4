40|$|AbstractThis article {{proposes a}} tandem cascade {{constructed}} {{to tackle the}} thorny problem of designing the high-loaded stator with a supersonic inflow and a large turning angle. The front cascade adopts a <b>supersonic</b> <b>profile</b> to reduce the shock wave intensity turning the flow into subsonic, while the rear cascade adopts a subsonic profile with a large camber offering the flow a large turning angle. It is disclosed that the losses would be minimized if {{the leading edge of}} the rear cascade lies close to the pressure side of the front cascade at a distance of 20 % pitch in pitch-wise direction without either axial spacing or overlapping in axial direction. The 2 D numerical test results show that, with the inflow Mach number of 1. 25 and the turning angle of 52 °, the total pressure loss coefficient of the tandem cascade reaches 0. 106, and the diffusion factor 0. 745. Finally, this article has designed and simulated a high-loaded fan stage with the proposed tandem stator, which has the pressure ratio of 3. 15 and the efficiency of 86. 32 % at the rotor tip speed of 495. 32 m/s...|$|E

50|$|Supersonic {{aerodynamics}} is {{simpler than}} subsonic aerodynamics because the airsheets {{at different points}} along the plane often can't affect each other. Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra aerodynamic drag experienced within the transonic region (around Mach 0.85-1.2). At these speeds aerospace engineers can gently guide air around the fuselage of the aircraft without producing new shock waves but any change in cross area farther down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body. Designers use the Supersonic area rule and the Whitcomb area rule to minimize sudden changes in size.However, in practical applications, a supersonic aircraft will have to operate stably in both subsonic and <b>supersonic</b> <b>profiles,</b> hence aerodynamic design is more complex.|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that {{satellite}} data are useful for obtaining ice thickness distribution for perennial sea ice or in stable thin sea ice areas, it is still an unresolved issue for the seasonal sea ice zone (SIZ). In this study, we approach the problem of ice thickness retrieval by using L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In the SIZ, ice thickness growth is closely related to the ridging activity and therefore surface roughness is expected to be correlated with ice thickness. L-band SAR is suitable for detecting such surface roughness, and therefore {{is expected to be a}} good tool for obtaining thickness distribution. To verify this idea, we conducted ship-borne electromagnetic (EM) inductive sounding and <b>supersonic</b> <b>profiling</b> observations with an icebreaker, coordinated with airborne L-band SAR observations in the southern Sea of Okhotsk in February 2005. The surface elevation was estimated by representing the ship's motion with a low-pass filter. Backscattering coefficients correlated well with ice thickness and surface roughness, defined by standard deviation of surface elevation. This result sheds light on the possibility of determining ice thickness distribution in the SIZ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of giant shells or loops in giant HII regions are clear witness {{of the mechanical}} energy input from massive stars. Here we evaluate the impact that winds may have {{on the structure of}} giant nebulae and on their supersonic velocity dispersion. We follow the suggestion from Chu & Kennicutt (1994) to see if a combination {{of a large number of}} unresolved wind-driven shells caused by massive stars could produce the integrated broad Gaussian profiles typical of giant HII regions. The results, accounting for a wide range of energies, densities and velocity or age of the expanding shells, show that <b>supersonic</b> Gaussian <b>profiles</b> may arise only from a collection of unresolved wind-driven shells if the shells present a peculiar velocity distribution which implies a strongly peaked age distribution leading to an awkward star formation history. On the other hand, a uniform distribution of ages originates profiles with a flat-topped core defined by the terminal shell velocity and a steep decay as v^- 6 up to the largest detectable shell speed. Thus, <b>supersonic</b> <b>profiles</b> can arise only if the final speed of the unresolved shells is supersonic. This implies an equally supersonic random speed of motions in the ionized gas disrupting the shells before they slow down to subsonic speeds. It also implies a mechanism, independent of the shells caused by massive stars, responsible for the supersonic stirring of the background medium. These facts together with the conditions for shells to remain unresolved to present day devices (energies, final speeds and ages), indicate that the winds may be produced by low-mass stars. In this latter case, if the sources move supersonically in the gravitational potential of the whole system they could stir the gas, with thei...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the well-posedness/ill-posedness and {{regularity}} of stationary {{solutions to the}} hydrodynamic model of semiconductors represented by Euler-Poisson equations with sonic boundary. When the doping profile is subsonic, we prove that, the steady-state equations with sonic boundary possess a unique interior subsonic solution, {{and at least one}} interior supersonic solution, and if the relaxation time is large and the doping profile is a small perturbation of constant, then the equations admit infinitely many transonic shock solutions, while, if the relaxation time is small enough and the doping profile is a subsonic constant, then the equations admits infinitely many C^ 1 smooth transonic solutions, and no transonic shock solution exists. When the doping <b>profile</b> is <b>supersonic,</b> we show that the system does not hold any subsonic solution, furthermore, the system doesn't admit any supersonic solution or any transonic solution if such a <b>supersonic</b> doping <b>profile</b> is small or the relaxation time is small, but it has at least one supersonic solution and infinitely many transonic solutions if the <b>supersonic</b> doping <b>profile</b> is close to the sonic line and the relaxation time is large. The interior subsonic/supersonic solutions all are global C^ 1 / 2 Hölder-continuous, and the exponent 1 / 2 is optimal. The non-existence of any type solutions in the case of small doping profile or small relaxation time indicates that the semiconductor effect for the system is remarkable and cannot be ignored. The proof for the existence of subsonic/supersonic solutions is the technical compactness analysis combining the energy method and the phase-plane analysis, while the approach for the existence of multiple transonic solutions is artfully constructed. The results obtained significantly improve and develop the existing studies. Comment: 65 pages, 7 figures. Any comments are welcom...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. An approximate method is presented which yields the <b>supersonic</b> nozzle <b>profile</b> {{necessary to keep}} an expanding high temperature gas mixture approximately in chemical equilibriurrio From equilibrium calculations for given chamber conditions, the freeze area ratio is determined by use of a modified Bray criterion. A plot of area ratio versus a function of nozzle geometry defines a limiting nozzle angle beyond which freezing is forecast to occur. This permits an expansion angle at each area ratio to be chosen to keep the flow near equilibrium. The effectiveness of the resulting nozzle profile is evaluated by comparing exact calculations with equilibrium calculations. Contouring is shown to be effective for small nozzles when a correction factor is applied. The hydrogen-oxygen system is used as an example. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continuing}} study {{of the effects of}} thermal spike on composite physical properties, severals sets of 16 -ply TGDDM-DDS epoxy/graphite fiber composites were first saturated with moisture, and then individual specimens were subjected to thermal spikes of up to 240 C for periods of up to 25 minutes. At the cure temperature, 177 C, all sets show a change in rate of mass lost during spike. Post-spike moisture reabsorption capacity data provides evidence of temperature dependent molecular structural dilation and consolidation of the epoxide matrix. This evidence suggests that either a thermoreversible phenomenon such as physical aging or a nonreversible additional cure becomes active near the upper limit of the aircraft <b>supersonic</b> flight <b>profile.</b> These and other important observations suggest that one or more of several mechanisms may be active during thermal spike...|$|R

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{transition}} {{in the wall}} boundary layers of two axisymmetric Mach 5 wind-tunnel nozzles has been measured under conditions of extremely low incident disturbance levels. The range of test unit Reynolds numbers, based on conditions at the nozzle exit, was from 6 x 10 to the 6 th power m to 2. 5 x 10 to the 7 th power m. When the nozzle walls were maintained in a polished and clean condition, transition moved gradually upstream as the test Reynolds number was increased. When transition occurred in the supersonic concave wall region, {{the values of the}} local Gortler parameter at transition varied from about 5 to 6, whereas the momentum thickness Reynolds number varied from about 750 to 1050. Oil flow patterns obtained near the exit of the nozzles indicated that Gortler vortices were always present when the wall boundary layers were laminar. Calculations for the growth of Gortler vortices based on new results from linear theory for <b>supersonic</b> flat-plate <b>profiles</b> gave amplification ratios to transition from e to the 4 th power to e to the 15 th power. Possible reasons for this wide range in amplification ratios are discussed, but no definite conclusions are yet possible regarding the values of n in a simple e to the nth power type theory for the assumed linear amplification of Gortler vortices to transition in supersonic nozzles...|$|R
40|$|The {{instability}} wave {{noise generation}} model {{is used to}} study the instability waves in the two shear layers of an inverted velocity <b>profile,</b> <b>supersonic,</b> coaxial jet and the noise radiated from the dominant wave.

Calculations are made for the stability characteristics in the coaxial jet shear layers and the noise radiated from the instability waves for different operating conditions with the same total thrust, mass flow and exit area as a single reference jet.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{kinematic}} properties of the ionized gas in the dominant giant HII region of the well known HII galaxy: II Zw 40. High spatial and spectral resolution spectroscopy has been obtained using IFU mode on the GMOS instrument at Gemini-North telescope. We have used a set of kinematics diagnostic diagrams, such as the intensity vs. velocity dispersion intensity vs. radial velocity, for global and individual analysis in sub-regions of the nebula. We aim to separate the main line broadening mechanisms responsible for producing a smooth <b>supersonic</b> integrated line <b>profile</b> for the giant HII region. The brightest central region (R ~ 50 pc) is responsible for sigma derived from a single fit to the integrated line profile. The dominant action of gravity, and possibly unresolved winds of young (< 10 Myr) massive stars, in this small region should be responsible for the characteristic Halpha velocity profile of the starburst region as a whole. Our observations show that the complex structure of the interstellar medium of this galactic scale star-forming region is very similar to that of nearby extragalactic giant HII regions in the Local Group galaxies.
