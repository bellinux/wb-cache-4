25|$|Shi Yi {{was known}} for leading a frugal and humble lifestyle. Unlike many other officials, he did not {{accumulate}} wealth for his family and never accepted financial aid from others. He was content with having only basic necessities. Sun Quan once went {{on a tour of}} Shi Yi's neighbourhood and saw a large mansion. When he asked who the owner of the mansion was, <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> him it was Shi Yi. However, Sun Quan said that it was definitely not Shi Yi, given his lifestyle. He was proven right. Shi Yi wore very simple clothing and had simple meals every day. He also enjoyed helping the needy so he often donated or gave away his personal savings to the poor. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Shi Yi's house and sampled the meals Shi Yi had every day. After the visit, he increased Shi Yi's salary, gave him more rewards and a larger plot of land. However, Shi Yi rejected these rewards and gifts and said that he would feel uneasy if he accepted them.|$|E

In it, he tells his staff that at a White House dinner, <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> him that on Yom Kippur Jews ask God for forgiveness, but [...] "on the day before" [...] Yom Kippur, called Erev Yom Kippur, Jews ask forgiveness from one another. The president remarks that [...] "you can't ask forgiveness of God until you've asked forgiveness of people on the day before." ...|$|E

500|$|Some people {{mentioned}} that the album's title, Memory Almost Full, is an anagram of [...] "for my soulmate LLM" [...] (the initials of Linda Louise McCartney). When asked if this was intentional, McCartney replied; [...] "Some things are best left a mystery". In an interview with Pitchfork Media, McCartney clarified, [...] "I must say, <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> me , and I think it's a complete mystery, because it's so complete. There {{does appear to be}} an anagram in the title. And it's a mystery. It was not intentional." [...] The album's title was actually inspired by a message that came up on his mobile phone. He thought the phrase summed up modern life.|$|E
500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly preferred the album's Southern hip hop over [...] "Arrested Development's suspiciously peppy, idealized version of down-home" [...] and stated, [...] "it's about time <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> today's weed-obsessed youth to 'get up, {{get out and}} get something/Don't spend all your time trying to get high.'" [...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times cited [...] "Git Up, Git Out" [...] as the album's highlight and commended the duo's [...] "sauntering, hard-core tales of the 'hood", writing that they [...] "bristle with clever humor and sharp insights rather than rage." [...] Rob Marriott of The Source complimented the duo's [...] "organic" [...] P-Funk influence and praised their lyrics' honesty, commenting that [...] "while their rhyme style may swing {{a little too close}} to Hiero for my comfort, what really makes this album so listenable is that... truthfulness reigns." [...] However, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating in his consumer guide for The Village Voice.|$|E
500|$|In the AIA Guide to Chicago, the Ponds are {{identified}} {{as part of the}} [...] "circle of young architects", including Frank Lloyd Wright, that was responsible for [...] "transforming the concepts of the Arts & Crafts movement into the indigenous Prairie [...] School." [...] Pond was a contemporary, and in some ways rival, of Wright in the Chicago architectural scene of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. [...] Both were members of the Chicago Architectural Club and served as judges and participants in the Club's annual competitions. [...] One biographer of Wright noted that Wright was insulted when the American Institute of Architects in 1912 commissioned a study of midwestern [...] "progressive architecture" [...] and instructed the investigators to examine the work of Louis Sullivan and Pond, but not including Wright. [...] In a letter to Lewis Mumford, Wright expressed his dislike for the [...] "truly-old" [...] Pond:"Yesterday <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> me that truly-old I.K. Pond took exception to your 'Sticks and Stones' because you weren't a 'practicing architect.' [...] What 'practicing architects' know anything at all of architecture anyway, -- even if they could write about it? [...] Certainly not he. [...] He's a dried herring, hanging beneath the eaves or Architecture." ...|$|E

500|$|The album makes {{prominent}} use of {{the voice}} audio processor technology of Auto-Tune. West had previously experimented with the technology on The College Dropout for the background vocals of [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down", {{but he had not}} used it for lead vocals until 2008. [...] "We were working on the remixes for Lil Wayne's 'Lollipop' and Young Jeezy's 'Put On' and {{he fell in love with}} the Auto-Tune", producer Mike Dean explained. Towards the end, West enlisted T-Pain for coaching on how to utilize the technology. West himself openly stated that he loved using Auto-Tune and was dismayed that the term has been commonly associated with being [...] "wack". He considers the technology [...] "the funnest thing to use" [...] and compared the situation to when he was a child and thought the color pink was cool until <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> him [...] "it was gay", producing an analogy of how the views of society can rob people of their confidence and self-esteem. He later went on to state that he enjoyed the electronic feel produced by Auto-Tune and sought out to juxtapose the mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks.|$|E
500|$|Upon his return, {{he found}} that the story {{was not going to be}} used in the current form. Gerrold later said that [...] "I was told that Gene's lawyer did not like the script and felt that this was not a good episode, and so on his advice, it seems, the script was cancelled. That's what I was told by someone who was in a {{position}} to know. I don't have any proof in writing, so I have to qualify it by saying <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> me." [...] Official sources stated that Paramount became involved, and that the company felt the story was inappropriate for younger viewers in the syndicated marketplace and that complaints would be received from parents. The script was given to Herbert Wright to re-write. Roddenberry gave Wright a number notes on the script, who accidentally handed over notes on the script to Gerrold which were written by Roddenberry's lawyer, Leonard Maizlish. Due to the workload on Wright at the time, Gerrold offered to make a first attempt at the re-write with the intention of removing the homosexual characters. However, after initially clearing that with Roddenberry, Wright later received a phone call from him telling Wright not to let Gerrold work on it. Shortly after, Wright received a second call from Maizlish to reinforce the message that Gerrold must not be allowed to work on the script.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E

50|$|In his mass-market {{anthology}} The Portable Henry Rollins, Rollins {{stated that}} he had given 2.13.61 its name because <b>someone</b> had <b>told</b> him that his first self-released book, 20 (1984), {{had to have a}} company name on it, and since he felt {{at the time that he}} would only ever get to release one book, he simply used his birthdate.|$|R
2500|$|Simon Hoggart, {{writing in}} The Guardian, related an anecdote of Soames' childhood: [...] "He {{gave me the}} true version of what I had always {{suspected}} was an apocryphal story. In or around 1953, when Soames was five, he didn't know how important his grandfather was until <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> him.

2500|$|After gaining some {{experience}} in the Ministry of Personnel, Zhuge Dan was then reassigned to be a Palace Assistant Imperial Secretary and Master of Writing (御史中丞尚書). He was close friends with Xiahou Xuan and Deng Yang. They enjoyed much praise from other officials and the citizens in the imperial capital. Later, <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> the Wei emperor Cao Rui that Zhuge Dan and his friends, along with other [...] "celebrities", were engaging in superficial and fame-seeking behaviour. Cao Rui felt disgusted and wanted to discourage such behaviour among his subjects, so he removed Zhuge Dan from office.|$|E
2500|$|McGee is {{very proud}} of past deeds, {{sometimes}} recalling an interesting nickname he picked up over the years. Each one of these nicknames is, as usual with Fibber, a bad pun. When <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> a man named Addison that McGee was a glib talker, McGee became known as [...] "Ad Glib McGee". Or, when Fibber made expressions with his eyes, he was nicknamed [...] "Eyes-a-muggin' McGee" [...] (a play on the popular Stuff Smith swing tune [...] "I'se A-muggin'"). From there Fibber jumps headfirst into a long, breathless and boastful description of his nickname, using an admirable amount of alliteration.|$|E

2500|$|General Canby had {{received}} conflicting orders from Washington {{as to whether}} to make peace or war on the Modoc. [...] As war was not working, the US government authorized a peace commission and assigned Canby a key position on it. There were many lines of communication between the Modoc and whites. At one point, <b>someone</b> <b>told</b> the Modoc leader Captain Jack that the governor of Oregon intended to hang nine Modoc, apparently without trial, {{as soon as they}} surrendered. The Modoc broke off scheduled talks; Canby was angered by the rumors and their action, as he believed that his federal authority trumped the governor's and made the threat irrelevant. Canby had no intention of allowing the Modoc to be punished without a trial.|$|E
2500|$|Responses to the {{restriction}} and ban of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga were generally negative. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund requested that Dan Kanemitsu, a blogger, and a Japanese-to-English translator {{who has worked}} on translating many anime, weigh in on the situation. Kanemitsu criticized the government, saying, [...] "We should always be careful when start to entrust the government with discriminatory polices, be that against people, sexuality, or mediums of self-expression.

[...] Their instructions were very definite. [...] They were all three told that it did not matter whether they got a kick themselves at all in the match, if they only succeeded in spoiling the play of the three South cracks. [...] Those who were present at the match can say how well these instructions were carried out. [...] There was nothing in the tactics adopted that infringed a solitary rule of the game and the plan was singularly effective, but I own to feeling a shade of doubt concerning the manliness of the whole proceeding. [...] I would certainly have preferred to see the representatives of the grand old Melbourne win ... purely upon their superior prowess as players.|$|E

Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals?
