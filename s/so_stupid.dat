25|$|In July 2016, after {{discovering}} that Warren might know about Patrick's {{body in the}} wall, Nancy, along with Darren move Patrick's body into the woods. In August 2016, Darren and Nancy try {{to get rid of}} Warren but are almost caught out by DS Armstrong. Nancy shouts at Darren for being <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> with the plan but in the process, accidentally runs over her friend, John Paul McQueen, making him blind. Nancy later reveals that her leg froze and she couldn't step on the brake, leaving her terrified. In September 2016, Nancy is interviewed over the murder of Patrick, but when she arrives at the school, her leg starts to spasm and she freezes, breaking down in tears, with Louis taking her to the hospital. In January 2017, she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on talking to the Turks, Ribbentrop and Papen became entangled in a feud over Papen's demand that he by-pass Ribbentrop and send his dispatches straight to Hitler. As a former Chancellor, Papen had granted this privilege of by-passing the Foreign Minister while he was Ambassador to Austria. Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, {{as part of the}} effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> that only by shouting at them could one make them understand. One of the consequences of Ribbentrop's heavy-handed behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance of 12 May 1939.|$|E
500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed!

I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|The suits were {{eradicated}} when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL {{to block}} the impending lawsuit, {{on the grounds that}} video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances. The following day, Thompson wrote on his website [...] "I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers would do something <b>so</b> <b>stupid,</b> that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two.

[...] On April 19, 2007, Thompson and Take-Two settled the suit, with Thompson agreeing not to seek any legal restriction on sales of Take-Two's games, threaten to sue the company, or accuse Take-Two of any wrongdoing based on the sale of any of its games.|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it <b>so</b> <b>stupid.</b> I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E

It's wrong. I don't think it's a good idea. But they wanted to bring in somebody else {{as the head of the}} hospital. They wanted his [...] mother to be head of the hospital and his conflicts would be with her and I just didn't think it was right. I didn't want to write it. I just didn't want to do it [...] I didn't. Someone else came in. It was a big thing with the network. They cancelled The Paul Lynde Show and put Paul in Temperatures Rising." ...|$|E

500|$|Comedian Richard Jeni {{performed}} a popular stand-up routine {{based on the}} film. During his routine, Jeni suggested that {{the title of the}} film should have been [...] "Here's a Fish, You're Stupid" [...] instead of the official title (Jaws 4: The Revenge) and called the film itself, [...] "A movie <b>so</b> <b>stupid...</b> You couldn't be stupid enough to enjoy it". Jeni also poked fun at several moments in the film, including Ellen's decision to leave Long Island and go to The Bahamas ("You with me here? An ideal place to avoid a fish [...] " [...] and [...] "Wouldn't an apartment building be sufficient protection?"), her affair with Hoagie right after three of her family members had been killed by the shark ("Ghee whizz, three people in my family have been eaten by a shark in one week... GEEZ AM I HORNY!") and how the shark reached The Bahamas before Ellen & Hoagie ("They land; there he [...] is, couple of beers, Ray-Bans.").|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{a parody of}} the Michael Jackson song [...] "Thriller", {{as well as the}} music video. When Chef becomes a zombie, he is dressed like Jackson from the [...] "Thriller" [...] video, and he and the other zombies dance in a similar way. Chef also shouts [...] "Oh" [...] the same way Jackson often did during music performances. The song Chef sings is also similar to the actual [...] "Thriller" [...] song, but Parker said they deliberately made it [...] "(just) different enough that we can't get sued". Stan is ridiculed for his likeness to Raggedy Andy, based on the rag doll character by children's writer Johnny Gruelle; Stan's girlfriend Wendy was originally supposed to dress as Raggedy Ann with Stan, but she instead chose to dress as Chewbacca. When Cartman later dons a [...] "ghost" [...] costume, it resembles a costume from the Ku Klux Klan, the militant white supremacy organization. Parker and Stone said they feel Klan jokes are particularly funny because the concept of KKK is <b>so</b> <b>stupid.</b> Stone said, [...] "Dressing up like ghosts to scare black people is just stupid. Stupidly funny." [...] The zombie-version of Kenny is said to resemble Edward James Olmos, the American actor who played Lt. Martin Costillo in Miami Vice.|$|E
5000|$|British {{film critic}} Mark Kermode gave the film a {{negative}} review, calling it, [...] "intergalactically stupid". Cinema Blend wrote Inferno is [...] "insufferable. And while you're obviously meant to take Inferno {{with a dash}} of salt, it's <b>so</b> preposterously <b>stupid</b> and dumb that this rancid popcorn flick becomes increasingly nauseating the further you taste." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being <b>so</b> <b>stupid.</b> She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E
500|$|He got {{his first}} job writing for {{television}} on the sitcom Three's Company in 1983. Through his cousin, Mirkin met writer George Tricker who became his mentor. Tricker wrote for the Three's Company spin-off The Ropers so Mirkin wrote a spec script for an episode of The Ropers. Although rejected by the producers of The Ropers, Three's Company creator Bernie West {{was impressed by the}} script and Mirkin began pitching ideas for that series instead. Mirkin pitched to the series' story editors for several years without success because they had very limited script buying power. He was eventually able to pitch to the show's producers, who bought a script from him, and then hired him as a staff writer. Mirkin was apprehensive about the job because he was aiming to work on Cheers, a show more focused on character-driven humor which Mirkin preferred writing, but felt he could not turn the opportunity down. Mirkin considered Three's Company to have [...] "a classic French farce structure", as [...] "the characters were <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> they could never say anything clever." [...] This meant Mirkin had to adapt his preference for character-driven comedy to fit the show; it [...] "forced you to put all the cleverness into the plot, a much more difficult thing to do. The plot had to get all the laughs". Mirkin felt the experience [...] "taught [...] a lot about structure" [...] which greatly aided his later work on character-focused shows.|$|E
500|$|Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian {{stated the}} series is [...] "one of those shiny and insubstantial series," [...] adding that [...] "all that leaping out of bed at dawn on the pretext {{that you have to}} go and sell a house tends to wear thin." [...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected" [...] and stated, [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> it has to be true." [...] Fellow Guardian {{reviewer}} Gareth McLean stated that Spooks is [...] "so good it makes {{you want to be a}} spy." [...] Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak rated the series eight out of ten, calling it [...] "thrilling, dramatic, and fast", while [...] "much more concise" [...] than many American series. Landmann added; [...] "Each story is complex and convincing, plus the scripts are very well written. A lot goes on in each episode, and it's detrimental for a show like this to keep the action and tension going as fast as possible." [...] The reviewer also noted that having only six episodes worked as an advantage over American television, stating [...] "while this seems incredibly short, the idea is actually very good. This ensures that each episode is strong in content and execution. American shows tend to run for 20–25 episodes a season, and while developments occur, there are always the filler episodes. With [...] there is nothing like it, no filler material at all. In fact, the first season sees a lot of development." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "It Must Have Been Love"“This was a song {{trying to}} take the {{opposite}} point of view to most rock bands when it comes to male-female relationships. Most bands go for the clichéd mach ‘been with this woman, been with that woman’ style. I tried to look at it from the woman's angle, which was quite difficult. You get <b>so</b> many <b>stupid</b> blokes boasting about their 'conquests' and nine times out of ten it's just lies.|$|R

[...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected." [...] She also stated [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> it has to be true." [...] Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a [...] "different kind of spy drama" [...] with [...] "a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story you could imagine being told at an MI5 staff social," [...] and [...] "a lot of bullshit too, naturally. This is one of those dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch {{straight}} into an urgent purposive shorthand." [...] Joe Joseph of The Times stated that it [...] "bears a closer resemblance [...] 24," [...] which [...] "shaded the pleasure of this opening episode," [...] but felt {{that by the end of}} the episode, Spooks had [...] "established a voice of its own." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the episode [...] "proved thoroughly entertaining," [...] and praised Wolstencroft's writing, which O'Donovan felt was [...] "confident enough to be playful with its subject - especially regarding Britain's poor-relation relationship with America." [...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times said that after the episode, the series [...] "looks like it's going to be great fun," [...] but [...] "it's presumably not meant to be taken too seriously, because surely life in MI5 can't be this exciting?" ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And just when you think the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Rangel became {{chair of}} the Select Committee on Narcotics, which {{solidified}} his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him. [...] Rangel kept the committee going, {{in the face of}} the usual pressure to disband special committees. [...] He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. [...] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel [...] "a front-line general in the war against drugs." [...] Rangel said [...] "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. [...] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent [...] "moral and political suicide". [...] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were <b>so</b> <b>stupid</b> that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. [...] By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's [...] "Just Say No" [...] campaign had been quite valuable. [...] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. [...] The Washington Post said Rangel was [...] "in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda." [...] He would remain as {{chair of the}} committee through 1993, when it was abolished along with other House select committees.|$|E
