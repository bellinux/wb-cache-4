40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of the relationships between input variables and silicon's behaviour in BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla No. 5 Blast Furnace. Over a period of 13 years stretching from 1991 to 2004, potentially important variables affecting the hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> content of the hot metal produced in the furnace were collected on a daily basis. A process analysis was performed using the data mining program, 'Weka', which is a freeware program developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand. The data collected were altered, and different datasets compiled, in order to analyse the data without interferences and to reveal previously unknown and hidden relationships. A post-pulverized coal injection dataset was compiled to remove historical variations of limited relevance to current operations. An important variable affecting the hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> was found to be the amount of Quartz charged in to the furnace. After finding the importance of Quartz charge, a short term, high frequency dataset was collected and analysed to find the true correlations. Quartz is charged in to the furnace to change the slag basicity, but this project shows that a significant fraction of the Quartz transfers into the hot <b>metal</b> as <b>silicon</b> instead of transferring in to the slag as silica as intended. The original data was compiled into a day-to-day difference dataset where each instance contained a difference between two consecutive days. In the difference dataset analysis, the long term variation was removed and the impacts of operational variables on hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> were revealed. The most significant variable affecting hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> was hot <b>metal</b> temperature. Hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> was corrected by hot metal temperature and the analysis was continued. The analysis showed that the relationship between hot metal sulphur and hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> was not causal, and could be explained by the impact of hot metal temperature. A data mining framework brought valuable new insight into hot <b>metal</b> <b>silicon</b> control in the blast furnace and further effort in this area is strongly recommended.

5000|$|The goal of many {{laboratories}} {{around the}} world is creating semiconductors that can operate faster than current technology. Specifically, electrons within the transistor will be able to actively travel with no collisions. [...] Research shows that with low velocities come unstable electron flow. Thus, when the electrons have a high velocity and long distance over which they can remain ballistic, then {{they will be able to}} travel through semiconductor material without being scattered. Currently, the <b>silicon</b> <b>Metal</b> Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is the main and leading research circuit. However, researchers predict that finding the ideal semiconductor will increase the dimensions of the transistor, even greater than the current silicon. In the early 1960s, there has been speculation that replacing the silicon with metal would increase the energy barrier between electrons and the semiconductor. Scientists now are also currently trying to improve two aspects of the standard transistor. The first is the common emitter, which is an amplifier used as a reference point between the point and collector. Scientists are trying to reduce the width of the emitter, in belief that it would increase the speed of electrons. The second is the base of the transistor. Scientists are trying to make the base as thin as possible, even as thin as 70 nanometers, so that there is a less travel length and time for the electrons through the base. When a device exceeds its permitted power consumption, there will be a leakage current. The ideal transistor should maintain a low to no leakage current. In order for this to happen, the device will have to operate in low temperatures, again meaning that it will have to use very little power. A prototype of the transistor has recently been created by the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility.|$|E
40|$|The method {{concerns}} {{forming a}} relatively stable slip of <b>silicon</b> <b>metal</b> particles and yttrium containing particles. In one embodiment, a casting slip of <b>silicon</b> <b>metal</b> particles is formed in water. Particles of a yttrium containing sintering aid {{are added to}} the casting slip. The yttrium containing sintering aid is a compound which has at least some solubility in water to form Y. sup. + 3 ions which have a high potential for totally flocculating the <b>silicon</b> <b>metal</b> particles into a semiporous solid. A small amount of a fluoride salt is added to the casting slip which contains the yttrium containing sintering aid. The fluoride salt is one which will produce fluoride anions when dissolved in water. The small amount of the fluoride anions produced are effective to suppress the flocculation of the <b>silicon</b> <b>metal</b> particles by the Y. sup. + 3 ions so that all particles remain in suspension in the casting slip and the casting slip has both an increased shelf life and can be used to cast articles having a relatively thick cross-section. The pH of the casting slip is maintained in a range from 7. 5 to 9. Preferably, the fluoride salt used is one which is based on a monovalent cation such as sodium or ammonia. The steps of adding the yttrium containing sintering aid and the fluoride salt may be interchanged if desired, and the salt may be added to a solution containing the sintering aid prior to addition of the <b>silicon</b> <b>metal</b> particles...|$|E
