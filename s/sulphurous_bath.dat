5000|$|Till {{the end of}} World War I in Croatia {{there was}} {{coexistence}} of several art movements and styles, but all avant-garde movements were absent. That is why the greatest artworks of that period were done {{in the spirit of}} 19th-century art. The most important architecture done in Viennas Art Nouveau (also called Sezessionsstil, 'Secessionism') is done at that time. Ethnographic Museum in 1901, Kalina House in 1903, National Library in 1912 were built in Zagreb, while <b>Sulphurous</b> <b>Bath</b> in 1903, and Croatian National Theatre in 1908, were built in Split.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: After stroke, {{spasticity}} {{is often}} the main problem that prevents functional recovery. Pain occurs in up to 70 % of patients {{during the first year}} post-stroke. Materials and methods: A total of 70 patients (30 female and 45 male) mean age (65. 67) participated in prospective, controlled study. Inclusion criteria: ischaemic stroke, developed spasticity of upper limb, post-stroke interval < 6 months. Exclusion criteria: contraindications for balneotherapy and inability to follow commands. Experimental group (Ex) (n= 35) was treated with <b>sulphurous</b> <b>baths</b> (31 ˚- 33 ˚C) and controlled group (Co) with taped water baths, during 21 days. All patients were additionally treate...|$|R
50|$|Amongst the {{exhibits}} relating to Harrogate as a spa town {{are a number}} of recreated treatment rooms using salvaged original fixtures. These dioramas recreate the Hydrotherapy facilities, such as the Vichy bath rooms that were {{to be found in the}} nearby Royal Baths. Visitors can also see a wheeled mahogany bath which was once used for giving <b>sulphurous</b> peat <b>baths.</b> It was discovered intact during the 1970s despite being left abandoned for many years and buried near the site of The Royal Baths.|$|R
40|$|Objective. Osteoarthritis (OA), {{the most}} common {{degenerative}} osteoarticular disease, is cause of pain and limitations in physical function with high disability that can conduct {{to a state of}} psycological stress, not always considered adequately, with negative impact on the quality of life. The mud and bath therapy can improve this aspect. However, these studies are insufficient. The objective of our research was to evaluate the impact of SPA therapy cycle on safety, efficacy and psychosocial disability in osteoarthritis. Materials and methods. The study was carried out on 99 subjects suffering from OA. The patients has treated for 12 days with applications of sulphurous mud-bath therapy from "Terme di Telese" (Benevento, Italy). At the beginning {{and at the end of}} the SPA therapy considered has assessed: 1) the adverse reactions; 2) the efficacy on the pain and functional limitations; c) the impact on the psychosocial function using the VAS scale, the SF- 36 questionnaire, the WOMAC index and the SDS-Zung test. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by determining the mean  ±  SD. The results were compared with the Student "t" test or Wilcoxon test. A p value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results. In comparison to the basal values, this investigation has demonstrated that <b>sulphurous</b> mud and <b>bath</b> therapy has induced a significant (p < 0. 01) improvement of overall quality of life with reduction of pain at rest (2. 1  ±  1. 5  →  1. 2  ±  1. 3) and during daily activities (2. 3  ±  1. 3  →  1. 4  ±  1. 3). This has facilitated the physical function and psychosocial disability as shown by the questionnaires SF- 36, WOMAC and SDS Zung. Conclusions. In conclusion our data suggest that mud-bath therapy with sulphurous mineral water can be considered as an important phase of the therapeutic strategy in OA...|$|R
