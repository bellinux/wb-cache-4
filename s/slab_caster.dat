40|$|Mathematical {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict temperature, stress, and shape development during initial solidification. The heat transfer model was run for typical casting conditions in the mold for typical thin slab and conventional continuous <b>slab</b> <b>casters.</b> The calculated temperatures were input to an elastic-viscoplastic finite-element stress model of the solidifying steel shell. This model features an efficient algorithm to integrate the highly non-linear constitutive behavior of steel at high temperature. The stress model includes the temperature and composition-dependent effects of phase transformation on both the thermal linear expansion / contraction behavior, creep behavior, and pseudo-strain due to flow in the liquid. Stress and strain distributions are calculated along a line through the shell thickness, assuming no shell bending or sticking to the mold. Results are compared for 0. 044 %C and 0. 1 %C steels and for both cooling conditions.

40|$|Nonoptimal {{fluid flow}} {{patterns}} in the mold cause level fluctuations and excessive surface velocities at the top surface, which shears off and emulsifies liquid slag, leading to inclusions and other defects in the steel product. Physical water models are often used to investigate these phenomena. However of the solidifying shell, and the top-surface slag layer leads to {{significant differences in the}} flow behavior, relative to the real steel caster. Trying to include these effects presents other difficulties. Constructing smaller, scaled-down water models introduce further differences. These differences are investigated using computational models of both the water models and real casters. The Froude similarity criterion reasonably reproduces overall flow features for different scale models, so long as the flow regime stays fully turbulent. Flow in small scale water models behaves differently, if the flow regime becomes laminar. Neglecting the surface slag layer causes excessive surface velocities in a water model. Neglecting the solidifying shell causes unrealistic lower surface velocities and surface waves in the water model, especially for thinner cross sections. Thus, water models of thin <b>slab</b> <b>casters</b> may become unreliable...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} modelling {{study has been}} undertaken to analyze transport phenomena in various steel casters. During {{the course of this}} work, a general three-dimensional parabolic heat flow model was developed for casters of arbitrarily shaped mould using a body-fitted coordinate transformation technique. The heat flow model was specifically applied to a beam blank caster as well as to an industrial <b>slab</b> <b>caster</b> of regular rectangular cross section, so as to analyze solidification within casters. Furthermore, a fully coupled turbulent flow and solidification model was developed to describe the turbulent transport processes in the upper part of a steel <b>slab</b> <b>caster</b> as well as to evaluate the process variables affecting the casting. Solidification modelling was carried out using a fixed grid enthalpy method while the mushy zone was modelled based on a Darcy-porosity approach. A modified low-Reynolds number version of the $ kappa$-$ epsilon$ model of turbulence was employed to calculate eddy viscosity within the liquid and mushy regions. A control volume based on finite difference method was used to solve the transport equations, wherein a SIMPLER algorithm was adopted to resolve the velocity-pressure coupling in the momentum equations. In order to verify the turbulent flow model, a water modelling study was performed for fluid flow in the mould region of a <b>slab</b> <b>caster.</b> Reasonable agreement was obtained between the mathematical model's predictions, and water modelling experiments. Macrosegregation of carbon in a steel billet caster was also modelled based on a continuum formulation, in which the conservation equations are derived in terms of mixture dependent variables. The effect of turbulence on the transport of solute in the liquid and mushy regions was taken into account using the $ kappa$-$ epsilon$ model adopted in this work. Various parametric studies have been preformed on different casting systems, and their effects on temperature distributions and velocity fields within the strand, solidification profiles, and trajectories of inclusions were predicted. Typical predicted results of the models have been compared against the experimental measurements on operating casters reported in the literature and relatively good agreement was obtained...|$|E

Unlike our first publication last year [1] it describes in more detail the approach to develop a new EMB concept not only by simulations but by experimental work.

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of a real-time monitoring system and an optimization algorithm of the wear of submerged entry nozzles (SEN) of continuous <b>slab</b> <b>casters.</b> The real-time monitoring system was developed in order to inform the operator about the actual state of SEN wear during casting in order to avoid primarily the risk of an excessive use and a breakage of the SEN. This kind of incident always entails a considerable danger for the operators while removing the broken parts out of the mould and a risk of a breakout due to an entrapment of refractory parts in the strand too. The parameters of the mathematical model were adjusted by collecting process data and measuring the wear of various nozzles utilized at different casting conditions. Additionally, a wear optimization algorithm was developed for controlling the immersion depth of the SEN in order to maximize the usage time even it was already used at a constant immersion depth for some time. With the implementation of these two systems, not only the usage time of the submerged entry nozzles could be enhanced significantly, but also, at the same time, the operator and process safety...|$|R

40|$|A simple, but {{comprehensive}} {{model of}} heat transfer and solidification of the continuous {{casting of steel}} slabs is described, including phenomena in the mold and spray regions. The model includes a 1 -D transient finite-difference calculation of heat conduction within the solidifying steel shell coupled with 2 -D steady-state heat conduction within the mold wall. The model features a detailed treatment of the interfacial gap between the shell and mold, including mass and momentum balances on the solid and liquid interfacial slag layers, {{and the effect of}} oscillation marks. The model predicts shell thickness, temperature distributions in the mold and shell, thickness of the re-solidified and liquid powder layers, heat flux profiles down the wide and narrow faces, mold water temperature rise, ideal taper of the mold walls, and other related phenomena. The important effect of non-uniform distribution of superheat is incorporated using the results from previous 3 -D turbulent fluid flow calculations within the liquid pool.

Calibration of the model with several different experimental measurements on operating <b>slab</b> <b>casters</b> is presented along with several example applications.

40|$|Continuous casting is the {{dominating}} {{process to}} cast steel. Liquid steel is continuously fed from a tundish {{to a mould}} through a casting nozzle. The flow conditions in the mould {{are influenced by the}} flow pattern inside the casting nozzle as well as the level of steel in the tundish. The flow into the mould is regulated by a stopper rod or a slide gate. The surface of the strand solidifies quickly in the mould and it is important to maintain a constant level of steel to avoid surface defects. A new physical model that simulates continuous casting has been developed. A physical model of this type is unique. The scale of the model is a commonly used full-scale casting machine at <b>slab</b> <b>casters,</b> except the dimension of the tundish. It is possible to generate different types of flow conditions at simulation in the model. Water and liquid steel has similar kinematic viscosity and water is therefore often used for simulation of the continuous casting process. This simulation has been performed using an alloy with a low melting point. The alloy has besides the low melting point, similar physical properties as steel. Measurements with a compact laser vibrometer have been performed to examine the possibility to quantify the volumetric flow of alloy in the model. The compact laser vibrometer measures the vibrations {{on the surface of the}} casting nozzle as the alloy flows through during simulation. The flow of alloy in the model is determined by the velocity of the pump. A calibration of the pump was done to specify the volumetric flow at a specific pumping velocity. This provides the possibility to examine the signal from the sensor during controlled circumstances. The investigation was performed during simulation at specific single phase flows. It was found that the compact laser vibrometer shows a trend of increasing frequency at higher flow rates. A background noise was created by the engine of the pump and measurements were done to be able to exclude this type of disturbance. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an important}} scheduling problem {{resulting from a}} new process for continuously casting steel. A master <b>slab</b> <b>caster</b> produces slabs which are wider than customer needs, and therefore, these must be ripped longitudinally at least once {{before they can be}} processed to a customer-specified width. The purpose of this research is to develop an effective and efficient algorithm for combining customer sizes in order to economically schedule the ripping process. Such a solution procedure could be used to assist decision-makers in selecting master slab widths for production and in designing width limitations for future casters. The method entails more than the minimization of trim loss because other costs are relevant.
