40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{present for the}} first time a {{wireless}} self calibrating pressure sensor for biomedical applications. The proposed system consists of a piezoresistive pressure sensor implemented on a thin silicon membrane, a catheter tube and finally a protection capsule fabricated from a biocompatible polymer (PEEK). A double <b>side</b> <b>flex</b> with embedded conductors has been used to create the interconnections between the pressure sensor and the control circuit which is further connected to a wireless transceiver. The auto calibration capability of the proposed sensor enables to avoid the existing problem of drift with time and hence provides an excellent solution for long term monitoring. Moreover, the catheter of the proposed system has a reduced length of only 200 mm in comparison to the 1 m length for the existing wired solutions. I...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic performance of clinical tests for degenerative rotator cuff disease, {{based on a}} systematic literature review. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and Pascal Biomed until {{the first half of}} 2006 inclusive for articles that reported at least the sensitivity and specificity of clinical tests for rotator cuff disease. Predictive values and accuracy were recorded where available. The results were discussed and validated. RESULTS: We selected nine studies, of which three investigated tests for subacromial impingement syndrome and seven tests for rotator cuff tendinopathy. The Neer and Hawkins tests had good sensitivity but low specificity for subacromial impingement syndrome. For diagnosing tears of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus, the Jobe sign and the full can test showed similar performance characteristics to the Patte test and resisted external rotation with the elbow at the <b>side</b> <b>flexed</b> at 90 degrees. For diagnosing tendinopathies with or without tears, active unresisted external rotation for the infraspinatus and the lift off test for the subscapularis were specific but lacked sensitivity. In one study, limitation of the range of active unresisted internal rotation was sensitive and specific for subscapularis tendon disease. The palm up test performed poorly for diagnosing long head of biceps disease. CONCLUSIONS: Data on the diagnostic performance of clinical tests for rotator cuff tendon disease are fragmentary. However objective data exist to support the usefulness of some of these tests. Further studies are needed...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{wearable}} electronic systems are being realized on flexible substrates. Main limiting factor for the mechanical flexibility of those wearable systems are typically the rigid components - especially the relatively large active components - mounted on {{top and bottom of}} the flex substrates. Integration of these active devices inside the flex multilayers will not only enable for a high degree of miniaturization but can also improve the total flexibility of the system. This paper now presents a technology for the 3 D embedding of ultra-thin active components inside standard flex laminates. Active components are first thinned down to 20 - 25 mu m, and packaged as an Ultra-Thin Chip Pack-age (UTCP). These UTCP packages will serve as flexible interposer: all layers are so thin, that the whole package is even bendable. The limited total pack-age thickness of only 60 mu m makes them also suitable for lamination in between commercial flex panels, replacing for example the direct die integration. A fan-out metallization on the package facilitates easy testing before integration, solving the KGD issue, and can also relax the chip contact pitch, excluding the need for very precise placement and the use of expensive, fine-pitch flex substrates. The technology is successfully demonstrated for the 3 D-integration of a Texas Instrument MSP 430 low-power microcontroller, inside the conventional double <b>sided</b> <b>flex</b> laminate of a wireless ECG system. The microcontrollers are first thinned down and UTCP pack-aged These pack-ages are then laminated in between the large panels of the flex multilayer stack and finally connected to the different layers of the flex board by metallized through-hole interconnects. The thinning down, the UTCP pack-aging and the 3 D-integration inside the commercial flex panels did not have any affect on the functionality of the TI microcontroller. Smaller SMD's were finally mounted on top and bottom of the integrated device...|$|R

40|$|The atlanto-axial rotatory {{fixation}} (AARF) {{is a rare}} {{clinical condition}} that occurs more commonly in children than in adults. It is easy to misdiagnosis AARF because of peculiar feature of atlanto-axial articulation. The authors reported a case of AARF in an adult who was treated by im-mobilization without surgery. Due to a traffic accident, the patient’s head was forcefully rotated to the right <b>side</b> and <b>flexed</b> to the left side. The patient had no neurological deficit, but the patient’s head was fixed in a position rotated {{to the right and}} tilted to the left.

After the reduction, Halo-vest was applied for three months and the patient recovered well without any neurological deficits.

40|$|When a cat's head is rotated in a {{transverse}} plane to one side, the legs {{on that side}} of the body extend, while on the other <b>side,</b> they <b>flex</b> (Asymmetric Tonic Neck Reflexes ATNR). On the contrary, when the head is rotated in a sagittal plane both legs flex when the head flexes, and extend when the head extends (Symmetric Tonic Neck Reflexes STNR). These reflexes have also been found in newborn babies and are thought to be a motor primitive, which is suppressed later in life. Still, using a test in which children sit on hand and knees, the ATNR and STNR can be found in children up to 9 years of age. This may suggest that these reflexes may still be involved in motor control in these children. Whether this is also the case in full-grown adults has thus far only been studied using coarse methods. Thus, for the current study, we set out to measure in detail whether the ATNR/STNR can still be evoked in healthy adult subjects. We measured 10 subjects who were asked to sit on their hands and knees while (1) their head was rotated left and right by an experimenter, (2) their head was flexed and extended by an experimenter. Kinematics was registered using a Vicon system. Elbow and head angles were detrended, and a regression analysis was performed, to investigate the effects of head angle on elbow angle. Results clearly showed the existence of the ATNR and STNR in adult subjects. A next step will be to assess the effects of the ATNR and STNR during everyday motor control tasks, such as making head rotations while driving a bike. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a funerary area dated to the late 9 th millennium BC (Early to Middle PPNB) sheds {{new light on the}} ritual practice of the first farming communities in Southern Syria.

40|$|Purpose: {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{describe}} a new test for identifying lesions of the long head of the biceps (LHB) and to evaluate its diagnostic performance in comparison with selected traditional clinical tests. Methods: one hundred and nine consecutive candidates for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were prospectively recruited. The BRF test, which measures biceps resisted flexion strength, was performed with the patient seated (armat the <b>side</b> and elbow <b>flexed</b> at 90 °). The patient was asked to maintain maximal resistance for five seconds while strength was assessed with a digital dynamometer. Since the dynamometer expresses a continuous variable in kilograms, the measure was dichotomized using a threshold value (cut-off) valueable to simultaneously maximize the sensitivity and specificity. This cut-off value was derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Speed’s test and the O’Brien test were also performed. During arthroscopy the presence of LHB pathology was assessed. Results: biceps resisted flexion strength was significantly higher in patients without associated LHB lesions [median (range) : 3 kg (0 - 9. 5 kg) versus 0 kg (0 - 8. 5 kg); p< 0. 001]. The cut-off level able to simultaneously maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the test was 1. 1 kg. The area under the ROC curve was 0. 745 (p< 0. 001) for the dichotomic BRF test (dBRF), 0. 562 (p= 0. 3) for the O’Brien test, and 0. 602 (p= 0. 113) for Speed’s test. A significant good level of accuracy was achieved only by the dBRF test. Specificity and the positive predictive value were significantly higher for the dBRF test than for Speed’s and O’Brien’s tests (p< 0. 02). Age and the dBRF test were both found to be significant predictors of LHB lesions. Conclusions: the dBRF test showed higher accuracy than traditional clinical tests in diagnosing LHB lesions. This novel test for biceps pathology may be advantageous because it is objective and therefore likely reproducible.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{designing}} and controlling robotic hands for the handy manipulation of everyday objects is a challenging. Even {{with the research}} of passive, 'smart' mechanics that simplify the actuation technique and control schemes of non-anthropomorphic robotic hand, the designing of control commands to handle the hand and the synchronisation of forces and torques experienced by the robotic hand back to a controller is very difficult due to a poor understanding of the grasp mechanism of the unusual hand architectures. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an adaptive robotic hand control model which uses numerical grasp operation, a haptic control interface, and machine learning to execute user-defined manipulation of rotation angle onto the grasp-space of robotic hand. The proposed model uses numerical equations to estimate grasp configurations which allow a robotic hand to acquire a given object with the forces and torques commanded by the user through a haptic interface. Extensive simulations of robotic hand grasps are conducted and used to characterize grasp mechanics and predict/suggest hand performance in unstructured tasks. In this paper, we are using wireless control of robotics hand. At the transmitter <b>side</b> five different <b>flex</b> sensors are used to monitor the finger movements. Flex sensor output resistance variation as tilt with respect to initial position as name implies flexible resistance. The resistance variation is converted into voltage or potential change by using voltage divider circuit and this voltage is converted to digital form using ADC (analog to digital). Now digital value of individual finger is transmitted to receiver of robotics hand using wireless communication system. According to changes in finger values, receiver side microcontroller send commands to dc motors to provide movement to robotic hand. The proposed architecture takes as input a human-user's grasp motions at the haptic interface, estimates the feasibility of the human-guided grasp. The success of the actual, physical grasp solution is used as feedback to the control model, which can update estimations of an object's properties, the hand's grasp mechanics, and the overall feasibility of grasp configurations for certain hand-object interactions. ...|$|R

In the server side, system use java to develop service program, and the system is deployed on the tomcat server. Index Terms- comet, flex, ajax, drawing board Summary Traditional drawing board is divided into two, one is based on the c / s architecture which needs to be installed before use, the other is based on media stream technology. However, the real-time sharing drawing board of the b / s structure is blank. With the extensive use of web application development, more and more users make such a demand that they hope to use a web-based real-time shared drawing board, making the drawing board combined with the existing web products tightly. When the user browse the webpage, they can use the drawing board at the same time, without having to install any software. As the comet technology is more and more mature, it is possible to realize such a system. Although the Ajax technology can make internet applications faster and more friendly, the real-time shared drawing board in the b/s architecture need to transmit the changed information in the background to the client without the customer-side non-stop to refresh and send request. The comet server push technology can be a good solution to this problem. Comet technology, the server does not passively wait for user requests, but initiatively send the message to the client, and the client need not too often to send the request to the server to obtain information. So that the server can take the initiative to pass information to customers, and this technology has immediate, efficient, good performance and able to support a large number of users advantages...|$|R
