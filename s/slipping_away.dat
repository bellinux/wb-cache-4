5|$|Evermore's first EP, <b>Slipping</b> <b>Away,</b> was {{released}} on 1 December 2002, with only 300 copies pressed. However, the EP received regular airplay on Triple J, and was thus able to garner the band some attention. Their next EP, the Oil & Water EP, released 13 January 2003 resulted in the band's first concert tour, again supported by Triple J. My Own Way EP, the band's third EP, {{was released}} on 15 September 2003, after which the band toured with American band Brad.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{discover}} what happened to Marsh, Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax (John Longden), who had previously assisted him (see The Quatermass Xperiment). Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent Broadhead (Tom Chatto), a Member of Parliament, who {{has been trying to}} uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats. Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture artificial food. <b>Slipping</b> <b>away</b> from the visiting party, Broadhead attempts to get inside one of the large domes that dominate the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Rosseau gave {{orders for}} the French frigates to sail once more, <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> from the British ships which had drifted {{to the north and}} {{anchoring}} safely between the batteries at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors. Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone, Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries. Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries. Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against Amazone, each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on Amazone.|$|E

25|$|During the 14th and 15th centuries, the {{progressive}} distancing of the kings from Galician affairs left the kingdom {{in the hands}} of the local knights, counts and bishops, who frequently fought each other to increase their fiefs, or simply to plunder the lands of others. At the same time, the deputies of the Kingdom in the Cortes stopped being called. The Kingdom of Galicia, <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> from the control of the King, responded with a century of fiscal insubordination.|$|E
25|$|In 1811, Masséna {{returned}} toward Portugal {{to relieve}} Almeida; Wellington narrowly checked the French at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro. Simultaneously, his subordinate, Viscount Beresford, fought Soult's 'Army of the South' to a mutual bloody standstill at the Battle of Albuera in May. Wellington {{was promoted to}} full General on 31 July for his services. The French abandoned Almeida, <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> from British pursuit, but retained the twin Spanish fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, the 'Keys' guarding the roads through the mountain passes into Portugal.|$|E

However, Edwards lost a fumble on the runback, which punter Reggie Roby recovered on the Bills 47. The Dolphins then made another big play when Marino completed a 38-yard pass to Duper on fourth down and 5 from the 42, and with just 27 seconds left on the clock, Marino scored on a 2-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 27-17 at halftime.|$|E

25|$|During the Roosevelt administration, several radical populist {{proposals}} {{which went}} beyond what Roosevelt {{was willing to}} advocate gained in popularity. It is notable that {{all four of the}} main promoters of these proposals, Charles Coughlin, Huey Long, Francis Townsend, and Upton Sinclair, were originally strong New Deal supporters but turned against Roosevelt because they believed the New Deal programs didn't go far enough. Like the New Deal programs, these populist proposals were based entirely on single economic reforms, but did not take a position on any other issue and were therefore compatible with those holding otherwise conservative views. Some historians today believe that the primary base of support for the proposals of Coughlin, Long, Townsend, and Sinclair was conservative middle class whites who saw their economic status <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> during the Depression.|$|E
25|$|The pirates now busied {{themselves}} dividing their treasure. Although it {{is sometimes}} reported that Every used his phenomenal skills of persuasion to convince the other captains to leave the Mughal loot in his care, quickly <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> into the night with the entire haul, this comes from Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates, an unreliable account. More reliable sources indicate {{that there was an}} exchange of clipped coins between the crews of the Pearl and the Fancy, with Every's outraged men confiscating the Pearl's treasure. (The Portsmouth Adventure observed but did not partake in the battle with the Ganj-i-sawai, so Captain Faro's crew received none of its treasure.) Every's men then gave Captain Mayes 2,000 pieces of eight (presumably an approximate sum as the treasure captured would have been in Indian and Arabian coins of a different denomination) to buy supplies, and soon parted company.|$|E
25|$|Even {{a return}} to RFK Stadium {{was not enough to}} cure {{whatever}} had been ailing United over the last 2 or 3 months of league play. United fell behind 2–0 against Columbus, but an attempt at a late rally came up short. A penalty kick by Rolfe put United on the scoreboard. Later, Saborio appeared to have tied the score in the 84th minute, off a through pass by Pontius, but the Costa Rican was controversially ruled offside. The result vaulted the Crew {{to the top of the}} standings in the Eastern Conference, while United slipped to 4th place. With dreams of MLS hardware <b>slipping</b> <b>away,</b> D.C. United still had top position in CONCACAF Champions League group play, which the team locked down in their final group match of 2015, a 3–3 draw in Jamaica, against Montego Bay United. The Jamaican side jumped out to an early lead when a quick restart caught out a really makeshift D.C. defense, that included Aguilar making his first start as a fullback, and Jalen Robinson making his first start as a center back. That goal was Montego Bay's first ever tally in CCL play. The home side extended the lead 3 minutes later and took what appeared to be a commanding 3-0 lead early in the second half on a penalty kick, after a phantom foul call against midfielder Jared Jeffrey. D.C. however rallied, with goals by Arrieta and Opare, and earned a draw and a point, when Michael Farfan collected a loose ball deep into stoppage time and aimed his shot into the top corner of the goal. The draw was the first CCL group match that D.C. United didn't win over the last two entries into CONCACAF play, but it did extend their CCL group play unbeaten streak to 8 games and left the team with 10 points, waiting to learn their seeding and knockout round opponent when Champions League play resumes in 2016.|$|E

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik began {{receiving}} heavy radio {{play and}} massive {{sales in the}} middle of their U.S. tour. Frusciante, who preferred the Chili Peppers to remain in the underground music scene, entered a state of denial and depression because of this. According to Kiedis, [...] "He began to lose all of the manic, happy-go-lucky, fun aspects of his personality. Even onstage, there was a much more serious energy around him." [...] Frusciante was slowly <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> from the band altogether, and began to form grudges against his bandmates. He saw the band's newfound popularity as shameful.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} for the fragrance found {{controversy in the}} United Kingdom with UK's Advertising Standards Authority. It was banned from the country's daytime TV rotation due to its [...] "sexy imagery" [...] and was only shown after 7:30 in the afternoon. The U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority commented on the ban decision, stating [...] "We considered that Beyoncé's body movements and the camera's prolonged focus on shots of her dress <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> to partially expose her breasts created a sexually provocative ad that was unsuitable {{to be seen by}} young children." [...] Coty, Inc., the world's largest fragrance company, replied to the ban, stating that they do not think there is anything too explicit about the TV spot. Coty continued that the commercial was [...] "intended to reflect the singer Beyoncé's personal 'sexy chic' style," [...] and while Beyoncé's cleavage is exposed at certain parts of the commercial, Coty stated that it is not [...] "overtly graphic or explicitly sexual and at no point was Beyoncé naked." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly defended Beyoncé, saying that [...] " [...] is sexy. It's suggestive and sultry. But it's certainly not X-rated." [...] Beyoncé's mother and collaborator Tina Knowles called the commercial's ban [...] "very good", as people purposely went to watch the video which further increased sales. Beyoncé herself also responded jokingly to the ban, saying, [...] "Where's the wind coming from? It started out only , and then it kind of created this effect with my hair... You can only imagine, the show is two and a half hours. It's really, really warm onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|Klemme got the team's first-ever win {{early in}} the spring season, at Le Samyn. After a solo escapee was caught by an elite 12-rider group that came clear of the peloton, Klemme timed his attack on the day's final climb with {{precision}} and stayed out front for victory by eight seconds over Kevyn Ista. The team came to the first monument race of the season, Milan–San Remo, with high ambitions. Cancellara aimed for a second triumph in the race, having previously won the 2008 edition, but he recognized that <b>slipping</b> <b>away</b> unmarked in the race's final kilometers as he did three years prior {{would be difficult to}} do again. He considered Philippe Gilbert to be his principal rival for the race. Cancellara and O'Grady made the day's major selection on the Le Manie climb, after a crash [...] from the finish. O'Grady hit out on the attack a few times shortly {{before the end of the}} race, but it was Cancellara who was present in an eight-rider group that formed on the Poggio which decided the race. These eight riders represented eight different teams, so no one was able to get a proper leadout. After Gilbert, Vincenzo Nibali, and Yoann Offredo opened up the sprint, Cancellara tried to come around them for the win, but was beaten at the line by 's Matthew Goss. Cancellara was deeply disappointed to finish second, feeling that even though he had done one of the best sprints of his life, he had not done adequately to pay off his team's efforts on the day.|$|E
