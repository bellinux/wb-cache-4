5|$|At the storm's initial {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, heavy rains and <b>strong</b> winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus.

5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused <b>strong</b> winds across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, <b>strong</b> winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house. Hail and <b>strong</b> winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the <b>strong</b> winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E

40|$|Aims This study {{examined}} whether parental drinking motives {{are associated with}} young adults' drinking motives, and their association with young adults' drinking behaviors. Methods: The sample consisted of 290 18 -year-old and 289 20 -year-old drinking young adults and their parents. Results: For the younger group, <b>stronger</b> maternal coping motives were related to <b>stronger</b> social and enhancement motives, while <b>stronger</b> paternal coping motives were associated with <b>stronger</b> young adult coping motives. For the older group, <b>stronger</b> maternal coping motives were related to <b>stronger</b> social motives and <b>stronger</b> paternal enhancement motives were associated with <b>stronger</b> overall young adult drinking motives. For the younger group, both enhancement and conformity motives were predictive of their alcohol use. For the older group, only higher social motives were predictive of higher alcohol use. Both groups' higher coping and enhancement motives were associated with more drinking problems. Conclusions: While, concerning content, there are some differences due to parent gender and adolescent age, <b>stronger</b> parental drinking motives are indeed associated with <b>stronger</b> adolescent drinking motives, which in turn are quite consistently related to more adolescent alcohol use and alcohol-related problems...|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Florence {{produced}} <b>strong</b> swells {{and dangerous}} surf conditions {{along the northern}} Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda. Later in its duration, the tight pressure gradient between Florence and a high-pressure system over southeastern Canada produced <b>strong</b> winds and rough waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused <b>strong</b> swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a <b>strong</b> light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology.
