50|$|When a {{metal wire}} is {{connected}} {{across the two}} terminals of a DC voltage source such as a battery, the source places an electric field across the conductor.

50|$|Another way {{to explain}} the benefit of Litz {{braiding}} is as follows: the magnetic fields generated by current flowing in the strands are in directions such {{that they have a}} reduced tendency to generate an opposing electromagnetic field in the other strands. Thereby, for the wire as a whole, the skin effect and associated power losses when used in high-frequency applications are reduced. The ratio of distributed inductance to distributed resistance is increased, relative to a <b>solid</b> <b>conductor,</b> resulting in a higher Q factor at these frequencies.|$|E
50|$|A type {{of cable}} called litz wire (from the German Litzendraht, braided wire) {{is used to}} {{mitigate}} the skin effect for frequencies of a few kilohertz to about one megahertz. It consists {{of a number of}} insulated wire strands woven together in a carefully designed pattern, so that the overall magnetic field acts equally on all the wires and causes the total current to be distributed equally among them. With the skin effect having little effect on each of the thin strands, the bundle does not suffer the same increase in AC resistance that a <b>solid</b> <b>conductor</b> of the same cross-sectional area would due to the skin effect.|$|E

5000|$|Litz wire: To reduce {{skin effect}} losses, some coils are wound {{with a special}} type of radio {{frequency}} wire called litz wire. Instead of a single <b>solid</b> <b>conductor,</b> litz wire consists {{of a number of}} smaller wire strands that carry the current. Unlike ordinary stranded wire, the strands are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each wire strand spends the same amount of its length {{on the outside of the}} wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.|$|E
50|$|High-frequency {{transformers}} {{operating in}} the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses. Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings. Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a <b>solid</b> <b>conductor</b> of similar size, aiding manufacture.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic vector {{potential}} (MVP) formulation combined with finite edge elements has gained substantial application in 3 -D eddy-current field computation. Compared with its magnetic scalar potential counterpart, the MVP formulation {{is much easier}} to treat multiply-connected conductors. With the availability of advanced direct linear solvers with high performance on parallel or multi-core platforms, it becomes more and more important to develop gauged MVP formulations. To this end, the gauging technique is essential to ensure that the MVP formulation is uniquely solvable by direct solvers. In this paper, a novel method for imposing Coulomb gauge to transient eddy-current problems using edge elements for approximating the MVP is proposed. The resultant linear matrix equation is symmetric and uniquely solvable. Current excitations and voltage excitations for stranded <b>conductors</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>conductors</b> are formulated, respectively.
