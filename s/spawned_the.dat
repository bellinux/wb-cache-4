5|$|Carla <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> largest hurricane-related tornado {{outbreak}} {{on record}} at the time, when 26tornadoes touched down within its circulation. However, it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane Beulah in 1967, which spawned at least 115tornadoes. Throughout its path, 43fatalities and about $325.74million in damage {{were attributed to}} Carla. Most of the impact occurred in Texas, where the storm made landfall as a large and strong Category4 hurricane.|$|E

Also in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 appeared {{in the form of a}} fixed shooter, with an exterminator ridding the ape—and insects—from a greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|On October10, another {{tropical}} depression formed {{further to the}} north of the previous storm. It possibly developed from the same tropical wave that <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> previous depression, although they were not the same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October12.|$|E
5|$|Several tornadoes were reported. Near Panacea, Florida, {{a tornado}} {{destroyed}} {{a house and}} damaged two others. Another tornado in Emanuel County, Georgia killed one person and demolished two homes.

5|$|There was a {{split at}} the club in 1906, after some of the staff {{considered}} moving Juve out of Turin. President Alfred Dick was unhappy with this and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino which in turn <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> Derby della Mole. Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
5|$|As the 19thcentury {{gave way}} to the 20th, there {{followed}} in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> short-lived First Philippine Republic, followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force. Aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II, when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution.|$|E

5|$|Ideas for Dishonored 2 began while {{developing}} the downloadable content of its predecessor, which <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> decision {{to create a}} voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, only a child in Dishonored, was first proposed as a playable character. The game's aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the new fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented {{over the course of}} one year. The city itself was based on southern European countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, drawing on the architecture, fashion, and technologies of 1851.|$|E
5|$|Skate punk innovators {{also pointed}} in other {{directions:}} Big Boys helped establish funkcore, while Venice, California's Suicidal Tendencies had a formative {{effect on the}} heavy metal–influenced crossover thrash style. Toward {{the middle of the}} decade, D.R.I. <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> superfast thrashcore genre. Both developed in multiple locations. Sacramento's Tales of Terror, which mixed psychedelic rock into their hardcore sound, were an early influence on the grunge genre. D.C.'s Void {{was one of the first}} punk-metal crossover acts and influenced thrash metal.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the existence of}} 30 years of newsreels archives were filmmakers who made early sound era documentaries. World War I was a popular topic of these pictures and <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> following documentaries; The Big Drive (1933), World in Revolt (1933), This is America (1933), and Hell's Holiday (1933). The most prescient pre-Code World War I documentary was aptly called The First World War (1934) and was the most critically and commercially successful documentary of the era.|$|E

5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} positive reviews by critics, {{with particular}} praise directed at its dark tone and violent nature. The game also received great controversy, {{due to the}} level of graphic violence in the game. It was banned in several countries, and implicated in a murder by the UK media, although this implication was later rejected by the police and courts. The game won several accolades, and <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> sequel Manhunt 2 in 2007. As of March 2008, the series has collectively sold 1.7 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Despite passing {{north of}} the Philippines, the storm killed three and left 15 persons injured. Damage in the country totaled $680,000 (1983 USD). While passing near Hong Kong, 50,000 people lost {{electrical}} services. Around 200 homes were destroyed; a total 2,000 people were left homeless, 1,600 of whom sought shelter. Throughout the city, eight people perished and 339 were hurt, including 120 seriously. Ellen <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> second tornado ever recorded in Hong Kong, and the first ever recorded during a typhoon. Elsewhere, in Macao, little damage was reported. Offshore, 40 crew members were rescued in a shipwreck. In a separate incident, eight people were lost at sea. Furthermore, ten Taiwan fishing boats capsized in the South China Sea, resulting in 48 fishermen missing, though 103 persons also survived. Overall, damage totaled $79 million and 23 people died.|$|E

5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said to have begun in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and others found their fame. This West Coast rap scene <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E

Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. Gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|In Hong Kong, 50,000 {{people lost}} power. About 200 houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 people were left {{homeless}}; 1,600 {{of the homeless}} sought emergency shelter. Flights to the Kai Tak Airport were cancelled as the airport was closed for 12 hours. Large areas of farmland were damaged. Throughout the city, eight people perished, including a girl that was crushed by a falling cabinet. Two sisters were killed via a landslide while a fireman died when trying to rescue someone. Additionally, 339 people were injured, including 120 seriously. Forty-five people were injured due to flying glass and failing objects. Typhoon Ellen also <b>spawned</b> <b>the</b> second tornado ever recorded in Hong Kong, and the first ever recorded during {{the passage of a}} typhoon. According to the HKO, Ellen was Hong Kong's worst typhoon since Typhoon Hope of 1979.|$|E
