30|$|In the European Union, IPM (Integrated Pest Management) {{programmes}} {{and strategies}} have become important due to Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable {{use of pesticides}} ([74], Article 1). This Directive aims at the reduction of risks and impacts on {{human health and the}} environment due to pesticide use by a range of measures implemented at the national level. It encourages the use of alternative approaches to (i) reduce pesticide use, (ii) monitor pesticides and (iii) prohibit pesticides in sensitive areas. Member States are requested to promote low-pesticide-input management, in particular by implementing the principles of IPM. The IPM principles require monitoring of harmful organisms as well as the use of threshold values for decision making for plant protection measures (<b>see</b> [74] <b>Annex</b> <b>III).</b> Consequently, a range of countries currently develop or plan to develop crop-specific IPM guidelines [104].|$|R
30|$|For the ERA of GMHT crops, EFSA [6] {{refers to}} two {{legislative}} documents comprising agricultural protection goals: the Biodiversity Action Plan for Agriculture [35] and Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable {{use of pesticides}} [74]. Agricultural protection goals relevant to GMHT crops are (i) the integration of biodiversity and sustainability into agricultural production practices such as the diversification of production types and cultivated varieties (including crop rotation), (ii) less input of agrochemicals (including PPPs) and (iii) maintenance of diversity of crop varieties. Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides promotes integrated pest management with the focus on non-chemical methods and also aims at the reduction of risks and impacts of pesticide use on {{human health and the}} environment [74]. According to this Directive, EU Member States are requested to define reduction targets for pesticide use for particular crops. Another aim of the Directive is to limit the levels of pesticide use in order not to increase the risk for resistance development in populations of harmful organisms (<b>see</b> [74]; <b>Annex</b> <b>III).</b>|$|R

40|$|A major {{limitation}} {{on the use}} of wind turbines in Europe is their noise radiation. The amount of wind energy generation capacity that can be installed at a site is directly dependent on the noise radiated. A noise reduction in the order of only 2 dB(A) can increase the number of installations by about 50 %. The tip noise experiments on commercial wind turbines have confirmed the results obtained in the wind tunnel. Tip designs generating strong tip vortices (e. g. extreme curvature at the leading edge) interacting with the TE (trailing edge longer than the leading edge) cause additional noise in the high frequency range (a second maximum in the 2 kHz frequency range of the sound power spectra is an indication of tip noise). Reductions of the overall sound power level up to 4 dB(A) can be reached by designs avoiding these effects (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> I and <b>III).</b> The measurements in the open and in the wind tunnel showed that the tip noise radiation is very sensitive to the angle of attack. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} following design criteria should be followed: - Cutting away of the trailing edge - modest leading edge sweep - reduction of the angle of attack at the tip.
