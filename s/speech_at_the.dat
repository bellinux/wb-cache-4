5000|$|Lewis {{prevented}} the communists from really making inroads at Oxford {{during his time}} there. He increased the Labour Club's membership by three-quarters, from 484 members in December 1932 to over 850 members {{by the time he}} left, while the October club never rose above 300 members. Ted Jolliffe stated [...] "there was a difference between his <b>speeches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Oxford Union and his <b>speeches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Labour Club.

[...] In 1935, the Soviet controlled Comintern's Seventh Congress, called for a united left response to fascism, called the popular front. The communist October Club used this call, for a popular front, as a pretext to have a union between themselves and the Labour Club. Under Lewis' leadership, the club was able to easily defeat a motion by the October Club, as only 20 OULC members voted for the union.|$|R
