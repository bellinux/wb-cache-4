5|$|After {{the island}} was {{evacuated}} it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from Barra. In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a <b>sheep</b> <b>farmer</b> in both Australia and Montana. Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company, choosing {{to live on the}} island alone all autumn and winter with his pet ferrets and cats, and joined by two shepherds for the spring and summer only. After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company’s ownership continued for the next forty years.|$|E

He was the sixth of ten {{children}} to Christopher Michael Bagot, a <b>sheep</b> <b>farmer</b> and station owner, and Eleanor Mary (née Hawker). The family home was in Largs Bay. Bagot belonged to a distinguished family: he was a great-grandson of Admiral Edward Hawker and of pastoralist Charles Hervey Bagot, a grandson of settler and politician George Charles Hawker, and a first cousin of Lanoe Hawker, a flying ace and Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War. Bagot and his four brothers were educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide, before Arthur went on to Geelong Grammar School from 1903 to 1907. At Geelong Bagot was active in sporting and extracurricular activities. He participated in sprint, high jump, pole vault and long jump events at the United Public School Sports, an annual athletic competition between five prestigious Victorian public schools, and set a new record in the hurdles in 1907. Bagot also rose to sergeant in the local Australian Army Cadets unit, and was a school prefect in his final year. As Baggot's father had died in 1899, the remaining family moved to Canada in 1907 and settled near Vancouver, where they were to largely remain until 1925.|$|E

Twenty five of the farmers surveyed used a sheep consultant, 25 did not, and 30 were interested in employing one.

Regular newsletters and field days were necessary, but the provision of contract services, such as mulesing, lamb-marking, drenching, pregnancy testing and sheep classing, and 'fire-brigade' services for sick animals, were not rated as important.

2500|$|In 1871, Trollope {{made his}} first trip to Australia, {{arriving}} in Melbourne in July, with his wife and their cook. The trip was made to visit their younger son, Frederic, who was a <b>sheep</b> <b>farmer</b> near Grenfell, New South Wales. He wrote his novel Lady Anna during the voyage. In Australia, he spent a year and two days [...] "descending mines, mixing with shearers and rouseabouts, riding his horse into the loneliness of the bush, touring lunatic asylums, and exploring coast and plain by steamer and stagecoach". Despite this, the Australian press was uneasy, fearing he would misrepresent Australia in his writings. This fear was based on rather negative writings about America by his mother, Fanny, and by Charles Dickens. On his return, Trollope published a book, Australia and New Zealand (1873). It contained both positive and negative comments. On the positive side, it found a comparative absence of class consciousness, and praised aspects of Perth, Melbourne, Hobart and Sydney. However, he was negative about Adelaide's river, the towns of Bendigo and Ballarat, and the Aboriginal people. What most angered the Australian papers, though, were his comments [...] "accusing Australians of being braggarts".|$|E
