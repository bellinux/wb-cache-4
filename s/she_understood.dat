5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.|$|E
5|$|Solanas {{moved to}} New York City in the mid-1960s, {{working as a}} writer. She met pop artist Andy Warhol {{and asked him to}} produce her play, Up Your Ass. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing and/or stealing, {{followed}} by Warhol expressing additional indifference to her play. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in the spring of 1968.|$|E
25|$|Benny Thau was trusted by the stars. For example, Greta Garbo {{never had}} a formal {{contract}} with MGM. The director and producer Gottfried Reinhardt recalled {{that at one time}} Thau explained to Garbo that if she accepted a sizable salary reduction she would move into a lower tax bracket and receive the same net pay. <b>She</b> <b>understood</b> the logic and agreed to the cut on a handshake.|$|E

25|$|Charles de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 7 April 1921. They {{had three}} children: Philippe (born 1921), Élisabeth (1924–2013), who married General Alain de Boissieu, and Anne (1928–1948). Anne had Down's {{syndrome}} {{and died of}} pneumonia {{at the age of}} 20. De Gaulle always had a particular love for Anne; one Colombey resident recalled how he used to walk with her hand-in-hand around the property, caressing her and talking quietly about the things <b>she</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, Verdonk {{considered}} returning homosexual {{asylum seekers}} to Iran because <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> {{they were no}} longer being prosecuted. The general public conception was that acts of homosexuality were still punishable by death. She noted that homosexuality in itself was not punishable by death sentence in Iran. In response to parliamentary criticism, the Minister announced on March 4 that all asylum cases involving homosexual Iranians would be assessed on an individual basis. Her proposed policy initially earned her selection for the Human Rights Watch Hall of Shame.|$|E
25|$|Barbara was the {{youngest}} child of Jerzy Radziwiłł, Voivode of Trakai and Vilnius and Great Lithuanian Hetman, and his wife Barbara Kolanka, daughter of Voivode of Podolia. Her exact birth date is unknown. It is known that she was born on 6 December, but the year is not known. Historians usually provide either 1520, as recorded in Radziwiłł genealogy found in Nesvizh, or 1523, as recorded on a plaque found in her tomb. Details of her education are unknown, but {{it is unlikely that}} it was extensive. From her correspondence, it is known that she could speak and write in Polish. From a February 1549 letter it could be inferred that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> at least some Latin, but her letters to Sigismund Augustus had not a single Latin phrase. According to her contemporaries, Barbara was very beautiful. Moreover, Barbara had an interest in fashion and cosmetics; she used perfumes and face powder.|$|E

25|$|At {{around the}} same time Curtiss began her work, doctors reevaluated Genie on the Leiter scale and {{measured}} her on the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale, which placed her estimated mental age between a 5- and 8-year-old with a very high degree of scatter. Doctors believed Genie had learned to use her gestalt perception to determine the number of objects in a group, and by the start of the case study she could accurately discern the correct number of up to 7 objects via gestalt perception. Child psychologist David Elkind, who was involved in the grant meetings, evaluated Genie in May 1971 and reported that she was in the concrete operational stage of development, noting that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> object permanence and could engage in deferred imitation. Genie's physical health also continued to improve, and by this time her endurance had dramatically increased. Her social behavior was still highly abnormal, and doctors were especially concerned that she almost never interacted with people her age, but evaluations from the time expressed some optimism about her prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. <b>She</b> <b>understood</b> {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

[...] "To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there... It's too buggy, too wet, too generally inhospitable", she wrote. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> that the health of the environment indicated the general well-being of humanity.|$|E

500|$|Hillary Clinton {{gradually}} {{came under}} scrutiny for allegedly having {{played a central}} role in the firings and making false statements about her involvement therein. [...] In 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray issued his final report on Travelgate. [...] He sought no charges against her, saying that while some of Clinton's statements were factually false, there was insufficient evidence that these statements were either knowingly false or that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> that her statements led to the firings.|$|E
500|$|She opposed statism, which <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> {{to include}} theocracy, {{absolute}} monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term [...] "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over {{issues such as}} religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.|$|E
500|$|Lori Loughlin {{auditioned for}} the role of Debbie and was given the part {{straight}} away. Sachs thought that Loughlin was too established to read for the part, but realized that <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> the role immediately. The producers were fans of Jessica Walter after watching her film, Play Misty for Me. Sachs found that Walter knew pieces of scenes, and suggested [...] "stuff that works". Sachs described Ryan Eggold, who portrayed Matthews, as [...] "a sophisticated actor, and he's also very funny". Sachs believed that every time Eggold would be on screen, [...] "people are going to go, 'Wow!'".|$|E

Pertaining to unplanned pregnancies and counselling, Gillard is of the view that women ought to be couselled by someone of their choice – as opposed to only trained professionals referred to by their general practitioners. In August 2012, Gillard reiterated her position in support of abortion, stating that [...] "Women must have the right to healthcare and women must have the right to choose." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{marked the}} last regular {{appearance}} of Emma Bell (Amy), whose character was killed {{off in the}} conclusion of the installment.

[...] The film he was preparing to shoot was Gone with the Wind, and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend her out for the project.

500|$|Early in the show, {{the actress}} based her {{understanding}} of Eve on the character's relationships with Grace and Ivy Winthrop. Ross described Eve's love for Grace as [...] "my rock in the sea" [...] when Eve took extreme, illegal measures to hide her past. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who portrayed Ivy, felt that her character viewed Eve as her only friend. Ross added that Eve respected Ivy's [...] "ability to take charge" [...] instead of [...] "always tiptoeing around and walking on eggshells". <b>She</b> <b>understood</b> Ivy's schemes to blackmail Eve as an attempt at a deeper connection; as [...] "the {{closest thing to a}} friend that Ivy had", Eve interpreted their relationship as a desire for friendship.|$|E
500|$|Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria {{wrote that}} Zenobia did not [...] "hand over churches to the Jews {{to make them}} into synagogues"; {{although}} the queen was not a Christian, <b>she</b> <b>understood</b> the power of bishops in Christian communities. In Antioch—considered representative of political control of the East and containing a large Christian community—Zenobia apparently maintained authority over the church by bringing influential clerics, probably including Paul of Samosata, under her auspices. She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of ducenarius (minor judge); he apparently enjoyed the queen's protection, which helped him keep the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as bishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 268.|$|E
