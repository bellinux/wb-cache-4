Teddy Sheringham’s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point, setting a precedent for things to come. The team's first away game at West Ham followed, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at.

40|$|A few {{among many}} {{otherwise}} highly successful lubricated sliding components fail catastrophically and without warning. This sudden {{mode of failure}} is often called <b>scuffing.</b> The phenomenon of <b>scuffing</b> {{has been known for}} many years and numerous {{attempts have been made to}} understand its processes and mechanisms. There is still, however, a general lack of agreement concerning the processes leading up to <b>scuffing.</b> One of the main reasons for this is that the detailed mechanisms of <b>scuffing</b> are not well understood. The main purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the <b>scuffing</b> processes and material failure mechanisms under starved lubrication conditions. The research focuses on two major goals. The first is to examine the <b>scuffing</b> behavior of 52100 steel shoes/ 390 -T 6 Al plate contacts under starved lubrication conditions. The evaluation is based on a shoe-on-disc geometry which approximately simulates the swashplate/ shoe contacts in an automotive swashplate compressor. All tests are conducted in a high pressure tribometer (HPT) under R 134 a environment with a base polyalkylene glycol (PAG) lubricant. The effects of degree of lubricant starvation, sliding velocity, geometry of contact, surface topography, a tin coating, and socket geometry supporting the shoe are evaluated. The second goal is to study the processes and mechanisms of the <b>scuffing</b> phenomenon also under starved lubrication conditions. A pin-on-disc geometry is used to examine the effect of materials, lubricant/refrigerant mixtures and loading history on <b>scuffing.</b> The transition behavior of a 390 -T 6 Al pin sliding against a 1018 carburized steel disc is also examined. To better understand the processes and failure mechanisms of <b>scuffing,</b> the <b>scuffed</b> surfaces and subsurfaces are examined. Based on the experimental observations, a hypothesis and its corresponding criterion for <b>scuffing</b> under starved lubrication conditions are proposed. According to this hypothesis, <b>scuffing</b> is caused by the formation of macroscopic adhesions leading to bulk material failure due to plastic shearing.

40|$|Some typical {{applications}} where <b>scuffing</b> {{may occur}} are gear teeth, piston rings and cylinder pairs, cams and followers, splines, sleeve bearings, {{and parts of}} swash and wobble plate compressors. Unlike other tribology-related failures, <b>scuffing</b> occurs very fast, without any warning, and usually leads to the complete destruction of the sliding pair. Practical experience with steel has helped to outline safe ranges of operation for some components. Very little, however, is known about aluminum, which {{is the second most}} commonly used engineering metal. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a better understanding <b>scuffing</b> and seizure of aluminum/steel contacts. The research includes an experimental study of <b>scuffing</b> of aluminum/steel contacts under dry sliding conditions, a study of the physics of the <b>scuffing</b> process, evaluation of various hypotheses for scuffmg, and modeling of <b>scuffing.</b> The experiments are conducted in a custom-designed tribometer, which provides accurate control of the environmental conditions. Special instrumentation, experimental procedures and software are developed as a part of the experimental program. These provide a reliable reproduction and identification of <b>scuffing</b> under laboratory conditions. The <b>scuffing</b> characteristics of five materials are obtained in air and refrigerant (R 134 a) environments. The effects of load, sliding velocity, mechanical strength, environmental temperature, specimen geometry, time, loading history, and type of environment are evaluated. The mechanisms leading to <b>scuffing</b> are studied by examination of surfaces, subsurfaces and wear debris of specimens in the process of <b>scuffing.</b> Quantitative measurements of subsurface plastic strain are also obtained. The theoretical part of the study includes the development of a finite element model for the contact of runned-in rough surfaces and several other models for subsurface stresses, temperatures, and strains. These models provide information about the local conditions in the subsurface Based on the experimental observations and the <b>scuffing</b> models a new hypothesis for <b>scuffing</b> is proposed. According to this hypothesis, <b>scuffing</b> involves initiation of cracks due to subsurface plastic deformation, propagation of these cracks leading to the removal of the existing protective surface layers, and finally cold welding due to adhesion between bare metal surfaces.

This work investigated the <b>scuffing</b> mechanism of EN-GJS 400 - 15 spheroidal graphite cast iron caused by reciprocating sliding of a 52100 roller bearing element lubricated with PAO base oil. The contact was conditioned at 100 N and 15 Hz over a stroke of 25 mm at 180 oC. Subsequently the load was incremented in 100 N/min steps at 5 minute intervals until severe <b>scuffing</b> occurred, indicated by a rapid rise in the average friction coefficient. High speed friction was used to determine the onset of mild and severe <b>scuffing.</b> Stylus and 3 D optical profilometery revealed that mild <b>scuffing</b> produced a smooth surface with small cracks compared to the severe <b>scuffed</b> surface which contained adhesive wear craters of 40 ?m in depth. Focused ion beam cross-sections of the mild <b>scuffed</b> surface and EDS analysis of the microstructure indicated that cracks were initiated by dross inclusions with a similar morphology to flake graphite.

The cylinder blocks with several values of surface roughness were used as reciprocating specimens, {{and a piece of}} piston ring was used as fixed pin. As increasing load by several steps in lubricated sliding, the friction signals indicated the state of surface interactions, such as friction forces, changes of lubricating films and <b>scuffing.</b> There were some rapid increases in friction forces just before the <b>scuffing</b> would occur. It was found that there was the optimum value of initial surface roughness to prolong the wear life of sliding surfaces.
