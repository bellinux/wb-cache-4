5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its <b>swimming</b> <b>speed.</b> In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as <b>swimming</b> <b>speed,</b> so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of BL/s, i. e. body lengths {{per second}} (dimensions of s- 1), to express {{relative}} <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> for fish is very common. The physiological literature demonstrates the following: a) fish length {{is a strong}} predictor of swimming performance; b) longer fish achieve higher absolute <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> (dimensions of m/s) than shorter ones, {{at least for the}} same species; c) when <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> are expressed in BL/s, shorter fish have higher relative speeds than longer ones. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> of large fish from small fish and vice versa, when using these absolute or relative <b>swim</b> <b>speed</b> metrics. It {{is important to recognize that}} regressions with data from small fish (e. g. juveniles) expressed in BL/s, would lead to overestimates of absolute <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> for large fish. It also follows that BL/s regressions with data from large fish, would lead to underestimates of absolute <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> for small fish. Yet, costs and complexity often lead to considerable data sets for small fish and limited tests with large fish, even though <b>swim</b> <b>speed</b> estimates are frequently needed for large fish. Regression strength for the same data sets, is higher when using dimensionless <b>swim</b> <b>speed</b> expressions, rather than BL/s. Such ecohydraulic analyses, demonstrate swimming performance similarity between small and large fish and provide better absolute <b>swim</b> <b>speed</b> estimates. Furthermore, ecohydraulic analyses point to efficient strategies for testing length classes, particularly when <b>swim</b> <b>speeds</b> for considerable numbers of sizes and species are needed...|$|R

40|$|Larval {{dispersal}} {{is shaped}} by the interaction between oceanographic processes and larval behaviour. To evaluate {{the potential impact of}} larval behaviour on this process, we quantified the undisturbed <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> and nocturnal <b>swimming</b> activity of 5 reef fish species throughout their larval phase. We used video techniques to obtain undisturbed observations of swimming behaviour in captive bred larvae. The results conclusively demonstrate that larvae maintain relatively high <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> throughout development. Speeds were consistent among 3 anemonefish species (Amphiprioninae; Amphiprion melanopus, A. percula and Premnas biaculeatus), which swam an average of 3. 9 and a maximum of 8. 4 body lengths (bl) s- 1. However, differences may exist among taxa in the undisturbed <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> of larvae. Highest speeds were recorded in the damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae) and the slowest speeds in the cardinalfish Sphaeramia nematoptera (Apogonidae). The results support short-duration experimental and in situ evidence of high sustained <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds.</b> However, it is striking that larvae routinely <b>swim</b> at such <b>speeds</b> without external stimuli. The proportion of time larvae spent swimming at night increased rapidly {{towards the end of the}} larval phase in all 5 species examined. In addition, the undisturbed <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> of larvae were significantly greater at night than during the day. Patterns of nocturnal activity appear to relate to the active nocturnal settlement behaviour of larvae. The pattern of <b>swimming,</b> and <b>speeds</b> achieved, suggest that an active behavioural mechanism for self-recruitment is well within the capabilities of the reef fish larvae examined. ...|$|R

In laboratory trials, <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> in two species of amphibious sea kraits (61 Laticauda laticaudata and 35 L. saintgironsi) varied from 0. 14 to 1. 39 body lengths per second. Miniature accelerometers attached externally to these snakes recorded the frequency and lateral acceleration of bodily undulations that the snakes used to propel themselves through the water. Frequency of undulation was constant {{along the length of}} the body, but amplitude of lateral acceleration increased in posterior sections. The frequency and amplitude of lateral acceleration of undulations were highly correlated with <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds,</b> suggesting (a) that intraspecific and interspecific variation in <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> reflects underlying variation in undulatory mechanics; and (b) that data from miniature accelerometers implanted in the body cavity could provide accurate estimates of <b>swimming</b> <b>speeds</b> of free-ranging snakes...|$|R

In this context, escape and swimming abilities of Pacific oyster larvae and the larvae of the native blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) were compared. Swimming behaviour of C. gigas larvae and larvae of M. edulis was recorded in still water and in a suction current mimicking a bivalve feeding current, in a horizontal and in a vertical plane.
