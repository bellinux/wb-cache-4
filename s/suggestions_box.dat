40|$|This {{text for}} pre-service and {{in-service}} English education courses presents current {{methods of teaching}} literature to {{middle and high school}} students. The methods are based on social-constructivist/socio-cultural theories of literacy learning, and incorporate research on literary response conducted by the authors. Teaching Literature to Adolescents [...] a totally new text that draws on ideas from the best selling textbook, Teaching Literature in the Secondary School, by Beach and Marshall [...] reflects and builds on recent key developments in theory and practice in the field, including: *the importance of providing students with a range of critical lenses for analyzing texts and interrogating the beliefs, attitudes, and ideological perspectives encountered in literature; *organization of the literature curriculum around topics, themes, or issues; *infusion of multicultural literature and emphasis on how writers portray race, class, and gender differences; *use of drama as a tool for enhancing understanding of texts; *employment of a range of different ways to write about literature; *integration of critical analysis of film and media texts with the study of literature; *blending of quality young adult literature into the curriculum; and *attention to students who have difficulty succeeding in literature classes due to reading difficulties, disparities between school and home cultures, attitudes toward school/English, or lack of engagement with assigned texts or response activities. Thoughtfully designed to draw readers into interacting with the text, each chapter is organized around a specific question English educators frequently hear in working with pre-service and in-service teachers, and includes a Case Narrative that frames discussion of the issue that is the focus of the chapter. Many chapters include teacher narratives or lesson plans that demonstrate how a teacher implements the proposed methods. All chapters conclude with an Action Research Activity or Portfolio Reflection Activity, and an Additional Online Activities, Links, and Further Reading <b>Suggestions</b> <b>box</b> directing readers to the Teaching Literature Web site designed to be used in conjunction with this text. The interactive Web site contains recommended readings, resources, and activities; links to Web sites and PowerPoint presentations; and opportunities for readers to contribute teaching units to the Web site databases. Instructors and students in middle and high school English methods courses will appreciate the clear, engaging, useful integration of theory, methods, and pedagogical features offered in this text.

50|$|A <b>suggestion</b> <b>box</b> is {{a device}} for obtaining {{additional}} comments, questions, and requests. In {{its most basic}} and traditional form, it is a receptacle with an opening, not unlike an offering box or voting box. The box is used for collecting slips of paper with input from customers and patrons of a particular organization. <b>Suggestion</b> <b>boxes</b> may also exist internally, within an organization, such as means for garnering employee input.|$|R

This can include collecting survey data and conducting focus groups and patron interviews. While these forms of data collection are considered standard assessment tools, libraries already have a rich collection of data available to them through their <b>suggestion</b> <b>boxes</b> – one of the most longstanding methods to determine how well your library is doing. A survey of Canadian academic libraries was conducted to gain some insight into the prevalence of the <b>suggestion</b> <b>box,</b> how libraries were managing them in their day to day operations, and whether the collected data was mined for any decision-making purposes. The authors provide recommendations on how libraries can analyze their <b>suggestion</b> <b>box</b> data to improve services and engage more effectively with their users...|$|R
