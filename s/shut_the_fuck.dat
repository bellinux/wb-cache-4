[...] The chorus, repeated three times, states that he [...] "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several drugs.|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

2500|$|In the offseason, the Celtics' Big 3 {{was broken}} up {{following}} Ray Allen's joining of the Heat. When {{asked about their}} immediate reactions to their teammate leaving for their rival, Kevin Garnett claimed that he deleted Allen's phone number, while Paul Pierce admitted that it [...] "hurt", though he still considers Allen [...] "a brother to me" [...] for their 2008 championship run. Although the two teams would not meet in the playoffs, the animosity continued in their four regular season games. The season opener – a Heat victory – included Rondo clothes-lining Wade's neck, Garnett snubbing a handshake from Allen pre-game, and Garnett throwing an elbow at Mario Chalmers. During Miami's 2013 Streak, Paul Pierce went on record {{to say that he}} wished for Miami to lose all of its remaining games by that point. When James voiced his displeasure over the Chicago Bulls' physicality against him, Boston's general manager Danny Ainge called it [...] "embarrassing" [...] for LeBron to complain about it. Pat Riley, the Heat team president, retorted that [...] "Danny should <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> up." [...] The teams met during the Streak, where it was five years to the day that the Celtics' stopped the Houston Rockets' own 20+-game winning streak. It ended in a Heat victory, one that featured James dunking on Jason Terry; he received a technical foul for staring down at Terry post-dunk. When asked about it after the game by reporters, James stated that he was [...] "glad it happened to him." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{group also}} created a series of videos in this period. Pilot (1977) was {{commissioned}} by TVOntario, Test Tube (1979) was created during a residency at the De Appel Gallery and produced for Dutch television. <b>Shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Up (1984) was likewise commissioned by De Appel, this time in collaboration with Time Based Arts, also for Dutch television. Pilot, an appropriation of the documentary format, is a further elaboration of the General Idea identity. Test Tube (a faux-soap opera, complete with commercials) and <b>Shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Up are deconstructions of and confrontations with the media distortion of the persona of the artist.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes Springsteen {{felt the}} need to {{reiterate}} parts of the message after subsequent songs, especially if Brooocing continued.
