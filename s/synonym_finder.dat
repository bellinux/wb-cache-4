The primary methodology {{of the assessment}} process is proposition level exact matching, which can identify correct and incorrect propositions clearly and can report the results immediately. An additional method is a synonym matching for measuring the label of the incorrect proposition. After using the proposition level exact matching, the incorrect proposition {{will be sent to}} the <b>synonym</b> <b>finder</b> such as WordNet (Kornilakis et al., 2004; Harrison et al., 2004). In this case, the <b>synonym</b> <b>finder</b> will annotate a value (density value) of label word of the incorrect proposition. So, the automatic assessment will generate a total score of the map that includes proposition level exact matching score and synonym matching score. The synonym matching is the additional assessment when the system provides the extra component such as blank cards to learners.|$|E
