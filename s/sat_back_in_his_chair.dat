60|$|Sir Patrick <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and {{stretched}} out his legs luxuriously.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilding <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and looked}} at him, his face inexpressibly shocked.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Templeton <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> frowning; {{but more}} from utter bewilderment now than anger.|$|E
60|$|Trenchard {{replenished}} it {{with the}} utmost promptness, then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tall chair and pulled a moment at the fresh pipe with which he had equipped himself.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Selingman <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> place. He {{was staring}} at his {{companion}} with wide-open eyes. Jean Coulois was moistening his lips with his tongue, his eyes were brilliant.|$|R
60|$|He waved {{away the}} attendants, drank a deep draught from the cup at his elbow, wiped {{his mouth with}} the back of <b>his</b> hand, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tall chair to hear her.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> His {{long fingers}} played nervously together, {{he looked at}} her gravely.|$|E
60|$|The Governor <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> with a grunt. His secretary, on his {{immediate}} right, leaned towards him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{and looked}} at the girl in amazement. She was rather young to have {{conceived}} such ideas.|$|E
60|$|Lord Arranmore spoke again. Still he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> high-backed chair, {{and still}} {{he spoke in}} measured, {{monotonous}} tones. But this time, if only their ears had been quick enough to notice it, there lay behind an emotion, held in check indeed, {{but every now and}} then quivering for expression. He had turned to Lady Caroom.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> place, {{his eyes}} fixed upon Louise. He was so anxious to {{understand}} her in all her moods and vagaries. He was forced to admit to himself that she had deliberately chosen not to take any portion of that drive home alone with him. And yet, as he looked back through the evening, he told himself that he was satisfied. He declined to feel even a shadow of discouragement.|$|R
60|$|The learned gentleman <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{seat and}} took a {{refreshing}} drink of rain water from a glass beside him, while a murmur of applause ran round the table. It was known and recognised that the speaker had done more than any living man to establish the fact that war is dangerous, that gunpowder, if heated, explodes, that fire burns, that fish swim, and other great truths without which {{the work of the}} peace endowment would appear futile.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and meeting}} the other's hatred with a gaze as steady as his own, {{replaced}} his pistol.|$|E
60|$|Mamie {{handed him}} her note. He read {{it without a}} word. When he had {{finished}} he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> thinking.|$|E
60|$|Strong {{as was his}} composure, {{the lawyer}} <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{with a sort of}} solid stupefaction at which Paynter could not help smiling.|$|E
60|$|The guest seemed {{helpless}} {{to take his}} gaze from it, and he <b>sat</b> fallen <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair at it when the woman {{came in with a}} pie.|$|R
60|$|Sharkey had <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair with}} a ghastly face while {{he listened to the}} surgeon's words. He mopped himself with his red handkerchief, and wiped away the fatal dust with which he was smeared.|$|R
60|$|But now at last {{since the}} very blood <b>in</b> <b>his</b> body had <b>in</b> vain rebelled against his Titanic soul; now the only visible outward symbols of that soul--his eyes--did also turn downright traitors to him, and with more success than the rebellious blood. He had abused them so recklessly, that now they {{absolutely}} refused to look on paper. He turned them on paper, and they blinked and shut. The pupils of his eyes rolled away from him in their own orbits. He put his hand up to them, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat. Then, without saying one word, he continued there for his usual term, suspended, motionless, blank.|$|R
60|$|No more did the {{financier}} {{reveal his}} own feelings. He still <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> unmoved, in apparent contemplation. The posture was familiar to Langmaid.|$|E
60|$|The master <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{white and}} dumb. Incredible, extraordinary, and utterly unlooked for as was this revelation, he felt instinctively {{that it was}} true.|$|E
60|$|Having concluded, Monsieur de Garnache <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and threw}} one {{leg over the}} other, fixing his eyes upon the Seneschal's face and {{awaiting}} his reply.|$|E
60|$|Southward, {{through the}} country lanes whose hedges were still wreathed with late honeysuckle, {{on to the}} great mainroad, Deane's car was driven through the night,--always southward, till {{the lights of the}} great city flared before them up into the sky. Deane himself, for hour after hour, had <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> corner, buried <b>in</b> thought. <b>His</b> {{companion}} was even more invisible, but {{as the end of the}} journey drew near he roused himself with an effort, turned on the electric light which hung down from the roof of the car, lit a cigarette, and, bending forward, looked into the half-hidden face of the girl who was reclining by his side.|$|R
60|$|We {{all knew}} Isobel's history. It had taken barely twenty minutes to tell it, {{but they had}} been twenty minutes of tragedy. We were all, I think, in {{different}} ways affected. Monsieur Feurg√©res alone <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat like a carved image, his face white and haggard, his deep-set eyes fixed upon vacancy. We {{felt that he had}} passed wholly away from the world of present things. He himself was lingering amongst the shadows of that wonderful past, upon which he had only a moment before dropped the curtain. He had told us to ask him questions, but I for my part felt that questions just then were a sacrilege. Arthur, however, seemed to feel nothing of this. It was he who took the lead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't take you!" [...] {{he almost}} groaned. [...] "It's madness! It's impossible!" [...] And {{he went out}} into the passage. He ran down the steps and got into his cab. An immense time seemed to pass before it began to move. It started at last, and Hilary <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> it, <b>his</b> hands clenched, still as a dead man.|$|R
60|$|He ceased, {{and there}} was silence. M. de Rivarol <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> the {{feathered}} end of a quill between his teeth. Presently {{he cleared his throat}} and asked a question.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> wearily, {{with his}} chin sunk upon his chest. For a time he did not think, and then, he read again the {{sentence}} {{in front of his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|He eyed me sardonically for a moment, as if enjoying in {{anticipation}} {{the pleasure of}} compelling me against my will. He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and threw one heavily-booted leg across the other.|$|E
6000|$|Pat's face {{suddenly}} sobered {{and rising}} {{to his feet}} he strode over to where Upton <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{his feet on the}} desk, and swung a big fist, hard as nails, perilously close to Upton's nose. [...] "Take ut back, ye little spalpeen," [...] he commanded. [...] "Take ut back and tell me ye loike me betther for what I am than for what I was!" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{his seat}} by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching. He {{had a reason}} of his own {{connected}} with a pet building scheme, for observing Bosinney. The architect might do for his purpose; he looked clever, as he <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, moodily making little ramparts with bread-crumbs. Soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut, but too small, as though made many years ago.|$|R
60|$|As {{the words}} fell, deliberately, yet without hesitation, from his lips, vivid, scathing, forceful, {{there was not}} one there but knew that this man spoke of the things which he had felt. The facts he marshalled before them were appalling, but not a soul doubted them. It was truth which he hurled at them, truth before which the Bishop <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat and felt his cheeks grow paler and his eyes more full of trouble. A great deal of it they had heard before, but never like this--never had it been driven home into their {{conscience}} so that doubt or evasion was impossible. And this man, who was he? They rubbed their eyes and wondered. Ninth Marquis of Arranmore, owner of great estates, dilettante, sportsman, cynic, latter-day sinner--or an apostle touched with fire from Heaven to open men's eyes, gifted for a few brief minutes with the tongue of a saintly Demosthenes. Those who knew him gaped like children and wondered. And all the time his words stung them like drops of burning rain.|$|R
60|$|The {{time came}} when speech failed James Boyd, and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> brooding. Elizabeth, cross and wounded, sat in hers, nursing Joseph. And so, in a dim light, time flowed by.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} head once more, {{suddenly}} clasped her hand, his eyes came to consciousness, his hand relaxed, he recognized her, and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> turning his face aside and lowering his lashes.|$|E
6000|$|The explanation, as {{an effect}} {{immediately}} produced, did proportionately {{much for the}} visitor, who <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> with a pleased--a distinctly exhilarated--sense both of what he himself and what Nanda had done. [...] "You're an adorable family!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He saw {{the priest}} bend down and kiss {{the altar and}} then face about and bless all the people. All crossed {{themselves}} and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bench. The priest {{came down from the}} altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{sat down}} to the little hired cottage piano that {{occupied}} {{the corner of the}} neat small room, and began to run his deft fingers lightly over the keys. It was the Butterfly fantasia. The father <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> red easy-chair, listening with all his ears, first critically, then admiringly, at last enthusiastically. As Arthur's closing notes died away softly towards the end, the old shoemaker's delight could be restrained no longer. 'Artie,' he cried, gloating over it, 'that's music! That's real music! You're quite right, my boy; that's far and away the best thing you've ever written. It's exquisite--so light, so airy, so unearthlike. But, Artie, there's more than that in it. There's soul in it; and I know what it means. You don't deceive your poor old Progenitor in a matter of musical inspiration, I can tell you. I know where you got that fantasia from as well as if I'd seen you getting it. You got it out of your own heart, my boy, out of your own heart. And the thing it says to me as plain as language is just this--you're in love! You're in love, Artie, and there's no good denying it. If any man ever wrote that fantasia without being in love at the time--first love--ecstasy--tremor--tiptoe of expectation--why, then, I tell you, music hasn't got {{such a thing as a}} tongue or a meaning in it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Dictation over, {{with its}} need of sitting and {{thinking}} instead of bustling around {{and making a}} noise and really doing something, Babbitt <b>sat</b> creakily <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> revolving desk-chair and beamed on Miss McGoun. He was conscious {{of her as a}} girl, of black bobbed hair against demure cheeks. A longing which was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled him. While she waited, tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the desk-tablet, he half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams. He imagined their eyes meeting with terrifying recognition; imagined touching her lips with frightened reverence and--She was chirping, [...] "Any more, Mist' Babbitt?" [...] He grunted, [...] "That winds it up, I guess," [...] and turned heavily away.|$|R
