40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which four calcium carbonate biomineral systems share common characteristics. Within the sample set, there is a range of ultrastructures and two types of calcium carbonate polymorph (calcite and aragonite). The mini survey includes three invertebrate systems: two members of the Phylum Brachiopoda; the articulated brachiopod Terebratulina retusa (Subphylum Rhynchoenlliformea) and the inarticulated brachiopod Novocrania anomala (Subphylum Craniiformea), {{and a member of the}} Mollusca, the bivalve Mytilus edulis. The fourth, outlying vertebrate system, is the eggshell of the domestic fowl, Gallus gallus. The minor element composition of each of the four systems is considered in the context of mineral ultrastructure. The shell of T. retusa comprises two layers; a primary <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> acicular <b>calcite</b> and an underlying secondary <b>layer</b> composed <b>of</b> <b>calcite</b> fibres. In thin section, a variation between the upper and lower portions <b>of</b> the secondary <b>layer</b> is evident. The concentrations of magnesium, sulphur and strontium are significantly greater in the primary <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the shell. Magnesium concentration also differs between the upper and lower regions <b>of</b> the secondary <b>layer</b> with higher concentration in the upper portion <b>of</b> the secondary <b>layer.</b> The shell <b>of</b> N. anomala consists of two layers; a primary <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> acicular <b>calcite</b> and a secondary <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>calcite</b> semi-nacre.

The tank which contained only MgO had severe clogging problems from the beginning, and showed a poor chemical performance.

50|$|When the egg {{is buried}} deeply enough, the {{bacteria}} decomposing the egg are {{cut off from}} oxygen and begin to power their metabolisms using different energy sources. These processes can result in certain minerals being precipitated out of the groundwater selectively. The bacteria also dispose of metabolic waste using ions. Ken Carpenter observes that one common method links Co2 to Ca2+ ions to produce calcium carbonate. Some of the bacteria involved in the decay process use the conversion of nitrogento ammonia to power their metabolisms. When this ammonia leaks out of the egg it raises the surrounding pH into the alkaline and can change what minerals will precipitate out of the water. The organic material in the eggshell itself {{can lead to the}} precipitation <b>of</b> <b>calcite</b> out <b>of</b> solution. This often causes fossil eggshell to be covered in a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>calcite</b> that complicates the identification process. However, since eggshells are usually chiefly composed <b>of</b> <b>calcite</b> anyway the eggshell itself is mostly composed <b>of</b> the original <b>calcite</b> it had in life.

Amino acid sequence analysis showed the protein to consist of 134 amino acids and to contain three sequence repeats of ∼ 40 amino acids which were {{very similar to the}} well-known whey acidic protein domains of other proteins. The new protein was therefore named perlwapin. In addition to the major sequence, we identified several minor variants. Atomic force microscopy was used to explore the interaction <b>of</b> perlwapin with <b>calcite</b> crystals. Monomolecular <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>calcite</b> crystals dissolve very slowly in deionized water and recrystallize in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution. When perlwapin was dissolved in the supersaturated calcium carbonate solution, growth of the crystal was inhibited immediately. Perlwapin molecules bound tightly to distinct step edges, preventing the crystal layers from growing. Using lower concentrations of perlwapin in a saturated calcium carbonate solution, we could distinguish native, active perlwapin molecules from denaturated ones. These observations showed that perlwapin can act as a growth inhibitor for calcium carbonate crystals in saturated calcium carbonate solution. The function of perlwapin in nacre growth may be to inhibit the growth of certain crystallographic planes in the mineral phase of the polymer/mineral composite nacre...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the variability of these isotopic compositions and to evaluate the potential of brachiopods as a proxy of past seawater d 26 Mg values. The two investigated brachiopod shells present the same range of d 26 Mg variation (up to 2 per mil). This variation cannot be ascribed to changes in environmental parameters (temperature or pH).

Red, dark red, pink, yellow, white, black and grey colours were used in the tomb in order to create paintings, which now represent a very precious record of the Etruscan art of wall painting in a hypogeal environment. The technical features of the painting were revealed by stratigraphy using optical and electronic microscopy.

The SEM-EDS and FTIR analyses showed that red and yellow ochre, calcite and vegetable charcoal were used to paint the walls of the tomb: the pigments, either alone or mixed together, were utilized to produce pure colours (red, yellow, white and black) and intermediate tonalities (pink, dark red, grey).
