500|$|Some {{changes were}} made to the initial plot of Virtue's Last Reward. During one scene, Dio {{handcuffs}} Clover and Tenmyouji to a sink, which prevents them from participation in the Nonary Game (the punishment for not participating is death). Originally, Dio was meant to [...] "do <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> messed up" [...] to Clover, but the president of Chunsoft opposed this scene for [...] "ethical reasons", after which it was changed. While the game ends in the year 2029 with humanity dying out and Sigma aspiring to change the future, Uchikoshi later felt this ending alone was inappropriate following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. He added an extended, non-canonical ending featuring Kyle to lighten the mood. Uchikoshi also considered including several scientific and philosophical concepts that eventually were left out. These scrapped ideas included the Monty Hall problem, a brain teaser based on probability; and the Capgras delusion, a mental disorder in which someone believes that a person they know has been replaced with an identical-looking impostor.|$|E

500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Derbyshire, culture {{editor of}} the New Statesman called it [...] "a {{remarkable}} novel" [...] and its protagonist [...] "a convincing witness to the defining moral catastrophe of the 20th century." [...] Tim Martin of The Telegraph praised the novel for not being just another story about banality of evil: [...] "it is a magnificently artificial project in character construction, a highly literary and provocative {{attempt to create a}} character various enough to match the many discontinuous realities of the apocalyptic Nazi world-view. The result is a sprawling, daring, loose-ended monster of a book, one that justifies its towering subject matter by its persistent and troubling refusal to offer easy answers and to make satisfying sense." [...] Writing for The Guardian, British author James Lasdun criticized the novel for [...] "some large flaws" [...] such as its main character, [...] "a ghoul belonging more to the fictional universe of, say, Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho", and provocative use of anachronisms, but called it a [...] "monumental inquiry into evil. To say that it falls short of Melville's visionary originality (and lacks, also, the breadth and vitality of Tolstoy, despite the claims of some reviewers) is hardly a criticism. It's a rare book that even invites such comparisons, and for all its faults, for all its problematic use of history, The Kindly Ones does just that." [...] In The Spectator, British journalist and biographer Patrick Marnham wrote: [...] "Dr Aue cannot be brought to trial because he does not exist; on the other hand, he can give us <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> valuable than vengeance, something that no real war criminal can manage, and that is total honesty." [...] Harvard University's English studies' Professor Leland de la Durantaye wrote that The Kindly Ones [...] "is indeed about cruelty and evil in the way that morality plays are, but it is also about evil in history, the weaving together of hundreds of objectives, millions of people, into an ensemble so vast, diverse, and ever-changing that even a well-placed and sharp-sighted observer cannot fully grasp it." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{significant}} difference {{from the way the}} practice has developed in North America with the associated threat. In Scotland and Ireland, the children are only supposed to receive treats if they perform a party trick for the households they go to.

Occasionally a more talented child may do card tricks, play the mouth organ, or <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> impressive, but most children will earn plenty of treats even with something very simple.

2500|$|In 1937, the German Ministry of Aviation {{issued a}} {{specification}} for a short-range, three-seat reconnaissance aircraft {{with a good}} allround view to support the German army in the field, replacing the Henschel Hs 126, which had just entered service. [...] A power of about 850–900hp (630–670kW) was specified. The specification was issued to Arado and Focke-Wulf. [...] Arado's design, the Ar 198, which was initially the preferred option, was a relatively conventional single-engined high-wing monoplane with a glazed gondola under the fuselage. [...] Focke-Wulf's chief designer Kurt Tank's design, the Fw 189, was a twin-boom design, powered by two Argus As 410 engines instead of with an expected single engine. As a [...] "twin-boom" [...] design like the earlier Dutch Fokker G.I from 1938, the Fw 189 used a central crew gondola for its crew accommodation, which for the Fw 189 would be designed with a heavily glazed and framed [...] "stepless" [...] cockpit forward section, which used no separate windscreen panels for the pilot (as with many German medium bombers from 1938 onwards). Blohm & Voss, however, proposed as a private venture <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> radical: chief designer Dr. Richard Vogt's unique asymmetric BV 141.

2500|$|Most {{of these}} {{practices}} {{were accompanied by}} a loud utterance of ritual texts, which had their own semantics, symbolism and structure. Standing {{in the yard and}} facing the cloud, farmers would address the cloud himself, or hail, prodigy, the unholy power, ala, drowned or hanged persons (usually calling by name someone like that from their region), and others. People tried to deflect the horrific bringer of clouds from their fields, by scaring him off with <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> appalling that was allegedly present in their village.

Do not go, prodigy, on prodigy: we have a huge prodigy!" [...] These texts often contained the idea of hail clouds as cattle, usually white: [...] "OSava and Nevena, turn back those white cattle! There is no pasture for them here! We only have ashes to put their eyes out!" [...] Uttering this, they would spill the ashes of the fire on which a česnica had been baked for Christmas, into the wind.

Club gave the episode a C-, the lowest grade given by the website to the show thus far: [...] "The show is so stupid that it thinks we're stupid, prays we're stupid; cross its fingers and hopes like hell that its legion of loyal, obsessive followers will rend their garments at the horrible death of a fan favorite, but still be back next week." [...] According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, [...] "This was, to put it mildly, uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with <b>something</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] "I've {{had a lot of}} issues with The Walking Dead of late — especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale — but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a “fan” of the show until tonight". Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: [...] "Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones -- not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience." [...] Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote in his review, [...] "It was miserable, and tedious, and made me feel bad. Not in an emotionally compelling way, just in a 'I could be watching something of value' way", and he graded the episode D-.

The eight front teeth are spatulate and peg-like, and served as incisors that were used to nip off mouthfuls of vegetation. The broad, blunt cheek teeth show extensive wear associated with occlusion, and would have functioned as molars, grinding up the food.

The difference is exemplified by the difference between Marx and Rousseau: the latter sentimental and soft, appealing to emotion, obliterating sharp outlines; the former systematic like Hegel, full of hard intellectual content, appealing to historic necessity and the technical development of industry, suggesting a view of human beings as puppets in the grip of omnipotent material forces.
