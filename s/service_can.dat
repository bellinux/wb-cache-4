5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their <b>service</b> <b>can</b> mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E

30|$|CASCADAS {{offers a}} {{versatile}} service-framework {{focused on the}} self-organization and self-adaptation of services. The framework was designed considering a set of fundamental ingredients: situation-awareness, semantics self-organization, and self-similar modular design. <b>Services</b> <b>can</b> form topic-specific clusters through dynamic SLAs, giving rise to service-based, self-assembly applications. In other words, <b>services</b> <b>can</b> synchronize actions to provide the desired self-emergent behavior. <b>Services</b> <b>can</b> adapt themselves to changes in context. Through this feature, <b>services</b> <b>can</b> become specialized in a certain topic. They can also self-monitor, self-heal, and self-protect agains threats. Whenever they are instantiated, <b>services</b> <b>can</b> establish connections with other services and initialize self-* algorithms.|$|R

5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the <b>service</b> <b>can</b> lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest <b>Service</b> <b>can</b> take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E
