Limestone caprocks are formed during salt dome ascent by: • Accumulation of disseminated anhydrite due to salt dissolution, • Conversion of anhydrite and hydrocarbon to calcite and sulfides by sulfate reducing bacteria...|$|E
40|$|If an {{incident}} wavefield hits a curved interface that possesses certain inflection points, there may exist "nonspecular" {{events in the}} reflected field that cannot be explained by real ray theory. The magnitude of such events can reach {{the order of the}} specular ones and can be expressed in terms of specular reflections at certain points on the analytic continuation of the interface. In fact, specular reflected "complex rays," connecting complex reflection points with the observation point, are used to explain such events. Previous results obtained for acoustic calculations, involving {{an incident}} plane wave and a perfectly soft reflector, are extended to arbitrary velocity and density contrasts, as well as to an incident far-field cylindrical wavefield. Moreover, the agreement between analytic results and independent computations using a finite-differences scheme is shown. It confirms the existence of nonspecular reflections. The interpreter of a seismic section should, therefore, be aware of not attributing a subsurface interface to a nonspecular reflection, e. g., at a flank of a <b>saltdome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Digital {{analysis}} of seismic images {{is a key}} component in the automation of seismic data interpretation. Other authors have explored using curvature as an attribute {{in this kind of}} analysis, but only on data which has been manually interpreted. In this project the subject is the use of curvature as a feature for automatic highlighting of saltdomes in seismic images. Saltdomes are of particular interest in seismic exploration, as they are often linked to hydrocarbon finds. By using the so-called dip to extract discrete curve segments representing the seismic horizons in the image, the local curvature may be estimated. This in turn requires approxi- mation of first and second order derivatives. Derivative approximation is done by locally fitting a parabola to each data point, and approximating the derivatives in that point by the derivatives of the parabola. The presented method is applied to a set of inline seismic <b>saltdome</b> images. The results show the saltdomes clearly highlighted from their surroundings, with distinct areas of positive and negative curvature values...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present initial results of {{applying}} Time-Reversed Acoustics (TRA) technology to <b>saltdome</b> flank, seismic imaging. We created {{a set of}} synthetic traces representing a multilevel, walkaway VSP for a model composed of a simplified Gulf of Mexico vertical-velocity gradient and an embedded salt dome. We first applied the concepts of TRA to the synthetic traces to create a set of redatummed traces without having to perform velocity analysis, moveout corrections, or complicated processing. Each redatummed trace approximates the output of a zero-offset, downhole source and receiver pair. To produce the final salt-dome flank image, we then applied conventional, poststack, depth migration to the zero-offset section. Our results show a very good image of the salt when compared to an image derived using data from a downhole, zero-offset source and receiver pairs. The simplicity of our TRA implementation provides a virtually automated method to estimate a zero-offset, seismic section {{as if it had}} been collected from the reference frame of the borehole containing the VSP survey.

40|$|In {{this joint}} {{research}} programme {{the significance of}} groundwater colloids in far field radionuclide migration has been studied. The characterization, quantification and theoretical interpretation of colloid-borne transport phenomena for radionuclides were the main objectives of this research programme. Groundwaters, colloids and sediments were sampled from aquifer system overlying a <b>saltdome</b> in the Gorleben area in northern Germany and were characterized by various analytical methods (ICP-MS, ICP-AES, neutron activation analysis (NAA), DOC-Analyser, HPIC, potentiometric titration). Different natural isotopes (" 2 H, " 3 H, " 1 " 3 C, " 1 " 4 C, " 1 " 8 O, " 3 " 4 S, U/Th decay series) were determined and their ratios were compared {{with one another in}} the order to ascertain the provenance of the groundwater colloids. The investigated groundwaters contain substantial amounts of colloids mainly composed of humic and fulvic acids loaded with various metal ions. The chemical interaction of radionuclide ions of various oxidation states (Am, Eu, for M(III), Th, Pu for M(IV), Np for M(V) and U for M(VI)) with groundwater colloids was investigated in order to elucidate the colloid facilitated migration behaviour of actinides in a given aquifer system. Transport process studies with generated pseudocolloids of radionuclides in various oxidation states were undertaken in scaled column experiments, pre-equilibrated with colloid rich Gorleben groundwater. A modelling programme was developed to predict chemical transport of radionuclides in the presence of humic colloids using {{a modified version of the}} CHEMTARD code. Modelling predictions have generated acceptable results for Eu, Am and U and poorer agreement between experimental and modelling results for Th and Np as a result of more limited data. (orig.)
