The exploitation and proper management of fisheries resources to improve the economic condition of local inhabitants was the primary objective. Geographically scattered nature and remoteness of the islands turned out to be real hurdles in the implementation of fishery development schemes. During the sixtees, fishing had been by primitive methods of harpooning, confined to the lagoon and reef areas.

40|$|Avariety {{of efforts}} are {{currently}} underway to develop {{alternatives to the}} neoclassical paradigm and neoclassical analysis of economic behavior. Here, the author seeks not to argue which approach is most productive, but to demonstrate the useful policy implications of adding key noneconomic (so- cial, psychological and political) variables to a paradigm that attempts to model economic behavior. This co-deterministic paradigm is called socio- economics. The article discusses the different and often insightful policy analysis that results from employing a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>set</b> of variables in four major areas: (1) allowing for shifting preferences; (2) including institu- tional contexts and influences within which individual transactions take place; (3) recognizing the effects of {{political as well as}} economic power differences; and (4) combining macro and structural policies.

40|$|Spatial {{sciences}} {{are confronted}} with increasing amounts of high-dimensional data. These data commonly exhibit spatial and temporal dimensions. To explore, extract, and generalize inherent patterns in large spatiotemporal data sets, clustering algorithms are indispensable. These clustering algorithms must account for the distinct special properties {{of space and time}} to outline meaningful clusters in such data sets. Therefore, this research develops a hierarchical method based on self-organizing maps. The hierarchical architecture permits independent modeling of spatial and temporal dependence. To exemplify the utility of the method, this research uses an artificial data <b>set</b> and a <b>socio-economic</b> data <b>set</b> of the Ostregion, Austria, from the years 1961 to 2001. The results for the artificial data set demonstrate that the proposed method produces meaningful clusters that cannot be achieved when disregarding differences in spatial and temporal dependence.

30|$|Findings {{from this}} study have {{revealed}} {{that the majority of}} farmers think livestock keeping give more income than cropping. Farmers in the study area depend on livestock as the main source of income. However, diseases and drought pose serious threats to livestock keepers. Losses are attributable to morbidity, mortality and costs of disease treatment and control measures to meet national and international requirements. Epidemic diseases such as RVF, with few natural factors to limit their spread and experience in managing them bring great threat to livestock keepers. Tanzania has an estimated livestock population of 17 million cattle, 11 million goats, and 3.6 million sheep (Mohamed et al. 2010) most of which are located in the north and central regions of the country. These regions were severely affected by the 2006 – 07 RVF outbreak leading to disrupted <b>socio-economic</b> <b>setting</b> of all Tanzanians and more so livestock keepers who are completely dependent on livestock and their products.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a rise in}} premarital and extra-marital sexual {{relations}} amongst some modern Zulus. The causes of this rise include the perpetual childhood of women in society and the political and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>setting</b> in South Africa. The results of this rise include teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. In Zulu traditional sexual practice the publicity of love affairs curbed sexual promiscuity. Many people {{were involved in the}} love affairs of young people. This tradition broke down because of the political, religious and socio-economic changes in South Africa. The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is sacred; it is an institution of God, a sacrament. Therefore premarital and extra-marital {{sexual relations}} taint the integrity of marriage. A number of things can be done to alleviate the problem of premarital and extramarital sexual promiscuity.

40|$|This study aims at {{exploring}} {{the relation between}} economic liberalisation and Egyptian foreign policy orientation. It argues that {{the roots of the}} restructuring of Egyptian foreign policy since 1970 could be traced in the process of transforming the populist statist model of managing the Egyptian political economy. The study of Egyptian foreign policy has been hitherto dominated by the psychological- perceptual analysis of the Egyptian presidents' belief systems. Implicit in such analyses is the assumption of a docile <b>socio-economic</b> <b>set</b> up and an omnipotent leader capable of making abrupt changes in the basic thrust and orientation of Egyptian foreign policy according to his preferences and perceptions. This study seeks to challenge this assumption. As opposed to the asocial conception of a transcendent leader deciding freely on foreign policy matters, major shifts in Egyptian attitudes and behaviour towards its regional and international environments, it will be argued, were deeply linked to, and largely dependent on, the transformation of the Egyptian political economy, as well as its pace. To this end, the thesis is divided into four chapters apart from the introduction and the conclusion. The first examines the foreign policy implications of the populist statist model that prevailed during the 1950 s and 1960 s as well as the origins of the restructuring process. The second, third and fourth discuss the first wave of restructuring during the 1970 s, the hesitant decade of slow transformation (the 1980 s), and the second wave of restructuring {{in the aftermath of the}} Gulf war respectively. The focus of analysis will remain throughout the study on the exploring patterns of interaction between transforming the political economy and reorienting foreign policy...|$|R
40|$|Although {{violence}} by men against women in Bangladesh occurs {{in most cases}} within the home, in a larger sense it does not originate in the home nor persist only within the home. It is simply one element {{in a system that}} subordinates women through social norms that define women's place and guide their conduct. This paper uses ethnographic and structured survey data from a study in rural Bangladesh to explore the relationship between domestic violence against women and their economic and social dependence. It describes some of the common situations in which violence against women occurs in Bangladeshi society, analyzes its larger context, and identifies factors that appear to lessen its incidence in this particular <b>socio-economic</b> <b>setting.</b> The study findings suggest that group-based credit programs can reduce men's violence against women by making women's lives more public. The problem of men's violence against women is deeply rooted, however, and the authors argue that much more extensive interventions will be needed to significantly undermine it. domestic violence violence against women gender Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|Entrepreneurship {{research}} concerning networks {{has largely}} focused on network structure, content and governance.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the existence, importance, values and meanings of both the informal and formal networks and networking behaviours of small-scale hotel owner-managers embedded in the socio-economic context of Croatia. In order to gain richer and more detailed understanding of entrepreneurial networks and to understand the influence of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>setting</b> on entrepreneurial networking, we have employed qualitative, in-depth study with small hotel owners. Results suggest that entrepreneurs do not establish strong personal and firm-to-firm ties, but rather focus on formal associations. Reported findings identify socio-cultural factors apparently unique to the context of former socialist economy which have the potential to explain the reported networking behaviour. The adopted research approach brings another dimension to existing theoretical underpinnings, which can encourage researchers to extend or revise theories with new contextual variables. ...|$|E
40|$|Following its {{translation}} {{into more}} than thirty languages, Roberto Saviano’s non-fiction novel, ‘Gomorrah’, has unveiled the endless saga of Naples’ crime syndicate to {{a vast number of}} readers across the globe. Literary critics and reviewers in the UK and in the US have widely acclaimed Saviano’s talent in depicting the corruption plaguing Naples’ gloomy and degraded hinterland, although the socio-cultural context portrayed in ‘Gomorra’ is naturally distant from the repertoire of the target culture: the text is widely populated by culture-bound concepts and implicit meanings, which further complicates the translation process. Through a contrastive analysis of the Italian and English versions of the exposé, the study explores the strategies employed in translating the voices and deeds of Naples’ mobsters, as well as the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>setting</b> of the Camorra (from which the book’s title originates its bitter play on words).

40|$|This {{article is}} based on joint research, between {{academics}} from South Africa and Sweden, comparing the influence of South African and Swedish teachers' attitudes towards the practical application of inclusive education (IE) in the classroom. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify and investigate problem areas pertaining to teachers' attitudes to IE. Attitudes often relate to interaction with others. This study departs from Festiger's theory of cognitive dissonance, which deals with the influence of people's attitudes and attitude change. In this research teachers from South Africa and Sweden completed the same questionnaire on perceptions pertaining to IE in their school system. A number of attitude-constructs were derived from the data via exploratory factor analysis methodology. Attitude-constructs included policy issues and specialised support; practical implementation of IE; teacher support structures; teachers' receptiveness of IE implementation; feasibility of proposed IE practices; and role of special schools in an IE environment. Negative responses to some of the attitude constructs identified problem areas in Swedish and South African inclusive systems.

Since a national crisis is no other than the totality of its rural crises manifesting in, among others, a fall in rural productivity and income, chronic rural poverty, rural unemployment and under- employment, rural – urban migration, collapse of basic infrastructural needs etc. Maigana offers and demonstrates empirical insights into the practical condition of Nigeria’s rural malaise. Whereas analysis of the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>setting</b> of a rural community can not be complete and accurate without being placed within the orbit of the State and international capital, it is rather not unusual that the various World Bank/IMF ‘solutions’, adopted by the Nigerian State, further worsen the rural crisis.

Thus, the growth in rural studies has considerably increased since the mid 1970 s sequel t...|$|E

40|$|Of the 85 {{psychiatric}} patients {{taken for}} the study 45 (52. 9 %) had physical illnesses. Results showed that 84. 4 % physically ill patients remained unrecognised {{at the time of}} psychiatric consultation. A significantly higher percentage of physically ill patients were drawn from larger families of lower socio-economic status. Significantly higher number of physically ill patients had psychiatric problems of longer duration. Severe type of physical illnesses were mainly found in schizophrenics. Respiratory system was most frequently involved. The presence of physical illness in psychiatric patients not only creates problems in the diagnosis and treatment but often complicates the course of both psychiatric as well as physical illnesses. The presence of physical illnesses increases the mortality risks in psychiatric patients. Sims and Prior (1978) demonstrated an excess of deaths in neurotic patients due to diseases of central nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems. Physical morbidity in psychiatric patients is reported to be much higher than the expected rate in general population. Estimates of incidence of physical illness that existed in psychiatric patients ranged from 33 % to 66 % (Johnson 1968). Marshal (1949) reported that no fewer than 44 % of patients admitted in a psychiatric unit had some physical problems requiring attention. Similarly Mcguire and Granville-Grossman (1968) found 33. 5 % of 200 consecutive inpatients to have medical illnesses, 70 % of which were severe and 49 % had illnesses which were previously unknown to either the patient or his physician.
