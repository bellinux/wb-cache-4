The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom told her that it needed <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E
5|$|The tale shows Potter at {{her best}} in {{depicting}} {{the life of}} the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one of <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based– the foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable– is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wider}} countercultural {{context of the}} time, with disillusion {{increasingly}} rife with each post-Woodstock rock event, commentators viewed the concerts as, {{in the words of}} Rolling Stone, [...] "a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties". Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden likened it to a [...] "rediscovery of faith", adding: [...] "Harrison had put rock music back on course." [...] Among Harrison's biographers, Alan Clayson describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as [...] "the George Harrison Moment", while Gary Tillery has written: [...] "The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison's stature as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a major celebrity...

They helped to redefine the album as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a few hits padded out with [...] "filler", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a [...] "major breakthrough... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.|$|E

Contrary to this exposition however, the Hebrew Bible supports the descriptions of Sheol which {{suggest that it is}} <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a place. In terms of sheer numbers the amount of anthropomorphic descriptions is significant. [...] Sheol is either portrayed by means of human qualities ( [...] , Job 26:6; [...] , Canticles 8:6 [...] desire isaiah 5:14) or attributed with the elements of human anatomy: womb ( [...] , Jonah 2:3), hand ( [...] , Psalms 49:15; 89:48; Hosea 13:14) and mouth ( [...] , Psalms 141:7; Isaiah 5:14).

5000|$|Gallagher's 1974 tour of Ireland {{coincided with}} one of the most tumultuous times in Belfast. Violence from IRA was erupting {{throughout}} the city even at rock concerts. As a result, most rock acts refused to play in the city. The day before Gallagher's scheduled concert in Belfast ten bombs went off at various locations around the city. Everyone expected Gallagher to cancel as all the other big names had but he went on with the concert and was rewarded {{with one of}} his best shows.

2500|$|Many of the {{characters}} in An Island are parodies of Blake's friends and acquaintances, although there is considerable critical disagreement as to whom some characters represent. Indeed, some scholars question the usefulness of trying to discover whom any of them represent. Northrop Frye, for example, argues [...] "{{the characters}} are not so much individuals as representatives of the various types of [...] "reasoning" [...] which are satirised." [...] Peter Ackroyd also suggests that understanding whom the characters represent is less important than understanding the satire {{at the heart of the}} piece. Similarly, Nick Rawlinson argues that trying to attach the characters to specific people [...] "limits the scope of the work to the eighteenth-century equivalent of a scurrilous email [...] it is reasonable to assume that the various characters stand for <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> amusing personality sketches [...] It may be more helpful to see the characters as a reflection not just of a real person but also of an attitude Blake wishes to question." ...|$|E

[...] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote, [...] "In {{the same way that the}} original 1979 Mad Max was the Citizen Kane of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema, Mad Max: Fury Road may well be the Götterdämmerung of drive-in movies. It has its roots in the Western and the post-apocalyptic road-rage action saga , where Miller dares anyone else to follow in his tire treads." [...] IGN reviewer Scott Collura gave the film 9.2 out of 10, saying: [...] "The over-the-top stunts and eccentric characters and designs are all hugely important to Fury Road, ... but it's the overriding sense of the film's uniqueness, its striving to be <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> another action movie, that is most impressive." ...|$|E
