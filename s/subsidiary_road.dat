40|$|One of {{the aims}} of outdoor {{lighting}} public spaces such as pathways and <b>subsidiary</b> <b>roads</b> is to help pedestrians to evaluate the intentions of other people. This paper discusses how a pedestrians’ appraisal of another persons’ intentions in artificially lit outdoor environments can be studied. We review the visual cues that might be used, and the experimental design with which effects of changes in lighting could be investigated to best resemble the pedestrian experience in artificially lit urban environments. Proposals are made to establish appropriate operationalisation of the identified visual cues, choice of methods and measurements representing critical situations. It is concluded that the intentions of other people should be evaluated using facial emotion recognition; eye tracking data suggest a tendency to make these observations at an interpersonal distance of 15 m and for a duration of 500 ms. Photographs are considered suitable for evaluating the effect of changes in light level and spectral power distribution. To support investigation of changes in spatial distribution further investigation is needed with 3 D targets. Further data are also required to examine the influence of glare...|$|R

40|$|Multinational {{enterprises}} {{often seem}} to be on a ‘roller coaster’ when managing their operations in transition economies, especially because of the volatile business and political environment. The study analyses the subtle equilibrium between formal control and day-to-day coordination in the Headquarters-Subsidiary (HQ-S) relationship of more than 70 subsidiaries of large multinational companies in Poland, taking the cultural differences between the headquarters and subsidiary country into account. It is concluded that in the best performing multinationals, strategic and operational control mechanisms are tightly organised, building a platform on which intensive coordination and attuning occurs to deal with the day-to-day management challenges. Interestingly, also for entering new markets, a prospector strategy focusing on innovation shows better results than copying of competitors. However, it also reveals that there is no simple and uniform recipe for managing <b>subsidiaries.</b> The <b>road</b> from governance to performance is not a one-way street, creating flexibility and learning capabilities at the subsidiary level clearly contribute to the success of international operations. ...|$|R

The pace at which new turnpikes were created picked up in the 1750s as trusts were formed to maintain the cross-routes between the Great Roads radiating from London. Roads leading into some provincial towns, particularly in Western England, were put under single trusts and key roads in Wales were turnpiked. In South Wales, the roads of complete counties were put under single turnpike trusts in the 1760s. A further surge of trust formation occurred in the 1770s, with the turnpiking of <b>subsidiary</b> connecting <b>roads,</b> routes over new bridges, new routes in the growing industrial areas and roads in Scotland.

Under his direction Kilmer {{developed into a}} multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and <b>subsidiaries</b> covered <b>road</b> building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer’s road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer’s wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited. Tanenbaum served as Chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada’s largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren’s activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America’s largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada.

However, in a span of six years and five promotions, he had risen to the rank of general manager, which in this scenario was the equivalent to chief operating officer. He held this position for another six years, until 1984. His experience as general manager at Western Nigeria Television was not a waste when it came to climbing the ranks. He explained during our interview, [...] "No experience is lost if you value it well".Prior to him, no other Nigerian had risen to that level in the organisation. At the time he joined Total they were ranked number three in Nigeria in terms of productivity amongst the petroleum companies. Eleven years later when he was promoted from his position as general manager (In this scenario he was the chief operating officer), the brand had risen to be number one in Nigeria.For his next assignment, Engineer Oyeleye was asked to help set up several new ventures (similar to incubator companies) for Total. For the three years he spent in the role of Group Executive Director of Total Nigeria Subsidiaries, Engr. Oyeleye formed several successful subsidiaries that grew significantly in size.

Appointment of a separate Project Manager to look after client's interests from the inception is one of the arrangements used successfully in contract administration. In this research it was considered the Project Management approach could be used to administer the road and bridge construction works. Main objectives of this research were to establish the relevancy of the project management concept to road and bridge construction work and to study some cases and evaluate how this concept could be applied in road and bridge construction claims. For the purpose of achieving the first objective a literature survey and an opinion survey was carried out. Results showed the necessity of a separate Project Manager for the road and bridge construction work and the requirement of an independent Project Manager for large Projects.

Independent Consultants and Contractors were handling some of the road and Bridge construction works procured through competitive tenders that was mainly foreign funded projects. After the closure of RC & DC in December 2003, the works which could not be handled by RDA directly were given on contract following the procurement procedures provided in government tender guidelines. Those contracts were categorized as foreign and locally funded projects. In contracts administration claim situations are common due to disputes with parties where independent consultants administrate the works of independent contractors. The appointment of an independent consultant to work as the contract administrator is one of the important arrangements in contract Administration. It was examined in this research how far the Construction Project Management approach could be used to minimize delays in claim situation in road and bridge construction works. The main objective of this research is to study how far the Construction Project Management concepts can be used for road and bridge construction works while evaluating selected case studies to see how this concept could be applied in road and bridge construction claims. To full fill this purpose a literature survey was carried out.

These were a Saint Paul to Duluth daytime train known only as Trains 62 and 63 (discontinued June 1961); the overnight Chicago to Duluth Laker and its Saint Paul connection (both discontinued January 15, 1965); the Twin Cities to Winnipeg Winnipeger (discontinued March 25, 1967); and the Saint Paul to Portal, North Dakota Soo-Dominion that during the summer, ran through to Vancouver via a connection with Canadian Pacific Railway's The Dominion at Moose Jaw. It was discontinued in December 1963, and the western Canada cars were handled on the Winnipeger for two more summers before they too were pulled. The Soo Line's last passenger train was the Copper Country Limited, a joint service with the Milwaukee Road inherited from the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic. This Chicago-Champion-Calumet service was discontinued May 8, 1968. In addition there were several mixed trains, with additional ones created to enable the discontinuance of the Saint Paul to Portal passenger train. Some mixed train services gained notoriety because passengers were conveyed in one direction only.In 1984, CP incorporated the Soo Line Corporation in Minnesota as a holding company, exchanging stock in December to give the Soo Line Corporation total control over the railroad. Two months later, on February 19, 1985, the Soo Line purchased the property of the bankrupt Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and assigned it to a newly created <b>subsidiary,</b> The Milwaukee <b>Road,</b> Inc. This company and the MN&S were both merged into the Soo Line Railroad effective January 1, 1986. To cut costs, the Soo Line created the Lake States Transportation Division (LSTD) on February 10, 1986 to operate the less-important lines, including the ex-Wisconsin Central line between Chicago and the Twin Cities. Unable to implement its proposed labor rule changes, the Soo Line sold the approximately 2000 mi LSTD to a new regional railroad, Wisconsin Central Ltd., in 1987 for $133 million.
