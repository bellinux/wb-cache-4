40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we consider}} the throughput performance of cognitive radio networks and derive the optimal sensing and access schemes for secondary users that maximizes their sum-throughput while guaranteeing certain quality of service to primary networks. First, we consider a cognitive radio network where secondary users have access to N licensed primary frequency bands with their usage statistics and are subject to certain inter-network interference constraint. In particular, to limit the interference to the primary network, secondary users are equipped with <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensors</b> and are capable of sensing and accessing {{a limited number of}} channels at the same time. We consider both the error-free and erroneous spectrum sensing scenarios, and establish the jointly optimal random sensing and access scheme, which maximizes the secondary network expected sum throughput while honoring the primary interference constraint. We show that under certain conditions the optimal sensing and access scheme is independent of the primary frequency bandwidths and usage statistics; otherwise, they follow water-filling-like strategies. Next, we study the asymptotic performance of two multi-hop overlaid ad-hoc networks that utilize the same temporal, spectral, and spatial resources based on random access schemes. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users with density ?^(p) and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive radio users with density ?^(s) = (?^(p)) ^(?) that utilize the spectrum opportunistically. Both networks employ ALOHA medium access protocols where the secondary nodes are additionally equipped with range-limited perfect <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensors</b> to monitor and protect primary transmissions. We study the problem in two distinct regimes, namely ? > 1 and 0 1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing turns out to be redundant when ? < 1 and employing <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensors</b> cannot improve the networks performance. Finally, we present a methodology employing statistical analysis and stochastic geometry to study geometric routing schemes in wireless ad-hoc networks.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} opportunistic spectrum access under design constraints imposed at both node {{and link}} levels. First, hardware and energy limitations at node level may prevent a secondary user from sensing all the channels in the spectrum simultaneously. A channel selection strategy is thus necessary {{to track the}} time-varying spectrum opportunities. Second, sensing errors are inevitable. A secondary user needs to decide, based on imperfect sensing outcomes, whether to access the sensed channel and how to update its statistical knowledge of spectrum dynamics for better tracking in the future. Third, a secondary transmitter and its intended receiver need to hop synchronously in the spectrum in order to communicate. When a dynamic opportunity tracking strategy is used where the channel selection depends on the sensing history, achieving this synchrony is nontrivial {{in the absence of}} a dedicated control channel and in the presence of sensing errors. These practical constraints significantly complicate the design of opportunistic spectrum access, and the optimal performance requires the joint design of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensor,</b> opportunity tracking strategy, and spectrum access decisions. The focus of this paper is on developing lowcomplexity approaches for opportunistic spectrum access. We show that under certain conditions on the spectrum dynamics, simple myopic strategies can provide optimal performance for the joint design of <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensor,</b> opportunity tracking, and opportunity exploitation. We also propose an alternate lowcomplexity indexing strategy for other conditions that takes into account the expected time to channel availability.
