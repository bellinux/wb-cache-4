5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a bulldozer from the John F. Casey Company in Aspinwall, and a <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> from the Burrell Construction and Supply Company of New Kensington; and they dug the foundation for a two-level building.|$|E
25|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> {{is a large}} steam-powered {{excavating}} machine {{designed for}} lifting and moving material such as rock and soil, typically in the mining industry. The <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> is composed of a bucket, boom and 'dipper stick', boiler, water tank and coal bunker, a steam engine, and a winch. The <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> was invented in 1835 by William Otis, later receiving a patent for his invention on February 24, 1839.|$|E
5000|$|Expanding railway {{networks}} (in the US and the UK) {{fostered a}} demand for <b>steam</b> <b>shovels.</b> The extensive mileage of railways, and corresponding volume of material to be moved, forced the technological leap. As a result, <b>steam</b> <b>shovels</b> became commonplace.|$|R

25|$|In the Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior (1963), {{a variant}} of the induced-compliance paradigm, by Elliot Aronson and Carlsmith, {{examined}} self-justification in children. In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable <b>steam</b> <b>shovel,</b> the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told {{the second half of the}} group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the <b>steam</b> <b>shovel).</b>|$|E
25|$|The show {{featured}} {{extensive use}} of slapstick, often performed using sped-up photography and clever, though low-budget, visual effects, such as when they built a railway station together and awoke {{the next morning to}} discover that some construction equipment outside (<b>steam</b> <b>shovel,</b> bulldozer, backhoe) had come to life and were lumbering, growling, and battling like dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{when the}} {{children}} {{were told that they}} could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of severe punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.|$|E

50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>shovels</b> {{assisted}} mining operations: {{the iron}} mines of Minnesota, the copper mines of Chile and Montana, placer mines of the Klondike - all had earth-moving equipment. But {{it was with}} the burgeoning open-pit mines - first in Bingham Canyon, Utah - that shovels came into their own. The shovels systematically removed hillsides. As a result, <b>steam</b> <b>shovels</b> were used around the world from Australia to Russia to coal mines in China. Shovels were also used for construction, road and quarry work.|$|R

25|$|From 1911 the {{government}} required {{the company to}} establish a fund which would aid the workers should the company go bankrupt. This was introduced after several large industrial companies had collapsed {{in the past decade}} and large costs had befallen the state. Just as the first expansion was competed, Sydvaranger decided that it needed to further expand its export capacity to 650,000 tonnes. Financing was secured through issuing new shares worth NOK3million. Investments included a new <b>steam</b> <b>shovel,</b> three steam cranes, three locomotives, a new briquetting plant; the work was completed in 1913. In 1913 the company had 1,150 employees.|$|E
25|$|In March 1931, {{over a year}} {{removed from}} the Wheatley Hills debacle, Moses {{announced}} the beginning of construction of the Northern State Parkway in Nassau County. The groundbreaking ceremony for {{the first section of}} the Northern State was held on March 9, with Moses at the controls of a <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> on the estate owned by Nicholas Brady in North Hills. Construction a small segment from the New York City line, where it would eventually meet the Grand Central Parkway, and east to Searington Road and Mineola Boulevard. Five bridges would be constructed in the original contract: Willis Avenue in Mineola, Searington Road in North Hills, Shelter Rock Road and the Long Island Motor Parkway in Lakeville, and Middle Neck Road in Lake Success. The first project would cost about $350,000 (1931USD).|$|E
25|$|It {{contains}} {{documents that}} trace {{the history of}} mining here from 1556 to 1967, and the {{more than a billion}} ounces of silver and the five million ounces of gold that have been extracted from the state of Hidalgo during that time. The museum has three exhibition halls, a covered courtyard and a garden which contains mining machinery. such as a <b>steam</b> <b>shovel,</b> a winch and a truck used for transport of ore. The exhibition halls contain displays relating to how minerals are found in nature and the tools and processes used to extract them. It also houses a large collection of documents, a library and a photography laboratory. The documentation contained here was rescued starting in 1987. In 1993 the current site was renovated to house the collection. The collection also includes minersâ€™ personal effects, as well as artworks relating to mining.|$|E
50|$|Six {{thousand}} men {{worked in the}} cut, drilling holes, placing explosives, controlling <b>steam</b> <b>shovels,</b> and running the dirt trains. They also moved and extended the railroad tracks as the work moved forward. Twice a day work stopped for blasting, and then the <b>steam</b> <b>shovels</b> were moved in to take the loose spoil (dirt and rock) away. More than 600 holes filled with dynamite were fired daily. In all, 60 e6lb MT of dynamite were used. In some locations, about 52000 lb of dynamite were planted and detonated for a single blast.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s {{diesel-powered}} excavation <b>shovels</b> replaced <b>steam</b> <b>shovels</b> for {{the excavation}} of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, {{in the late}} 19th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>shovels</b> {{became more}} {{popular in the}} latter half of the nineteenth century. Originally {{configured}} with chain hoists, the advent of steel cable in the 1870s allowed for easier rigging to the winches.|$|R

500|$|From about 1920 Frise {{shared an}} {{office with the}} {{journalist}} and Vimy ridge veteran Greg Clark (1892â€“77). [...] They became friends, and Frise began providing colour illustrations to Clark's tales in the Star of the pair's misadventures in Torontoâ€”Frise tall and gangly, and Clark short and stout. [...] A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936. [...] Frise talked of their blunderings to the Star: [...] "We've fried eggs on the city hall steps. We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement. I once let Greg persuade {{me to get a}} <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> to do my spring digging and ruined my garden. Perhaps this book is our most foolish adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1931 as a <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> {{was making}} ready to level enough land to {{accommodate}} the great castle, Hearst {{put a stop to}} all his construction plans. The Great Depression had greatly diminished his income, and he could not pay for his $50million project at Wyntoon {{while at the same time}} indulging his expansion at San Simeon. Abandoning the massive castle idea, Hearst instead asked Morgan to design a [...] "Bavarian Village" [...] with multiple half-timbered buildings in the medieval style of Germany or Austria. Hearst sent Morgan to Europe to study suitable buildings; she brought fine artist Doris Day with her to investigate architectural inscriptions and painting styles. In 1932, Morgan put together a master plan for Wyntoon. It described a group of guesthouses with romantic names such as Cinderella House, Fairy House and Bear House, arranged not in a cramped medieval style but symmetrically around a common green in the Beaux-Arts style. These three-story structures with steeply gabled roofs were completed in 1933. Swiss artisan Jules Suppo and his assistants carved much of the German Gothic decorations. Day painted fine inscriptions and exterior decorative patterns. Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany painted exterior murals depicting Russian and Germanic fairy tales such as those from the Brothers Grimm, but Pogany's versions were bright, humorous and cheerful, not dark and grim.|$|E
50|$|In 1864 {{the company}} (a joint venture of John Souther and D.A. Pickering) ceased {{producing}} locomotives and instead {{focused on the}} manufacture of <b>steam</b> <b>shovels.</b> From thereon it operated as the Globe Works Company.|$|R

5000|$|Full-scale mining using <b>steam</b> <b>shovels</b> {{was started}} in 1917, making the New Cornelia the first large open pit mine in Arizona. [...] Mining and {{treatment}} of the underlying but lower-grade copper sulfide orebody began in 1924.|$|R
2500|$|In 1906, W. A. Bechtel won {{his first}} {{subcontract}} to build part of the Oroville-to-Oakland section of the Western Pacific Railroad. That same year, he bought his own <b>steam</b> <b>shovel,</b> becoming a pioneer of the new technology. He painted [...] "W.A. Bechtel Co." [...] {{on the side of}} the <b>steam</b> <b>shovel,</b> effectively establishing Bechtel as a company, though it was not yet incorporated.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{confusion}} and disagreement between Lewis and William J. Tracy, representative of District No. 1, International Brotherhood of <b>Steam</b> <b>Shovel</b> and Dredgemen (IBSSD). In a widely publicized statement, Lewis said that two {{representatives of the}} UMWA had contacted the IBSSD, but [...] "have failed to secure any satisfaction." [...] He did note that the <b>Steam</b> <b>Shovel</b> union had been suspended from the American Federation of Labor, to which the United Mine Workers also belonged. Lewis claimed that the IBSSD was also strikebreaking in Ohio. Tracy responded that though he had sent four individuals to the site when requested, they turned away {{when they saw the}} guards. He said that no one from his organization was working in Herrin. Tracy also criticized the UMWA for not communicating adequately about the situation.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1909, {{business}} {{was reported to}} be booming on upper Klamath Lake waterfront. [...] There was a saw mill, a box factory, two large dredgers, a <b>steam</b> <b>shovel</b> and construction trains in operation. [...] Five steamers were making regular trips on the lake: Eagle (under Captain Wickstrom), Hooligan, Mazama, Hornet and the large sternwheeler Winema. [...] Earlier that year, in June, a newspaper report hinted that racing was occurring between the crews of the steamers Hooligan and Hornet.|$|E
50|$|Power shovels {{are used}} principally for {{excavation}} and removal of overburden in open-cut mining operations, {{though it may}} include loading of minerals, such as coal. They are the modern equivalent of <b>steam</b> <b>shovels,</b> and operate in a similar fashion.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century coal was mined {{underground}} using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions. Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, surface mining was conducted with <b>steam</b> <b>shovels</b> designed for coal mining.|$|R
50|$|Coupled {{with the}} arrival of the railway links, Lincoln boomed again during the Industrial Revolution, and several world-famous {{companies}} arose, such as Ruston's, Clayton's, Proctor's and William Foster's.
