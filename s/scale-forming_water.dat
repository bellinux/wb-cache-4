40|$|Conditions {{that will}} cause calcium {{carbonate}} precipitation exist in most domestic hot water heaters and {{virtually all of the}} water injection wells used by the American oil producing industry. After discovery in 1936 of the precipitation inhibiting powers of sodium hexametaphosphate, at very low concentrations, its use exploded to many water handling applications where scale was troublesome. Very little research was undertaken to examine this phenomenon. Little research could be justified because treatment costs were so low and benefits were so great. The use of sodium hexametaphosphate, known as "threshold treatment", was originally intended to prevent internal scaling of water lines and valves. It certainly accomplished this job, but no one demonstrated whether calcium was mainly held in solution or precipitates were prevented from sticking. Bottle tests suggested that calcium remained in solution. However, the data were certainly sketchy for extrapolation to much more scale forming oil field brines held at higher temperatures under pressure. The research reported herein deals with the influence of all these variables. Also considered are the very important effects of pressure, surface roughness of the container, time, proprietary inhibitor brand (liquid organic phosphates) and concentration. To simulate a domestic hot water heater or oil field water injection well condition a new test apparatus was developed and patented. It consists of two chambers separated by a free piston fitted with an 0 -ring. The test water is contained below the piston, and sealed from the pressuring gas above the piston by the 0 -ring. Data are presented to show that a given water under field pressure conditions precipitates more calcium carbonate as the temperature is increased. If the test is run at atmospheric pressure, as done by all previous investigators, even more calcium carbonate precipitates. It is shown that 100 percent inhibition can be achieved. For the very <b>scale-forming</b> <b>water</b> used as our principal model only a few ppm of the chemicals provide complete inhibition under pressure in the test apparatus. At atmospheric pressure 500 ppm of inhibitor provide only 50 to 60 percent inhibition in one oil field brine. The empirical Stability Index, a measure of calcium carbonate precipitation tendency developed by previous investigators, appears to be a reliable measure of precipitation and thus inhibitor requirements. In addition, the data herein indicate a good possibility that a costeffective ranking of inhibitors would remain the same in many waters. The actual dosage of each chemical to achieve 100 percent inhibition would change, but cost rankings would remain the same.

40|$|Scale {{deposits}} impair production reservoirs and foul down hole, surface, and injection equipment. The {{effects can}} be rapid and dramatic. One of the most frequent <b>scale-forming</b> compounds in <b>water</b> is calcium carbonate. In a reservoir the production of brine can result in the lowering of the pressure and/or temperature. A pressure drop will decrease the solubility of CaCO 3 and thus increase the saturation ratio for CaCO 3, whereas a temperature drop will have the opposite effect. The net outcome {{of a change in}} pressure and temperature may therefore be a decrease or an increase in the saturation ratio of CaCO 3 as specified by the change of temperature relative to the change of pressure. Accordingly, applying robust predictive tools in this research is of high interest in petroleum production systems. The current study plays emphasis on applying the predictive model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) to estimate amount of Dissolved Calcium Carbonate Concentration in oil field brines. Genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize hyper parameters (γ and σ 2) which are embedded in LSSVM model. Using this method is simple and accurate to determine the amount of Dissolved Calcium Carbonate Concentration in oil field brines with minimum uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Background: Kashan rural {{water and}} {{wastewater}} company (KRWWC) in Iran is facing a multitude of problems including some potential health risks associated with pipe corrosion byproducts, their early deterioration, the occasional interruption of the water supplies and also huge operation costs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the corrosive and <b>scale-forming</b> properties of <b>water</b> in Kashan villages. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was carried out on 151 water samples taken from 39 rural water supplies in 4 stages during 2007 - 9. All samples were analyzed for total hardness, calcium, alkalinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), bicarbonate, temperature and pH according to the last edition of the Standard Methods Book and then Ryznar, Langelier and Puckorius indices were calculated. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and Paired t-test followed by Bonferroni correction. Results: According to Ryznar, Puckorius and Langelier indices, 95, 97 and 74 of the water supplies in all seasons were corrosive, respectively. Moreover, according to the three above-mentioned indices, 18 villages (46. 15) under the coverage of Kashan rural {{water and wastewater}} company have always had corrosive water {{and there was also}} no significant difference in water quality between the seasons. Conclusion: Results showed that most water supplies are corrosive and a few of them are scale-forming. Hence, application of suitable plumbing utensils, turn on/off bypass pumps and valves and if necessary, appropriate water treatment are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Fracturing fluids are {{commonly}} formulated with fresh water to ensure reliable fluid rheology. However, fresh water {{is becoming more}} costly, and in some areas, {{it is difficult to}} obtain. Therefore, the use of produced water in hydraulic fracturing has received increased attention in the last few years. This study investigates the feasibility of using field-produced water to formulate crosslinked-gel-based fracturing fluid through a series of laboratory experiments. Research applied three different approaches to qualify the produced water for the formulation of the fracturing fluid: 1) dilution of the produced water with fresh water, 2) reduction of water cations? concentrations, and 3) use of different chelating agents. The fracturing fluid was prepared with the typical fluid additives used in the field. Compatibility tests were done to examine the compatibility of the water with the fracturing fluid system, and the fracturing fluid viscosity was evaluated through high-pressure high-temperature (HP/HT) viscosity measurements. Results show that produced water could cause formation damage if used directly to formulate the hydraulic fracturing fluid. Precipitations could be prevented if the produced water is diluted with fresh water, or treated to reduce the concentration of <b>scale-forming</b> ions. Produced <b>water</b> could be used to formulate the fracturing fluid if diluted with fresh water 25 times; and the concentrations of Ca and Mg ions that the system can tolerate were found to be 400 and 25 ppm, respectively. Further reduction of divalent cations indicated the enhancement of the fracturing fluid viscosity. The use of HEDTA and GLDA was found to increase the system tolerance to Ca and Mg ions, and to maintain adequate fracturing fluid viscosity. However, sodium gluconate, di-sodium EDTA, and di-ammonium EDTA showed a breaking effect on the viscosity of the fracturing fluid. This work contributes {{to the understanding of the}} main factors that enable the use of produced water for hydraulic fracturing operations. Maximizing the use of produced water could reduce its disposal costs, mitigate environmental impacts, and solve fresh water acquisition challenges...|$|R
