There were others, of course, but {{with the exception of one}} Goblin they don't come violently into this tale. There had been a good deal of promiscuous firing that evening, and actions were going on all round. Towards midnight our destroyers were overtaken by several three-and four-funnel German ships (cruisers they thought) hurrying home. At this stage of the game anybody might have been anybody--pursuer or pursued. The Germans took no chances, but switched on their searchlights and opened fire on Gehenna.

6000|$|... "Almost {{from the}} moment of the Evolution the {{competitive}} and monopolistic centres of population began to decline. In the clear light of the new order it was seen that they were not fit dwelling-places for men, either in the complicated and luxurious palaces where the rich fenced themselves from their kind, or in the vast tenements, towering height upon height, ten and twelve stories up, where the swarming poor festered in vice and sickness and famine. If I were to tell you of the fashion of those cities of our egoistic epoch, how the construction was one error from the first, and every correction of an error bred a new defect, I should make you laugh, I should make you weep. We let them fall to ruin as quickly as they would, and their sites are still so pestilential, after the lapse of centuries, that travelers are publicly guarded against them. Ravening beasts and poisonous reptiles lurk in those abodes of the riches and the poverty that are no longer known to our life. A part of one of the less malarial of the old cities, however, is maintained by the commonwealth in the form of its prosperity, and is studied by antiquarians for the instruction, and by moralists for the admonition, it affords. A section of a street is exposed, and you see the foundations of the houses; you see the filthy drains that belched into the common sewers, trapped and retrapped to keep the poison gases down; you see the sewers that rolled their loathsome tides under the streets, amid a tangle of gas-pipes, <b>steam-pipes,</b> water-pipes, telegraph-wires, electric lighting-wires, electric motor-wires, and grip-cables--all without a plan, but makeshifts, expedients, devices, to repair and evade the fundamental mistake of having any such cities at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. I forgot the heartache which {{makes up the}} rest of the price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done? You do your tricks very well. And I didn't do badly either, since I managed not to sink that {{steamboat}} on my first trip. It's a wonder to me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road. I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that's supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump--eh? A blow on the very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all over. I don't pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellows--cannibals--in their place. They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange,--had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in the air for a while--and on we went again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know. To some place where they expected to get something, I bet! For me it crawled toward Kurtz--exclusively; but when the <b>steam-pipes</b> started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the woodcutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand, because we were too far and could not remember, because we were traveling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign--and no memories.|$|R

Farther on, three beautiful new engines, that had just been made and stood ready for action, were receiving a few finishing touches from the painters. Fresh, spotless, and glittering, these were to make their debut on the morrow, and commence their comparatively brief career of furious activity--gay things, doomed emphatically to a fast life!

40|$|The use of {{classical}} creep continuum damage mechanics, constitutive and damage equations is restricted, to model {{certain types of}} creep deformation and fracture mechanisms, under isothermal conditions; and, to extend their predictive capabilities for {{a wider range of}} problems they have to be modified. The constitutive and damage equations are modified to represent the bi-linear, log. stress vs. log. rupture, and the log, stress vs. minimum strain rate, characteristics of materials; so that the change in material behaviour, as a mechanism change occurs, is represented in the constitutive model, by a change in the slope of these characteristic lines. Uni-axial creep tests of as-cast (OFHC) Copper have been performed at 150 ¬∞C, 250 ¬∞C and 500 ¬∞C; and, an anisothermal constitutive model has been developed for the temperature range 150 ¬∞C to 500 ¬∞C, which highlights how the constitutive equations may be modified, to model creep behaviour under varying temperature conditions. The model predictions are in good agreement with the test results. A compact tension specimen has been studied, which has shown the importance of modelling the effects on rupture, of the high tri-axial stress-state present at the crack-tip, which accelerates void growth. Modified constitutive equations, have been used to model the mechanism of constrained cavity growth, and has enabled improved damage distribution and. lifetime predictions to be obtained for the compact tension specimen, similar to those expected from experimental tests. Non-local damage techniques are developed to model the effects of grain size characteristic dimension, on the failure of large and small cracked tension specimens. Non-local damage techniques are shown to be necessary to give accurate, physically related, finite element solutions. Suitably modified constitutive and damage rate equations are used to model the high temperature failure of a circumferential weld, in a thick <b>steam-pipe,</b> operating at a constant temperature and pressure. The models developed predict, the growth of damage in certain microstructural regions of the weld, and the lifetime of the component; which are observed to be in close agreement with the results from a fullsize pressure vessel tests. It will be shown that it is essential to use creep constitutive and damage equations in computer models, which accurately represent the underlying physics of IX the predominant creep mechanisms present. The implications of the research work on future computer modelling and on design are discussed...|$|E
