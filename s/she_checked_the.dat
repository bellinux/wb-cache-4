2500|$|As {{in other}} Nevada brothels, {{customers}} were buzzed {{in through a}} gate. Once in, they chose a woman from a lineup in a lobby, and negotiated prices and services in the woman's room. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> penis for any open sores or signs of venereal disease and tested the pre-ejaculatory fluid. A short negotiation was made as {{to the type of}} [...] "party" [...] the customer wanted. Typical prices ranged from $100 to $500 plus tips, although the standard price of $25 for 30 minutes with [...] was enforced and could not be refused. Some women, who performed bizarre acts approved by the Confortes, could get up to $10,000 for a party. The house received half of anything the women made. After the negotiations (overheard by a hidden intercom system) were over, the prostitute collected the money and deposited it with a cashier. She returned to the room, washed the male genitals in a basin. After the act, she would again wash the male and slip on her skimpy outfit. The women was require to escort the customer from her room to the door. Some men would relax in the bar or on sofas talking to the girls. In time the men would be rested for [...] "round two." [...] Many men had favorites or wanted variety. They could be with as many women as they could afford. The fantasy of two and three women simultaneously was common. Another frequent fantasy was of an older and younger prostitute being intimate with the customer and each other; he pretended they were mother and daughter.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} with a {{great effort}} of will <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> scream which had forced itself up to her throat.|$|E
60|$|Presently a buggy {{appeared}} over a rise, and Harding felt {{a thrill}} of pleasure as {{he recognized the}} team and the driver. When Beatrice reached him <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> horses.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>checked</b> herself; <b>the</b> next {{refinement}} of insult remained suspended on her lips.|$|R
60|$|Seeing {{no one but}} {{her father}} in <b>the</b> room, <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> on <b>the</b> threshold.|$|R
50|$|Back in {{her hotel}} room, Isabel takes a box {{from under the}} bedside table {{and takes out a}} gun. <b>She</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> loaded drum {{magazine}} and hides the gun under a pillow. Then she prepares to take a bath. She takes off her clothes and her black wig. With her long, blonde hair she looks strikingly different.|$|R
60|$|Hypatia had all {{but said}} 'a woman even as I am': but Neo-Platonic {{philosophy}} taught her better; and <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> hasty assertion of anything like a common sex or common humanity between two beings so antipodal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We priests! Thou art not yet {{old enough}} to--' <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> joke with another laugh. 'Believe me, now and again, we women, O priest, think of other matters than sons. Moreover, my {{daughter}} has borne her man-child.' ...|$|E
60|$|The girl instinctively made a {{movement}} {{as if to}} follow him, whilst a quickly smothered cry--half of joy and half of fear--escaped her lips. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> movement {{as well as the}} cry, but not before Richard Lambert had perceived both.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{unable to}} secure acting work, Judy {{must find a}} way to make ends meet. She tries a number of jobs: passing out fliers, waiting tables at a club, and working as an extra on a movie set. <b>She</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> circulars for wanted ads, and seeing [...] "friendly phone line", as well as, [...] "mo money, mo money, mo money". She circles them both.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Sarah pursues {{the assassin}} and, {{after a long}} chase and gunfight, manages to kill him. <b>She</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> corpse for his {{identification}} and learns {{that he was a}} rogue CIA agent. After all the people are cured with the antigen, they are allowed to exit the building, and Chuck and Jill share a long kiss, as Sarah watches in frustration. Chuck and Jill rekindle their relationship and begin dating again.|$|R
50|$|Isidore's wife, Maria, {{always kept}} {{a pot of}} stew on the {{fireplace}} in their humble home as Isidore would often bring home anyone who was hungry. One day he brought home more hungry people than usual. After she served many of them, Maria told him that there simply was no more stew in the pot. He insisted that <b>she</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> pot again, {{and she was able}} to spoon out enough stew to feed them all.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> pony {{before the}} bar which the flagman at the {{railroad}} crossing had let down, while a long freight train clattered deafeningly by, and then drove bumping and jouncing across the tracks. [...] "I suppose {{you remember what}} 'Over the Track' means in Hatboro'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|If Catherine was surprised, <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> {{expression}} of it; she gave neither a start nor an exclamation. She remained, indeed, for some moments intensely still, {{and this may}} very well have been a symptom of emotion. [...] "I hope he was well," [...] she said at last.|$|E
60|$|Should she {{unlock the}} door, and fling herself wildly into his arms? Her {{instinct}} {{told her to}} do it, but she faltered and hesitated. A drunkard! a drunkard! Oh no! she could not. The evil genius conquered the good, and <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> impulse that alone could have saved her.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>checked</b> out of <b>the</b> {{hotel at}} 12:30 p.m. on March 5, {{the day of}} her fatal flight.|$|R
50|$|One story relates that Maria {{always kept}} {{a pot of}} stew on the {{fireplace}} in their humble rural dwelling. She knew that her husband Isidore would often bring home anyone who was hungry. One day he brought home more hungry people than usual. After she served many of them, Maria told him that there simply was no more stew in the pot. He insisted that <b>she</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> pot again, {{and she was able}} to spoon out enough stew to feed them all.|$|R
5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> {{rear-view}} mirror, {{her face in the}} policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|R
60|$|Almost had she bluntly {{demanded the}} name of her father's accuser, that thus she might reach the object of her visit. Betimes <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> rash impulse, perceiving that subtlety was here required; that a direct {{question}} would close the door to all information. Skilfully, then, she chose her line of attack.|$|E
60|$|Lance and Devine had {{lingered in}} the rear, and the little group stopped {{in the middle of}} the trail and waited for them. Then, when they moved forward again, Beatrice and Harding were somehow thrown together, and <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> impulse to {{overtake}} the others when she saw that she and the prairie man were falling behind. To avoid being alone with him would exaggerate his importance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can see now," [...] said Marguerite in that calm voice {{which comes}} so {{naturally}} {{in moments of}} infinite despair--"I can see now exactly what Percy meant when he made me promise not to open this packet until it seemed to me--to me and to you, Sir Andrew--that {{he was about to}} play the part of a coward. A coward! Great God!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> sob that had risen to her throat, and continued in the same calm manner and quiet, even voice: ...|$|E
5000|$|Linda {{talks with}} her friend Annie (Nia Long), who asks how Linda and Jim are, since their {{relationship}} has gotten into a rut. Then Linda goes through various chores. When <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> answering machine, there is a message from Jim, in which {{he says that he}} meant everything he said in front of the kids the other night, and he wants her to know that he was sincere. He spots a call waiting on his phone and mutters [...] "Is that you?" [...] before hanging up. Linda calls him back and leaves a message.|$|R
2500|$|Against this <b>she</b> set <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> {{implied in}} {{democratic}} control: ...|$|R
5000|$|Lamar {{goes to a}} bar, where Lavonia masks {{herself as}} Mexican {{stripper}} Lola Langusta and drugs his drink. In a motel room, Lavonia rapes the unconscious Lamar [...] - [...] by first triggering an erection via oral sex and then by finally having vaginal sex with him using a sock as protection. She frees him to test if she changed his ways, but he runs away. Back home, Lavonia has sex with a truck driver. As <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> clock smiling, Lamar returns. A fight ensues and Lavonia helps Lamar by burning the truck driver's scrotum with a light bulb.|$|R
60|$|The voice drew nearer; for {{one brief}} second the wild desire seized Marguerite to rush {{down the steps}} and fly across the room, to stop that song at any cost, to beg the cheerful singer to fly--fly for his life, before it be too late. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> impulse just in time. Chauvelin would stop her before she reached the door, and, moreover, she had no idea if he had any {{soldiers}} posted within his call. Her impetuous act might prove the death-signal of the man she would have died to save.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{were in the}} {{carriage}} now: one a little person, with light hair, and dressed in {{the height of the}} fashion; the other in a brown silk pelisse, and a straw bonnet with pink ribbons, with a rosy, round, happy face, that did you good to behold. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> carriage as it neared the three gentlemen, after which exercise of authority she looked rather nervous, and then began to blush most absurdly. [...] "We have had a delightful drive, George," [...] she said, [...] "and--and we're so glad to come back; and, Joseph, don't let him be late." ...|$|E
60|$|A lurch that flung Miss Schuyler {{against her}} showed that Hetty {{had found the}} turning; and a little later, with a struggle, <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> team, and they slid {{behind one of the}} low, rolling rises that seamed the prairie here and there. There was no wind in the hollow behind it and a great stillness under the high vault of blue studded with {{twinkling}} stars. The dim whiteness of a long ridge cut sharply against it, and the pale colouring and frosty glitter conveyed the suggestion of pitiless cold. Flora Schuyler shivered, and drew the furs closer round her.|$|E
50|$|When Sophie {{returns home}} from the cabin, she realizes her cat {{is nowhere to be}} found. She {{suspects}} Mara is behind it, so she decides to sneak onto Mara's property to <b>check.</b> <b>She</b> finds her cat inside the house, but the burglar alarm goes off, attracting a neighbor's attention. Sophie hides in the basement just as Mara returns, who then searches the house to find out why the alarm was tripped. Wielding a hammer, <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> basement while Sophie hides behind a shelf unit. Mara seems to sense someone is there but doesn't say anything. She just goes back upstairs and bolts the basement door, locking Sophie inside. Mara then goes to work.|$|R
60|$|Returning to the sitting-room after bidding Kitty goodnight, Mrs. Linley {{discovered}} {{the old lady}} asleep, {{and saw that the}} book on her mother's lap was sliding off. Before <b>she</b> could <b>check</b> <b>the</b> downward movement, the book fell on the floor, and Mrs. Presty woke.|$|R
500|$|Following a home evaluation, Bev {{from the}} {{adoption}} agency comes {{to work with}} Liz where <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> safety of the studio and interviews the TGS cast and crew including Jenna, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), and Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden). The workplace evaluation goes badly, {{with many of the}} interviews reflecting badly on Liz or the safety of the studio for a child. However, before Bev files her report she sustains a head injury and forgets that she has done the evaluation. Liz gets the crew to help her [...] "do over" [...] the evaluation, hoping for a better result.|$|R
60|$|What {{had that}} star {{to do with}} hell? She might be crushed and {{destroyed}} by life, but was there not something beyond? Just to be born, just to suffer, just to die--could that be all? Despair did not loose its hold on Ellen, the strife and pang of her breast did not subside. But with the long hours and the strange closing in of the forest around her and the fleeting glimpse of that wonderful star, with a subtle divination {{of the meaning of}} her beating heart and throbbing mind, and, lastly, with a voice thundering at her conscience that a man's faith in a woman must not be greater, nobler, than her faith in God and eternity--with these <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> dark flight of her soul toward destruction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not--why not, when {{we talked}} in that way?" [...] he demanded, {{following}} her fast. [...] "And he was dying--when a man's dying it's different." [...] <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> movement she had made to leave him; she was listening more than ever; {{it was true that}} he was not the same as that last time. That had been aimless, fruitless passion, but at present he had an idea, which she scented in all her being. [...] "But it doesn't matter!" [...] he exclaimed, pressing her still harder, though now without touching a hem of her garment. [...] "If Touchett had never opened his mouth I should have known all the same. I had only to look at you at your cousin's funeral to see what's the matter with you. You can't deceive me any more; for God's sake be honest with a man who's so honest with you. You're the most unhappy of women, and your husband's the deadliest of fiends." ...|$|E
60|$|Catherine cheerfully complied, {{and being}} {{properly}} equipped, was more impatient {{than ever to}} be at the pump-room, that she might inform herself of General Tilney's lodgings, for though she believed they were in Milsom Street, she was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street she was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and resolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to believe, were in a shop hard by. She reached the house without any impediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for Miss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not quite certain. Would she be pleased to send up her name? She gave her card. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did not quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that Miss Tilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left the house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home, and too much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street, could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in expectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At the bottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at a window, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She was followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father, and they turned up towards Edgar's Buildings. Catherine, in deep mortification, proceeded on her way. She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility; but <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> resentful sensation; she remembered her own ignorance. She knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable.|$|E
50|$|Before Carmilla leaves, <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> police station. There, she {{discovers the}} police were called to Troy's house. In Millarca's statement, {{she says she was}} having a lesbian affair with Karen. Separately, Troy corroborates this with Laura, who has demanded the full story. Troy beat both women when he found that they were {{engaging}} in blood fetishism. He blamed Karen's mysterious ailment and eventual death on Millarca, whom he believes to have been a vampire who seduced Karen. Laura, who self-injures, excitedly tells Carmilla, who has not left town yet, that she now understands herself and her sexuality. The two begin a lesbian relationship that mirrors that of their mothers.|$|R
50|$|After a {{date with}} Juliet, Jack is {{attacked}} and injured by Max. That night, Max drugs Juliet and attempts to rape her while she sleeps, but she awakens and he flees after giving her an injection. The next morning, Juliet finds the cap from the hypodermic needle. At work she has her blood and urine analyzed and discovers high levels of Demerol and other drugs. She rushes back home and finds Jack's possessions there but no sign of him. A nightshirt of hers is in a location where she did not leave it. <b>She</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> security camera footage and sees Max assaulting her.|$|R
5000|$|Following a home evaluation, Bev {{from the}} {{adoption}} agency comes {{to work with}} Liz where <b>she</b> <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> safety of the studio and interviews the TGS cast and crew including Jenna, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), and Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden).
