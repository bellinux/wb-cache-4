The GBAS installation at Newark Liberty International Airport achieved <b>Operational</b> <b>Approval</b> on Sept. 28, 2012. A second GBAS installed at Houston Intercontinental Airport received <b>Operational</b> <b>Approval</b> on April 23, 2013. Honeywell systems are also installed internationally, with an operational system in Bremen, Germany. Additional systems are installed or {{in the process of}} being installed. <b>Operational</b> <b>approval</b> of several more systems is expected shortly.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) Electronic Flight Bag application intended to inform the pilot of trajectory improvement opportunities while en route that result in operational benefits. The results of safety analyses and a detailed review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulatory documents that establish certification and <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> requirements are presented for TASAR. The safety analyses indicate that TASAR has a likely Failure Effects Classification of No Effect, and at most, is no worse than Minor Effect. Based on this safety assessment and the detailed review of FAA regulatory documents that determine certification and <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> requirements, this study concludes that TASAR can be implemented in the flight deck as a Type B software application hosted on a Class 2 Portable Electronic Device (PED) Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). This implementation approach would provide a relatively low-cost path to certification and <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> for both retrofit and forward fit implementation, {{while at the same}} time facilitating the business case for early ADS-B IN equipage. A preliminary review by FAA certification and operational approvers of the analyses presented here confirmed that the conclusions are appropriate and that TASAR will be considered a Type B application...|$|R
