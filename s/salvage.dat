5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} <b>salvage</b> rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. <b>Salvage</b> work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, <b>salvage</b> work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed.

40|$|Cobinamide (Cbi) <b>salvaging</b> is impaired, but not abolished, in a Salmonella enterica strain {{lacking a}} {{functional}} cobU gene. CobU is a bifunctional enzyme (NTP:adenosylcobinamide [NTP:AdoCbi] kinase, GTP:adenosylcobinamide-phosphate [GTP:AdoCbi-P] guanylyltransferase) whose AdoCbi kinase activity {{is necessary for}} Cbi <b>salvaging</b> in this bacterium. Inactivation of the ycfN gene in a ΔcobU strain abrogated Cbi <b>salvaging.</b> Introduction of a plasmid carrying the ycfN+ allele into a ΔcobU ΔycfN strain substantially restored Cbi <b>salvaging.</b> Mass spectrometry data indicate that when YcfN-enriched cell extracts were incubated with AdoCbi and ATP, {{the product of the}} reaction was AdoCbi-P. Results from bioassays confirmed that YcfN converted AdoCbi to AdoCbi-P in an ATP-dependent manner.

5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for <b>salvage</b> logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from <b>salvage</b> logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by <b>salvage</b> logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the <b>salvage</b> logging plan.|$|E
5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and tugboat assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest <b>salvage</b> tugboat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, <b>Salvage</b> Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. <b>Salvage</b> Chief had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar for an additional two days. <b>Salvage</b> Chief did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the grounding occurred.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste {{was built}} in Spencer's Island, Nova Scotia, and {{launched}} under British registration as Amazon, in 1861. She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the <b>salvage</b> hearings in Gibraltar, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities of foul play, including mutiny by Mary Celestes crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or <b>salvage</b> fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low <b>salvage</b> award.|$|E
40|$|The genome of Rhodobacter sphaeroides encodes the {{components}} of two distinct pathways for <b>salvaging</b> cobinamide (Cbi), a precursor of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl, coenzyme B 12). One pathway, conserved among bacteria, depends on a bifunctional kinase/guanylyltransferase (CobP) enzyme to convert adenosylcobinamide (AdoCbi) to AdoCbi-phosphate (AdoCbi-P), an intermediate in de novo AdoCbl biosynthesis. The other pathway, of archaeal origin, depends on an AdoCbi amidohydrolase (CbiZ) enzyme to generate adenosylcobyric acid (AdoCby), which is converted to AdoCbi-P by the AdoCbi-P synthetase (CobD) enzyme. Here we report that R. sphaeroides strain 2. 4. 1 synthesizes AdoCbl de novo and that it <b>salvages</b> Cbi using both of the predicted Cbi <b>salvaging</b> pathways. AdoCbl produced by R. sphaeroides was identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and bioassay. The deletion of cobB (encoding an essential enzyme of the de novo corrin ring biosynthetic pathway) resulted in a strain of R. sphaeroides that would not grow on acetate {{in the absence of}} exogenous corrinoids. The results from a nutritional analysis showed that the presence of either CbiZ or CobP was necessary and sufficient for Cbi <b>salvaging,</b> that CbiZ-dependent Cbi <b>salvaging</b> depended on the presence of CobD, and that CobP-dependent Cbi <b>salvaging</b> occurred in a cbiZ+ strain. Possible reasons why R. sphaeroides maintains two distinct pathways for Cbi <b>salvaging</b> are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Wrecking was a {{mainstay}} of the Bahamian economy {{through most of the}} 19th century. In 1856 there were 302 ships and 2,679 men (out of a total population of 27,000) licensed as wreckers in the Bahamas. In that year <b>salvaged</b> wreck cargo brought to Nassau was valued at £96,304, {{more than half of all}} imports to the Bahamas. More than two-thirds of exports from the Bahamas were <b>salvaged</b> goods. The government normally took 15% customs duty on <b>salvaged</b> goods. If the <b>salvaged</b> cargo was not claimed, the Vice Admiralty Court took 30%, and the Governor took another 10%. Shore workers (warehouse workers, agents and laborers) usually received around 14% of the value. The wreckers themselves usually received 40% to 60% of the value of the <b>salvaged</b> goods.

40|$|Recent {{increases}} in hard fault rates in modern chip multi-processors {{have led to}} a variety of approaches to try and save manufacturing yield. Among these are: fine-grain fault tolerance (such as error correction coding, redundant cache lines, and redundant functional units), and large-grain fault tolerance (such as disabling of faulty cores, adding extra cores, and core <b>salvaging</b> techniques). This paper considers the case of core <b>salvaging</b> techniques and the heterogeneous per- formance introduced when these techniques have some <b>salvaged</b> and some non-faulty cores. It proposes a hypervisor-based hardware thread scheduler, triggered by detection of spin locks and thread imbalance, that mitigates the loss of throughput resulting from this het- erogeneity. Specifically, a new algorithm, called Most ProgressMade algorithm, reduces the number of synchronization locks held on a <b>salvaged</b> core and balances the time each thread in an application spends running on that core. For some benchmarks, the results show as much as a 2. 68 x increase in performance over a <b>salvaged</b> chip multi-processor without this technique...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as <b>salvage</b> {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop.

5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two <b>salvage</b> contractors, Smit International and <b>Salvage</b> Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, <b>Salvage</b> Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
