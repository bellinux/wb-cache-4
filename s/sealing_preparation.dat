40|$|Mastitis is {{considered}} to be the most economically costly disease affecting the dairy industry. Regular dosage of animals with antibiotics, including use of prophylactic concentrations, may select for resistant strains. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the mode of action of a new bacteriocin (macedocin ST 91 KM), to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens to antibiotics commonly used in treatment remedies, and to introduce the possible use of an alternative antimicrobial agent. The bacteriocin macedocin ST 91 KM, produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST 91 KM, is bactericidal to Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus associated with mastitis infections, including strains resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. Sensitive cells were deformed and secreted nucleotides, K+ and &# 946;-galactosidase when exposed to macedocin ST 91 KM. Adsorption of the peptide to target cells decreased in the presence of solvents, suggesting that receptors on the cell surfaces have lipid moieties. No adsorption was recorded in the presence of MgCl 2, KI and Na 2 CO 3, suggesting that ionic strength plays an important role. A teat <b>seal</b> <b>preparation</b> containing macedocin ST 91 KM effectively released the peptide and inhibited the growth of S. agalactiae.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Microbiology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Mastitis is {{considered}} to be the most costly disease affecting the dairy industry. Management strategies involve the extensive use of antibiotics to treat and prevent this disease. Prophylactic dosages of antibiotics used in mastitis control programmes could select for strains with resistance to antibiotics. In addition, a strong drive towards reducing antibiotic residues in animal food products has lead to research in finding alternative antimicrobial agents. Streptococcus macedonicus ST 91 KM, isolated from bulgarian goat yoghurt, produces the bacteriocin macedocin ST 91 KM with a narrow spectrum of activity against Grampositive bacteria. These include mastitis pathogens Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis as well as Lactobacillus sakei and Micrococcus varians. Macedocin ST 91 KM is, according to tricine-SDS PAGE, between 2. 0 and 2. 5 kDa in size. The activity of macedocin ST 91 KM remained unchanged after 2 h of incubation at pH 2. 0 to 10. 0 and 100 min at 100 °C. The peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 °C and when treated with pronase, pepsin and trypsin. Treatment with α-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. Precipitation with 60 % saturated ammonium sulphate, followed by Sep-Pak C 18 separation recovered 43 % of macedocin ST 91 KM. Amplification of the genome of strain ST 91 KM with primers designed from the sequence of the macedocin prescursor gene (mcdA) produced two fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one fragment of 150 bp recorded for macedocin produced by S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Strain ACA-DC 198 was not available. However, the DNA fragment amplified from strain LMG 18488 (ACA-DC 206), genetically closely related to strain ACADC 198, revealed 99 % homology to the mcdA of S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 (accession number DQ 835394). Macedocin ST 91 KM may thus be a related bacteriocin described for S. macedonicus. The peptide adsorbed equally well (66 %) to L. sakei LMG 13558 and insensitive cells, e. g. Enterococcus faecalis BFE 1071 and FAIR E 92, and Streptococcus caprinus ATCC 700066. Optimal adsorption of macedocin ST 91 KM was recorded at 37 °C and 45 °C and at pH of 8 - 10. Addition of solvents decreased adsorption by 50 %, suggesting that the receptors to which the bacteriocin binds have lipid moieties. The addition of MgCl 2, KI and Na 2 CO 3 completely prevented adsorption of macedocin ST 91 KM to the target cells, possibly due to competitive ion adsorption on the bacterial cell surface. The peptide has a bacteriocidal mode of action, resulting in lysis and the release of DNA and β-galactosidase. Atomic force microscopy of sensitive cells treated with macedocin ST 91 KM have shown deformation of the cell structure and developing of irregular surface areas. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were evaluated against eighteen mastitis pathogens. All isolates tested were resistant to methicillin and oxacillin, but had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) falling in the intermediate and susceptible range against erythromycin. S. agalactiae and S. epidermidis had the highest sensitivity to macedocin ST 91 KM. A teat <b>seal</b> <b>preparation</b> containing macedocin ST 91 KM effectively released bacteriocin inhibiting the growth of the bacterial pathogen. Macedocin ST 91 KM could form the basis for an alternative dry cow therapy to prevent mastitis infections in dairy cows, as it is effective against pathogens that display resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Greenfield Sluder, Joshua J. Nordberg, Frederick J. Miller and Edward H. Hinchcliffe This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “A <b>Sealed</b> <b>Preparation</b> for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells,” Chapter 18, in *Live Cell Imaging* (eds. Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The continuous long-term observation of cultured cells on the microscope {{has always been a}} technically demanding undertaking. This protocol describes a <b>sealed</b> <b>preparation</b> that allows the continuous long-term observation of cultured mammalian cells on upright or inverted microscopes without environmental CO 2 control. The preparation allows for optical conditions consistent with high-quality imaging and good cell viability for at least 100 hours. The preparation is an aluminum support slide with a square aperture cut in its center. The coverslip bearing the cells is attached {{to the top of the}} slide with a thin layer of silicone grease, and the bottom of the slide is similarly covered with a clean coverslip of the same size. The thickness of the slide is intended to coordinately maximize the volume of the medium while maintaining optical properties that allow Koehler illumination with standard condensers. The chamber is filled in equal parts with HEPES-buffered media containing fetal calf serum and a low-viscosity fluorocarbon oil. These oils have a high solubility for atmospheric gases. The inclusion of the oil in the preparations is intended to provide a source of oxygen and perhaps a sink for some of the CO 2 produced by the cells. Although the inclusion of fluorocarbon oil in the preparation may not be necessary for short-term (~ 24 hr) observations, particularly with cells that are sparsely plated, long-term cell viability is ensured when the oil is present. ### RELATED INFORMATION Support slides should be prepared as described in [A <b>Sealed</b> <b>Preparation</b> for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells: Details of Support Slide Construction]([URL] ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Cells for analysis - *This protocol has been used extensively for BSC- 1, CV- 1, COS- 7, CHO, mouse embryo fibroblasts, and hTERT RPE 1 cells. The FC 47, FC 40, FC 43, and FC 77 oils (see below) all work well for these cells. Most cells appear viable and have normal interphase morphology at 250 hours. Normally, observations of cells stop after 70 - 120 hours because by that time the cells have become confluent. Over the course of 100 hours, all of the cell types show constant motility, and mitoses continue for the duration of the observations with no noticeable prolongation of the cell cycle at later times. Note, however, that at later times, cells often develop small spherical inclusions that are phase-bright. The identity of these inclusions remains obscure, but they may be large pinocytotic vesicles. In any case, they do not appear to have an adverse impact on cell motility, mitosis, or gross morphology*. - Culture medium - *This protocol uses culture medium appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO (catalog no. 15240 - 062) *. - Ethanol (70 %, 95 %) - Fluorocarbon oil - *The oils we use are manufactured by 3 M Corp. and are part of its Fluorinert series of performance liquids ([3 M Fluorinert product guide, 1997]([URL] These are short (primarily eight-carbon) hydrocarbons that are fully substituted with fluorine. They are extremely inert and immiscible with water, and they do not present any recognized significant health hazards. However, it is recommended that all users consult the Material Safety Data Sheets provided by 3 M Corp. for potential health hazards before using these oils. These oils are available from three manufacturers’ representatives in three-quarter gallon (or 11 pound) amounts. 3 M Corp. does not directly sell anything but truckload quantities of these oils. Small sample quantities are available from Acuity Technical Sales (New Hampshire), AMS Materials (Florida), and Semitorr (Oregon) *. - Vaseline:lanolin:paraffin, melted and combined 1 : 1 : 1 (VALAP) ### Equipment 1. Alcohol burner - Aluminum support slide - Beaker, 1 liter - Controlled-temperature environment - *Since this <b>preparation</b> is <b>sealed,</b> control of environmental CO 2 is not needed. However, the cells under observation need to be maintained at 37 °C. This can be achieved by enclosing the entire microscope in a box and using a proportional feedback control apparatus to blow warmed air into the enclosure. Cardboard boxes work well when configured so that the video camera and the mercury arc lamp (when present) are external to the enclosure. The oculars should project from the top edge of the box. A more elegant and user-friendly setup is a Plexiglas enclosure with sliding doors custom-fabricated for the particular microscope. Again, the oculars, camera, and arc lamp housing should be located outside of the box. Three alternative heating strategies include placing the microscope in a 37 °C room, enclosing the volume around the stage with a custom-built Plexiglas box, and warming the preparation alone with a temperature-controlled support apparatus on the stage. This last strategy suffers because there will be a temperature gradient from the margins of the preparation to the cells under observation. The gradient is particularly severe when a water or oil immersion objective is used, unless the objective is equipped with a heated collar or other heating device*. - Coverslip jars - Coverslips, size 1. 5 - Culture dish, 100 × 20 mm - Forceps - Pipettes, 1 ml - Silicone vacuum grease (High Vacuum Grease; Dow Corning) - Spatula - Squirt bottle containing distilled H 2 O - Tissue culture hood - UV light source - Water bath, preset to 37 °C ### METHOD 1. Clean the coverslips used in the construction of this preparation prior to use by sonicating them in distilled H 2 O containing a small amount of detergent and then rinsing the coverslips several times in distilled H 2 O. Store cleaned coverslips in jars containing 95 % ethanol. - *Although the utility of these preparations is not sensitive to coverslip thickness, use number 1. 5 (i. e., 0. 17 mm thick) coverslips, because microscope objectives (without coverslip correction collars) are designed for this thickness of glass. Use of number 1 or number 2 coverslips introduces spherical aberration that degrades image quality*. - To prepare the coverslips for use in growing cells, pass each coverslip through the flame of an alcohol burner to burn off excess ethanol. - To ensure a uniform and lasting seal, do not apply silicone grease to the margins of wet coverslips coming out of a tissue culture dish. Instead, grease the margins of the coverslips before the cells are grown on them by applying a thin and uniform coating of silicone vacuum grease to the margins of the coverslip with a small spatula. - Place the coverslips in a 100 × 20 -mm tissue culture dish. To ensure sterility, place the dish with coverslips in a tissue culture hood, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes. - Following sterilization, plate the cells onto coverslips and culture them in ~ 10 ml of media. - *For our applications, we use the media appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO*. - Wipe the aluminum support slide with a tissue soaked with 70 % ethanol, and then briefly pass the slide through a flame to remove residual alcohol. - Use a small spatula to apply a thin rim of silicone grease around the top and bottom margins of the opening. - Use a thin, even layer of silicone grease. Thicker layers, although they may work well, can lead to dimensional instability as the preparation “settles” at 37 °C. This can lead to a constantly changing focus for the first few hours, even though the microscope may have a stable focus mechanism. - Flame a cleaned blank coverslip (from Step 1) to remove the alcohol, and attach the coverslip to the bottom of the support slide. Use the back of a pair of curved forceps to gently tamp the coverslip to ensure a good seal. - Place the prepared slide in a plastic culture dish, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes in a tissue culture hood. - Warm the media and fluorocarbon oil to 37 °C in a water bath. - Use a sterile 1 -ml pipette to fill the chamber halfway with oil (~ 350 μl). - Use a fresh sterile 1 -ml pipette to add medium until the oil at the margins of the opening just barely overflows from the chamber (again, ~ 350 μl). - Remove a coverslip with cells from the culture dish, and aspirate off excess medium. Quickly place the coverslip, silicone-grease-side down, on the chamber. Tamp the coverslip with forceps to ensure a good seal. Aspirate off any excess media and oil that may have flowed over onto the top of the coverslip. - Wash the top of the preparation prior to use to prevent salts from the medium forming crystals on the coverslips once they air dry. - Fill a 1 -liter beaker with 37 °C water, and place a squirt bottle of distilled H 2 O in it to warm. - When the water is warm, take the assembled chamber out of the incubator. Use a small spatula to apply a small amount of melted 1 : 1 : 1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin (VALAP) to the edges of the top coverslip to provide an extra seal. Use the squirt bottle to gently wash the top coverslip, and aspirate off any excess water. - *Keep the amount of VALAP used to a minimum to reduce the chance that any will catch on the objective when the preparation is in use. This soft, waxy material is difficult to remove from optical surfaces*. - Proceed with microscopy [...] the culture preparation is now ready for observation. *See Movie 1, which illustrates BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy*. ![Movie 1]([URL] "Movie 1 ") **Movie 1. ** BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy.

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an obvious choice for studies of the developmental significance of gravity vectors because of the unparalleled description of regulatory mechanisms controlling oogenesis and embryogenesis. However, we demonstrate that Drosophila could not survive the conditions mandated for particular flight opportunities on the Space Shuttle.

The surface area, size and shape of the nanoparticles decide the physical and chemical properties of these particles to a great extent, which in turn decide the performance in various applications [11]. The particle size, and its distribution, the magnetic and flow properties of the fluid influence the application parameters especially in biomedicine. The spherical shape and monodispersibility of SPIONs are often a prerequisite for application in living tissues [12]. So, optimization of the synthesis of nanoparticles and their conjugation with organic molecules onto the surface becomes very much essential.|$|R

A survey {{for the presence of}} Clostridium botulinum type E along the coastline of Nunavik indicated a prevalence of spores along the southern coasts of Ungava Bay and Hudson Bay, indicating a possibility of contamination of seal meat from environmental sources during butchering. The highest concentration of spores was found in the Koksoak River (> 5400 spores/kg), which flows into southern Ungava Bay. Spores were also found on seal skin and in seal intestinal contents, although at levels lower than found in environmental sources. Contamination of seal meat with C. botulinum type E spores may occur following contact with coastal rocks, tidal water, or shoreline soil, during the butchering process. Genomic analysis of coastal isolates of C. botulinum type E by PFGE indicated a heterogeneous population at the butchering sites, making it difficult to trace contamination sources. Epidemiologically related strains of C. botulinum type E could be identified by PFGE. Several distinct subtypes were involved in botulism incidents originating from Inuit villages of southern Ungava Bay, corroborating the existence of a high genetic diversity of C. botulinum type E in the environment. Some of these subtypes were detected inland and in large rivers flowing into southern Ungava Bay. The temperature used for igunaq preparation was the primary factor influencing the growth and toxigenesis of C. botulinum type E. All igunaq preparations incubated at 4 °C were negative for BoNT/E. The use of traditional seal skin pouches or plastic containers did not influence the time to toxicity of <b>seal</b> igunaq <b>preparations</b> aged at abuse temperatures (10 and 20 °C), regardless of inoculation dose. Changes in handling of seal meat during butchering to reduce contamination, combined with temperature control of the aging process to 4 °C or less, should significantly reduce the risk of botulism from consumption of traditional Inuit foods...|$|R
50|$|Tobruk {{began the}} 1990s with another {{deployment}} {{at short notice}} to the South Pacific. On 26 January 1990, she was tasked to assist with evacuating Australian citizens from Bougainville in Papua New Guinea; this operation was cancelled in early February while the ship was travelling to the island from Sydney. On 5 March, Tobruk left Sydney bound for Gallipoli, Turkey in company with HMAS Sydney to participate in ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove. Tobruk carried vehicles, stores and support personnel for the ceremony on 25 April, {{with many of the}} ship's crew also going ashore to visit the battlefields on Anzac Day. In 1991, the ship was refitted by Forgacs (formerly Carrington Slipways) in the company's new floating dock. The refit was delayed by industrial action by the Painters and Dockers Union. In late December 1992, Tobruk was selected to take part in Operation Solace, Australia's contribution to the international peacekeeping effort in Somalia. Initial notice of the deployment was given on 9 December, then confirmed on 15 December, with personnel recalled from leave. Working-up exercises ran between 22 and 26 December, before the ship left Sydney for Townsville. En route, the ship's company was informed that Tobruk would remain on station in Somalia for the duration of Operation Solace. In Townsville, equipment and vehicles for 1RAR and elements of the 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment (Australia). Tobruk sailed for Somalia on 1 January 1993: the loading process was delayed by another serious toxic gas incident in one of the ship's sewerage plants. The sealift operation in support Operation Solace, conducted by Tobruk and , was the largest performed by the RAN since the Vietnam War. Tobruk arrived at Mogadishu on 19 January, and unloaded during 20 January. She spent the next few days at anchor, during which she was used as a training platform for boarding and seizure operations by the United States Navy <b>SEALs,</b> in their <b>preparation</b> for the arrival of a merchant vessel smuggling weapons. Between 26 and 28 January, Tobruk visited Mombasa, Kenya to collect building materials for the reconstruction of the United States embassy in Somalia.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 11 A {{mechanical}} seal improvement program was initiated {{at a major}} oil refinery. The program was intended to improve seal reliability, reduce emissions, improve safety, and reduce costs. A partnership agreement was reached between the refinery and a major mechanical <b>seal</b> manufacturer. In <b>preparation</b> for the program, extensive research was conducted {{to ensure that all}} relevant information was readily available. A computer database was set up to organize the information and document changes as they were implemented. A document was generated detailing preferred seal designs and piping plans for various classifications of operating conditions, based on past experience and established engineering principle. The actual program focused on several areas. All {{mechanical seal}} failures were closely investigated {{in order to determine the}} root cause of failure and to make recommendations for changes that would improve seal reliability. Additionally, a list was generated of the pumps with the worst history of seal reliability. At least two of these ?worst seals? were addressed each month in an attempt to identify and correct the cause of premature failure. Pumps that were determined to be current or future environmental emissions problem were addressed at the rate of at least two per month in a similar fashion. As much as possible, all seal designs were standardized such that each seal was capable of being installed in the greatest number of pumps possible. In conjunction with this standardization, an attempt was made to identify and eliminate obsolete warehouse stock items. Additional training was provided to mechanics and unit operators to ensure that seals were being installed and operated properly. Over the course of 32 months, 191 pumps out of a population of over 12000 were converted to cartridges. During the same period of time, the seal mean time between failures for the entire population increased by 54 percent, and the average monthly maintenance cost associated with mechanical seal failures decreased by 17 percent. In addition, due to standardization and consolidation efforts, the net value of warehouse stock of seals and seal parts was reduced by 11 percent and the number of warehouse stock items was reduced by 34 percent. Several important conclusions were reached as a result of the success of the program. Cartridge seals, when properly applied, have an inherent advantage over noncartridge designs in terms of reliability and ease of installation. In order to be successful, any seal improvement program must incorporate additional training and support for mechanics and unit operators. Lastly, it is possible to reduce overall costs associated with seal failures, while fully complying with increasingly stringent environmental regulations and significantly improving safety...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Hamid Kalantari, Hamid Gourabi & Hossein Baharvand ### Abstract Our {{observation}} {{showed the}} addition of cytochalasin-B to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) culture for CBMn analysis led to the induction of apoptosis in these cells. On the other hand, addition of cyt-B is the most critical part of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) technique that cannot be omitted. Thus, modification of the traditional CBMn assay seems to be necessary. In this paper, we attempt to troubleshoot this problem and show that the CBMn assay {{can be used in}} embryonic stem cells research, particularly as a reliable tool in monitoring the cytogenetic integrity of cells. The potential reasons of the observed induction of apoptosis in mESCs are also discussed. The full text pdf version of this protocol can be accessed [here]([URL] ### Introduction Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) are pluripotent cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, round to oval nuclei, basophilic cytoplasm and round shaped cells that are traditionally co-cultured with “feeder” cells. The use of stem cells in research emphasizes the need to confirm their genetic integrity after different manipulations. For this purpose, many techniques with different capabilities have been used thus far, but most are expensive, time consuming, need special instruments and training. Adopting simple methods for stem cell research is a necessary step for stem cells in large-scale research projects, particularly in pharmaceutical bio-monitoring. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay is a reliable and precise method for assessing chromosome damage. 1 Basically, MNi originate from acentric chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes not included in the main nuclei following DNA replication and nuclear division 2. Although it has been a century since Howell and Jolly described Feulgen-positive nuclear bodies in human reticulocytes, also known as Howell-Jolly bodies 3, the term micronucleus (MN) was suggested for the first time by Boller, Schmidt and Heddle in the early 1970 s 4. In our study cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) was performed as previously described by Fenech 5 with adaptation. It has been shown that CBMn assay provides a simple method to detect the genotoxic potential of mutagens after in vivo and in vitro exposure to biologic systems 6. ### Reagents 1. 2 -Mercaptoethanol (Sigma; M- 7522) - Concentration of stock solution is 14. 3 M (pure liquid), for Preparation working solution of 2 -mercaptoethanol, dissolve 70 µl of 2 -mercaptoethanol stock solution (14. 3 M) in 10 ml of PBS; sterilize by filtration and store in a dark, cool place. 2 -mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent that can break down many toxic metabolites produced by cells in cultures, thus improving the environment surrounding the cells. Mouse cells are indeed very sensitive to oxidative metabolites; therefore 2 -mercaptoethanol is principally used in culturing these cells. - Bisbenzimide H 33258, (Calbiochem, 382061, 100 mg) - Dulbecco´s phosphate-buffered saline without Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + (D-PBS-) (Sigma; D 5652). Do not heat, sterilize immediately by filtration. - DMSO (Sigma, Hybrimax, sterile–filtered; D 2650) - EGTA powder (Sigma; E- 4378) - EDTA has a high affinity for magnesium and a lower affinity for calcium, whereas EGTA has a high affinity for calcium and a lower affinity for magnesium. Working solution of EGTA was prepared at concentration of 2 mM. - Embryonic stem cell qualified Fetal calf serum (ES-FCS) (Gibco; 16141 - 079) - FCS may contain undefined factors that can promote differentiation of ES cells, thus each lot must be screened prior its use in order to find the best lot quality. - Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, 10270 - 106) - Store frozen at - 20 ºC. Thaw in a 37 ºC water bath before adding to the culture medium. Once thawed, FBS will remain stable at 4 ºC for 3 – 4 weeks. - Caution: Avoid repeated refreezing FBS which has been thawed. - Gelatin (Sigma; G 2500) - Gelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of water-soluble proteins with high average molecular weight that are present in collagen. The change on a gelatin molecule and its isoelectric point are primarily due to the carboxyl amino and guanidine groups on the side chains of it. - L-glutamine solution (Gibco; 25030 - 024) - 200 mM sterile solution, cell culture tested. - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (ESGROTM; 13275) - This cytokine is often used to assist with maintaining the pluripotency of mESCs. - Mitomycin C powder (Sigma; M 0503) - Prepare fresh before use. Notice that the amount of Mit-C in a culture medium (at 38 ºC) that contains antibiotics and serum, decreases over time. - Non-essential amino acid (Gibco; 11140 - 035). Store aliquots in fridge - Thymidine powder (Sigma; T 1895) - Trypsin-EDTA (1 x) in HBSS without Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + (Gibco; 25300 - 054) - The optimal activity of trypsin is in a partially alkaline (pH 7. 8 - 8. 7) environment with no Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ions. **REAGENT SETUP** - BD Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences; cat. # 354277) - Since Matrigel™ matrix forms a gel above 10 °C; it should be kept at a low temperature. Therefore, all equipment and reagents (tips, Matrigel™ matrix solution, etc.) should be chilled on ice prior to use. For the preparation of Matrigel™, add 350 µl from the stock solution to 6 ml of cool medium. Thaw Matrigel™ at 4 ºC. - Cytochalasin-B (Sigma; C 6762) - Dissolve 5 mg solid Cytochalasin-B in 1 ml DMSO to give a Cyt-B concentration of 5000 µg/ml as follows (1000 x solution) : - i. Remove the cyt-B vial from - 20 ºC and place at room temperature. Do not remove the seal. - ii. Sterilize the top of the rubber seal with 70 % ethanol and allow the ethanol to evaporate. - iii. Vent the vial’s seal aseptically. With a 2. 5 ml sterile syringe, inject 1 ml DMSO through the seal. - iv. Mix contents gently. Cytochalasin-B dissolves readily in DMSO. - v. Mix and dispense 50 µl of 1000 x stock solution aliquots into sterile, 0. 5 ml polystyrene tubes. Date and label tubes with “cyt-B”. - vi. Store at - 20 ºC for up to 12 months. The vials of powder are guaranteed by Sigma for 2 years if stored at - 20 ºC. - vii. For preparation of 100 x and 10 x cyt-B, add 450 µL and 4950 µL DMEM, respectively. - Caution: Cytochalasin-B is toxic and it can be a possible teratogen agent. It must always be purchased in <b>sealed</b> vials. The <b>preparation</b> of this reagent must be carried out in a cytoguard cabinet. - DMEM: The culture medium needed for feeder layer growth. - 1. DMEM (Gibco; 12800 - 116) 13. 5 g/l - 2. NaHCO 3 (Sigma; S- 5761) 3. 7 g/l - 3. Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco; 15070 - 063) 10 ml/L - 4. HCl (1 N) 3 ml/L - 5. 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma; M- 7522) 7 µL - Add these components to 837 ml of cell culture grade de-ionized water filter and store in dark, cool conditions. Adjust the pH to 0. 2 - 0. 3 units below the desired working pH (7. 0 - 7. 4) by adding 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCl with stirring. The pH of bicarbonate buffered solutions usually raises 0. 1 – 0. 2 units during filtration. - ES-cell medium - 1. Knock-out™ DMEM (Gibco; 10829 - 018) 500 ml - 2. Penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; 15070 - 063) 5 ml - 3. Non-essential amino acid (Gibco; 11140 - 035) 5 ml - 4. 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma; M- 7522) 0. 5 ml - 5. ES-FCS (Gibco; 16141 - 079) 75 ml - Aliquot and store at 4 ºC in a dark place. For 50 ml KO-DMEM, 500 µl of L-glutamine and 50 µl LIF 1 are needed. - Caution: Periodic discontinuation of antibiotic use is recommended for several reasons. First, questionable cell culture techniques can be masked; antibiotic-resistant organisms may arise, and finally, cryptic microbial contamination may be present and masked by antibiotic use. - Gelatin treatment of flasks - i. Add 3 - 4 ml of 0. 1 % sterile gelatin to cover the bottom of the T- 25 flask. - ii. Let the gelatin sit for 1 hour at 37 ºC. Sitting longer is also acceptable. - iii. Remove excess fluid from the coated surface and allow to air dry under a laminar flow hood for approximately 1 / 2 hour (alternatively can allow to air dry overnight). - iv. Rinse with sterile tissue culture grade water or a balanced salt solution before adding the media and/or cells (optimal condition for attachment must be determined for each cell line and application). - Hoechst 33258 stock solution Preparation: - Stock solutions of most of the dyes are prepared in PBS at concentrations of 1. 0 mg/ml. However, DAPI and the Hoechst dyes should be prepared in distilled water since at relatively high concentrations these dyes tend to precipitate in PBS. Stock solutions are refrigerated in dark-colored containers or wrapped in foil 7. - Caution: This material is harmful if inhaled, by contact with skin and if swallowed. - The Bisbenzimide Hoechst dyes are designated by numbers 33258, 33342 and 34580. As with H 33258, Hoechst stain H 33342 is used for staining DNA. It binds to AT-rich sequences (in the minor groove) without intercalation 8. H 33342 exhibits 10 -fold greater cell permeability than H 33258. DAPI and H 33258 only stain vital cells, while H 33342 stains vital and dead cell types 9, with blue emission when examine with fluorescent microscopy. H 33258 gives a more stable reaction compared with Hoechst 33342 10. The dye is excited at 365 nm and the filter (emission) is 418 nm 8. - Mitomycin-C treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) - i. Aspirate media from day 14 mEF that are confluent in a T- 75 flask. - ii. Add 200 µl Mit-C to 10 ml of culture medium and incubate for 90 minutes at 37 ºC. - iii. Aspirate off the media and wash three times with 5 ml of PBS- to remove any trace of Mit-C. - iv. Trypsinize and resuspend the cells in growth medium and add 2. 5 × 106 cells to each pre-gelatinized T- 25 flask that contains growth medium adjusted to the appropriate pH. Rotate and distribute the cell suspension evenly {{on the surface of the}} flask. Cell attachment of fibroblasts cells usually takes place within 1 - 2 hours. - Caution: Cells|$|R
