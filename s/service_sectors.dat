40|$|Abstract — A well-functioning <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> {{is the key}} to the {{economic}} performance of the contemporary developing countries. India is no exception, where <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> grows at a faster rate. What is, however, critical is the capacity of the <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> to create new jobs. This study investigates the employment intensity of <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> growth in India and examines the role of fundamental macroeconomic factors in determining the same. The results indicate that over the years, while output growth rate in <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> has increased, employment growth rate has decelerated significantly leading to considerable fall in employment elasticity. Coupled with this, there is predominance of low productive and unskilled labour based activities in <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> Regression results based on the time-series data from 1960 - 61 to 2004 - 05 further indicate that investment friendly environment, better public expenditure management, effective labour policies and proper structural transformation are the key to achieve higher employment elasticity in <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> Keywords- growth; employment; structural change; <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of a trivariate vector autoregressive {{framework}} that includes the degree of <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> openness, this article examines the link between tourism growth and <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> growth in Singapore. Empirical analysis based on Johansen's cointegration approach shows that the three variables are cointegrated (i. e., a stable long-run relationship exists among tourism growth, the degree of openness of the <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> and <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> growth). The <b>services</b> and manufacturing <b>sectors</b> are regarded as the twin engines of Singapore's economic growth.

In 1991, the Tirunelveli region ranked second {{in the number of}} women workers. <b>Service</b> <b>sectors</b> such as tourism have developed, due to a growth in religious tourism. Tirunelveli has beedi and cement factories, tobacco companies, workshops for steel-based products and mills for cotton textiles, spinning and weaving; there are also small-scale industries, such as tanneries and brick kilns. The agricultural areas, hand-woven clothes and household industries contribute to the economic growth of the city. Food-processing industries have developed since the late 1990s; at the district level, it is the foremost industrial segment. Industries involving rice-making, blue-jelly metal manufacturing and jem power generating are located {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The major agricultural produce in the region is paddy and cotton. Beedi production during the 1990s earned an annual revenue of 190billion and a foreign exchange of 8billion across the three districts of Tirunelveli, Tiruchirapalli and Vellore.|$|E

The study also looks into the sub-sectoral dynamics and indicates towards the fact that the trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage and communications sub-sector contributes the most in the growth of Indian <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> Therefore FDI can be truly be used as a propagator of economic growth, via its favourable effect on the growth in the <b>services</b> <b>sector.</b> Finally, the study addresses the long running sustainability debate regarding the Indian <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> ...|$|R

After controlling for growth it is difficult to identify a positive and significant impact of international trade on employment in the organized <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> We have also tried to work out the direct and indirect effects of exports and imports on employment after deciphering their effects included in overall growth. However, the positive effects are mostly negligible. For the informal or unorganized <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> employment the impact does not seem to be greatly different from what is observed in the case of the organized <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> employment.

40|$|The {{maturing}} of {{the manufacturing}} sector in many Asian countries, combined with the relative backwardness of its <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> has made <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> development a top priority for developing Asia. Our central objective is to broadly survey and analyze the current landscape of the region's <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> so as to assess its potential {{to serve as an}} engine for inclusive economic growth. Our analysis indicates that services are already an important source of output, growth, and jobs in the region. However, its productivity greatly lags that of the advanced economies, which implies ample room for further growth. The impact of <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> on poverty reduction is less clear but we do find some limited evidence of a poverty reduction effect. One key challenge for all Asian countries is {{to improve the quality of}} <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> data. Overall, while <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> development is a long and challenging process, creating more competitive services markets by removing a wide range of internal and external policy distortions is vital for improving <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> productivity.

40|$|AbstractThe slow {{development}} of the <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> in China mainly lies in the lagging behind of rural <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> development in the rural area. Currently, the gap of per capita income between rural and urban areas in China is fifteen years, and employment quota of city <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> surpassed fifty percent fifteen years ago. However, the employment quota of the rural <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> in 2009 was less than ten percent. The reason may be the dispersive distribution of the rural population, such as the construction of immigrating towns Three Gorges Project, the construction of towns by canceling villages in Hei Longjiang Province, the group together of the southeast coastal industry.
