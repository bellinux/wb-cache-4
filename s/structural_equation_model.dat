50|$|Structural {{equation}} modeling (SEM) {{includes a}} diverse set of mathematical models, computer algorithms, and statistical methods that fit networks of constructs to data. SEM includes confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, partial least squares path modeling, and latent growth modeling. The concept {{should not be}} confused with the related concept of structural models in econometrics, nor with structural models in economics. Structural equation models are often used to assess unobservable 'latent' constructs. They often invoke a measurement model that defines latent variables using one or more observed variables, and a structural model that imputes relationships between latent variables. The links between constructs of a <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>model</b> may be estimated with independent regression equations or through more involved approaches such as those employed in LISREL.|$|E
50|$|Structural {{equation}} modeling {{software is}} typically used for performing confirmatory factor analysis. LISREL, EQS, AMOS, Mplus and laavan package in R are popular software programs. CFA is also frequently {{used as a}} first step to assess the proposed measurement model in a <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> <b>model.</b> Many of the rules of interpretation regarding assessment of model fit and model modification in structural equation modeling apply equally to CFA. CFA is distinguished from structural equation modeling by the fact that in CFA, there are no directed arrows between latent factors. In other words, while in CFA factors are not presumed to directly cause one another, SEM often does specify particular factors and variables to be causal in nature. In the context of SEM, the CFA is often called 'the measurement model', while the relations between the latent variables (with directed arrows) are called 'the structural model'.|$|E
