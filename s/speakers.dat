5|$|According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 {{there were}} up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland. The largest populations were in the United States (up to 100,000), the UK, Spain and Germany (c. 30,000 each) and a large {{proportion}} of the remaining 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. A considerable majority of Swedish residents born outside Sweden (c. 1.5 million) speak Swedish and according to the ELDIA Project, there were c. 2,390,000 second-language <b>speakers</b> in Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation, for a total of about 5 million second-language <b>speakers.</b> The total number of native <b>speakers</b> could be up to 8.6 million with an additional 4–5 million second language <b>speakers</b> in Sweden and Finland. Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion of <b>speakers</b> of Danish and especially Norwegian are highly fluent in Swedish for a total number of <b>speakers</b> that could be as high as 15 million.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{prevailing}} classification scheme by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its <b>speakers</b> moved northwest along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Ch'olan <b>speakers</b> subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the Yucatán Peninsula. <b>Speakers</b> of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When <b>speakers</b> of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Ch'olan group and moved south into the Chiapas highlands, they {{came into contact with}} <b>speakers</b> of Mixe–Zoque languages. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and Houston, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with <b>speakers</b> of Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.|$|E

5|$|Many {{users of}} English in the {{expanding}} circle {{use it to}} communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native <b>speakers</b> of English plays no part in their decision to use English.

Varieties of English learned by <b>speakers</b> who are not native <b>speakers</b> born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native <b>speakers</b> of English in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E

40|$|This survey {{focuses on}} two {{challenging}} speech processing topics, namely: <b>speaker</b> segmen-tation and <b>speaker</b> clustering. <b>Speaker</b> segmentation aims at nding <b>speaker</b> change points in an audio stream, whereas <b>speaker</b> clustering aims at grouping speech segments based on <b>speaker</b> characteristics. Model-based, metric-based, and hybrid <b>speaker</b> segmentation algo-rithms are reviewed. Concerning <b>speaker</b> clustering, deterministic and probabilistic algo-rithms are examined. A comparative {{assessment of the}} reviewed algorithms is undertaken, the algorithm advantages and disadvantages are indicated, insight to the algorithms is of-fered, and deductions as well as recommendations are given. Rich transcription and movie analysis are candidate applications that benet from combined <b>speaker</b> segmentation and clustering...|$|R
50|$|At {{the first}} sitting after a general election, Parliament {{presided over by}} the {{outgoing}} <b>Speaker</b> or, in his absence, by the Deputy <b>Speaker,</b> proceeds first to elect a <b>Speaker</b> and a Deputy <b>Speaker</b> in the manner laid down in the Rules of Procedure.

After {{the election of the}} <b>Speaker</b> and the Deputy <b>Speaker,</b> the House is adjourned for a short period so as to enable the newly elected <b>Speaker</b> and Deputy <b>Speaker</b> to take oath of their office. The House then meets with the new <b>Speaker</b> presiding.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Speaker</b> diarisation (or diarization) is {{the process}} of {{partitioning}} an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the <b>speaker</b> identity. It can enhance the readability of an automatic speech transcription by structuring the audio stream into <b>speaker</b> turns and, when used together with <b>speaker</b> recognition systems, by providing the <b>speaker’s</b> true identity. It is used to answer the question [...] "who spoke when?"Speaker diarisation is a combination of <b>speaker</b> segmentation and <b>speaker</b> clustering. The first aims at finding <b>speaker</b> change points in an audio stream. The second aims at grouping together speech segments on the basis of <b>speaker</b> characteristics.|$|R

5|$|A {{tradition}} of indigenous literacy in Ottawa {{arose in the}} 19th century, as <b>speakers</b> of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate in their own language. Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography, while Methodist and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies. Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa <b>speakers</b> on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals. Ottawa <b>speakers</b> from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to Anishinabe Enamiad ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan missionaries and published in Harbor Springs, Michigan between 1896 and 1902.|$|E
5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL <b>speakers</b> constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it {{does not imply that}} it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since <b>speakers</b> of other languages may also speak English.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>Speaker,</b> a Deputy <b>Speaker,</b> {{also known as the}} [...] "Chair of Committees" [...] (of the Whole,) is elected {{at the beginning of each}} parliament to act in place of the <b>Speaker</b> when the latter is unavailable. Under the Standing Orders, the <b>Speaker,</b> after consulting with each of the party leaders, nominates a candidate for Deputy <b>Speaker</b> to the House, which then votes on that nomination. The Deputy <b>Speaker</b> presides over daily sessions of the House when the <b>Speaker</b> is not in the chair. The Deputy <b>Speaker</b> also chairs the House when it sits as a Committee of the Whole. Other presiding officers, the Deputy Chair of Committees and the Assistant Deputy Chair of Committees, are chosen each session to occupy the chair when the <b>Speaker</b> and Deputy <b>Speaker</b> are not available. The Deputy <b>Speaker</b> and the other presiding officers are members of the Panel of Chairs, and can therefore be selected by the <b>Speaker</b> to chair legislative committees. Like the <b>Speaker,</b> the Deputy <b>Speaker</b> has a role in administering the House.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the <b>speaker</b> tracking and clustering system that we implemented for the ESTER evaluation campaign.

Results show {{that the use of}} t-norm significantly improves the performance at low false alarm rates. In a second part of the paper, we study the possible interactions between <b>speaker</b> tracking and <b>speaker</b> segmentation (also known as <b>speaker</b> diarization). We show that <b>speaker</b> segmentation benefits from the use of <b>speaker</b> tracking as a prior information while the contrary is not true. Using <b>speaker</b> tracking before clustering can decrease the <b>speaker</b> segmentation error by 4 % absolute. 1...|$|R
