40|$|Introduction: Several {{drugs have}} been {{associated}} with the development of peripheral edema. Leg edema can result in dermatitis of the lower extremities.   We describe levofloxacin-induced peripheral leg edema, which progressed to <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Methods: A 76 -year-old man with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma was administered intravenous vancomycin and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam by injection for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.   Prior to discharge, the patient's antibiotic therapy was switched to oral levofloxacin.   The patient developed drug-associated bilateral peripheral leg edema and <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Both the dermatitis and leg edema resolved after withdrawal of levofloxacin and administration of topical corticosteroid therapy. The patient had a similar reaction to levofloxacin one year prior, which had subsided with discontinuation of the drug. Results: Several medications have been documented to cause leg edema and secondary <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis.</b>   The timing, recurrence, and resolution of edema and <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with respect to the administration and termination of levofloxacin suggest that the leg edema and <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> occurred secondary to levofloxacin administration. Discussions: Levofloxacin can be added to the list of drugs associated with the development of peripheral leg edema.    <b>Stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> proceeded by lower extremity edema can be added to the list of adverse events associated with levofloxaci...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{report the}} case of a 73 -year-old man with massive {{swelling}} of the lower extremities, with a chronic and rather uncommon form of <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> – stasis papillomatosis. The patient was also diagnosed with severe heart failure, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism that required a substantial dose of exogenous tyrosine, microcytic and megaloblastic anemia, iron deficiency, and type 2 diabetes. The cause of <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> lesions is not completely understood. It may be caused by the allergic reaction to some epidermal protein antigen formation or chronic damage to the dermal-epidermal barrier that makes the skin more sensitive to irritants or trauma. It has, however, been suggested that the term <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> should be used to refer only to cases caused by chronic venous insufficiency, which belongs to a group of lifestyle diseases and affects both women and men more and more frequently.   KEY WORDS: stasis; vein insufficienty; edema; heart failure</p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is an itchy, scaly, and hyperpigmented {{condition}} of the lower leg due to venous insufficiency. Hemosiderin and/or melanin have been considered responsible for the brown pigmentation. However, there are not sufficient histopathologic studies. In this retrospective study the hospital records and biopsy slides of 20 patients were reviewed to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms of brown pigmentation in <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Fifteen were men (75 %) and 5 were women (25 %) {{with a mean age}} of 46. 2 +/- 8. 2 yr (18 - 76), mean age at onset of 43. 4 +/- 18. 0 yr (17 - 73), and a mean duration of the disease 2. 8 +/- 2. 5 yr (0. 25 - 10). All patients had varicose vein and complained of pruritus. On histopathologic evaluation, two cases out of 20 (3 skin biopsy specimens from 25 samples) showed dermal melanocytes containing melanin, and incontinence of melanin pigment was observed in 5 cases, which indicates that melanin pigments from epidermis could contribute to cutaneous pigmentation in <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> However, the existence of dermal melanocytes in two cases cannot be explained because normally the dermis contains no melanocytes. Further studies concerning the role of iron or inflammatory cytokines on the development of dermal melanocytes should be conducted...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) in lower limbs manifest as <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The anti-collagenase, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of doxycycline and the T-cell inhibitory effects of tacrolimus could theoretically modify the disease pathophysiology. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of four weeks combination therapy of oral doxycycline 100 mg with topical tacrolimus 0. 1 % for <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> associated with CVI. Materials and Methods: A single-arm, interventional pilot study was conducted on subjects with CVI of C 4 to C 6 category (CEAP classification: clinical, etiology, anatomical, pathophysiology). Treatment duration was four weeks with fortnightly follow-ups. Primary efficacy was assessed as changes from baseline of pigmentation, erythema, edema, itching and hair loss of the affected area evaluated on Likert scale scores. Secondary efficacy parameters were percentage improvement of the dermatitis area and changes in ulcer dimensions (maximum length and breadth), if present. Safety evaluation included all treatment emergent clinical signs and symptoms reported by the patients and/or observed by the physician. Results: Out of 19 recruited subjects, 15 completed the study for analysis. Significant (P< 0. 01) improvement in pain, edema, pigmentation, erythema and exudation were observed. Reduction of ulcer dimensions was also statistically significant (P< 0. 01). 86. 6 % showed improvement of the dermatitis area, 6. 7 % patients failed to show any improvement and 6. 7 % showed worsening. Adverse effects were observed in only two subjects. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests efficacy of this combination therapy in controlling features of <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> but further studies are needed for validation...|$|E

40|$|A {{clinical}} {{model to}} examine the hypothesis that venous hypertension of the lower leg per se can cause lower leg <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is described. To prove this concept, we retrospectively studied a consecutive series of 38 patients with lower leg dermatitis who underwent phlebological examination at our consultation {{over a period of}} four years. Among those patients who had an insufficiency of the superficial veins only, without insufficiency of the deep veins, 22 had undergone patch testing to common allergens in phlebology. We found 10 patients with a <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> of the lower leg and an incompetent great saphenous vein, six of whom had no detectable contact sensitization at all and another four exclusively to phlebologically irrelevant substances, e. g. nickel, cobalt, chromate or epoxid resin. All these 10 patients showed long saphenous vein incompetence from the groin to the medial aspect of the leg. All were operated by classical flush ligation and saphenectomy. Lower leg dermatitis healed in all 10 patients within 8 - 12 weeks and no recurrence was observed (1 year follow-up). These results support clinical experience that venous hypertension alone indeed can cause lower leg dermatitis...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{management}} of stasis ulcer, and the frequently coexisting <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> depends on correct diagnosis. Significant morbidity and disability result, often {{over a long}} period of time. The usual defect involved is incompetence of the intrinsic valves in either the superficial or deep veins. Treatment is geared towards correction of venous hypertension in the lower leg, clearing of secondary infection and inflammation, protection from further injury, and correction of predisposing factors. Treatment failure is usually due to non-compliance, since many treatment methods are irksome. A simplified method, using the Unna paste boot, partly eliminates dependence on patient compliance...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of a new topical vehicle formulation containing cetirizine in emu oil in treating inflammatory skin conditions. Methods: A single blind half body comparative study of patients with psoriasis, atopic and <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis</b> were all treated with midpotency topical steroid (desoximethasone) in propylene glycol base, desoximethasone and cetirizine in propylene glycol base, desoximethasone in emu oil base and desoximethasone with cetirizine dissolved in emu oil. Results: Based on patients’ ranking of creams’ efficacy, and supported by photographic data and investigators’ clinical assessment, results clearly indicated that desoximethasone and cetirizine in emu base was statistically more efficacious than either desoximethasone alone or with cetirizine in neutral propylene glycol base or desoximethasone in emu oil base (without cetirizine). Conclusions: Cetirizine and emu oil, having inherent anti-inflammatory and other beneficial properties synergistically, and by different biochemical pathways, enhance and magnify each other’s pharmaceutical effects that are useful in treatment of skin inflammatory diseases. </p...|$|E

The isolate produced no pigment and was not identifiable using chromogenic agar and API 20 C AUX. The fungus was identified as Metschnikowia sp. strain UM 1034, which is close to that of Metschnikowia drosophilae based on ITS- and D 1 /D 2 domain-based phylogenetic analysis. However, the physiology of the strain was not associated to M. drosophilae. This pathogen exhibited low sensitivity to all tested azoles, echinocandins, 5 -flucytosine and amphotericin B.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} assess the impact of {{comorbidities}} and identify factors that accelerate the healing rate of venous leg ulcers we performed an extensive, retrospective analysis of our experience in a diverse population. From June, 2006 to June, 2014, 897 patients with 1249 venous leg ulcers were treated at Lake Wound Clinics. Treatment protocols utilized the standard regimen of wound cleaning, debridement and compression bandaging. Wound cleaning, autolytic debridement, packing and dressing of venous leg ulcers utilized aqueous solutions of hypochlorous acid (HCA) rather than the standard normal saline. This protocol caused all ulcers to close completely. Comorbidities that delayed healing included uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, advanced peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAD), active smoking, use of steroid medications and/or street drugs, large initial ulcer size and significant depth. Other factors, including advanced age, recurrent venous ulceration, <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> lipodermatosclerosis, morbid obesity and infection with one or more multidrug resistant organisms did not delay closure. From this experience we conclude that venous leg ulcer care protocols that clean, debride, pack and dress with hypochlorous acid solutions can reduce the effects of some comorbidities while accelerating healing times. Additional benefits are described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Contact {{dermatitis}} {{is not a}} homogenous entity, {{but rather}} a number of subtypes contributing to different clinical presentations. For better understanding, instructional sheets provide information that assists in patient care. Informational sheets on contact dermatitis, patch testing, hand dermatitis, <b>stasis</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and poison ivy are reviewed for open forum. Although often considered archaic therapy, restriction in use of soaps/cleansers appears to aid in clinical improvement of contact irritant dermatitis. Patient education on patch testing is greatly aided by presenting visual material prior to formal discussion. An internet site for more information regarding culprit environmental allergens is presented. Some simple methods for patients to achieve clinical improvement with eczema, hand dermatitis, and poison ivy are presented. Simplicity, clarity, as well as practical, usable informa-tion are important with patient presentation of the subject of eczema. The material has to be presented in an easy-to-follow, coherent manner for patients. Semantics and scien-tific detail are not necessarily included. Thus on instructional sheets,- eczema can be equated with dermatitis;- determining the primary lesion in an eruption is not discussed;- classification by stage, location, appearance, or cause is not necessary...|$|E
