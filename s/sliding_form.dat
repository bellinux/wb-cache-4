50|$|A slider or slide {{phone is}} {{composed}} of usually two, but sometimes more, sections that slide past each other on rails. Most slider phones have a display segment which houses the speaker used for calls and the phone's screen, while another segment contains the keypad or keyboard and slides out for use. The goal of a <b>sliding</b> <b>form</b> factor is to allow the operator {{to take advantage of}} full physical keyboards or keypads, without sacrificing portability, by retracting them into the phone when they are not in use. Many different companies have developed phones that slide: Samsung has the Corby and BlackBerry has the Torch.|$|E
50|$|These new {{platforms}} led to {{the decline}} of earlier ones. Microsoft, for instance, started a new OS from scratch, called Windows Phone. Nokia abandoned Symbian and partnered with Microsoft to use Windows Phone on its smartphones. Windows Phone then became the third-most-popular OS. Palm's webOS was bought by Hewlett-Packard and later sold to LG Electronics for use on LG smart TVs. BlackBerry Limited, formerly known as Research In Motion, also made a new platform based on QNX, BlackBerry 10, which was later discontinued. The capacitive touchscreen also changed smartphone form factors. Before 2007, it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical QWERTY keyboard in either a candybar or <b>sliding</b> <b>form</b> factor. However, by mid 2010s, almost all smartphones were touchscreen phones.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the basis for flagellar and ciliary movements is ATP-dependent sliding between adjacent doublet microtubules. However, the mechanism for converting microtubule sliding into flagellar and ciliary movements has long remained unresolved. The author has developed new sperm models that use bull spermatozoa divested of their plasma membrane and midpiece mitochondrial sheath by Triton X- 100 and dithiothreitol. These models enable the observation of both the oscillatory sliding movement of activated doublet microtubules and flagellar bend formation {{in the presence of}} ATP. A long fiber of doublet microtubules extruded by synchronous sliding of the sperm flagella and a short fiber of doublet microtubules extruded by metachronal sliding exhibited spontaneous oscillatory movements and constructed a one beat cycle of flagellar bending by alternately actuating. The small sliding displacement generated by metachronal <b>sliding</b> <b>formed</b> helical bends, whereas the large displacement by synchronous <b>sliding</b> <b>formed</b> planar bends. Therefore, the resultant waveform is a half-funnel shape, which is similar to ciliary movements...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of the modified adaptive conjugate gradient (CG) algorithms based on the iterative CG method for adaptive filtering is highly related to the ways of estimating the correlation matrix and the cross-correlation vector. The existing approaches of implementing the CG algorithms using the data windows of exponential form or <b>sliding</b> <b>form</b> result in either loss of convergence or increase in misadjustment. This paper presents and analyzes {{a new approach to}} the implementation of the CG algorithms for adaptive filtering by using a generalized data windowing scheme. For the new modified CG algorithms, we show that the convergence speed is accelerated, the misadjustment and tracking capability comparable to those of the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm are achieved. Computer simulations demonstrated in the framework of linear system modeling problem show the improvements of the new modifications. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of wear tests obtained for 4 groups of materials: surface-hardened alloy steels and alloy cast steels for structural applications, hard-wearing surface-hardened alloy cast steels, and austempered alloy cast irons. The wear tests have been performed on a specially designed test rig that allows reproducing the real operating conditions of chain wheels, including the rolling and <b>sliding</b> <b>form</b> of contact between elements. The chain wheels subjected to tests were operated with the use of loose quartz abrasive. This study presents results of measurements of material parameters, micro-structure of a surface subject to wear, as well as the linear wear determined for the materials considered. Based on the results, the following was found: the best wear properties were obtained for surface-hardened alloy steels and wear surface; strengthening of the ADI surface took place - most probably as a result of transformation of austenite into martensite; the uniformity {{of the structure of the}} materials affects the surface wear process. The study also indicated a significant degree of graphite deformation in ADI characterized by the upper ausferritic structure and its oblique orientation in relation to the surface, which resulted in a facilitated degradation of the surface caused by the quartz abrasive...|$|E

Both Northern (NTS) and Southern Twin Slide (STS) involve two failure stages, a debris avalanche and a translational slide, but are strongly affected by distinct preconditioning factors linked to the older and buried Father Slide. Core-acoustic correlations suggest that sliding occurred along sub-horizontal weak layers reflecting abrupt physical changes in lithology or mechanical properties. Our results show further that headwall failure predominantly took place along sub-vertical normal faults, partly through reactivation of buried Father Slide headscarps...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a nanoplasmonic-based approach to induce nanometer-sized local defects in the phospholipid membranes. Here, gold nanorods and nanoparticles having plasmon resonances in the nearinfrared (NIR) spectral range are used as optical absorption centers in the lipid membrane. Defects optically induced by NIR-laser irradiation of gold nanoparticles are continuously monitored by high-precision ion conductance measurement. Localized laser-mediated heating of nanorods and nanoparticle aggregates cause either (a) transient nanopores in lipid membranes or (b) irreversible rupture of the membrane.
