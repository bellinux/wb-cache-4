40|$|The study {{aims for}} the {{development}} of a Pretreatment method for wheat straw, when it is stored at low temperature. The hypothesis is that an initial disruption of the crystalline nature of lignocellulose can improve the efficiency of current pretreatment method during low temperature storage. A silo model storage of wheat straw, with high moisture, involving 3 different fungal species (Holtermanniella takashimae, Pichia anomala and Anthracophyllum discolor) and their combination at two different temperatures (4 °C and 15 °C) was tested. The microbiology of samples was studied for analyzing the effectiveness of conservation. Dilute acid treatment was done prior to the saccharification with Accellerase™ 1000 enzyme. The soluble fraction of hydrolysate was fermented in 15 ml <b>serum</b> <b>flask</b> with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biomass stored with combination of Holtermanniella takashimae and Pichia anomala at 4 °C showed significant improvement in initial ethanol yield (2. 8 % increase in ethanol at P‐value< 0. 05) compared to the non inoculated wet control sample. A detailed study of the simple sugars released, showed that the total sugar yield for P. anomala inoculated sample was double as that of control sample (29. 283 g/L Vs 17. 43 g/L). The ethanol yield for A. discolor inoculated samples (59 %) was higher than the theoretical maximum (< 50 %), which suggests that the saccharification may not have completed at the time of fermentation. The samples stored with P. anomala showed significant inhibition of mold and other contaminants. But the results were compared with wet non inoculated samples which were non sterile and had high microbial load (106 CFU/g of fungus, 108 CFU/g aerobic bacteria, 107 CFU/g of enterobacteria) during incubation. So it is suggested to carry out a future study with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) to completely utilize the free sugars and with a dry stored material as control, to avoid the effect of natural microflora...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the clinical and hematological aspects during experimental envenomation by Crotalus durissus terrificus in dogs treated with different antiophidic serum doses. Sixteen dogs {{were divided into two}} groups of eight animals each. Group I received 1 mg/kg venom subcutaneously and 30 mg antiophidic serum intravenously; Group II received 1 mg/kg venom subcutaneously and 60 mg antiophidic serum intravenously. In the clinical evaluation, we observed ataxia, moderate sedation, dilated pupils, sialorrhea, flaccid paralysis of mandibular muscles, and discreet edema at the site of venom inoculation. Evaluating red and white blood cells, we observed a decrease of hemoglobins, globular volume and erythrocytes, and an increase of plasmatic proteins, leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. Clotting time increased and there was blood incoagulability with return to normal clotting time six hours after antiophidic serum administration. Animals treated with six antiophidic <b>serum</b> <b>flasks</b> had a faster recovery than the animals that received three <b>serum</b> <b>flasks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aromatic {{compounds}} are inhibitors {{of methane}} biosynthesis in anaerobic treatment of solid wastes and industrial efflu-ents. Anaerobic treatment of solid wastes and industrial effluents {{may be limited}} by the methanogenic bacteria inhibi-tion exerted by these types of compounds, the production of biogas is not possible and the organic matter contained in the effluent is not reduced. These effluents poured in the nature can {{be the basis of}} the pollution. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effect of monosubstituted aromatic compounds functional groups on the methanogenic inhibi-tion. The toxicity to acetoclastic methanogenic bacteria has performed in <b>serum</b> <b>flasks,</b> utilizing digested pig manure as inoculums, by measuring methane production. The nature of aromatic functional groups was observed to have a pro-found effect on the toxicity of the monosubstituted aromatics. Among the monosubstituted aromatic, the chlorobenzene was the most toxic with 50 % of inhibition occurring at the concentration of 30. 08 mg/l. In contrast, benzoic acid is the least inhibitory with IC 50 of 2515. 20 mg/l.

40|$|N-substituted {{aromatics}} {{are important}} priority pollutants entering the environment primarily through anthropogenic activities {{associated with the}} industrial production of dyes, explosives, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Anaerobic treatment of wastewaters discharged by these industries could potentially be problematical {{as a result of}} the high toxicity of N-substituted aromatics. The objective of this study was to examine the structure-toxicity relationships of N-substituted aromatic compounds to acetoclastic methanogenic bacteria. The toxicity was assayed in <b>serum</b> <b>flasks</b> by measuring methane production in granular sludge. Unacclimated cultures were used to minimize the biotransformation of the toxic organic chemicals during the test. The nature and the degree of the aromatic substitution were observed to have a profound effect on the toxicity of the test compound. Nitroaromatic compounds were, on the average, over 500 -fold more toxic than their corresponding aromatic amines. Considering the facile reduction of nitro groups by anaerobic microorganisms, a dramatic detoxification of nitroaromatics towards methanogens can be expected to occur during anaerobic wastewater treatment. While the toxicity exerted by the N-substituted aromatic compounds was closely correlated with compound apolarity (log P), it was observed that at any given log P, N-substituted phenols had a toxicity that was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorophenols and alkylphenols. This indicates that toxicity due to the chemical reactivity of nitroaromatics is much more important than partitioning effects in bacterial membranes...|$|R

Two types of PSP hydrolysates were used: {{one in which}} the starch in the PSP was liquefied with alpha-amylase, and {{one in which the}} liquefied starch was further hydrolyzed to glucose by amyloglucosidase. When the PSP hydrolysates or untreated PSP were added at circa 10 – 14 g/L of glucose units, both strains grew well and produced hydrogen with reasonable to high molar yields (2. 4 – 3. 8 moles H 2 /mole glucose units), and no significant production of lactate. The hydrogen production rates and yields were similar with untreated PSP, hydrolyzed PSP, and pure glucose, showing that C. saccharolyticus and T. neapolitana are well equipped for the utilization of starch. When the concentrations of the substrates were increased, growth and hydrogen production of both strains were hampered. At substrate concentrations of circa 30 – 40 g/L of glucose units, the molar hydrogen yield of C. saccharolyticus was severely reduced due to the formation of high amounts of lactate, while T. neapolitana was unable to grow at all. The results showed that PSP and PSP hydrolysates are very suitable substrates for efficient fermentative hydrogen production at moderate substrate loadings...|$|R
40|$|The new {{robotized}} {{gas analysis}} system is an improved {{version of the}} system described by Molstad et al (2007). The new system has replaced the microGC with a traditional GC, equipped with various valves, columns and detectors (TCD, FID and ECD). This ensures more sensitive measurements of N 2 O (by ECD) and CH 4 (by FID), thus allowing quantification of these gases at much below ambient levels in the atmosphere (which are 0. 35 ppmv for N 2 O, 1. 84 ppmv for CH 4). The new system uses a better sampler, CTC GC-PAL (delivered by Agilent), which has a wider operation than the old (Gilson). We have also changed tubing in the sampling pump (information will come) In all other aspects, the new system {{is equal to the}} original (Molstad et al 2007) regarding the repeated sampling by peristaltic pumping, replacement of the sampled gas by reversed pumping (injecting He), and transfer of gas to a chemoluminiscense NO analyser. In short: Samples are taken from 10 - 120 ml <b>serum</b> <b>flasks</b> using an autosampler connected to a peristaltic pump. The autosampler operates a needle which pierce the septa on the flasks (never at the same spot twice), and the pump takes approximately two ml headspace gas from the flasks into the sample loops of the GC and NO analyser.

In order to achieve this, extracellular products (ECPs) collected from cultures of P. d. subsp. piscicida strain P- 3179 grown either with or without iron restriction were incubated in dialysis bags with transferrin, an enriched iron compound, or with yellowtail <b>serum</b> in <b>flasks</b> containing medium broth. The ECPs were able to break both the transferrin and yellowtail serum components into smaller units, releasing iron to the culture medium, After removal of the dialysis bags, newly inoculated bacteria into the culture media grew {{at a higher rate}} in the flasks that contained broken transferrin and yellowtail serum than the ones without those components. Correspondingly, analysis of the outer membrane proteins collected from P. d. subsp. piscicida after 24 h incubation period showed stronger antigenicity for the OMPs preparation purified from the culture that contained transferrin and ECPs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNitric oxide (NO) {{is known}} to induce {{denitrification}} in model organisms, but the quantitative effect of NO and its concentration dependency has not been assessed for denitrification in soils. NO is chemically unstable {{in the presence of}} oxygen due to autoxidation, and the oxidation of NO is accelerated by acetylene (C 2 H 2) which is commonly used as an inhibitor of N 2 O reductase in denitrification studies. As a first step to experimentally explore the role of NO in soil denitrification, we investigated NO oxidation kinetics for a closed “two phase” system (i. e. liquid phase + headspace) typically used for denitrification experiments with soil slurries, both with and without acetylene present. Models were developed to adequately predict autoxidation and acetylene-accelerated oxidation. The minimum oxygen concentration in the headspace ([O 2]min, mL L− 1) for acetylene-accelerated NO oxidation was found to increase linearly with the NO concentration ([NO], mL L− 1); [O 2]min =  0. 192  + [NO] *  0. 1 (r 2  =  0. 978). The models for NO oxidation were then used to assess NO oxidation rates in denitrification experiments with batches of bacterial cells extracted from soil. The batches were exposed to low initial oxygen concentrations in gas tight <b>serum</b> <b>flasks</b> (with and without C 2 H 2), and monitored for O 2, NO, N 2 O and N 2 production while depleting the oxygen and switching to anoxic respiration. Acetylene effectively scavenged NO from the cultures until oxygen concentration reached below ∼ 0. 19  mL L− 1, and the estimated rate of acetylene-accelerated NO oxidation was more than sufficient to explain an observed reduction of the N 2 O production induced by acetylene. When [O 2] reached below 0. 19  mL L− 1, the NO concentrations increased and stabilized at the same level as in the treatments without acetylene, but the rate of denitrification was much lower than without acetylene. The results indicate that the early accumulation of 10 – 20  nM NO during oxygen depletion has a significant effect on the expression of denitrification in soil communities. This warrants a greater interest in NO as a regulator of denitrification in soils and shows that the acetylene inhibition method may be problematic even for intentionally anoxic incubations, unless precautions are taken to secure initial O 2 concentrations below 0. 19  mL O 2 L− 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: Leishmania is {{a single}} cell {{parasite}} causing leishmaniasis, which is a common disease between humans and animals. Due {{to the importance of}} in-vitro culture of the parasite in leishmania research, developing new methods for in-vitro cultivation of the parasite has always been a goal for leishmania researchers. The main objective {{of this study was to}} use sheep and bovine hydatid cyst fluids as alternatives for fetal calf serum (FCS) in leishmania in-vitro culture. Materials and Methods: A total of 1 million leishmania promastigotes were added to 4 flasks as follow. A flask containing DMEM medium with 10 % fetal bovine <b>serum,</b> a <b>flask</b> containing DMEM and 10 % sheep hydatid cyst fluid, a flask containing DMEM medium with 10 % bovine hydatid cyst fluid and a flask containing DMEM medium alone. After 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 21 and 24 days, the number of parasites were counted and compared. Results: The result of this study showed that, DMEM medium enriched with 10 % sheep hydatid cyst fluid in 168 hours and medium enriched with 10 % bovine hydatid cyst fluid in 96 hours can act as a good alternative for fetal bovine serum in the culture Leishmania major. Conclusion: The results showed that sheep and bovine hydatid cyst fluid can be used as alternatives to FCS for dense cultivation of leishmania. The results also showed that, the growth of promastigotes in medium enriched with bovine cyst fluid is more rapid than the medium enriched with sheep cyst fluid in the beginning of cultivation...|$|R

Viability results showed potential biological risk associated with uncontrolled burial of pharmaceutical industry waste, including some live vaccines. lyophilized form; the estimated net weight of biological material was 20 – 25 kg. Four vaccine types against ND (2 in liquid and 2 in lyophilized form) were unearthed from the dump. A review of documentation found that all 4 types had been produced by ISM from 1975 through 1988. Because the exact composition of the vaccines was unknown, the vial contents were subjected to viability tests in culture and to molecular characterization assays. The viability evaluations were performed by inoculation of the vial contents onto a confluent monolayer of Vero cells (African green monkey kidney), followed by observation of the cell culture for 7 days and assessment of any cytopathic effect (1). Each assay was performed twice. The positive control was a commercially available ND vaccine (Izovac; IZO S. p. A, Brescia, Italy), containing> 10 6 50 % embryo infectious dose live attenuated viruses. As a result of bacterial contamination, no virus could be isolated from the 2 types of liquid vaccine. However, virus was isolated from the 2 lyophilized ND vaccine strains and caused cytopathic effect, which was further confirmed by hemoadsorbing assay (Figure 1).

Leukocytes were incubated in vitro with c 14 -labeled acetate, and the fate of the radioactive carbon was determined by fractionation and analysis of the major, cell components. 	Leukocytes were obtained from whole blood by fibrinogen sedimentation and differential centrifugation. Optimal conditions for isolation and incubation of viable cells were developed and assessed using phase microscopy for direct observation of their morphological integrity and by their oxidative metabolism. Control experiments to determine the possible effect of erythrocyte utilization of acetate were run using twice the number of cells ordinarily found in leukocyte suspensions. No utilization of acetate by red blood cells was observed. 	Respiration studies were performed using standard Warburg manometry. Otherwise, incubations were carried out in modified Erlenmeyer flasks equipped with center wells for C 02 collection and stoppered with <b>serum</b> bottle caps. <b>Flasks</b> were equilibrated and various additions were made to the suspensions using hypodermic needles.

40|$|Existence of {{autocrine}} {{growth factors}} (aGFs) {{may influence the}} serum requirement for growth of hybridoma cells and thus significantly influence process economics. For the murine hybridoma cell line S 3 H 5 /γ 2 bA 2, critical inoculum density (cID) and serum requirement for growth were inversely related for cultivation in both T flasks and spinner flasks. In spinner flasks, an inoculum density of 10 6 cells/ml was necessary for the cells to grow in RPMI 1640 medium without serum supplement, and an inoculum density of 10 3 cell/ml was necessary in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % <b>serum.</b> In T <b>flasks,</b> where the local cell density is higher than in spinner flasks, an inoculum density of 10 6 cells/ml was necessary for the cells to grow in RPMI 1640 medium without serum supplement, and an inoculum density of 1 cell/ml was also necessary in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % serum. Further, immobilized cells at high local cell density could grow under conditions where cells in T flasks at corresponding overall cell density could not grow. The cells at high inoculum density were less sensitive to shear induced by mechanical agitation than the cells at low inoculum density. Taken together these observations support the existence of secreted aGF(s) by the hybridoma cell line used.

40|$|The work of Hecke on the cultivation, of hog cholera {{virus was}} {{confirmed}} with ease. Virus was {{grown in the}} presence of fresh minced swine testicle in flasks containing Tyrode solution, on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs, and on the surface of swine <b>serum</b> agar. In <b>flasks</b> it was grown for 14 transfers; while on eggs it was grown for 13 transfers, followed by an equal number of transfers on agar, making 26 transfers in all. Only one strain of virus was used and we do not know whether all strains can be cultivated so readily or whether we were particularly fortunate in the selection of the strain used. Neither do we know whether swine testicle is better than other tissues for growth. The cultured virus produces characteristic hog cholera when injected into swine, and its effect can be neutralized with commercial anti-hog cholera serum. No evidence of attenuation of the virus was obtained, the last culture being highly virulent when small amounts were injected. No evidence for the adaptation to the egg could be secured, since passages without swine testicle on the membrane or intravenously for 2 transfers resulted in a loss of the virus. No contaminating virus that might favor the cultivation could be detected by animal or egg inoculation. Not only has the virus been cultivated but it has been demonstrated in large amounts in the culture. Four suspensions containing slightly over 0. 5 mg. of protein nitrogen produced typical hog cholera when 1 x 10 – 6 cc. was injected, and one suspension made in the same way was active in one-tenth this amount. Few titrations on what is commonly known as hog cholera virus, i. e. the serum from acutely ill pigs, are available. We made one such titration and produced a delayed disease with 1 x 10 – 5 cc. of infectious serum. It seems probable that the culture virus is more active than the commonly used virus and that its practical use in hog cholera vaccination and hyperimmunization would result in a considerable saving. All of the methods used yielded active cultures, but the serum agar method is the one of choice since larger amounts of suspension can be obtained with less labor...|$|R
