40|$|In recent years, a {{dramatic}} increase in incidence of the dextro-rotatory tartrate-positive variant (dT+) of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi B has been observed in poultry and poultry products. In the present study the interactions of this bacterium with the host were studied in vivo and in vitro in an attempt to explain the preferential association of this serotype with poultry. The ability of this organism to invade and multiply in chicken intestinal epithelial cells and the intracellular behaviour in chicken macrophages was studied in vitro using chicken cell lines. In vivo challenge experiments in specific pathogen-free chickens were carried out to determine the level of colonization of caeca and internal organs early after experimental infection. An in vivo trial with commercial broiler chickens, using a seeder model, was performed to determine whether S. Paratyphi B dT+ could persist and spread in broilers until <b>slaughter.</b> <b>S.</b> Paratyphi B dT+ invaded and multiplied in the chicken epithelial cell line and survived in a chicken macrophage cell line. The strain used colonized caeca and internal organs of chickens to a high extent 1 week after infection with a low-dose inoculum. Moreover, the strain was efficiently transmitted within a group of broilers and persisted until slaughter. It was concluded that S.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide a {{detailed}} environmental evaluation of pigmeat production (the second most widely eaten type of meat) in Portugal, using relevant and good quality data in order to obtain representative results for this production sector. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used for the evaluations from a cradle-toslaughterhouse gate perspective. The system under study was divided in three subsystems: crop and feed production (S 1), pigmeat production (<b>S</b> 2) and <b>slaughtering</b> (<b>S</b> 3). The production system under study considered the Best Available Techniques (BATs) for intensive rearing of pigs. According to the results and in line with other studies, S 1 was the most influential subsystem in the environmental profile (ranging from 70 % to 100 % depending on the impact) mainly due to agricultural activities involved in the production of feed components. Activities carried out on the pig farms (S 2) were remarkable in categories such as climate change due to background processes involved in the production of electricity requirements, e. g. emissions derived from slurry management (such as CH 4 and N 2 O), and water depletion. Slaughtering-related contributions were negligible regardless of the category assessed. Different alternatives for the valorisation of animal by-products derived from the slaughterhouse were proposed for energy and feed production. A comparison with other related studies focused on pigmeat production was performed and no remarkable differences were identified. Thus, achievements and environmental hotspots identified in this specific case study for Portugal could be extended to the European production chain...|$|R

The basal diet (B) contained 3 % sunflower oil, while in the experimental feed (S) this was changed to 3 % linseed oil. The vitamin E and selenium content of the two diets was 60 vs. 260 mg/kg and 0. 10 vs. 0. 46 mg/kg, respectively. Rabbits were fed the B diet {{from the age of}} 18 days. One group was fed with the B diet until 11 weeks of age, while the experimental groups were fed the S diets for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks before the <b>slaughter</b> (<b>S</b> 1, S 2, S 3 and S 4 groups). The body weight gain, the body weight, the feed intake and the feed conversion was identical in all groups. The mortality, as compared to the S 1 group (0 %) was higher in the in the B group by 13. 4 % and in the S 2 and S 3 groups (5. 6 % and 11. 1 %, resp.). The dressing out percentage was the lowest in the S 1 group (61. 7 %), while it was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in the S 2 and S 3 groups (62. 8 and 62. 7 %). The proportion of the mid part, as compared to the reference carcass was the lowest in the S 1 group and the highest in the S 3 (31. 3 vs. 32. 0 %, P< 0. 05). The proportion of the hind part was the highest in the S 1 group (P< 0. 05) and the lowest in the S 2, S 3 and S 4 groups (38. 8 vs. 37. 3; 37. 2 and 37. 1 %).

40|$|In this thesis, a {{continuous}} rollforming {{process for the}} folding of thin-films was proposed and studied as a key step in the continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets. HPMC and PEG based polymeric thin-films were considered for this application. An experimental apparatus was designed and developed to test the folding of thin-films. The experimental apparatus was designed in a modular fashion to facilitate testing of various process parameters. Analysis was carried out for the folding operations, based on which two folding strategies were proposed - (i) without scoring and (ii) with scoring. The first strategy relies on elastic deformation of the thin-films, whereas the later depends on localized, plastic deformation caused by the scoring geometry. From the experiments on folding we identified three regimes of process operation namely: insufficient scoring, appropriate scoring, and excessive scoring. The implications of different levels of scoring were observed and understood carefully for the scoring and folding operation. Practical guidelines were developed for carrying out folding successfully and the scope of future work was discussed. by Ryan <b>Slaughter.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|A fusion {{between the}} genes {{encoding}} the Escherichia coli STb heat-stable enterotoxin (estB) and alkaline phosphatase (phoA) was constructed, and the expressed protein product was characterized. The STb-alkaline phosphatase protein (STb-PhoA) had an apparent molecular mass of 50, 000 daltons and was detected with both monoclonal anti-alkaline phosphatase and polyclonal anti-STb antibodies. Expression {{of the gene}} fusion resulted in high-level production of alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating that STb-PhoA was processed and exported into the periplasm of the E. coli host strain. Amino acid sequence analysis of the hybrid protein yielded the sequence Ser-Thr-Gln-Ser-Asn-Lys-Lys, indicating that STb-PhoA was processed during export in a fashion identical to that of native STb (Y. M. Kupersztoch, K. Tachias, C. R. Moomaw, L. A. Dreyfus, R. G. Urban, C. <b>Slaughter,</b> and <b>S.</b> Whipp, J. Bacteriol. 172 : 2427 - 2432, 1990). STb-PhoA was purified from an expressed bacterial lysate by preparative isoelectric focusing. In a rat ligated intestinal loop model, purified STb-PhoA induced highly significant (P less than 0. 002) fluid secretion. In addition, the specific activity of STb-PhoA was nearly identical to that of purified STb. Thus, the STb-PhoA hybrid protein represents a readily obtainable source of biologically active (STb) enterotoxin that may prove useful in studies to determine the mode of toxin action...|$|R
40|$|Xylanase is an {{exogenous}} {{enzyme that}} {{is added to}} non-ruminants diets in order to break down and ameliorate the effects that non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) have on feed digestibility. Dietary supplementary xylanase reduces viscosity of the digesta to improve feed digestibility and growth performance. Recently a study in broiler chickens (Singh et al., 2012) showed {{a significant increase in}} circulating serum peptide-YY (PYY) concentration (p< 0. 001) in response to xylanase supplementation. PYY is a satiety hormone that inhibits gastric motility, increasing digesta retention times in non-ruminants which has also been identified to occur in studies where xylanase has been supplemented. It is thought this could potentially be another mechanism by which xylanase exerts its beneficial effects on growth outcomes. Therefore the aim of the current study was to explore the effects that xylanase (16, 000 BXU/kg diet, Econase XT, AB Vista, UK) supplementation, of a wheat-based feed, has on growth performance parameters and gut/metabolic hormones that are produced from the gastrointestinal tract in pigs, and if age at supplementation affects the efficacy of the enzyme. In a preliminary trial a human multiplex assay (Human Metabolic Hormone Milliplex HMHMAG 34 k kit, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was successfully used to measure porcine gut/metabolic hormones simultaneously, and the assay was hence used in subsequent trials. In the same trial it was determined that animals subjected to commercial <b>slaughter</b> (<b>S),</b> which had an increased time to tissue sample collection (approximately 18 hours) and exposes carcasses to a 60 °C water bath, did not affect the quality of RNA extracted from gut, pancreatic and liver tissue and subsequent relative abundance of gene transcripts over animals not subjected to this slaughter method (NS). In two trials on weaned piglets, it was found that dietary xylanase supplementation at 0 - 2 weeks post-wean decreased glucose-dependent insulinotrophic peptide (GIP), glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) plasma concentrations (p< 0. 05) which resulted in a tendency for insulin and C-peptide (p< 0. 08) to be decreased in these animals when bloods were analysed at 6 weeks post-wean. Also at this time point PYY concentrations were found to be decreased (p< 0. 01) in animals fed diets supplemented with xylanase between 2 and 6 weeks post-wean. In a third trial, when blood parameters were measured at 13 weeks post-wean, leptin and ghrelin levels were higher in animals provided with the exogenous enzyme, supplemented feed at 0 - 2 weeks post-wean. In conclusion, it was found growth performance in pigs fed a wheat-based diet supplemented with xylanase was not significantly improved at any age. However timing and/or duration of supplementation affected production of certain gut/metabolic hormones, in particular those produced in the pancreas or those that influence production of these hormones, suggesting dietary xylanase supplementation fed to weaned pigs may affect pancreas function and development...|$|R

The pigs were housed in groups of 40 and each AFR was tested with seven groups (21 groups in total). The daily weight gain of the individual pigs was calculated from the beginning of the experiments until slaughter. Additionally, the lean meat percentage was recorded (AutoFOM). Feeding behaviour was observed by means of 24 -h video recording at the ages of 14 and 17 weeks with scan sampling every 5 min. The daily weight gain decreased with increasing AFR (P< 0 · 01) and females had lower weight gains than barrows (P< 0 · 001). The lean meat proportion was influenced by the AFR (P< 0 · 01) and sex of the pigs (P< 0 · 001). Proportions were highest with the AFR 13 : 1 and in females.

40|$|A gopher {{tortoise}} {{population on}} the campus of University of North Florida is part of an ongoing study initiated during the early 1990 s, and this project presents data on this population collected during the 2009 - 2011 field seasons. The project has three major objectives: 1) measure population demographics including density and structure to assess long-term viability and recruitment, 2) evaluate decadal growth rates of individuals by comparing measurements of tortoises captured and marked in the 1990 - 1994 study done at the same site with those tortoises recaptured during the current study, and 3) assess the effect of prescribed burning on vegetation. In total, 141 individuals were caught from 2009 - 2011 : 32 adult females, 28 adult males and 17 young adults, 43 juveniles and 21 hatchlings. Of these, 39 are recaptures from the research performed in the early 1990 <b>s.</b> Adult burrow <b>aprons</b> were probed using a wire survey flag in an attempt to locate nests. In 2010 we found two intact nests with this technique and recorded two other depredated nests that were unassociated with any burrow. In 2011 we found one nest and a clutch that was laid on the ground’s surface. Four 100 m transects were established before prescribed burning began. Vegetation analyses were done bi-monthly and all plants were recorded as well as their percent of each plot. The most abundant plant was milkpea. Preliminary analysis of postburn response has indicated increased groundcover in all burned transects...|$|R

A Chinese street gang, the Lords of Death, tries to kidnap another Chinese girl at the airport who is being met by her friend Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), intending to sell her as a sex slave. After Jack intervenes, they take Miao Yin instead. In Jack's big-rig truck, he and Wang track the Lords of Death to the back alleys of Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that quickly erupts into a tong war between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese societies. When [...] "The Three Storms" [...] - Thunder, Rain, and Lightning, mighty warriors with weather-themed powers - appear, <b>slaughtering</b> the Chang <b>Sing,</b> Jack tries to escape but runs over Lo Pan (James Hong), a powerful and legendary sorcerer and the leader of the Wing Kong. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, but finds Lo Pan entirely unfazed and glowing with malicious power. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys; the two escape the carnage and mayhem, but Jack's truck is stolen.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the third}} article in a series on the {{perspectives}} of Dakota cow/calf producers on public price reporting, marketing channel selection and price discovery. This series {{is a result of}} a survey questionnaire sent to 814 cow/calf producers in North and South Dakota. The questionnaire was mailed during the fall of 2005, and 199 completed surveys were returned, a response rate of 24. 5 percent. All completed surveys were from the western parts of the Dakotas, commonly referred to as “West River”. Mandatory Price Reporting for Slaughter Cattle In April 2001 mandatory livestock price reporting began in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>slaughter</b> cattle market. Price reporting regulations require packers to report all spot market and captive supply transactions to the USDA-Agricultural Marketing News Service (AMS). However, the mandatory reporting system proved to be controversial, and the U. S. Congress allowed the regulatory authority to expire in October, 2005. After extensive congressional debate, a new bill (H. R. 3408) authorizing mandatory livestock price reporting was signed by President Bush in October, 2006 (Fausti et al. 2007). However, the legislation has not been implemented as of June, 2007. Thus, since the Fall of 2005, public reporting of slaughter cattle prices and transaction volume has relied on voluntarily reported information from packers...|$|R
40|$|A {{national}} survey of dairy producers assessed their willingness to improve safety of food products from their farms (response rate 9 %). The majority considered a veterinarian as their first choice for information concerning dairy market food safety, with more than 33 % reporting that they would pay for veterinarians to perform food safety assessments. Nearly half {{reported that they had}} been well informed by their veterinarian concerning food safety issues. Income from market beef was important to 75 %, but few had toured a slaughter facility and less than 35 % were aware that HACCP was required in U. <b>S.</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities. Most believed consumer food safety concerns affected their profits, but less than half reported that on-farm HACCP would reduce the risk of foodborne disease. Several reported that they would change practices if so doing would increase profits and most preferred that profits come from incentives paid by slaughter establishments. Few preferred government subsidies and most opposed on-farm government regulatory programs. Ultimately, respondents expected consumers to pay for on-farm food safety practices and expected little of the corresponding increase in price to trickle to them. Overall, results indicate that producers might benefit from better knowledge of HACCP. Further research is needed to help producers determine if implementing on-farm HACCP improves profits as well as public health...|$|R
