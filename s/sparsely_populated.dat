5|$|Originally, stanitsas were {{fortified}} Russian Cossack outposts {{during the}} Caucasian War. After 1861, the stanitsas also started {{to appear in}} <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{route is}} in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> area east of Hancock in Washington County.|$|E
5|$|The name Bret was not retired, as its {{landfall}} {{occurred in}} unusually <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Kenedy County and hence did much less damage to manmade structures than normal for a hurricane of that intensity.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is mostly}} forest and <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated.</b> Historically, the area supports industry in agriculture, lumbering, and coal and iron mining. Native American crucibles {{have been discovered}} along the Creek.|$|E
5|$|After its {{founding}} as a township, Teaneck saw {{rapid growth in}} its population {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. As Teaneck changed from a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> rural area into a suburb, particularly after development of property that had been part of the Phelps Estate started in the late 1920s, Teaneck's population grew rapidly, far outpacing the growth of Bergen County.|$|E
5|$|British {{nationality}} law as it {{pertains to}} Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. From its beginning as a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{is a city}} in and {{the county}} seat of Harney County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. According to the 2010 census, the {{population}} was 2,806. Burns and the nearby city of Hines are home to about 60percent {{of the people in}} the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> county, the largest in Oregon and the ninth largest in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{population}} is almost evenly divided between {{urban and rural}} dwellers. Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain. Douala, Yaoundé, and Garoua are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, {{and most of the}} South Cameroon Plateau are <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain areas began {{preparing}} for the storm along Florida's west coast. Hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure, and some coastal residents left their homes. Initially, the storm was forecast to strike the Tampa area, but missed to the north as it weakened. It reportedly left little damage in the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> land where it made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Anita made {{landfall}} in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> {{portion of}} Mexico; as a result, few meteorological statistics exist. A station {{near where the}} hurricane moved ashore recorded 17.52 inches (445 mm) of precipitation in six hours, which resulted in severe flooding and mudslides. Winds along the eastern Mexico coastline were estimated at over 100 mph (160 km/h).|$|E
5|$|Only {{two-thirds of}} its present {{territory}} were occupied during the colonial period, as the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau, which remains <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> to this day. The agricultural and livestock sector's output was principally consumed by the producers themselves and by the small local market, and only became associated with foreign trade {{towards the end of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several {{severe weather}} {{warnings}} were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130km/h (80mph), damage was limited {{due to the}} <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> region it struck. The most severe damage was defoliation around Kuri Bay. Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan.|$|E
5|$|September 5, 1950– Hurricane Easy moves ashore near Cedar Key {{and later}} near Tampa Bay {{as a major}} {{hurricane}} after looping offshore. The hurricane causes locally heavy damage in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> area, totaling $3.3million (1950USD, $29.5million 2008USD). Due to its erratic motion, Easy drops heavy rainfall peaking at 38.7inches (983mm) in Yankeetown, which in turn causes 2indirect deaths from electrocution.|$|E
5|$|The rivalries {{between the}} Datus, Rajahs, Sultans, and Lakans {{eventually}} eased Spanish colonization. Furthermore, the islands were <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> due to consistent natural disasters and inter-kingdom conflicts. Therefore, colonization was made easy {{and the small}} states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the Spanish Empire and were Hispanicized and Christianized.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Bay Area {{transformed}} {{during the}} 20th century. Following the hurricane, donations by {{the newly established}} Red Cross helped revive area farming communities. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. Commercial fishing, particularly for oysters and shrimp, grew as a significant area industry.|$|E
5|$|A rugged, <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> area, the Catlins {{features}} a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast. Most of the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily {{populated}} {{prior to the}} conquest, the impact of Old World diseases {{was one of the}} factors that resulted in the depopulation of the hot, moist lands of the Depresión Central, which remain <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> to this day. Likewise, Soconusco was rapidly depopulated as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish. Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{early history}} {{is that of}} a remote and {{marginal}} area. The main centres of population, power and wealth in the pre-industrial English Midlands lay in the fertile and accessible river valleys of the Trent, the Severn and the Avon. The area of modern Birmingham lay in between, on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the densely wooded and <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Forest of Arden.|$|E
5|$|Born in glaciers {{and flowing}} through a rugged {{landscape}} of mountains and valleys, the river drains an isolated and <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> {{region of the}} Pacific Northwest. From its highest headwaters to its confluence with the Columbia River, the Kootenay falls more than two kilometers in elevation. Although comparable in length, watershed and discharge to the Columbia above the confluence, the Kootenay is of a notably different character; its much steeper gradient results {{in the formation of}} many rapids.|$|E
5|$|Dean was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992. Dean's Category5 landfall was in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long swath of damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists.|$|E
5|$|Florence {{developed}} on September23 near Jamaica from a tropical wave. While passing that island, it produced heavy rainfall that blocked roads. It intensified to hurricane status on September24 while {{passing through the}} Yucatán Channel, and while doing so left heavy damage in western Cuba. After turning north and entering the Gulf of Mexico, Florence quickly intensified to peak winds of 115mph (185km/h). It gradually weakened before making landfall on September26 as a minimal hurricane in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> region of the Florida Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> {{area where}} Item moved ashore, the {{hurricane}} dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico in ten years, with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5million (1950USD, $ USD). The strong winds sank 20ships, {{and although there}} were no reports of casualties, Item caused 15injuries. Communications were disrupted across the region, and downed trees blocked roads. Near Tuxpam, the winds damaged large areas of banana plantations.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that are {{perceived}} as the area's early history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Vorontsov was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Novorossiya in May 1823. Even before their arrival in Odessa, the Vorontsovs started buying up {{lands in the}} southwest of Crimea, which was <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> and little known at the time. Alupka was bought in 1824 from colonel , the owner of Livadia and Oreanda. By that time, the Vorontsovs also had property in Gurzuf, Massandra, Ai-Danil, and Cape Martian.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{has a high}} {{indigenous}} British population, with 98.8% registering {{as white}} British and 92.4% of these as born in the United Kingdom. Chinese is the largest ethnic group, while the black minority ethnic proportion {{of the total population}} is 2.9%. Over 25% of Somerset's population is concentrated in Taunton, Bridgwater and Yeovil. The rest of the county is rural and <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated.</b> Over 9million tourist nights are spent in Somerset each year, which significantly increases the population at peak times.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquakes}} were {{a series}} of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. They took place in the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human activity in the area is {{the remains of a}} Roman road which served as the route between Roman camps at Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). The road ran to the north of Astley, past Keeper Delph and through Tyldesley. Evidence for the presence of Anglo-Saxons in the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated,</b> heavily wooded and isolated region is provided by place names incorporating the Old English suffix leah, such as in Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
5|$|The village {{remained}} <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> {{and only}} {{consisted of two}} houses when the Delaware and Hudson Canal reached it after the materials used to manufacture Rosendale cement, named after the town, were discovered locally in 1825. Early settlers had avoided the area because the northern land, comprising present-day Rosendale Village, was a known floodplain, and the lands south of the creek were less mountainous and at a higher elevation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> area, no deaths {{were reported by}} the NHC. However, one boy was swept away in the Uxpana River and was thus reported missing. Due to flooding caused by the storm, three rivers in Veracruz overflowed their banks. Flooding from the storm also washed-out portions of two Mexico highways. Furthermore, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured. Overall, damage from the system was not widespread.|$|E
5|$|Citing the Palmyrenes' combat {{skills in}} large, <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> areas, the Romans formed a Palmyrene auxilia {{to serve in}} the Imperial Roman army. Vespasian {{reportedly}} had 8,000 Palmyrene archers in Judea, and Trajan established the first Palmyrene Auxilia in 116 (a camel cavalry unit, Ala I Ulpia dromedariorum Palmyrenorum). Palmyrene units were deployed throughout the Roman Empire, serving in Dacia late in Hadrian's reign, and at El Kantara in Numidia and Moesia under Antoninus Pius. During the late second century Rome formed the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum, which was stationed in Dura-Europos.|$|E
5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} the arid and <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Four Corners region, the Chacoan {{cultural}} sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to the}} closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> area it struck, {{only minor}} damage was reported. Heavy rain and {{flooding}} were reported, peaking at over 10inches (25cm) in one location. One person {{was reported missing}} {{in the state of}} Colima, and three people were injured in Guerrero. More than 1,000 homes were damaged in Guerrero, Michoacán, and Colima, as was 7,400 acres (30km²) of farmland. A flood on the Atoyac River washed away 500 homes in Guerrero, which prompted the evacuation of 2,500 people. A passenger train north of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, was derailed when it encountered washed-out roadbeds. The storm also caused power outages.|$|E
5|$|Following {{reconstitution}} {{into the}} Territorial Army in 1920, the Liverpool Scottish formalised {{its relationship with}} the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and transferred in 1937 to become the regiment's second territorial battalion. In comparison to the densely urbanised region that the King's Regiment encompassed in north-west England, the Cameron Highlanders area of recruitment in the Highlands was <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated.</b> Although it had its numerical designation omitted, the battalion's identity was preserved and headquarters at Fraser Street, Liverpool were retained. During a royal visit to Liverpool in 1938, George VI presented the battalion with new colours at Everton Football Club's Goodison Park stadium.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the All-American honors, Heikkinen finished second in voting for the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the Big Ten Conference’s Most Valuable Player. He was also chosen {{to play in the}} East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco on January 1, 1939. And in July 1939, Heikkinen was elected with 846,943votes (fourth highest vote count of any player) to play in the annual game between the College All-Stars and the NFL New York Giants. The Ironwood Daily Globe boasted that residents of Michigan’s <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> Gogebic Range had accounted for 25,000 of Heikkinen’s votes.|$|E
