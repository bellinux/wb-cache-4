40|$|In {{this study}} test {{characteristics}} of three newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin were evaluated and compared with two <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests.</b> The ELISAs involved were an indirect ELISA with serovar Dublin lipopolysaccharide (LPS ELISA), an indirect ELISA with serovar Dublin flagellar antigen (GP ELISA), and a double-antibody sandwich blocking ELISA that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis flagellin (GM-DAS ELISA). The <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> involved were two routine <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> with either somatic (O) or flagellar (H) antigen. Diagnostic specificity {{of the three}} ELISAs was determined using 840 serum samples from seven dairy herds without any history of serovar Dublin infection. Cutoff values at a titer of 100, 100, and 10, respectively, for the LPS ELISA, GP ELISA, and GM-DAS blocking ELISA resulted in a specificity of 99. 3, 100, and 100 %, respectively. Using these cutoff values the LPS ELISA, GP ELISA, and GM-DAS ELISA were able to detect, respectively, 30, 46, and 38 % of 50 fecal culture-positive animals from 13 herds with a recent serovar Dublin infection. With the same cutoff values, active carriers (n = 18) were detected for 94. 4 % with the LPS ELISA and for 100 % with the GP and GM-DAS ELISAs. Kappa values determined {{on the results of}} all tests from 8 of the 13 serovar Dublin-infected herds and the 7 control herds demonstrated a good correlation between the results of all ELISAs and the H-agglutination test. The results of the O-agglutination test failed to correlate with those of the other tests. Using a set of sera from 170 aborting cows (with 25 abortions due to serovar Dublin), test results of the ELISAs and the H-agglutination test were comparable. The H-agglutination test may be used successfully for single sample testing, especially to diagnose abortion due to serovar Dublin. It is concluded that the ELISAs are useful diagnostic tools in serovar Dublin control programs and that they are preferred to <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> for reasons of automation and costs.

40|$|Background: Brucellosis {{still remains}} a major health problem with {{different}} symptoms and various diagnostic methods. Diagnostic methods of brucellosis are usually based on detecting specific antibodies in the patient’s serum. Nowadays, many serological tests are {{applied for the}} diagnosis of human brucellosis. Most routine <b>tests</b> are <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> based on Wright and 2 -Mercaptoethanol (2 -ME). Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} (cross sectional study) was to evaluate the prevalence of brucellosis and assess the degree of agreement among serum samples of suspected brucellosis serological tests routinely performed in Mashhad, Iran. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted in Mashhad from August 2011 to September 2012. Sera (2 - 3 mL) were collected from 83 cases suspected of brucellosis among 594 patients. Ten serum samples were collected from healthy subjects as control sera. Rose Bengal test for initial screening and Wright and 2 ME as standard tests were conducted to determine antibody titers. Thereafter, IgG and IgM levels were determined by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Results: Among 83 serum samples, Rose Bengal test was able to identify 20 (12 %) positive specimens; the standard tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was able to detect 30 (18 %) positive samples, and the ELISA IgG and ELISA IgM were able to trace 42 (21 %) and 13 (6. 5 %) positive samples, respectively. Ten control samples had negative results for the ELISA method. The results were calculated by the Kappa formula. The highest level of agreement was among 1 = KRB-SAT tests and the lowest level of agreement was among tests K ELISA IgM-IgG = 0. 30. Conclusions: According to the results, brucellosis has remained endemic in this region. Most cases were detected by ELISA IgG. The highest kappa agreements were between tests KRB-SAT, KRB-IgG and KSAT-IgG, while the lowest levels of agreement were between tests SAT-IgM and ELISA IgM-IgG. Considering that ELISA IgM results are covered by SAT and ELISA IgG test results, applications of this test do not seem necessary. © 2015, Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Research Center...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{described}} the isolation and molecular detection of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg) and Mycoplasma synoviae from tracheal swabs of diseased birds {{showing signs of}} respiratory distress in selected commercial (layer and broiler) farms and from yolk and an open air of pens of vaccinated breeder flocks in Sudan. A number of 45 [*]Mycoplasma isolates were recovered from chickens in Khartoum, Gezira, and Equatoria states in Sudan. Of these, eight Mg and three Ms isolates were identified using growth inhibition and rapid <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> (RSA) <b>tests.</b> The conventional PCR technique was applied to amplify 140 [*]bp and 720 [*]bp DNA fragments for the Mg and Ms, respectively. This research confirmed vertical and horizontal transmission of Mg from breeder farms through detection of Mg in yolk of fertile eggs and an air of pens despite previous vaccination. PCR is considered a rapid, sensitive, and cheap method and it will improve the diagnosis of Mycoplasma in chickens...|$|R
40|$|A {{serological}} investigation of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection in chicken {{was conducted in}} the greater Rajshahi district of Bangladesh on 115 flocks {{during the period from}} July 2006 to June 2007. A total of 575 sera samples were collected and <b>tested</b> by <b>serum</b> plate <b>agglutination</b> (SPA) <b>test</b> using Mycoplasma gallisepticum antigen (Nobilis®MG, Intervet International B. V. Boxmeer-Holland) to determine specific antibodies in different flocks. The overall seroprevalence of MG infection in different flocks was recorded as 55. 13 %. Seroprevalence of MG infection was found significantly (p 0. 05) higher in large flocks (62. 86 %) in comparison to small flocks (52. 00 %). It has been found that MG infection is still an important disease problem in chickens in Bangladesh.

40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum is {{the most}} {{economically}} significant mycoplasma pathogen affecting poultry and has a worldwide distribution. M. gallisepticum infection is commonly designated as chronic respiratory disease (CRD) in chickens and infectious sinusitis in turkeys. Infection may also occur in pheasants, partridges, and peafowl (1 - 3). Routine detection of Mycoplasma spp. infection depends on isolation of the organism, with subsequent identification of the isolates or detection of specific antibodies in sera (4). Although some basic biochemical tests {{can be helpful in}} preliminary classification of Mycoplasma spp. isolates, definitive identification must be performed by serological tests. Several serological tests have been used to detect M. gallisepticum antibodies, but their specificity and sensitivity have been lacking to some degree in all of them (4). The most commonly used serological tests for M. gallisepticum are the rapid <b>serum</b> <b>agglutination</b> (RSA) <b>test,</b> hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (4, 5). Because of its high sensitivity and ease of use, ELISA represents a potential replacement for the AGID, RSA, and HI test...|$|R
