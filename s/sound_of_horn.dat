60|$|Seeing this, Erling uttered his war-cry, and, {{collecting}} his men together, {{acted on}} the offensive. Wherever his battle-axe swung, or Thorer's sword gleamed, there men fell, and others gave way, till {{at last they}} were driven {{completely out of the}} pass and partly across the plain. Erling took care, however, not to advance too far, although Skarpedin, by retreating, endeavoured to entice him to do so; but drew off his men by <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn,</b> and returned to his old position--one man only having been killed and a few wounded.|$|E

Then, when all the fleet had assembled, both parties landed, and the Thing was summoned by <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn.</b> It was held on the level ground where the recent battle had been fought. There were still strewn about many evidences of the ferocity of that fight; and when the King looked upon the host of stout and well-armed men who had assembled, not only from Horlingdal, but from the whole of the surrounding district, he felt that, however much he might wish to force obedience on his subjects, [...] "discretion" [...] was at that time [...] "the better part of valour." ...|$|E

6000|$|The young {{king was}} {{very fond of}} the chase. When the summer was come he rode forth with hawk and hound, one day, in a {{brilliant}} company of his nobles. He got separated from them by and by, in a great forest, and took what he imagined a near cut, to find them again; {{but it was a}} mistake. He rode on and on, hopefully at first, but with sinking courage finally. Twilight came on, and still he was plunging through a lonely and unknown land. Then came a catastrophe. In the dim light he forced his horse through a tangled thicket overhanging a steep and rocky declivity. When horse and rider reached the bottom, the former had a broken neck and the latter a broken leg. The poor little king lay there suffering agonies of pain, and each hour seemed a long month to him. He kept his ear strained to hear any sound that might promise hope of rescue; but he heard no voice, no <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn</b> or bay of hound. So at last he gave up all hope, and said, [...] "Let death come, for come it must." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{when the}} report was brought that Harald's fleet had doubled the distant cape beyond Hafurdsfiord, the people crowded {{to the top of}} the cliffs behind Ulfstede to watch it; and when it was clearly seen that it was so much larger than their own, there were a few who began to say that it would be wiser to refrain from resistance; but Haldor called a Thing {{together}} on the spot by <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn,</b> and a great many short pithy speeches were made on both sides of the question. Those who were for war were by far the most able men, and so full of fire that they infused much of their own spirit into those who heard them. Erling in particular was very energetic in his denunciation of the illegality of Harald's proceedings; and even Glumm plucked up heart to leap to his feet and declare, with a face blazing with wrath, that he would rather be drowned in the fiord like a dog, or quit his native land for ever, than remain at home to be the slave of any man! ...|$|E

50|$|The new {{generation}} of jazz guitar players are using many different concepts and tastes in their improvisations and compositions. While still maintaining the roots of jazz guitar being bebop and swing, these guitarists {{take advantage of the}} whole musical development of jazz during the last few decades. From post bop to modal jazz to free jazz and jazz fusion which is an amalgamation of blues or rock or folkloric and world music with jazz. This evolution was started by guitarists like Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Mike Stern, Allan Holdsworth, Bill Frisell and, in an older generation, Jim Hall. After decades of work, these pioneer jazz guitarists have established a distinctive, yet constantly evolving, sound for the electric guitar {{as one of the most}} desired instruments in jazz. As a result, contemporary guitarists are not only trying to simulate the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn</b> players or pianists, but also the sound of those guitar players who added guitar capabilities to the language of jazz improvisation.|$|E
40|$|High {{information}} load of crew {{is one of}} {{the main}} problems of modern piloted aircraft therefore researches on approving data representation form, especially in critical situations are a challenge. The article considers one of opportunities to improve the interface of a modern pilot's cabin i. e. to use a spatial sound (3 D - audio technology). The 3 D - audio is a technology, which recreates a spatially directed sound in earphones or via loudspeakers. Spatial audio-helps, which together with information on danger will specify also the direction from which it proceeds, can reduce time of response to an event and, therefore, increase situational safety of flight. It is supposed that helps will be provided through pilot's headset therefore technology realization via earphones is discussed. Now the main hypothesis explaining the human ability to recognize the position of a sound source in space, asserts that the human estimates distortion of a sound signal spectrum at interaction with the head and an auricle depending on an arrangement of the sound source. For exact describing the signal spectrum variations there are such concepts as Head Related Impulse Response (HRIR) and Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF). HRIR is measured in humans or dummies. At present the most full-scale public HRIR library is CIPIC HRTF Database of CIPIC Interface Laboratory at UC Davis. To have 3 D audio effect, it is necessary to simulate a mono-signal conversion through the linear digital filters with anthropodependent pulse characteristics (HRIR) for the left and right ear, which correspond to the chosen direction. Results should be united in a stereo file and applied for reproduction to the earphones. This scheme was realized in Matlab, and the received software was used for experiments to estimate the quantitative characteristics of technology. For processing and subsequent experiments the following sound signals were chosen: a fragment of the classical music piece "Polovetsky Dancings" from A. P. Borodin's opera "Prince Igor", the horn sounds, the modulated broadband noise (with the fixed position, and "wandering" in the range ± 5 º in the vertical direction with respect to the fixed position). In the course of experiments the examinee was offered to define in what of possible positions (on an azimuth ± 80 º, ± 40 º, 0 º, on an eminence ± 45 º, 0 º, and 90 º - over the head) there is a virtual source of sound. According to results of experiments, directions with "rough" gradation 90 ° (in a horizontal "at the left–direct-on the right", in a vertical ""up-direct-down") are distinguished with he high probability (on the average 0. 94) for all types of signals. Thus the spectral content of signal is of no importance. Results of more accurate recognition with gradation of 40 … 45 ° depend on the type of signal and are different for horizontal and vertical channels. In the horizontal channel the probability of the correct recognition for broadband signals (the modulated noise, classical music) is 0, 77 … 0, 78, for a <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn</b> it is 0, 75. In the vertical channel for broadband signals (the modulated noise, classical music) the probability of the correct recognition is 0. 48 … 0. 50, for a <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>horn</b> it is 0. 36. The results allow us to assume that the person recognizes better the position of sound signal sources with rather wide spectrum close to the natural ones (broadband noise, symphonic orchestra). Thus, as a result of the carried-out work the sound processing algorithms have been realized and the software to allow reproducing spatial audio-helps via earphones has been created. In the course of research the methods of a digital filtration as well the statistical methods to analyse the results of experiments have been used. The main result defining a scientific novelty of work is the objective quantitative characteristics of the 3 D - audio technology, which are expedient for considering in designing the interfaces for pilots' cabins of modern aircrafts. </p...|$|E
