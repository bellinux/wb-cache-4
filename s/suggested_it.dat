Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> will explore this route in the future. In 1985 the Cuban government issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.|$|E

5|$|Berger later {{claimed that}} he had come {{up with the idea of}} SS combat troops wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and had <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E

5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who <b>suggested</b> <b>it,</b> though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have <b>suggested</b> <b>it,</b> as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual loop, initial reports <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> was two {{separate}} storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession.

5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer {{in the set}} is a proper divisor of {{the product of the}} other integers in the set, plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> was due to an epidemic, {{it was difficult to}} ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} have suspected that a secret accomplice was involved. The magician Carlos María de Heredia {{claimed to have}} replicated the accordion feat of Home and <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> was a trick performed by an accomplice playing a hidden accordion.

5|$|The crater was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who {{had been looking for}} petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|The name Pluto, {{after the}} god of the underworld, was {{proposed}} by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology.

The government initially <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.|$|E

5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and {{decisions}} were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Pennington, {{who lived}} near Lanesville, {{became one of}} the county's early leading {{citizens}} and speaker of the territory's legislature. Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May1, 1813, after Pennington <b>suggested</b> <b>it</b> would be safer than Vincennes. For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.|$|E
