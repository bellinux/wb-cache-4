5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E

25|$|A {{potentially}} {{significant problem}} following bisulfite treatment is incomplete desulfonation of pyrimidine residues due to inadequate alkalization of the solution. This may inhibit some DNA polymerases, rendering subsequent PCR difficult. However, this <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> {{be avoided by}} monitoring the pH of the solution to ensure that desulfonation will be complete.|$|E

25|$|Implications of symmetries in a {{physical}} <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be found with the action principle, together with the Euler–Lagrange equations, which are derived from the action principle. An example is Noether's theorem, which states that to every continuous symmetry in {{a physical}} situation there corresponds a conservation law (and conversely). This deep connection requires that the action principle be assumed.|$|E
25|$|Bates, Wallace and Fritz Müller {{believed}} that Batesian and Müllerian mimicry provided {{evidence for the}} action of natural selection, a view which is now standard amongst biologists. All aspects of this <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be, and have been, the subject of research. Field and experimental work on these ideas continues to this day; the topic connects strongly to speciation, genetics and evolutionary developmental biology.|$|E

Also, suppose that the rain has a direct effect {{on the use of the}} sprinkler (namely that when it rains, the sprinkler is usually not turned on). Then the <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be modeled with a Bayesian network (shown to the right). All three variables have two possible values, T (for true) and F (for false).|$|E

25|$|The {{interaction}} between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout {{history has been}} complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of anthropological study involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed first contact, the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be further confused {{when there is a}} complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> {{be reduced to a}} two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{focus on}} hierarchical order generated {{the impression that}} DGs have little to say about linear order, and it {{has contributed to the}} view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, {{is that there is a}} dearth of dependency-based explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard discontinuities. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition are mostly absent from many established dependency-based frameworks. This <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be contrasted with constituency grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} the {{indigenous}} groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally participative one, in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence {{and participate in the}} external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and land rights.|$|E
25|$|Such a <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be {{expected}} on water-rich planets located {{too far from}} their star to allow surface liquid water, but on which subsurface water is in liquid form because of the geothermal heat. Two examples of such an environment are Europa and Enceladus. In such worlds, not only is light not available as an energy source, but the organic material brought by meteorites (thought to have been necessary to start life in some scenarios) may not easily reach the liquid water. If a planet can only harbor life below its surface, the biosphere would not likely modify the whole planetary environment in an observable way, thus, detecting its presence on an exoplanet would be extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|As Piero Falchetta notes, {{there are}} many {{geographical}} facts reflected in Fra Mauro map {{for which it is}} not clear what Fra Mauro's source was, as no similar information is found in other preserved Western maps or manuscripts of the period. This <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be at least partially explained by the fact that, besides the existing maps and manuscripts, an important source of information for his map were oral accounts from travelers - Venetians or foreigners - coming to Venice from all parts of the then-known world. The importance of such accounts is indicated by Fra Mauro himself in a number of inscriptions. An even earlier map, the De Virga world map (1411–1415) also depicts the old world in a way broadly similar to the Fra Mauro map, and may have contributed to it.|$|E

25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.|$|E
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E
25|$|As some {{carotenoids}} can {{be converted}} into vitamin A, {{attempts have been made}} to determine how much of them in the diet is equivalent to a particular amount of retinol, so that comparisons can be made of the benefit of different foods. The <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> be confusing because the accepted equivalences have changed. For many years, a system of equivalencies in which an international unit (IU) was equal to 0.3 μg of retinol, 0.6 μg of β-carotene, or 1.2 μg of other provitamin-A carotenoids was used. Later, a unit called retinol equivalent (RE) was introduced. Prior to 2001, one RE corresponded to 1 μg retinol, 2 μg β-carotene dissolved in oil (it is only partly dissolved in most supplement pills, due to very poor solubility in any medium), 6 μg β-carotene in normal food (because it is not absorbed as well as when in oils), and 12 μg of either α-carotene, γ-carotene, or β-cryptoxanthin in food.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the <b>situation</b> <b>can</b> lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E
