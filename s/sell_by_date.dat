2500|$|... "Sell by date" [...] {{is a less}} {{ambiguous}} term for what {{is often referred to}} as an [...] "expiration date". Most food is still edible after the expiration date. A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves moving products with the earliest <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date</b> from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. This is important, as consumers enjoy fresher goods, and furthermore some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of infant formula and baby foods which must be withdrawn by their expiration date, Federal law does not require expiration dates. For all other foods, except dairy products in some states, freshness dating is strictly voluntary {{on the part of}} manufacturers. In response to consumer demand, perishable foods are typically labelled with a <b>Sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date.</b> It is up to the consumer to decide how long after the <b>Sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date</b> a package is usable. Other common dating statements are Best if used by, Use-by date, Expiration date, , and Pack date.|$|E
50|$|Rotation {{also applies}} to loose products; in this case, there is usually no set <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date,</b> and produce must merely look fit to eat. Older stock is merely placed on top of newer stock to rotate it.|$|E

25|$|According {{to former}} UK {{minister}} Hilary Benn, the use <b>by</b> <b>date</b> and <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>dates</b> are old {{technologies that are}} outdated and should be replaced by other solutions or disposed of altogether. The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revised guidance in 2011 to exclude the use of <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>dates.</b> The guidance was prepared {{in consultation with the}} food industry, consumer groups, regulators, and Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). It aims to reduce the annual £12bn of wasted supermarket food.|$|R
50|$|All autocoding systems {{comprise}} a products database which contains standard reference information for each product including packaging type, labels and <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date</b> criteria.

5000|$|If a {{stock is}} nearing its <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date,</b> stock may be reduced; its price is lowered {{in order to}} be more {{appealing}} to customers [...] Reduced stock is usually included in the rotation of stock, and is therefore moved {{to the front of the}} shelf ahead of any unreduced stock.|$|E
50|$|If {{a product}} is still on shelves after its <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date,</b> {{it will have to}} be thrown away, which is both costly and {{wasteful}} to the store (suppliers must be paid even if stock is not sold). Therefore, it is imperative that sell by dates are strictly adhered to, and that products which will perish earlier be sold as quickly as possible.|$|E
40|$|Capstone {{paper from}} 2015 spring MPA program. Instructed by Allen Zagoren. In America, 40 % {{of the food}} {{produced}} is ultimately thrown away, which is economically and environmentally detrimental. Our essay outlines the issue from a national standpoint to the local level, providing an examination of programs developed in other cities across {{the nation and the}} current programs in Des Moines that combat the food waste problem. This research reveals that {{there is a lack of}} education provided for the primary producers of food waste: individual consumers. We conducted a survey on 200 residents of the Des Moines metro area and found that this demographic would like more information on Use <b>By</b> and <b>Sell</b> <b>By</b> <b>dates,</b> as well as proper food storage for a variety of foods. Based on these results, we have developed some simple educational materials that can be easily distributed through existing organizations to educate the consumers on the topics they are curious about. Combating food waste needs to be a community activity, requiring participation and cooperation from an array of organizations. As such, we have developed a sample proposal that will be used by Next Course, a Food Recovery Network organization, to create partnerships with restaurants and grocery stores in the fight against food waste in Des Moines...|$|R
40|$|In July 1989, 1834 {{samples of}} paté (of which 1698 were from retail displays) were {{examined}} by the PHLS {{for the presence of}} Listeria monocytogenes. The survey was repeated in July 1990, when 626 paté samples on retail sale were examined. Between the two surveys there was a marked reduction in the proportions of patés contaminated (10 % in 1989 and 4 % in 1990) and in the numbers of samples from which > 10 (3) L. monocytogenes/g were recovered. The higher rate of contamination detected in 1989 was largely due to paté from a single manufacturer. In both surveys, paté sold as loose slices had higher rates of contamination than those prepackaged. Temperature control had improved between the two surveys where 65 % of samples in 1989 and 83 % in 1990 were stored at 7 degrees C. The majority of patés had unexpired shelf lives of between 0 and 3 weeks. Although contamination occurred throughout the shelf life of these products, the proportion of samples where L. monocytogenes was recovered was higher in patés with expired <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>dates.</b> There was an association between high total viable counts and the presence of L. monocytogenes. Likely routes of contamination of paté together with possible preventive measured are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Store {{management}} is an application that is complex although it seems apparently simple. A good store management system should prevent a wide set of issues: {{some of them}} inside the own business logic of the application (for instance employees or providers management) and others depending on the application’s architecture that makes the system more open. The goal of this Master Thesis Project is to define a Framework {{for the design of}} Store Management Applications, cooperating with other parallel master thesis, "Development of an Pharmacy management application using MSTORE Framework", and also probe it with the development of an specific application: an Ironmonger management application. This work is aimed towards SMEs, providing attractive and viable software tools that allow them their modernization for reaching the competitively grade of the department stores (cooperating with other parallel modules in the same research program). Three levels compose the Framework: in the top there is the interface layer, with all the common behaviour for all the standard stores. In the second layer, it can be found the abstract level that implements a part of the first level operations. Finally in the third level there will have the specific classes for each application that can be done using the Framework. For testing the Framework usefulness and good operation there were developed two concrete applications, each one with specific problems. The first is a Pharmacy, which works with perishable products, so the software should provide functions for controlling the <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>dates</b> and maintaining the merchandise in good conditions. The second is the Ironmonger, which needs a special support for buying sets and selling units. Both applications have also some common behaviour that is developed in the same way. This report will describe the concepts of the framework in relation to problems and solutions regarding store management. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

50|$|Shoppers, on {{the most}} part, will simply walk up to a shelf and take the front most box of the product they are looking for; this is {{especially}} true if they are in a hurry. They will generally also, unless they are specifically looking for a product that will last longer, not pay much attention to sell by/use by dates. If products with an early <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date</b> are at the front, and later ones at the back, they will be sold first. If things are organized the other way round, or stock is improperly rotated, newer stock will be sold first, leaving out of date stock sitting on the shelves which will have to be thrown away.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} brewery {{was established}} on 1 June 1879 by Herman Meijling and J.H. Bartelink as the Hengelosche Stoom Beiersch Bierbrouwerij, translated as the Hengelo Steam Bavarian Beer Brewery. Beiersch Bier {{refers to the}} German state of Bavaria, home of an innovative method of brewing that soon became the standard in brewing lager beers. Like other Dutch brewers in the 19th century, Meijling and Bartelink adapted the Bavarian brewing process of lager beer, using bottom fermentation and cellar storages to mature the beer for several weeks. This approach resulted in typical clear lager, increased preservation and a smooth taste. The early adapters of this technology were able to increase their territory and market share, {{taking advantage of the}} extended <b>sell</b> <b>by</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} stock traders focus on round numbers as cognitive reference points for value. Using {{a random sample}} of more than 100 million stock transactions, we find excess buying (<b>selling)</b> <b>by</b> liquidity demanders at all price points one penny below (above) round numbers. Further, the size of the buy- sell imbalance is monotonic in the roundness of the adjacent round number (i. e., largest adjacent to integers, second-largest adjacent to half-dollars, etc.). Conditioning on the price path, we find much stronger excess buying (<b>selling)</b> <b>by</b> liquidity demanders when the ask falls (bid rises) to reach the integer than when it crosses the integer. We discuss and test three explanations for these results. Finally, 24 -hour returns also vary by price point, and buy-sell imbalances are a major determinant of that variation across price points.
