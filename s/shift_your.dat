"Take off the trappings," [...] Hector said, [...] "then put {{a saddle}} on one for me; <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> own saddle {{on to the}} other, and picket your own with the spare horses of the staff, then we will ride over and get my saddle, bridle, holsters, and trappings.

This cabin o' yours ain't just the thing, you know,--raither dirty, and too high in the clouds by a long way, so I've bin an' seen a noo house on the river, not unlike this one, an' I wants you to <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> berth.

6000|$|... “Then, {{when you}} have put loads of stones all along in this way, you must <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> boards {{over to the other}} side of the path, and then wheel on them again; and that will fill up the side where the boards lay at first. And so, after a while, you will get the whole pathway filled up with stones, as high as you please. I should think you had better fill it up nearly level with the bank on each side.” ...|$|E

"I know not," [...] Cuthbert said; [...] "all that I {{gathered}} {{was that}} the earl intended to sweep the forest, and {{to put an end}} to the breaches of the laws, not to say of the rough treatment that his foresters have met with at your hands. You had best, methinks, be off before Sir Walter and his heavily-armed men are here. The forest, large as it is, will scarce hold you both, and methinks you had best <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> quarters to Langholm Chase until the storm has passed." ...|$|E

25|$|Reverse: The exact {{opposite}} of regular. The board is bent upwards starting at the middle, so that when laid flat the nose and tail are significantly off the ground. This design is ideal for park and freestyle as it allows a much smoother 360-degree rotation on both snow and rails. When standing on the board it is flexed down at the contact points by your weight, but can easily be lifted by <b>shifting</b> <b>your</b> weight off either foot. Sims first released this design in 1985, however, it was popularized recently by companies such as Lib-Tech and K2 Snowboarding.|$|R

My own troop will, of course, be ready to go; and you could <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> saddles on to the other horses. There is not one of our men who would not gladly march with you, for {{although}} we have beaten the Catholics well, the tenants do not forget that they are homeless; and will, I am sure, gladly follow up the blow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Stand by {{the side}} of the tree, Joyce. Now I will put this rope round you and round the tree, leaving a certain amount of slack in the loop. Now you get a grip of the tree with your knees. Then with your hands you shift the loop up as high as you can, and lean against it. Get a sort of purchase, and so <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> knees a bit higher. No doubt you will feel it awkward at first, but after a little {{practice}} you will find no difficulty whatever in going up at a fair rate of speed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} may {{see it in}} that light, in London," [...] the officer said courteously; [...] "but I doubt whether, at the present moment, they will take a calm view of the subject. However, I hope they will do so, {{especially}} as no shot has been fired by you, and they cannot charge you with resisting capture. At any rate, gentlemen, I will {{do my best to}} make you comfortable while you are under my charge. I must ask a few of you to <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> quarters, so as to make room for me and the three officers with me; beyond that you will continue, as before, to use the ship as passengers." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Analyst was {{a direct}} attack on the {{foundations}} of calculus, specifically on Newton's notion of fluxions and on Leibniz's notion of infinitesimal change. In section 16, Berkeley criticizes...the fallacious way of proceeding to a certain Point on the Supposition of an Increment, and then at once <b>shifting</b> <b>your</b> Supposition to that of no Increment [...] [...] [...] Since if this second Supposition had been made before the common Division by o, all had vanished at once, and you must have got nothing by your Supposition. Whereas by this Artifice of first dividing, and then changing your Supposition, you retain 1 and nxn-1. But, notwithstanding all this address to cover it, the fallacy is still the same.|$|R
5000|$|Checking {{involves}} striking {{with the}} side of the body, at the hip or shoulder, by <b>shifting</b> <b>your</b> balance and pushing with the furthest foot to drive the body into the opponent with force. While these movements are used extensively in ice hockey (see checking (ice hockey)) they can be performed equally well on dry ground and are part of various self-defense techniques. These strikes rarely cause damage, but are used to off-balance or knock an opponent down. However, when applied with ample power and to a vulnerable region they can cause pain, for example, hitting an opponent with the shoulder to the nose, striking the upper Quadriceps femoris muscle with the hip, or driving the shoulder into the opponent's solar plexus region.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said he, [...] "I {{found your}} trick--nay, you cheat me not twice the same way. There {{was a very}} palpable hit. Why, had I had but light enough the other night--But it skills not {{speaking}} of it--Here we leave off. I must not fight, as we unwise cavaliers did with you roundhead rascals, beating you so often that we taught you to beat us at last. And good now, {{tell me why you}} are leaving your larder so full here? Do you think I or my family can use broken victuals? What, have you no better employment for your rounds of sequestrated beef than to leave them behind you when you <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> quarters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Circumstantial {{evidence}} {{is a very}} tricky thing," [...] answered Holmes thoughtfully. [...] "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> {{own point of view}} a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|The general smiled. [...] "I am much {{obliged to}} you for your information, Mr. King, and am much pleased at the courage with which you and your companions entered the Boer camp to obtain it. It is {{satisfactory}} to learn that their force is not much greater than our own. It is also useful to know that their ponies are gathered so close to them, for shells that go over the hill may burst among them; and I believe {{that one of the}} Boers' most vulnerable points is their horses, for without them they would feel absolutely lost. I am sure, Mr. King, that you would wish to be {{in the thick of the}} fighting, but I would rather that you curbed your impetuosity, for after the manner in which you obtained this news for me, I can see that your party will do far greater service in scouting and in gaining intelligence than they could afford in action. I should advise you to <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> camp, as the troops are about to advance into the town, and the enemy's shot will soon be falling there." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, {{surgeons}} wore white gowns, {{but in the}} 20th century surgeons {{began to}} wear cyan or green surgical gowns, for several reasons. First, in the brightly lit operating room, cyan reflected less light than white and caused less strain on {{the eyes of the}} medical team. Second, cyan is the complementary color of red, so red blood on a cyan gown looks black or gray rather than red, and is not as vivid. Also, <b>shifting</b> <b>your</b> sight to cyan after staring at red {{for long periods of time}} does not cause cyan after-images, as shifting from red to white will do. Lastly, since cyan is considered a restful and soothing color, it causes less anxiety to patients.|$|R
6000|$|... "A goodly proposal, truly," [...] said Catherine, [...] "and worthy the mad-cap {{brain of}} a {{discarded}} page!--And what <b>shifts</b> does <b>your</b> worship propose we should live by?--by singing ballads, cutting purses, or swaggering on the highway? for there, I think, {{you would find}} your most productive exchequer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{that will}} never do," [...] Captain Martin said. [...] "They are all the more easy about me {{because they know that}} as long as your ship is there I cannot get out, but if they saw you <b>shifting</b> <b>your</b> berth it would strike them at once that I might be {{intending}} to slip away. You must wait until it gets perfectly dark, and then throw off your warps and slacken out your cable as silently as possible, and let her drop down so as to leave me an easy passage. As soon as it is dark I will grease all my blocks, and when everything is quiet try to get her out. What wind there is is from the southwest, which will take us well down the Zuider Zee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "I {{can speak}} freely to you. I was ashore {{the day before}} yesterday, and learned that my wife's father, her three brothers, and one of their wives have been murdered by the Spaniards. Well, you can {{understand}} that in my grief and rage I cursed the Spaniards and their doings. I have learnt that some spy has denounced me, {{and that they are}} only waiting for me to set foot on shore to arrest me, and you know what will come after that; for at present, owing to the volunteers that have come over to Brill and Flushing, the Spaniards are furious against the English. They would rather take me on shore than on board, but if they find that I do not land they will certainly come on board for me. They believe that I shall not be unloaded until noon tomorrow, and doubtlessly expect that as soon as the cargo is out I shall land to arrange for a freight to England. Therefore, until tomorrow afternoon I am safe, but no longer. Now, I am thinking of trying to get out quietly tonight; but to do so it is necessary that you should <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> berth a ship's length one way or the other. Will you do this for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Great cry, {{and little}} wool--is now become The plague and proverb of the weaver's loom; No wool to work on, neither weft nor warp; Their pockets empty, and their stomachs sharp. Provoked, in loud {{complaints}} to you they cry; Ladies, relieve the weavers; or they die! Forsake your silks for stuff's; nor think it strange To <b>shift</b> <b>your</b> clothes, since you delight in change. One thing with freedom I'll presume to tell-- The men will like you {{every bit as}} well. [...] See I am dress'd from top to toe in stuff, And, by my troth, I think I'm fine enough; My wife admires me more, and swears she never, In any dress, beheld me look so clever. And if a man be better in such ware, What great advantage must it give the fair! Our wool from lambs of innocence proceeds; Silks come from maggots, calicoes from weeds; Hence 'tis by sad experience that we find Ladies in silks to vapours much inclined-- And what are they but maggots in the mind? For which I think it reason to conclude, That clothes may change our temper like our food. Chintzes are gawdy, and engage our eyes Too much about the party-colour'd dyes; Although the lustre is from you begun, We see the rainbow, and neglect the sun. [...] How sweet and innocent's the country maid, With small expense in native wool array'd; Who copies from the fields her homely green, While by her shepherd with delight she's seen! Should our fair ladies dress like her, in wool How much more lovely, and how beautiful, Without their Indian drapery, they'd prove! While wool would help to warm us into love! Then, like the famous Argonauts of Greece, We'll all contend to gain the Golden Fleece! ...|$|E

5000|$|Drunken Monkey uses {{a lot of}} throat, eye and groin strikes as well as {{tumbling}} {{and falling}} techniques. It incorporates a lot of false steps to give the appearance it is defenseless and uses a lot of off balance strikes. The practitioner waddles, takes very faltering steps and sometimes {{fall to the ground}} and lies prone while waiting for the opponent to approach at which time a devastating attack is launched at the knees or groin areas of the opponent. In drunken monkey you use more internal energy than any other. It {{is one of the more}} difficult of the monkey styles to master and also extremely effective against a standard, attack-oriented enemy. Countering this style involves <b>shifting</b> <b>your</b> body around often to ensure that the Drunken Monkey user impacts more solid, tougher areas of your body.|$|R
