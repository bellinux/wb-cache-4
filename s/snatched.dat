5000|$|The <b>snatch</b> is {{the first}} of two lifts contested in the sport of weightlifting (also known as Olympic weightlifting) {{followed}} by the clean and jerk. The objective of the <b>snatch</b> is to lift the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion. There are four main styles of <b>snatch</b> used: squat <b>snatch</b> (or full <b>snatch),</b> split <b>snatch,</b> power <b>snatch,</b> and muscle <b>snatch.</b> The squat <b>snatch</b> and split <b>snatch</b> are the most common styles used in competition while power <b>snatch</b> and muscle <b>snatch</b> are mostly used for training purposes. In the squat <b>snatch,</b> the lifter lifts the bar as high as possible and pulls themselves under it in a squat position, receiving the bar overhead with the arms straight, decreasing the necessary height of the bar, therefore increasing the amount of weight that the lifter may successfully lift. In the split <b>snatch,</b> the lifter lifts the bar as high as possible and pulls themselves under the bar similar to the squat <b>snatch</b> but in the split <b>snatch</b> the lifter [...] "splits" [...] his legs, placing {{one foot in front of}} them and one behind, allowing themselves to receive the bar lower as in the squat <b>snatch.</b> The split <b>snatch</b> has become much less common with the increased popularity of the squat <b>snatch</b> but is occasionally performed by some lifters. In the power <b>snatch,</b> the lifter lifts the barbell as high as possible and receives the bar overhead with only a slight bend in the knee and hip, increasing the height that the bar must be lifted and decreasing the amount of weight that may be successfully lifted. In the muscle <b>snatch,</b> the lifter lifts the bar all the way overhead with arms locked out and the hip and knee fully extended.|$|R

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he <b>snatched</b> up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, <b>snatched</b> in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E

The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier.

5|$|Rendered {{unable to}} speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a {{tapestry}} (or a robe) that told her story and had it sent to Procne. Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband. After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and {{he became aware of}} their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal. He <b>snatched</b> up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters. They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis. In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale.

40|$|Log {{bunching}} with winches {{is still}} popular in small scale forest operations, and where machine traffic {{is confined to}} widely spaced designated trails. Like all tree handling methods, winching has a potential to incur residual stand damage, especially when harvested trees need to be moved around a dense residual stand. <b>Snatch</b> blocks are special pulleys designed for changing the pulling direction, in order to maneuver the winch load around obstacles. This study was aimed at determining the effect of using a <b>snatch</b> block on stand damage and work productivity. Using a <b>snatch</b> block allowed reducing by one quarter the frequency of wounded trees, which dropped from 50 % to 36 %. The <b>snatch</b> block was especially effective in preventing damage to dominant trees. No significant difference was recorded for wound size and wound severity. Survival of advance regeneration was significantly higher when using a <b>snatch</b> block. When no block was used, {{almost half of the}} saplings were lost. In contrast, only one sapling out of four was lost when using a <b>snatch</b> block. Using a <b>snatch</b> block did not cause any significant change of work productivity. Lower incidence of hang-up delays and faster pulling fully offset the time required to rig the <b>snatch</b> block. The study did not include ergonomics, and could not indicate how operator workload was affected by adding the weight of a <b>snatch</b> block to that of the cable and chain rigging. © 2012 Elsevier B.

50|$|A <b>snatch</b> strap is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used to help in the recovery of vehicles bogged in sand or mud. <b>Snatch</b> straps are manufactured from webbing that is capable of approximately 20% stretch under load. This stretching property allows the strap to store kinetic energy, which is used to pull vehicles from a bog. <b>Snatch</b> straps are typically between 6 m (20 ft) and 15 m (50 ft) in length, with 9 m (30 ft) being a common size. <b>Snatch</b> straps also have ratings of permissible working load - e.g. 8,000 kg.|$|R

Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags <b>snatched.</b> But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E

A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with a sledgehammer, but Bryan <b>snatched</b> it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron.
