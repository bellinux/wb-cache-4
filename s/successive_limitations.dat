In each, typically, there are two columns: the left column contains {{the language of the}} patent claim under analysis, separated into the <b>successive</b> <b>limitations</b> (e.g. elements or steps, integers, parts) of the claim; the right column contains the information relating to the claim element at its left.|$|E

Initially the toluene sorption isotherm on peat {{and the effect of}} different environmental conditions on the toluene consumption rates of this consortium were measured. The fast start-up of the biofilter and the decay in the elimination capacity (EC) were reproduced using microcosm assays with toluene <b>successive</b> additions. Nutrient <b>limitation</b> and a large degree of heterogeneity were also detected. EC values, extrapolated from microcosms, were higher than biofilter EC when it was operating close to 100 % efficiency but tended to relate better as the biofilter EC diminished. In studies on the microbial evolution in the biofilter, an increase in the cell count and variation in the ecology of the consortium were noted. Bacterial counts up to 10 × 10 11 cfu/g dry peat were found in 88 days, which corresponds to about a 10 4 increase from inoculum. Observations with SEM showed a nonuniform biofilm development on the support and the presence of an extracellular material. The results obtained in this work demonstrated that activity measurement in microcosms concomitant to the biofilter operation could be an important tool for understanding, predicting and improving th...|$|R
40|$|This paper mobilizes the {{trajectory}} of privatization policies around Thessaloniki's port as an entry point to explore the neoliberalization of urban infrastructure politics in Greece since the late 1990 s. It asks how neoliberalization policies around the port were conceptually legitimized and traces their implications for urban infrastructure governance. In doing so, it draws from a reading of neoliberalism as a performative discourse. This understanding allows analyzing the contingent and situated articulation of neoliberalization discourses {{as well as the}} context-specific implications of neoliberalization. The paper suggests that since the late 1990 s neoliberalization discourses in Greece were articulated with discourses of modernization. This coupling was mutually reinforcing for the two rationalities. On the one hand, successive rounds of neoliberal policies around the port were conceptually legitimized through functionalist references to the modern. On the other, performing neoliberalization constituted a key strategy in maintaining state legitimacy. Within such a configuration, <b>successive</b> failures and <b>limitations</b> of neoliberal polic(y) ing were (re-) inscribed in discourses of neoliberalization. Tracing the emergence and workings of this articulation in the case of Thessaloniki's port, the paper also examines how successive rounds of neoliberalization consolidated, through failing forward, forms of governance beyond democratic accountability geared around consensus formation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA better {{understanding}} of the factors controlling N 2 fixation is a pre-requisite for improving our knowledge on the contribution of N 2 fixation process in the nitrogen cycling. Trace-metal clean nutrient/dust addition bioassays (+P, +PFe, +dust) were performed at three stations located in the western, central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, in summer 2008 as part of the BOUM cruise. The main goals were (1) to investigate the nutrient factor(s) limiting N 2 fixation (uptake of 15 N 2) and (2) to evaluate the potential impact of a Saharan dust event on this biological process during the stratification period. Initially, surface waters at the three stations were DIP-depleted (2 fixation (from 130 % to 430 %). The highest dust stimulation of N 2 fixation was recorded at the station located in the eastern basin. The response of diazotrophic activity to nutrient additions was variable between the sampled stations suggesting a spatial variability of the factor controlling N 2 fixation over the whole basin. At all stations, N 2 fixation was not limited by Fe nor co-limited by P and Fe. At the western station, N 2 fixation was DIP limited while at the eastern one, N 2 fixation was first DIP limited, then was limited by one or several chemical element(s) released by dust. Our results demonstrated that a Saharan dust input was able to relieve these <b>successive</b> on going <b>limitations.</b> Very interestingly, at the station located in the central basin, N 2 fixation was not limited by the availability of P yet it was strongly stimulated by dust addition (x 3. 1). A chemical element or a combination of several, released by the added dust may have been responsible for the observed stimulations of N 2 fixation. These results indicated that Saharan dust pulses to the surface Mediterranean waters, in addition to P and Fe, could be a source of chemical(s) element(s) that are necessary for metabolic processes and therefore influence rates of N 2 fixation...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} five essays, four on cost overruns {{and one on}} behavioral economics witha focus on real estate investments. The main aim of the thesis was to answer the questions: • Is it common with cost overruns in infrastructure projects? • What explains the cost overruns? • What {{can be done to}} prevent cost overruns? This thesis contributes to the current state of knowledge within the field: • It is yet another evidence that cost overruns are a significant problem. • Optimism bias is an explanation of cost overruns. However, the thesis adds, by Article two, arationality explanation. • Dismisses in part the Successive method as a tool to reduce cost overruns. • Provide recommendations on how action against cost overruns can be systematized. The first article, which is a result of my Licentiate thesis deals with real estate investments and the fact that investors sometimes are influenced by behavioral aspects that make them deviate fromwhat is rational. The result is some what uncertain but shows that investors in these cases were influenced by myopic behaviour. The second article deals with cost overruns and rationality. The question is whether it can be rational in a procurement, using a unit‐price contract, to expect cost overruns. The result shows that it is possible in situations where the decision maker has to take renegotiation costs and monitoring costs into account. The third article examines how well the successive method can pvents cost overruns. Established results in research on cost overruns indicated that strategic factors, psychological factors (optimism bias) and technical factors are important to explain cost overruns. The review suggests that the <b>Successive</b> method has <b>limitations</b> as a method to reduce cost overruns because it cannot deal with strategic and psychological factors. The fourth article focus on why cost overruns incurred. The article presents a new framework based on microeconomic cost theory and also results based on a survey to project managers in infrastructure projects, suggesting that cost overruns are common and that cost overrun mainly aredue to the optimism bias. The issue addressed in the fifth article is {{what can be done to}} prevent cost overruns. The conclusion, based on questionnaire survey and literature review, suggests that a variety of policy measures are needed at different levels such as (1) : Organizational macrostructure where e. g. cost overruns in a project in one region leads to less projects in that region. (2) Organizational quality: improved transparency within organizations to see where and when cost overruns occur. (3) Organizational processes: e. g. the use of external reviewers.
