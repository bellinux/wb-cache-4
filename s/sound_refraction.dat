50|$|Atmospheric {{refraction}} is {{the deviation}} of light or other electromagnetic wave from {{a straight line}} as it passes through the atmosphere due to the variation in air density {{as a function of}} height. This refraction is due to the velocity of light through air, decreasing (the refractive index increases) with increased density. Atmospheric refraction near the ground produces mirages and can make distant objects appear to shimmer or ripple, elevated or lowered, stretched or shortened, with no mirage involved. The term also applies to the <b>refraction</b> of <b>sound.</b> Atmospheric <b>refraction</b> is considered in measuring the position of both astronomical and terrestrial objects.|$|R

This apparatus takes advantage of recent advances in two-dimensional ultrasound transducer array technology; it employs {{a modified version of}} a commercially available ultrasound camera, similar to those employed in non-destructive testing of solids. Images of convection patterns are generated by observing the lateral variation of the temperature dependent speed of <b>sound</b> via <b>refraction</b> of acoustic plane waves passing vertically through the fluid layer.

3000|$|Compensating {{for this}} error {{requires}} {{the availability of}} sound velocity profile data during localisation. Figure 2 shows that in very shallow water environments with relatively benign velocity profiles and short ranges (i.e., under 4000 [*]m), the error caused by <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> is relatively small (i.e., 0.02 % of the range) compared to the ambiguity errors that are potentially introduced by {{a large percentage of}} missing pairwise distances (typically in the order of 10 to 20 % of range). Another common compensation approach is by using a set of available anchor points of which the precise coordinates, and hence shortest inter-node distances, are used to predict a best-fit velocity profile by matching against ranging measurements. These anchor points are also used for mapping the relative locations onto geo-coordinates by using m-axis vector translations along with [...]...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe three-dimensional coupled mode sound propagation model of Chiu and Ehret (1990) is tested for its accuracy in modeling horizontal <b>sound</b> <b>refraction.</b> The test {{is achieved by}} comparing results generated by this model with exact analytic solutions to a parabolic approximation of the Helmholz Equation (Seigman, et al., 1990). Specifically, the acoustic wavefields associated with two cases of horizontally variable sound speed are considered. In Case I the sound speed varies only with azimuth, while in Case II there is radial and azimuth variation. The acoustic quantities used for the comparison included the modal modulation envelopes and transmission loss. Errors in the mode amplitude and phase are quantified and the significance of horizontal refraction is discussed. [URL] Commander, Japan Maritime Self-Defence Forc...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{calculation}} of the noise spectrum radiated from a turbulent jet flame based on a statistical model of the thermoacoustic source terms. Afterwards, the effects of the <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> by the temperature field of the flame are investigated. The sound production terms, derived from an aerothermoacoustic model (Boineau, 1997) and similar to Strahle's one (Strahle, 1985), are represented as a set of equivalent monopoles placed on the burner's axis. Effects of the severe temperature gradients surrounding the thermoacoustic sources are then investigated by using a recent numerical technique called Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method. This method is shown to be very fruitful and adapted to our current problem since it allows to take realistic configurations into account (presence of the burner tube, temperature field, distribution of monopoles [...] .) and automatically satisfies the radiation condition at infinity. Numerical results show acoustic amplification effects at low frequencies (< 500 Hz) whereas effects on the directivity patterns are noticeable at higher frequencies. 1...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} of meteorological parameters, traffic flow and vehicle composition, NOx concentrations and noise levels {{have been performed}} during a consecutive 166 -hour (approx. one week) episode in the Austrian Inn valley. The study elaborates the meteorologically induced effects on the transport and dispersion of air pollutants (NOx) and the propagation of sound waves from the motorway in the valley towards two receptor/receiver sites, one at the valley bottom, the other one at an elevated slope position. Due to complex transmission effects {{only a small portion}} of the observed variations in the air and noise pollution at the two sites can be explained by the varying emission at the motorway. With the help of simple models it is shown that by adding merely one or two meteorological parameters a substantially larger portion of the variation can be explained. The vertical temperature gradient turned out to be the meteorological key parameter. It controls the mixing volume (confined by the valley sides and the mixing-layer top) and the <b>sound</b> wave <b>refraction</b> which strongly determine air pollution and noise level, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Geometrical {{acoustics}} or ray acoustics is {{a branch}} of acoustics that studies propagation of sound {{on the basis of}} the concept of rays considered as lines along which the acoustic energy is transported. This concept is similar to the concept of geometrical optics, or ray optics, that studies light propagation in terms of rays. Geometrical acoustics is the approximate theory, which is valid in the limiting case of very small acoustic wavelengths, or very high frequencies. The principal task of geometrical acoustics is to determine the trajectories of sound rays. The rays have the simplest form in a homogeneous medium, where they are straight lines. If the acoustic parameters of the medium are functions of spatial coordinates, the ray trajectories become curvilinear, describing <b>sound</b> reflection, <b>refraction,</b> possible focusing, etc. The equations of geometric acoustics have essentially the same form as those of geometric optics. The same laws of reflection and <b>refraction</b> hold for <b>sound</b> rays as for light rays. Geometrical acoustics does not take into account such important wave effects as diffraction. However, it provides a very good approximation when the wavelength is very small compared to the characteristic dimensions of inhomogeneous inclusions through which the sound propagates.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this project was to design a ceiling system within a new Materials Resource Center in the Architecture Building that would embody the {{potential}} of parametric design and digital fabrication to rethink a generic interior architectural system. The instructors and students in a combined design studio and digital fabrication seminar developed a Ceiling Cloud that clips on to a modified suspended ceiling grid using lightweight folded aluminum panels {{that are designed to}} incrementally change dimension and drape into the space below. Constraints and variables within the parametric models allowed for the optimization and extraction of 150 unique panels that are also perforated with their own individual pattern. The variations in the folded surface disburse and dissipate <b>sound</b> through <b>refraction</b> and absorption created by the corrugation in the panels and their perforation. The holes are also calibrated as a gradient to allow more light to penetrate {{in the center of the}} space away from the perimeter walls. The project was prototyped by the students as the College of Architecture and partially realized with the help of industrial partners in Houston. The studio was co-directed with Visiting Critic Scott Marble who provided a framework to conduct the studio's exploration and several successful projects as precedent...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} aeroacoustics prediction tool {{based on}} the application of Lighthill’s theory is presented to compute noise from subsonic turbulent jets. The sources of sound are modeled by expressing Lighthill’s source term as two-point correlations of the velocity fluctuations and the <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> effects {{are taken into account}} by a ray tracing methodology. Both the source and refraction models use the flow information collected from a solution of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a standard k-epsilon turbulence model. By adopting the ray tracing method to compute the refraction effects a high-frequency approximation is implied, while no assumption about the mean flow is needed, enabling the authors to apply the new method to jet noise problems with inherently three-dimensional propagation effects. Predictions show good agreement with narrowband measurements for the overall sound pressure levels and spectrum shape in polar angles between 60 and 110 for isothermal and hot jets with acoustic Mach number ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 0. The method presented herein can be applied as a relatively low cost and robust engineering tool for industrial optimization purposes...|$|E
40|$|Backscatter {{reflectivity}} from multibeam echo-sounders {{provides a}} powerful tool to efficiently characterize seafloor substrates. A comprehensive EM 300 bathymetric and backscatter survey has been completed of Cook Strait, in central New Zealand. This paper presents {{a detailed analysis of}} the realtime corrections applied to the raw EM 300 multibeam data and additional corrections required to compute angular variations of the backscatter strength. The corrections, including the local absorption coefficient, the influence of seafloor topography and <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> in the water column, are determined for different Cook Strait seafloor substrates. Modifying MB-System software code, we extracted the backscatter signal parameters in order to quantify the raw backscatter strength and apply additional processing. Profiles of backscatter strength versus incidence angle were computed for a variety of sites characterized by flat seafloor and homogeneous substrates, and for which ground-truth data were available. For each homogeneous site, different but characteristic backscatter profiles are observed that can be interpreted in terms of sediment facies. To analyze heterogeneous substrates, we present a statistical technique, based on a 3 -dimensional distribution of (incidence angle, backscatter strength) couples that preserves geological information of the substrate components. This analysis, using backscatter data acquired on a submarine volcano, north of New Zealand, clearly differentiates soft sediments and lava flows within a heterogeneous substrate...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of sound from a source outside a nonisothermal high-speed boundary layer is considered. The sound source is assumed to lie in a uniform stream and matched to a zero velocity at the wall by a linear velocity profile. The unidirectional shear mean flow {{is assumed to be}} isentropic but nonhomentropic, so that the entropy, the sound speed, and the temperature can vary from one streamline to the other. The condition of homoenergetic flow, or constant enthalpy, is used to relate the sound speed to the mean flow velocity and specify the temperature profile in the boundary layer. Compared with a homentropic boundary layer, for which <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> is due to the shear flow alone, a nonhomentropic boundary layer introduces additional refraction due to the nonuniform sound speed and the associated temperature gradients. It is shown that for a high speed, even in isentropic conditions, the nonhomentropic effects of temperature gradients and the nonuniform sound speed can cause significant sound attenuation (viz., for the same sound source outside the boundary layer, the acoustic pressure at the wall can be substantially reduced). This agrees qualitatively with the results from testing propfans at high subsonic speeds, which showed significant sound attenuation in the fuselage boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} and {{experiments are}} carried out to apply ultrasonic computed tomography (CT) for a non-invasive measurement of bone density distribution. When an ultrasonic ray passes through such an object as bone, it propagates along refracted and curved paths. In such a case, the reconstruction methods commonly used will lead to inexact or even false results. To overcome this difficulty encountered in ultrasonic CT, the following procedure was developed. First, an approximate distribution of sound velocity is determined with usual reconstruction method on the assumption of straight-line propagation. Subsequently, after the corrected curved ray paths have been computed based on the result, a more exact sound velocity distribution can be reconstructed as the solutions of linear algebraic equations. This procedure is confirmed to be very effective from the present numerical simulation for a cylindrical object with high sound velocity. Through the measurements of the forefingers, the sound velocity distributions corresponding to the above first approximation could be obtained. The {{results indicate that the}} shape of the finger is enlarged due to the <b>sound</b> ray <b>refraction.</b> Because the present subjects are all young and healthy persons, there are no remarkable differences with respect to the maximum sound velocity of the finger...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the last}} years in the {{acoustical}} imaging area significant progress has been obtained. One of the important factors of ultrasonic visualization system performance is the primary transducer spatial resolution, its sensibility and signal-to-noise ratio. A common way to improve spatial resolution is to increase nominal frequency of a probe. But the high damping rate of acoustical waves in most metals at frequencies 2. 5 – 5 MHz give here a strong limitation. One of the efficient methods to improve probe’s sensibility and lateral resolution is a focusing. In practice when one has {{to solve the problem}} of the focusing for obliquely impinging beams upon an interface between two media, it is very important to estimate the influence of the <b>sound</b> waves <b>refraction</b> on the acoustical field pattern. The present study concerns the focusing beam geometry evaluation using plane waves and Fresnel integral approach. We have calculated, for shear wave probes, focal spot patterns in metals with shear wave velocity about 3000 – 3300 m/s i. e. for steels, aluminum and its alloys, first medium being polymer with longitudinal wave velocities 2400 – 3500 m/s and different damping level, which gave the possibility to determine allowed variations of aforementioned factors for a good focusing. One simple way to decrease the aberrations and improve the focusing for the shear waves transducers is proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{geophysical}} study that involved different techniques {{was carried out}} with the aim to improve {{the knowledge of the}} archaeological site where the Basilica of Maxentius was founded and to discern individual covered structures (foundations). Vertical Electrical <b>Sounding</b> (VES), seismic <b>refraction</b> and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) studies were performed in the archaeological site. VES and seismic refraction allowed to characterise the main geological formations of the hill where the Basilica was built and to distinguish the concrete floor and backfilling. Electrical data were processed using different algorithms; their results were compared to appraise the inverted models' robustness. ERT inversion algorithms were used to delineate shape and size of a much more complex structure, that were originally expected from archaeological excavation plan. The results of the commercial program were used as a posteriori information to include them in the algorithm proposed by the authors; the sequential use of the programs defined a processing procedure. The integrated use of different geophysical techniques reduced a great deal the intrinsic ambiguities of each method. Direct explorations (boreholes and archaeological excavations) confirmed the geophysical results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{atmospheric}} {{influence on}} sound propagation {{along the ground}} sur-face is a critical issue for estimating the noise impact of industrial plants or road networks. Indeed, <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> in the surface layer has a dramatic impact on the geographical acoustic exposure. Many analytical and numerical models and stud-ies based on {{the laws of physics}} are available in scientific papers whereas very few works in statistical analysis have been attempted. However several important practical issues need to be considered. Among these, time and space represen-tativity of “in situ ” measurements, sampling design, influence of meteorological and ground parameters on acoustic exposure show to be a few challenges. They need to be investigated with statistical tools taking into account space and time autocorrelation. A new protocol which includes ground impedance monitoring, spatial micro-meteorological and acoustical characterization has been applied to an experimental campaign from June to August 2005 in a case of sound propagation from a point sound source on a grassy flat ground. The first geostatistical study on such a multi-variable experimental database is presented. It adresses both the issue of modelling space varying impedance properties of an homogeneous meadow and the issue of modelling the acoustic field itself. This latter includes an analysis of the spatial variogram of the acoustic field residual calculated from a basic physical model as an external drift...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> {{in the water column}} on the accuracy of depths calculated from oblique swath angles of Multibeam Echosounders. This was accomplished by analysing data collected from the Tamar Estuary, Plymouth Sound and the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Sound speed was computed from this data using the Chen & Millero, MacKenzie and Medwin formulae for the estimation of sound speed in sea water. Resulting values were graphed as sound velocity profiles and barographs thus visually illustrating discrepancies in sound speed estimation between the three sound speed formulae, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} sound speed formula used for the calculation of sound speed in the water column is a source of error related to the horizontal position in a charted depth. The last phase of analysis utilised ray tracing to compare the horizontal distance a sound ray refracted in the water column from sound pulses emitted at near vertical and oblique angles. In all analysis, the extent of refraction increased as the swath angle increased as did the error between the estimated sound speeds from the Chen & Millero, MacKenzie and Medwin formulae. This study establishes the sound velocity formula used to compute sound speed in the water column and refraction at large oblique angles of Multibearn sonars contribute to errors associated with outer swaths of Multibeam sonars, thus contributing error to the horizontal position of chart depths...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of trees on sound propagation is currently discussed {{to reduce the}} sound exposure near transport infrastructure or industrial areas. This influence is direct due to reflection and scattering at the trees themselves as well as indirect through meteorological and ground effects modified by the trees. Previous investigations provide a mixed picture of sound attenuation within forested areas, in particular for the temporally and spatially variable meteorological influence. Thus, a three-dimensional model chain of atmospheric and acoustic models was adapted and applied to special meteorological and vegetation-specific conditions. A meteorological mesoscale model was applied to simulate temperature and wind fields within an inhomogeneous forest site. The meteorological quantities are used as diurnally variable input data for the acoustic FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) -model to simulate the sound propagation. Thereby, the effects of vegetation elements, impedance ground surface, and <b>sound</b> <b>refraction</b> are considered. The simulations are related to outdoor measurements, which were performed in early autumn 2011 near Dresden (Germany). The sound propagation of artificial signals was measured along sound paths of up to 190 [*]m length through a clearing {{as well as through}} an old spruce stand. Results of the comparison between measurement and model simulations are presented and possible applications of these results with regard to noise protection aspects are discussed. The model results confirm the measured diurnal cycle of sound levels at the receiver positions. Simulations with and without trees suggest an excess attenuation of the trees by about 4 [*]dB per 100 [*]m already for low frequencies...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} research project [SPR 2418; 2 ̆ 2 Study {{of the performance}} of acoustic barriers for Indiana toll roads, 2 ̆ 2] the influence of environmental factors and of advanced sound barrier concepts was investigated. The presence of temperature gradients over pavements was found to have a strong influence on <b>sound</b> propagation. <b>Refraction</b> of <b>sound</b> waves emitted by tire-road interactions {{in the vicinity of the}} ground also affects sound barrier performance. Modified ray tracing model suggested that prevailing winds have an influence on barrier performance at large distances. Randomized edge configurations were found not to improve barrier performance for traffic noise. Random edges simply scatter sound energy without any net noise reduction. Although the edge can be optimized for specific frequency components and locations, it appears that optimization for broadband noise control is difficult. The study also suggested that adding sound absorptive material along the barrier edge could enhance barrier performance. The present study is the continuation of the latter effort to confirm the findings related to the sound absorptive treatment on the barrier through a more rigorous study and to apply the design concept to a realistic situation. A comparison was made between barriers that incorporated sound absorptive treatments and barriers with T-shaped tops. The results confirmed that a sound absorptive treatment near the barrier edge resulted in a performance improvement over corresponding rigid barriers. A design optimization study of the most effective shape of acoustic treatments concluded that a circular shape works best. The performance of two different acoustical materials was also compared. Use of glassfiber resulted in better performance in the high frequency region, while polyolefin foam with closed cells achieved a relatively large insertion loss at low frequencies. Efforts were made to develop a numerical predictive model. The boundary element method was used to model the infinite size surrounding fluid effectively. The disadvantage of the boundary element model is the calculation load associated with the large number of elements required for high frequency analysis. A mesh optimization procedure was successfully implemented in the boundary element model to reduce the calculation time while satisfying the tolerances for analysis accuracy at each analysis frequency. Octave band averaging was also adapted to facilitate the comparison between the numerical results and experimental data. It was found that the results from the boundary element model agree relatively well with the experimental results up to 6300 Hz at selected locations. The insertion loss distribution proved the numerical model 2 ̆ 7 s capability of reproducing the rather complicated interference pattern on the receiver plane correctly at one-third octave band frequencies from 1000 Hz to 6300 Hz. Spatial-averaged insertion losses over different size receiver planes showed that the numerical model was less reliable when the averaging was done close to the ground level. Preliminary measurements for an actual, real-size barrier were performed in South Bend, Indiana, to identify a measurement location that can be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed add-on device. The add-on device was designed based on laboratory experiments and numerical studies, and was proven to be effective in a realistic highway environment. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (TNM) was exercised for the comparison of the measurements. On-site measurements were performed to evaluate the absorptive treatment. Application of the treatment over a limited (6 m) region improved the performance of the barrier by 2 to 5 dB at the frequencies from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz...|$|R
