5|$|On August 26, 1823, Joseph F. Goodrich, an American missionary, {{made the}} first {{recorded}} ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones he observed <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> {{was not the first}} human on the summit. He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau.|$|E
5|$|P. H. Vanderweyde {{noted that}} Crookes {{was already a}} believer in psychic powers before he {{obtained}} {{the results of the}} experiments. Vanderweyde stated the spring balance used in Crookes' experiment was unreliable as it was easy to manipulate by deception and <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> should repeat the experiment by using a chemical balance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} a {{combination}} of political satire and sexual humour wrapped in nursery rhyme style lyrics. The protagonist, John Wayne, is having sexual intercourse with a Native American female. When Wayne's bandolier restricts their intimacy, she <b>suggests</b> <b>he</b> removes it. <b>He</b> refuses and <b>suggests</b> <b>he</b> sodomises her instead: ...|$|R

5|$|An {{impressed}} tutor <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> {{should become}} an actor and, on Pryce's behalf, {{applied to the}} Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for an application form; Pryce was awarded a scholarship to RADA. When he joined Equity he used Jonathan Pryce as his stage name because Equity will only have one actor with any particular name on its books. While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings. Pryce {{was part of a}} 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included Bruce Payne, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{passed the}} Canadian {{citizenship}} test in June 1999, {{but it was}} <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> should delay taking the Oath of Citizenship until the next year of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) fair. He became a Canadian citizen at the 2000 CNE, during a Citizenship Ceremony in the Automotive Building. The Citizenship Oath was administered by Bill Withrow, C.M., longtime director of the Art Gallery of Ontario and great-grandson of John Withrow, the Canadian National Exhibition Association's first president.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{continued}} to play for Trinidad between 1923 and 1926, although, owing to his business commitments, {{he was unable to}} play in every game. In 1926 he played against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was touring the West Indies, for both Trinidad and a West Indies team. He passed fifty three times against the touring team, and such was his improvement as a batsman that critics <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> could hold a place in the West Indies team for his batting alone. However, Dewhurst did not play another first-class match until 1930.|$|E

50|$|The hagiography on Gorakhnath {{describe}} {{him to have}} appeared on earth several times. The legends do not provide a time or place where he was born, and consider him to be superhuman. North Indian hagiographies <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> originated from northwest India (Punjab, with some mentioning Peshawar). Other hagiographies on Gorakhnath in Bengal and Bihar <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> originated from eastern region of India (Assam).|$|R
5|$|Eardwulf was deposed in 806 and {{according}} to a Frankish record, returned to his kingdom in 808. No record has survived of his death {{or the end of}} his reign: dates from 811 to 830 have been <b>suggested.</b> <b>He</b> was possibly buried at the Mercian royal monastery of Breedon on the Hill, which carries a dedication to Saint Mary and Saint Hardulph, with whom Eardwulf is identified by several historians.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been born}} to a Polish family but brought up in England, Starosta speaks English but has learned Polish during {{his time in the}} country. As a young player his heroes were David Beckham and Kaká. Starosta cites his main hobby as playing golf and also enjoys singing to the point that his Miedź team mates <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> enter the Polish version of Must Be The Music.|$|E
5|$|Meikle {{started his}} career with Vernon Colts before going on trial with Eastwood Town, after his father <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> join his brother Deon at the club. He joined the club's youth system under Paul Cox. He {{graduated}} from the youth system and made his first-team debut as a 16-year-old during the 2004–05 season. Meikle helped Eastwood to promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division via the Northern Premier League First Division play-offs in 2006–07, and around this time had trials with Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Yeovil Town.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is little}} certain {{information}} about his life. There is a Genoese document (dated June 9, 1291) referring to a certain Giovanni, son of Mauro, from Carignano (Johannes de Mauro de Calignano). Other fragments <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> had two brothers, Giacomo a notary, and Anselmo a doctor. Further documents <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> was still alive in September 1329, but dead by May, 1330.|$|R

5|$|Norton was {{the subject}} of many tales; one popular story <b>{{suggested}}</b> <b>he</b> was the son of Emperor Napoleon III, and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry Queen Victoria. While this claim is unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions, and he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.|$|E
5|$|Radford was {{promoted}} to vice admiral in late 1945. For a time he was Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air under Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. In the post-war period Radford was a strong advocate that naval aviation programs be maintained. When Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King issued a post-war plan calling for the U.S. to maintain nine active aircraft carriers, Radford <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> double the number, a politically unrealistic proposal.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the pitching staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the ire of Phillies fans, who were tired of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> should be traded to another team.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction {{increased}} {{and there were}} frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned {{within a few months}} of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton Bragg) took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, while {{going through}} {{insurance}} papers in his parents' home, Rose learned of his biological father's existence, and he unofficially readopted his birth name. However, he referred to himself only as W. Rose, {{because he did not}} want to share a first name with his biological father. Following the discovery of his true family origins, Rose became the local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette; he was arrested more than 20 times on charges such as public intoxication and battery, and served jail terms up to three months. After Lafayette authorities threatened to charge him as a habitual criminal, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in December 1982. After moving to Los Angeles, he became so engrossed in his band AXL that his friends <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> call himself Axl Rose; he legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} bone cancer. He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in his leg {{led to the development of}} osteomyelitis, which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E

5|$|By {{now living}} in Nelson and barred from the Inter-Colonial Tournament, Constantine played no {{first-class}} cricket for two years. His contract with Nelson made him unavailable {{for much of the}} 1933 West Indies' tour of England under Grant. Constantine never challenged Nelson over this; some critics <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> was swayed by the greater financial rewards the club provided. He appeared once for the tourists in May, scoring 57 in 27 minutes and taking four wickets in a victory over an MCC team at Lord's. The West Indian board unsuccessfully tried to secure his release for the first Test match, which the West Indies lost heavily. After he took nine wickets in the tourists' game against Yorkshire, Nelson gave him permission to appear in the second Test at Manchester.|$|E
5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to pack the midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} with Clarke, Billingham {{still could not}} get support for Little Athletics from VAAA; instead, they <b>suggested</b> <b>he</b> drop the junior {{competition}} {{and focus on the}} rapidly expanding senior one. One of the delegates, Jack Frewin, encouraged him to push through with his idea, so he published a notice in the Geelong Advertiser announcing that he needed to start a formation of Little Athletics clubs. There was a meeting of interested parents, and Billingham told them that he thought an organisation should be set up based on his experience from the seniors competitions but he need some parents to help him. On 27 November 1965, six clubs were formed. They were run by parents with Billingham as an overall manager. By the end of the 1965/66 season, more than 200 boys and girls were competing regularly across nine clubs, and more than 500 had tried out at least once. The first Geelong championships were held in March 1966 over the long weekend.|$|E
