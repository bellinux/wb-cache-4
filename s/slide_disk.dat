40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{physics of}} motion of a sliding object {{can be used}} to plan sensorless robot {{manipulation}} strategies. Prediction of a sliding object’s motion is difficult because the object’s distribution of support on the surface, and the resulting frictional forces, are in general unknown. This paper describes a new approach to the analysis of sliding motion, which finds the set of object motions for all distributions of support. The analysis results in the definition of discrete regions of guaranteed sticking and slipping behavior which lend themselves to use in planning. Unlike previous work our approach produces quantitative bounds on the rate at which predicted motions can occur. To illustrate a manipulation plan which requires quantitative information for its construction, we consider a strategy based on “herding ” a <b>sliding</b> <b>disk</b> toward a central goal by moving a robot finger in a decreasing spiral about the goal. The optimal spiral is constructed, and its performance discussed...|$|R

40|$|A micromechanical {{distinct}} element method (DEM) {{model is}} adopted {{to analyze the}} grain-scale mechanism {{that leads to the}} brittle-ductile transition in cohesive-frictional materials. The cohesive-frictional materials are idealized as particulate assemblies of circular disks. While the frictional <b>sliding</b> of <b>disks</b> is sensitive to the normal compressive stress exerted on contacts, normal force can be both caused by interpenetration and long-range cohesive bonding between two particles. Our numerical simulations indicate that the proposed DEM model is able to replicate the gradual shift of porosity change from dilation to compaction and failure pattern from localized failures to cataclastic flow upon rising confining pressure in 2 -D biaxial tests. More importantly, the micropolar effect is examined by tracking couple stress and microcrack initiation to interpret the transition mechanism. Numerical results indicate that the first invariant of the couple stress remains small for specimen sheared under low confining pressure but increases rapidly when subjected to higher confining pressure. The micropolar responses inferred from DEM simulations reveal that microcracking may occur in a more diffuse and stable manner when the first invariant of the macroscopic couple stress are of higher magnitudes...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{interobserver}} variation of confocal laser scanning tomographic {{measurements of the}} optic nerve head and {{to address the question}} of whether the addition of clinical optic disk photographs is helpful in outlining the optic disk margin and in reducing the observer-related variation of the measurements. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Optic disk variables for 16 eyes of 16 patients with glaucoma, generated by confocal laser scanning laser tomography (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph), were independently evaluated by four experienced glaucoma specialists, and the interobserver variability was calculated. A second separate review by the same observers included the use of clinical stereoscopic color optic nerve head photographs to aid definition of the optic disk margin. RESULTS: Optic disk parameters with the smallest interobserver variation were cup shape measure, maximum cup depth, height variation contour, and mean height contour. The intraobserver variation of these parameters did not increase when clinical optic <b>disk</b> <b>slides</b> were additionally available. Parameters with the highest interobserver variation were volume below surface, volume below reference, volume above surface, and volume above reference. The observer variation of these optic disk parameters increased significantly for two of the four examiners when clinical optic <b>disk</b> <b>slides</b> were additionally available for outlining the optic disk margin. CONCLUSION: Confocal laser scanning tomography of the optic nerve head can be improved significantly if clinical optic disk photographs are additionally available to help in outlining the optic disk margin. Because interobserver variation in the tomographic optic disk measurements can be significant, even if experienced observer are involved, tomographic optic disk measurements may be centralized in reading centers in the case of multicenter studies.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of disinfectant procedures on the dimensional stability and surface quality of a tissue conditioner used as a functional impression material. Materials and Methods: A tissue conditioner (Visco-gel) used as a functional impression material was disinfected by immersion in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite or 2 % glutaraldehyde solutions for 10 or 20 minutes, respectively. The control group consisted of specimens (n= 10) that were not treated by disinfectants. For testing the dimensional stability, impressions of an aluminum edentulous arch with three reference points were made. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water, the specimens were treated by one of the disinfection procedures. Impressions were poured and, subsequently, 50 stone casts were measured with a Nikon profile projector. For surface roughness evaluation, disks that contained Visco-gel were pressed against glass <b>slides.</b> The <b>disks</b> were then stored in distilled water for 24 hours. After disinfection, 50 disk-shaped dental stone casts were prepared. Surface roughness values were determined using a profilometer. For each test, data were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey′s test (α = 0. 05). Results: The results of the dimensional stability test showed that immersion of Visco-gel impressions in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite solution or 2 % glutaraldehyde solution did not significantly change the anteroposterior (AP) and cross-arch (CA) distances of the resultant stone casts when compared to the control group (P> 0. 05). The surface quality of dental stone casts formed by Visco-gel did not change significantly when impressions were immersed in the disinfectant solutions for either 10 or 20 minutes, or when stored in distilled water (P> 0. 05).

Three test parameters; temperature, load, and sliding velocity were varied {{over a wide range}} {{in order to determine the}} performance envelope on the gold/chromium (Au/Cr) solid lubricant film. The tribo-tests were run in an air atmosphere at temperatures of 25 to 1000 C, under loads of 4. 9 to 49. 0 N and at sliding velocities from 1 to 15 m/sec. Post test analyses included surface profilometry, wear factor determination and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) examination of worn surfaces. Compared to unlubricated Al 2 O 3 sliding, the use of the Au/Cr film reduced friction by 30 to 50 percent and wear by one to two orders of magnitude. Increases in test temperature resulted in lower friction and the Au/Cr film continued to provide low friction, about 0. 3, even at 1000 C. Pin wear factors and friction were largely unaffected by increasing loads up to 29. 4 N. Sliding velocity had essentially no effect on friction, however, increased velocity reduced coating life (total sliding distance). Based upon these research results, the Au/Cr film is a promising lubricant for moderately loaded, low speed applications operating at temperatures as high as 1000 C...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Let D be {{a set of}} n {{pairwise}} disjoint unit {{balls in}} Rd and P the set of their center points. A hyperplane H is an m-separator for D if each closed halfspace bounded by H contains at least m points from P. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes (n/ 2 -separators). The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied. Separators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer schemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating hyperplane may still interact with {{both sides of the}} partition. Therefore it is desirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls only. We present three deterministic algorithms to bisect or approximately bisect a given set of n disjoint unit balls by a hyperplane: firstly, a linear-time algorithm to construct an αn-separator in Rd, for 0 < α < 1 / 2, that intersects at most cn(d− 1) /d balls, where c depends on d and α. The number of balls intersected is best possible up to the constant c. Secondly, we present a near-linear time algorithm to find an (n/ 2 −o(n)) -separator in Rd that intersects o(n) balls. Finally, we give a linear-time algorithm to construct a halving line in R 2 that intersects O(n(5 / 6) +ε) disks.

Each part of the wear track on the disc is in discontinuous contact with the counterbody. The contact frequency at {{each part of the}} wear track on the disc with the counterbody is defined by the rotation frequency of the disc. The sliding speed is however a function of both the rotation frequency and wear track diameter. In this work, the effect of the contact frequency on friction and wear was investigated on carbon steel in discontinuous sliding contact with corundum balls. Various sliding speeds were used while maintaining the contact frequency at a fixed value, and various contact frequencies were applied at constant sliding speeds. The wear rate of the disk material is shown to depend not only on the usual wear test parameters, namely sliding speed and contact load, but also on contact frequency. Moreover, contact frequency is shown to be a key factor determining the wear mode even at constant sliding speed and load. At contact frequencies above 9 Hz, the dominant wear mechanism is oxidational wear, while at frequencies below 4 Hz the dominant wear mechanism is adhesive wear. This transition from adhesive to oxidational wear takes place together with a change in the type of debris generated and {{in the value of the}} coefficient of friction. The validity of the Garcia-Ramil-Celis model proposed earlier for discontinous sliding contact conditions, is demonstrated for the case of carbon steel <b>disks</b> <b>sliding</b> against a chemically inert counterbody. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the tribological properties of hard diamondlike carbon (DLC) films on magnesia-partially-stabilized zirconia (MgO-PSZ) substrates {{over a wide range}} of loads, speeds, temperatures, and counterface materials. The films were 2 {micro}m-thick and produced on by ion-beam deposition at room temperature. Tribological tests were conducted on a ball-on-disk machine in open air of 30 to 50 % relative humidity under contact loads of 1 to 50 N, at sliding velocities of 0. 1 to 6 m/s, and at temperatures to 400 {degrees}C. A 1 {sub 2 }O{sub 3 } and Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } balls were also used and rubbed against the DLC-coated MgO-PSZ disks, primarily to assess and compare their friction and wear performance to that of MgO-PSZ balls. A series of long-duration lifetime tests was run at speeds of 1, 2, and 6 m/s under a 5 -N load to assess the durability of these DLC films. Test results showed that the friction coefficients of MgO-PSZ balls <b>sliding</b> against MgO-PSZ <b>disks</b> were in the range of 0. 5 - 0. 8, and the average specific wear rates of MgO-PSZ balls ranged from 10 {sup {minus} 5 } to 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } mm{sup 3 }/N. m, depending on sliding velocity, contact load and ambient temperature. The friction coefficients of MgO-PSZ balls sliding against the DLC-coated-MgO-PSZ disks varied between 0. 03 to 0. 1. The average specific wear rates of MgO-PSZ balls were reduced by factors of three to four orders of magnitude when rubbed against the DLC coated disks. These DLC films could last 1. 5 million to 4 million cycles, depending on sliding velocity. Scanning electron microscopy and micro-laser Raman Spectroscopy were used to elucidate the microstructural and chemical nature of DLC films and worn surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Let D be {{a set of}} n {{pairwise}} disjoint unit {{balls in}} Rd and P the set of their center points. A hyperplane H is an m-separator for D if each closed halfspace bounded by H contains at leastm points from P. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond to n/ 2 -separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied. Separators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer schemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating hyperplane may still interact with {{both sides of the}} partition. Therefore it is desirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls only. We present three deterministic algorithms to bisect or approximately bisect a given set of disjoint unit balls by a hyperplane: Firstly, we present a simple linear-time algorithm to construct an αn-separator for balls in Rd, for any 0 < α < 1 / 2, that intersects at most cn(d− 1) /d balls, for some constant c that depends on d and α. The number of intersected balls is best possible up to the constant c. Secondly, we present a near-linear time algorithm to construct an (n/ 2 − o(n)) -separator in Rd that intersects o(n) balls. Finally, we give a linear-time algorithm to construct a halving line in R 2 that intersects O(n(5 / 6) +ε) disks. Our results improve the runtime of a <b>disk</b> <b>sliding</b> algorithm by Bereg, Dumitrescu and Pach. In addition, our results improve and derandomize an algorithm to construct a space decomposition used by Löffler and Mulzer to construct an onion (convex layer) decomposi-tion for imprecise points (any point resides at an unknown location within a given disk). Figure 1 : A set of 18 disks in R 2 and three separators. The dashed line forms a 6 -separator. Both the solid line and the dotted line are halving lines. The solid line is preferable to the other two lines because it separates perfectly and intersects no disks. ar X i...|$|R
