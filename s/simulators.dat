5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, {{particularly in light of}} contemporary <b>simulators</b> like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that fans would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration.

They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E

5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight <b>simulators</b> failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scenes in}} the episode were filmed at a Canadian Airlines {{operations}} center in Richmond, British Columbia. The crew were given permission by the airline to use their flight <b>simulators,</b> leading to the production being delayed while everyone had a turn simulating flights over Canada. The problematic command center set was constructed and filmed at an amphitheater in Vancouver, whose sloping surfaces helped to suggest computer terminals without needing much construction, although false computer monitors were added for shots when {{they would be in}} view.|$|E
5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened <b>simulators</b> so as to keep their night vision, but in practice {{it was discovered that}} the light of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E

The Motion Base <b>Simulator</b> has a forward crew station with six-degrees of freedom motion simulation. Operation of the Spacelab <b>Simulator</b> is planned for the spring of 1983. The Guidance and Navigation <b>Simulator</b> went into operation in 1982.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} overview {{deals with}} <b>simulator</b> sickness, for example, why it occurs, the symptoms, and what measures can alleviate the symptoms. Image systems which extend {{a long way}} sideways, 90 º turns and rapid changes of speed are examples of factors which can give rise to <b>simulator</b> sickness. The effect of movement is less clear, positive effects {{and the lack of}} effects have both been observed. There are also individual differences, including sex and age, which can affect sensitivity to <b>simulator</b> sickness. By excluding tight bends, complex environments, start and stop situations in the scenarios, the frequency of <b>simulator</b> sickness is reduced. In short exposures, there is less risk of <b>simulator</b> sickness occurring. Repeated exposures can result in the trial participants getting used to the <b>simulator</b> environment. Also, persons who do not consider themselves to be at all sensitive as regards motion sickness can be affected by <b>simulator</b> sickness, for which reason, previous experience of motion sickness is not a good predictor of <b>simulator</b> sickness. Experience of <b>simulator</b> sickness in VTI's research <b>simulator</b> is summarised. The problems have been reduced, largely thanks to <b>simulator</b> design. Finally, relevant aspects are discussed as regards the planning of a study of <b>simulator</b> sickness in a VTI <b>simulator...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ultracold atom {{trapping}} in optical lattices is {{an experimental}} tool {{commonly used in}} condensed matter physics, and in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The method involves using optical lasers to form an interference pattern, which acts as a lattice, in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as quantum <b>simulators,</b> that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as frustrated magnets.

5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in <b>simulators.</b> Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} a <b>simulator</b> {{for a new}} processor architecture, it often {{is not clear whether}} it is more efficient to write a new <b>simulator</b> or to modify an existing <b>simulator.</b> Writing a new <b>simulator</b> forces the processor architect to develop or adapt all of the related software tools.
