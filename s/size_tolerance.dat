Mating relations between datum planes are shown to involve translational and rotational errors, which are related to form tolerances and are usually neglected in tolerance analysis. To evaluate these errors, the contact between datum planes was simulated by a stochastic model, where two surface profiles are randomly generated and then registered to reproduce a mating condition. Concepts of fractal geometry were exploited to make the generation consistent with the autocorrelation properties of actual surfaces resulting from manufacturing processes.

Although there are many factors that affect cost of manufacturing, {{the single most important}} parameter for estimating the cost of manufacturing is tolerance (deviation from the nominal <b>size).</b> Since <b>tolerance</b> affects the manufacturing cost directly, in the past most cost formulations were constructed using some form of inverse power function of a single tolerance parameter.

50|$|When {{designing}} mechanical components, {{a system}} of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (<b>size)</b> <b>tolerances</b> are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work {{in such a way}} that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) for the repair and retrofit of concrete structures in the 1980 ’s, considerable research {{has been devoted to}} the feasibility of their application and predictive modeling of their performance. However, the effects of flaws present in the constitutive components and the practices in substrate preparation and treatment have not yet been thoroughly studied. ^ This research aims at investigating the effect of surface preparation and treatment for the pre-cured FRP systems and the groove <b>size</b> <b>tolerance</b> for near surface mounted (NSM) FRP systems; and to set thresholds for guaranteed system performance. This study was conducted as part of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 10 - 59 B to develop construction specifications and process control manual for repair and retrofit of concrete structures using bonded FRP systems. ^ The research included both analytical and experimental components. The experimental program for the pre-cured FRP systems consisted of a total of twenty-four (24) reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams with various surface preparation parameters and surface flaws, including roughness, flatness, voids and cracks (cuts). For the NSM FRP systems, a total of twelve (12) additional RC T-beams were tested with different grooves sizes for FRP bars and strips. The analytical program included developing an elaborate nonlinear finite element model using the general purpose software ANSYS. The bond interface between FRP and concrete was modeled by a series of nonlinear springs. The model was validated against test data from the present study as well as those available from the literature. The model was subsequently used to extend the experimental range of parameters for surface flatness in pre-cured FRP systems and for groove size study in the NSM FRP systems. ^ Test results, confirmed by further analyses, indicated that contrary to the general belief in the industry, the impact of surface roughness on the global performance of pre-cured FRP systems was negligible. The study also verified that threshold limits set for wet lay-up FRP systems can be extended to pre-cured systems. The study showed that larger surface voids and cracks (cuts) can adversely impact both the strength and ductility of pre-cured FRP systems. On the other hand, frequency (or spacing) of surface cracks (cuts) may only affect system ductility rather than its strength. Finally, within the range studied, groove <b>size</b> <b>tolerance</b> of ± 1 / 8 in. {{does not appear to have}} an adverse effect on the performance of NSM FRP systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Material loss at {{the taper}} {{junction}} of metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM THRs) has {{been implicated in}} their early failure. The mechanisms of material loss are not fully understood; analysis of the patterns of damage at the taper can help us better understand why material loss occurs at this junction. Methods: We mapped the patterns of material loss {{in a series of}} 155 MOM-THRs received at our centre by scanning the taper surface using a roundness-measuring machine. We examined these material loss maps to develop a five-tier classification system based on visual differences between different patterns. We correlated these patterns to surgical, implant and patient factors known to be important for head-stem taper damage. Results: We found that 63 implants had ‘minimal damage’ at the taper (material loss < 1 mm 3) and the remaining 92 implants could be categorised by four distinct patterns of taper material loss. We found that (1) head diameter and (2) time to revision were key significant variables separating the groups.
