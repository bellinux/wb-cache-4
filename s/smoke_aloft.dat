60|$|Then an Allied gun {{opened up}} with a boom. The shell moaned on over. Dorn saw where it burst, sending <b>smoke</b> and earth <b>aloft.</b> That {{must have been a}} signal for a {{bombardment}} of the enemy all along this sector, for big and little guns began to thunder and crack.|$|R
60|$|It {{was early}} in the evening, with the sun not yet out of sight behind a lofty ridge that topped the valley slope. High grass, {{bleached}} white, shone brightly on the summit. Soon several columns of blue <b>smoke</b> curled lazily <b>aloft</b> until, catching the wind high up, they were swept away. Meanwhile the men talked at their tasks.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a hot}} autumn {{morning when}} we {{prepared}} to commence our task of railroad building, the last forlorn hope between ourselves and ruin. Harry and I stood each beside our teams, which were harnessed to a great iron scoop or scraper designed to tear out a heavy load of soil at each traverse. This we would pile in the slight hollows, so that, sinking a few feet through the rises and raised slightly above each depression, the road-bed might run straight and level across the prairie. A group of sinewy, dusty men waited about the line of flat cars loaded with rails close behind, while a plume of black <b>smoke</b> curled <b>aloft</b> from the huge locomotive in a dingy column against {{the blue of the}} sky. This, with the cluster of tents and shanties, was all that broke the white grass-land's empty monotony.|$|R
5000|$|There {{comes the}} Multnomah! Success to the steamer,Sweet {{sounding}} her music, high floating her streamer:The {{sound of her}} paddles the hills serenading,And her <b>smoke</b> high <b>aloft</b> into vapor is fading.There comes the Multnomah shout fifty glad voices;Each heart beats with rapture, each bosom rejoices,Her structure so firm, yet buoyant and airyShe skims o'er the waves like a sylph or a fairy.There comes the Multnomah, we greet her with pleasure,The choicest of welcomes to her is extended,Because with her welfare our interests are blended. —Anonymous poet signed [...] "O.P.Q.", published in pioneer newspaper Oregon Spectator, August 19, 1851. Residents of the Oregon Territory saw {{the coming of the}} steamboats as a mark of progress. Poems were published in honor of the early steamboats. Randall V. Mills, an historian of the early steamboats in Oregon, and a folklore expert, found these poems to be lacking in skill, but expressive of the attitudes of the population.|$|R
60|$|The little {{hamlet of}} Pine {{lay on the}} last level of sparsely timbered forest. A road, running {{parallel}} with a dark-watered, swift-flowing stream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue <b>smoke</b> drifted lazily <b>aloft.</b> Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow in the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted with horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site {{appeared to be a}} natural clearing, for {{there was no evidence of}} cut timber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene, tranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and happy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} use {{of chemical}} analysis of organic molecules in atmospheric aerosols (PM 1) collected in situ in Barcelona and optical measurements with a {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) instrument allowed the characterization of the smoke plume from a wildfire that reached the city in July 2012. Analysis of the chemical composition of the aerosols collected on 23 July 2012 confirmed the large effect of biomass burning on urban air quality during a period of several hours. Typical biomass burning tracers, such as levoglucosan, dehydroabietic acid and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were enhanced {{at the same time as}} the aerosol concentrations in the boundary layer increased. According to air-mass trajectory modeling, the biomass burning particles originated from a severe wildfire burning 120 km northeast of the city. On the following days, no significant contribution of wildfire smoke was found in the urban air, although the lidar detected particles aloft. A Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART) was used to simulate the transport of aerosols (PM 2. 5) and carbon monoxide (CO), and the simulated concentrations in Barcelona were compared to in-situ measurements. FLEXPART simulated the onset of the wildfire smoke plume event in the urban center in the early morning of 23 July successfully; by contrast, the fast passage of the plume at the surface and the decoupling of the cleaner boundary layer from the persistent <b>smoke</b> plume <b>aloft</b> was not well captured. This was attributed to the fact that the model did not capture the local sea-breeze circulation well enough. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|Large {{sources of}} aerosol {{particles}} and their precursors are ubiquitous in East Asia. Such sources {{are known to}} impact the South China Sea (henceforth SCS), a sometimes heavily polluted region that has been suggested as particularly vulnerable to climate change. To help elucidate springtime aerosol transport into the SCS, an intensive study {{was performed on the}} remote Dongsha (aka Pratas) Islands Atoll in spring 2010. As part of this deployment, a Davis Rotating-drum Uniform size-cut Monitor (DRUM) cascade impactor was deployed to collect size-resolved aerosol samples at the surface that were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence for concentrations of selected elements. HYSPLIT backtrajectories indicated that the transport of aerosol observed at the surface at Dongsha was occurring primarily from regions generally to the north and east. This observation was consistent with the apparent persistence of pollution and dust aerosol, along with sea salt, in the ground-based dataset. In contrast to the sea-level observations, modeled aerosol transport suggested that the westerly flow aloft (w 700 hPa) transported smoke-laden air toward the site from regions from the south and west. Measured aerosol optical depth at the site was highest during time periods of modeled heavy <b>smoke</b> loadings <b>aloft.</b> These periods did not coincide with elevated aerosol concentrations at the surface, although the model suggested sporadic mixing of this free-tropospheric aerosol to the surface over the SCS. A biomass burning signature was not clearly identified in the surface aerosol composition data, consistent with this aerosol type remaining primarily aloft and not mixing strongly to the surface during the study. Significant vertical wind shear in the region also supports the idea that different source regions lead to varying aerosol impacts in different vertical layers, and suggests the potential for considerable vertical inhomogeneity in the SCS aerosol environment...|$|R
2500|$|... "Nuclear winter," [...] and its progenitor, [...] "nuclear twilight," [...] {{refer to}} nuclear events. Nuclear winter {{began to be}} {{considered}} as a scientific concept in the 1980s, after it became clear that an earlier hypothesis, that fireball generated NOx emissions would devastate the ozone layer, was losing credibility. It was in this context that the climatic effects of soot from fires was [...] "chanced upon" [...] and soon became the new focus of the climatic effects of nuclear war. In these model scenarios, various soot clouds containing uncertain quantities of soot were assumed to form over cities, oil refineries, and more rural missile silos. Once the quantity of soot is decided upon by the researchers, the climate effects of these soot clouds are then modeled. The term [...] "nuclear winter" [...] was coined in 1983 by Richard P. Turco in reference to a 1-dimensional computer model created to examine the [...] "nuclear twilight" [...] idea, this 1-D model output the finding that massive quantities of soot and <b>smoke</b> would remain <b>aloft</b> in the air for on the order of years, causing a severe planet-wide drop in temperature. Turco would later distance himself from these extreme 1-D conclusions.|$|R
