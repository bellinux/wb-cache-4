5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a <b>sheltered</b> <b>workshop</b> at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E

50|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} shops {{are run by}} <b>sheltered</b> <b>workshops,</b> and two-thirds are social firms trading on the market. Some {{associations}} run several shops. The attraction for disablement organisations running <b>sheltered</b> <b>workshops</b> is that opening a CAP Market enables them to create jobs for their users in the ‘real world’. These allow disabled people to have near-normal working life {{and to be a}} fully integrated part of the local community. Many of the jobs that <b>sheltered</b> <b>workshops</b> undertake, such as assembly or logistics, are carried out away from the public gaze.

It explains the function of protected workshops and compares their positive and negative elements. The practical section of the thesis outlined the cost-benefit analysis used for effectiveness evaluation of protected workshops comparing costs and benefits arising from the employment and unemployment of disabled people. The final calculation demonstrates that the state saves in the interval from 3. 5 to 5. 7 crowns from each invested crown. This implies that the active policy of employment which finances <b>sheltered</b> <b>workshops</b> and <b>sheltered</b> employment is effective...|$|R
