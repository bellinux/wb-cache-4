Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought it sounded as if the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that <b>something</b> <b>serious</b> had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{was born}} on Scotland Road in Liverpool. His parents were working class; his mother, Mary Jane (née Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic, and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker {{attended}} Cheswardine Boarding School. At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. As {{he wrote in his}} autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and thought he should get out before he did <b>something</b> <b>serious.</b> He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife. He {{went on to become a}} professional actor in the late 1960s after the marriage broke down.|$|E

500|$|In 1969, {{after two}} large {{accidents}} due to breakages on his Lotus car, Mosley decided that [...] "it {{was evident that}} I wasn't going to be World Champion" [...] and retired from driving. He was already working with Robin Herd, Alan Rees and Graham Coaker to establish the racing car manufacturer March Engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters. The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the 'M' stands for Mosley. Like the other founders, Mosley put in £2,500 of capital. His father {{told him that the}} company [...] "would certainly go bankrupt, but it would be good training for <b>something</b> <b>serious</b> later on." ...|$|E
500|$|Gielgud {{directed}} Michael Redgrave in a 1940 London {{production of}} The Beggar's Opera for the Glyndebourne Festival. This was a chaotic affair: Gielgud's direction confused his star, and when Redgrave lost his voice Gielgud {{had to step}} in and sing the role as best he could. Gielgud felt that <b>something</b> <b>serious</b> or even solemn was necessary for wartime London, where most entertainment was light-hearted. Together with Harley Granville-Barker and Guthrie he reopened the Old Vic with Shakespeare. His King Lear once again divided the critics, but his Prospero was a considerable success. He played the role quite differently from his attempt on the same stage in 1930: in place of the [...] "manic conjurer" [...] his Prospero was [...] "very far from the usual mixture of Father Christmas, a Colonial Bishop, and the President of the Magicians' Union... a clear, arresting picture of a virile Renaissance notable", according to Brown. The critics singled out, among the other players, Jack Hawkins as Caliban, Marius Goring as Ariel, Jessica Tandy as Miranda and Alec Guinness as Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|... "Young Girls" [...] debuted to {{mixed and}} {{positive}} reviews among critics. After its premiere during Mars' performance on Saturday Night Live, it became {{available as a}} studio version with Chris Martins of Spin labeling it an [...] "epic studio-recorded glory". On a more thorough review, Idolator's Carl Williott found the production [...] "dynamic" [...] comparing it to compositions by Lana Del Rey and while [...] "the pre-chorus could be from a 60's girl group", the [...] "percussion and electro flitting in the background" [...] is what makes pop music nowadays. He concluded, that it's [...] "a flipside" [...] to Mars' lead single.. HitFix's critic Melinda Newman gave the track a B- rating, praising the melody and Mars' vocal delivery, writing [...] "he makes it all sound so sweet, and as if he really is tortured by these young girls", but ultimately calling the lyrics [...] "a little skeevy". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, while reviewing the album, believed that it [...] "swells <b>something</b> <b>serious.</b> The ambition is undeniable". He compared it {{to the music of}} U2 and Daughtry.|$|E

A statement from the band stated that the members [...] "felt it necessary to take some immediate time to focus on our friendship, as that's more important than risking it for the sake of touring at this time." [...] In an Alternative Press cover story on Underoath, Michael [...] "Fat Mike" [...] Burkett told the magazine that Chamberlain had confided in him that Underoath's band members had been [...] "having a lot of arguments over their religious beliefs." [...] Burkett admitted to Punknews.org that he had poked fun at the band for their beliefs, but emphasized that he befriended Underoath's band members {{at the start of the}} tour and had a personal policy of not making jokes on-stage about anyone he was not friends with or did not like personally. It was also spread that the band's withdrawal from the tour was due to Chamberlain's rumored drug problems and time spent in rehabilitation, to which Gillespie responded, [...] "If there was <b>something</b> <b>serious</b> going on like that and he was in rehab, we'd have to tell the press. But it's just not true." [...] Underoath toured extensively throughout Europe, Australia and Asia in the late 2006, from February to April in 2007 toured with Taking Back Sunday and Armor for Sleep.|$|E
