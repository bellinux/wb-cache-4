40|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Hong Kong popular {{music has been}} {{characterized}} by several different configurations of languages. In the 1950 s, Mandarin Chinese popular songs, inherited from pre-communist Shanghai, and Cantonese opera were the two main mass-mediated styles. In the 1960 s and early 1970 s, Mandarin came second to English pop, with Cantonese playing a minor role, while the mid- 1970 s saw the rise of mass-market Cantonese popular music, known as Cantopop and the demise of English and Mandarin as many established <b>stars</b> <b>switched</b> to Cantonese. Recent scholarship has tended to identify Hong Kong popular music with Cantonese, and to understate the historical roles of English and Mandarin. This paper explores alternative ways of representing the history of Hong Kong popular music that are grounded {{in the notion of}} multilingualism, asking whether locally-produced English music can also be "local" through its embedding in the matrix of Hong Kong languages and the hybridity of languages in contact. 15 page(s...|$|R
50|$|In July 1930, the National Council of the French Football Federation voted 128-20 {{in support}} of {{professional}}ism in French football. Red Star {{were among the first}} clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and were founding members of the new league. In the league's inaugural season, Red Star were relegated after finishing in the bottom three of its group. As a result, the club played the following season in the inaugural season of the Division 2. Red Star won the league and returned to the first division for the 1934-35 season. Following the club's return to Division 1, Red <b>Star</b> <b>switched</b> its colours from white to the green and white that exists today.

40|$|We {{present a}} model for the {{anomalous}} X-ray pulsars (AXPs) in which the emission is powered by accretion from a fossil disk, established from matter falling back onto the neutron star following its birth. The time-dependent accretion drives the neutron star towards a ``tracking'' solution in which the rotation period of the star increases slowly, in tandem with the declining accretion rate. For appropriate choices of disk mass, neutron star magnetic field strength and initial spin period, we demonstrate that a rapidly rotating neutron star can be spun down to periods characteristic of AXPs on timescales comparable to the estimated ages of these sources. In other cases, accretion onto the neutron <b>star</b> <b>switches</b> off after a short time, and the star becomes an ordinary radio pulsar. Thus, in our picture, radio pulsars and AXPs are drawn from the same underlying population, in contrast to models involving neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields, which require a new population of stars with very different properties.

40|$|National Science Foundation of China [10225420, 11074208]; DFG [SPP 1369]We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} polymer brushes made of symmetric and asymmetric starlike polymers in good solvent using Langevin dynamics simulations. Two types of populations coexist in such a brush, one of them being made of highly stretched polymers and a second one made of stars that are retracted inside the lower brush regions. Scaling properties of molecular tension, brush layer thickness, and brush density are in reasonable agreement with those of linear chain brushes. The dynamics of <b>stars</b> <b>switching</b> between both the retracted and the stretched states is analyzed, and an exponential scaling with the stretching energy difference is proposed. Most of our results are found in good agreement with recent SCF calculations of Polotsky et al., with one notable exception that their proposed transition from a longest path stretching mode to a uniform stretching mode, the latter being dominant at high densities, has not been supported by our data. Instead, the longest path stretching dominates at high densities {{as a result of}} a surface instability, which has previously been found with brushes made of linear chains at high grafting densities...|$|R

The serious difficulty in this scenario lies in the estimate of the irradiating luminosity required to match the observational data, that is a factor 10 − 50 higher than the quiescent X-ray luminosity of this source. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative scenario, in which the irradiation is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinning neutron <b>star,</b> <b>switched</b> on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), during quiescence.

40|$|We present {{models in}} which the photoevaporation of discs around young stars by an {{external}} ultraviolet source (as computed by Adams et al 2004) is coupled with the internal viscous evolution of the discs. These models are applied {{to the case of}} the Orion Nebula Cluster, where the presence of a strong ultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of circumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In particular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc properties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on a scale of a few A. U., but that only a minority ( 0. 1 M⊙). The ubiquity of discs on a small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the timespan over which the discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field (< 2 Myr). We argue that the discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which self-gravity was important {{at the time that the}} dominant central OB <b>star</b> <b>switched</b> on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be important in these discs at the present time.

40|$|We discuss visual {{observations}} spanning nearly 70 {{years of}} the nearby semiregular variable R Doradus. Using wavelet analysis, we show that the <b>star</b> <b>switches</b> {{back and forth between}} two pulsation modes having periods of 332 days and about 175 days, the latter with much smaller amplitude. Comparison with model calculations suggests that the two modes are the first and third radial overtone, with the physical diameter of the star making fundamental mode pulsation unlikely. The mode changes occur on a timescale of about 1000 d, which is too rapid be related to a change in the overall thermal structure of the star and may instead be related to weak chaos. The Hipparcos distance to R Dor is 62. 4 +/- 2. 8 pc which, taken with its dominant 332 -day period, places it exactly on the period-luminosity relation of Miras in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our results imply first overtone pulsation for all Miras which fall on the P-L relation. We argue that semiregular variables with long periods may largely be a subset of Miras and should be included in studies of Mira behaviour. The semiregulars may contain the immediate evolutionary Mira progenitors, or stars may alternate between periods of semiregular and Mira behaviour.
