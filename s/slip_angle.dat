5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the <b>slip</b> <b>angle,</b> and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
25|$|Drifting is {{a driving}} {{technique}} where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction {{in the rear}} wheels or all tires, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. Car drifting is caused when the rear <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> {{is greater than the}} front <b>slip</b> <b>angle,</b> {{to such an extent that}} often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering).|$|E
25|$|Japan {{was one of}} the birthplaces of {{drifting}} as a sport. It {{was most}} popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races. The famous motorcyclist turned driver, Kunimitsu Takahashi, was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires. The bias ply racing tires of the 1960s1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high <b>slip</b> <b>angle.</b> As professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did the street racers.|$|E
50|$|The ratios {{between the}} <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> {{of the front}} and rear axles (a {{function}} of the <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> of {{the front and rear}} tires respectively) will determine the vehicle's behavior in a given turn. If the ratio of front to rear <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> is greater than 1:1, the vehicle will tend to understeer, while a ratio of less than 1:1 will produce oversteer. Actual instantaneous <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> depend on many factors, including the condition of the road surface, but a vehicle's suspension can be designed to promote specific dynamic characteristics. A principal means of adjusting developed <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> is to alter the relative roll couple (the rate at which weight transfers from the inside to the outside wheel in a turn) front to rear by varying the relative amount of front and rear lateral load transfer. This can be achieved by modifying the height of the roll centers, or by adjusting roll stiffness, either through suspension changes or the addition of an anti-roll bar.|$|R
30|$|We {{introduced}} a positivity constraint to confine the <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> within 180 ° ± 45 °.|$|R
50|$|The second form {{of control}} is {{control over the}} four tires’ slip ratios and <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> (control that is {{effected}} over the respective slip ratios and <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> of the four tires such that the longitudinal and lateral forces produced by {{each of the four}} tires are maximized in a balanced manner). An anti-lock braking system (ABS), a traction control (TCL) system, and steering-system control technologies are exploited for this purpose.|$|R
25|$|The game {{eliminated}} the so-called TrueFeel handling of Grid 2, {{but it did}} not simply return to the handling of Race Driver: Grid. Codemasters used a new, improved version of its previous model, better simulating how grip falls away, when the player approaches the <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> of the tyres. Decision to use the new model, which was tested by Autosport magazine experts and racing drivers, was made on 23 January 2014, which was followed by applying it to each car’s grip falloff graph and re-tuning the vehicles' individual handling characteristics. According to the company, the shift caused the most difficulties in modeling the behaviour of open wheelers and American muscle cars. It also necessitated re-doing the AI benchmarking work, which was well-underway by then using the old model. The game was built using Codemasters’ in-house EGO 3.0 engine.|$|E

5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|R
30|$|In situ {{fixation}} {{of chronic}} SCFE gave satisfactory long-term outcome {{irrespective of the}} treatment method. Corrective femoral osteotomy did not improve the outcome in hips with large <b>slip</b> <b>angles.</b> Acute SCFE had poor outcome. Prophylactic fixation of the contralateral hip is barely necessary.|$|R
50|$|A major {{technical}} {{change for}} 1991 was the introduction by Avon of radial-ply tyres. Compared {{to the previous}} crossply tyres, these could be more consistently manufactured, and made the cars more consistent aerodynamically, but gave the drivers less control at high <b>slip</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In vehicle dynamics, <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> or {{sideslip}} angle is the angle between a rolling wheel's actual {{direction of travel}} and the direction towards which it is pointing (i.e., {{the angle of the}} vector sum of wheel forward velocity [...] and lateral velocity [...] ). For a free-rolling wheel this <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> results in a force parallel to the axle and the component of the force perpendicular to the wheel's direction of travel is the cornering force. This cornering force increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of <b>slip</b> <b>angle,</b> then increases non-linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease.|$|E
50|$|Cornering {{force is}} {{generated}} by tire slip and is proportional to <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> at low slip angles. The rate at which cornering force builds up is described by relaxation length. <b>Slip</b> <b>angle</b> describes the deformation of the tire contact patch, and this deflection of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring.|$|E
5000|$|In vehicle dynamics, side <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> {{is defined}} as the angle made by the {{velocity}} vector to longitudinal axis of the vehicle at the center of gravity in an instantaneous frame. As the lateral acceleration increases during cornering, the side <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> decreases. Thus at very high speed turns and small turning radius, there is a high lateral acceleration and [...] could be a negative value.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, bone-peg epiphysiodesis gave similar good {{long-term}} outcome as {{screw fixation}} in chronic slips. Corrective femoral osteotomy {{did not improve}} the results in chronic slips with large <b>slip</b> <b>angles.</b> The outcome in acute slips was very poor. Because of the good clinical outcome and low rate of OA in the contralateral hip, we think that prophylactic fixation of this hip is barely indicated.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{interlock}} is {{an important}} component in load transfer capacity in the rockbolting system. It is in turn dominated by the rebar bolt profile configuration. To gain a deeper understanding of their interactions, rebar bolt units under axial loading were studied. Two kinds of failure mode have been identified, namely parallel shear and dilational slip failures. Based on some assumptions made, a universal upper limit of <b>slipping</b> <b>angle</b> of dilation <b>slip</b> failure can be found as the complementary angle of the grout material internal friction angle, which is also the minimum value of the bolt rib face angle. This theory can explain similar performances of rock bolts in pull-out tests while their face angles are large. In addition, once the geometric parameters of a rebar bolt profile are provided, more narrow <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> range can be figured out via simple plots. As a result, the grout between the bolt profiles can be recognised as three sections, one works as part of the bolt profile, one carries out shear failure and the bottom part keeps intact...|$|R

5000|$|Slow {{response}} - sideways acceleration {{does not}} start immediately when the steering is turned {{and may not}} stop immediately when it is returned to center. This is partly caused by body roll. Other causes include tires with high <b>slip</b> <b>angle,</b> and yaw and roll angular inertia. Roll angular inertia aggravates body roll by delaying it. Soft tires aggravate yaw angular inertia by waiting for the car to reach their <b>slip</b> <b>angle</b> before turning the car.|$|E

30|$|Standard AP and frog-leg lateral radiographs {{had been}} {{obtained}} {{at the time}} of diagnosis and shortly after surgery. Pre- and postoperative radiographs were available for 72 hips. The <b>slipping</b> <b>angle</b> or Southwick angle (SA) was measured by two orthopedic surgeons independently. Whenever the measurements disagreed by more than 5 °, the angles were measured again. The SA is defined as the difference between the affected side and the normal side in the angle between the line connecting the corners of the femoral epiphysis and a line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the femoral shaft on the frog-leg lateral view. When both sides are affected, 12 ° is subtracted from the <b>angle</b> measured. The <b>slip</b> is then classified as mild when less than 30 °, moderate when 30 °– 50 °, and severe when more than 50 ° <b>slipping</b> <b>angle</b> [9]. Besides the SA angle, the postoperative radiographs were reviewed for adequacy of positioning of the pins/screws, number of pins or screws, and perforation of the joint. At follow-up, AP pelvis and frog-leg lateral or normal lateral X-rays were made. These were scored by two orthopedic surgeons for signs of osteoarthritis using the Kellgren–Lawrence classification [14].|$|R
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work aims to {{simulate}} {{and study the}} flow field around SAFAT- 01 aircraft using numerical solution based on solving Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with K-ω SST turbulent model. The aerodynamics behavior of SAFAT- 01 aircraft developed at SAFAT aviation complex were calculated at different angles of attack and side <b>slip</b> <b>angles.</b> The x,y and z forces and moments were calculated at flight speed 50 m/s and at sea level condition. Lift and drag curves for different angles of attack were plotted. The maximum lift coefficient for SAFAT- 01 was 1. 67 which occurred at angle of attack 16 o and Maximum lift to drag ratio (L/D) was 14 which occurred at α= 3 o, and the zero lift drag coefficient was 0. 0342. Also the yawing moment coefficient was plotted for different side <b>slip</b> <b>angles</b> as well as rolling moment. The longitudinal stability derivatives with respect to angle of attack, speed variation (u), rate of pitch (q) and time rate of change of angle of attack were calculated using obtained CFD results. Concerning lateral stability only side slips derivatives were calculated. To validate this numerical simulation USAF Digital DATCOM is used to analyze this aircraft; a comparison between predicted results for this aircraft and Digital DATCOM indicated that this numerical simulation has high ability for predicting the aerodynamics characteristics...|$|R
