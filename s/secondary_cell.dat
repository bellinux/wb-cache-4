5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E

40|$|The Drosophila male {{accessory}} gland has functions {{similar to}} those of the mammalian prostate gland and the seminal vesicle, and secretes accessory gland proteins into the seminal fluid. Each of the two lobes of the accessory gland is composed of two types of binucleate cell: about 1, 000 main <b>cells</b> and 40 <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> A well-known accessory gland protein, sex peptide, is secreted from the main cells and induces female postmating response to increase progeny production, whereas little is known about physiological significance of the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> The homeodomain transcriptional repressor Defective proventriculus (Dve) is strongly expressed in adult <b>secondary</b> <b>cells,</b> and its mutation resulted in loss of <b>secondary</b> <b>cells,</b> mononucleation of main cells, and reduced size of the accessory gland. dve mutant males had low fecundity despite the presence of sex peptide, and failed to induce the female postmating responses of increased egg laying and reduced sexual receptivity. RNAi-mediated dve knockdown males also had low fecundity with normally binucleate main cells. We provide the first evidence that <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> are crucial for male fecundity, and also that Dve activity is required for survival of the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings provide new insights into a mechanism of fertility...|$|R

25|$|In plants, a <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> {{wall is a}} thicker {{additional}} {{layer of}} cellulose which increases wall rigidity. Additional layers may be formed by lignin in xylem cell walls, or suberin in cork cell walls. These compounds are rigid and waterproof, making the secondary wall stiff. Both wood and bark cells of trees have secondary walls. Other parts of plants such as the leaf stalk may acquire similar reinforcement to resist the strain of physical forces.|$|E
25|$|Wood, in {{the strict}} sense, is yielded by trees, which {{increase}} in diameter by the formation, between the existing wood {{and the inner}} bark, of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots.

40|$|The paired male {{accessory}} glands of Drosophila melanogaster enhance sperm function, stimulate egg production, {{and reduce}} female receptivity to other males by releasing a complex mixture of glycoproteins from a secretory epithelium into seminal fluid. A small subpopulation of about 40 specialized secretory <b>cells,</b> called <b>secondary</b> <b>cells,</b> resides at the distal tip of each gland. We show that these cells grow via mechanisms promoted by mating. If aging males mate repeatedly, {{a subset of}} these cells delaminates from and migrates along the apical surface of the glandular epithelium toward the proximal end of the gland. Remarkably, these secretory cells can transfer to females with sperm during mating. The frequency of this event increases with age, so that more than 50 % of triple-mated, 18 -d-old males transfer <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> to females. Bone morphogenetic protein signaling specifically in <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> is needed to drive all of these processes and {{is required for the}} accessory gland to produce its normal effects on female postmating behavior in multiply mated males. We conclude that <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> are secretory cells with unusual migratory properties that can allow them to be transferred to females, and that these properties are a consequence of signaling that is required for <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> to maintain their normal reproductive functions as males age and mate...|$|R
40|$|In insects, {{products}} of the male reproductive tract are essential for initiating and maintaining the female post-mating response (PMR). The PMR includes changes in egg laying, receptivity to courting males, and sperm storage. In Drosophila, previous studies have determined that the main cells of the male accessory gland produce some of the products required for these processes. However, nothing was known about {{the contribution of the}} glandâ€™s other secretory <b>cell</b> type, the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> In the course of investigating the late functions of the homeotic gene, Abdominal-B (Abd-B), we discovered that Abd-B is specifically expressed in the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> of the Drosophila male accessory gland. Using an Abd-B BAC reporter coupled with a collection of genetic deletions, we discovered an enhancer from the iab- 6 regulatory domain that is responsible for Abd-B expression in these cells and that apparently works independently from the segmentally regulated chromatin domains of the bithorax complex. Removal of this enhancer results in visible morphological defects in the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> We determined that mates of iab- 6 mutant males show defects in long-term egg laying and suppression of receptivity, and that {{products of}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> are influential during sperm competition. Many of these phenotypes seem to be caused by a defect in the storage and gradual release of sex peptide in female mates of iab- 6 mutant males. We also found that Abd-B expression in the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> contributes to glycosylation of at least three accessory gland proteins: ovulin (Acp 26 Aa), CG 1656, and CG 1652.

40|$|Organisms {{pattern and}} specify cell fates with remarkably high {{fidelity}} and robustness, and {{cancer may be}} considered in part to be a disease of fate specification gone awry.
