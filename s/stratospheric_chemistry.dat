40|$|In-situ {{measurements}} of ClO made onboard the Geophysica aircraft on 30 January 2003 in the Arctic afford {{a novel approach}} to constrain the kinetic parameters governing polar <b>stratospheric</b> chlorine <b>chemistry</b> using atmospheric observations. The self-match flight pattern, i. e. sampling individual air masses twice at different zenith angles, was utilized by simulating the evolution of ClO mixing ratios between two 'matching' points using a photochemical model and optimizing the model parameters to fit the observations within a retrieval framework. Our results suggest a ClO/ClOOCl thermal equilibrium constant K-eq a factor of 5 smaller and a ratio J/k(f) a factor of 2 larger than the values based on the JPL recommendations. This concurs with other studies based on observed ClOx partitioning and corroborates that our understanding of <b>stratospheric</b> chlorine <b>chemistry</b> is incomplete, particularly {{in the light of}} the most recent laboratory experiments pointing to a J/k(f) ratio almost an order of magnitude below the JPL recommendation...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{nitrogen}} (NOy) {{plays an}} important role in <b>stratospheric</b> ozone <b>chemistry.</b> Its constitutents NO and NO 2 both catalyze ozone detruction and limit other catalytic ozone depletion cycles as they transform the involved radicals into reservoir species, e. g. chlorine nitrate and nitric acid. While the partitioning within the NOy family may change rapidly, its chemical lifetime is long compared to the time scale of atmospheric transport processes. This also holds for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), whose photochemical destruciton in the middle stratosphere in the tropics is the principle source of NOy. Therefore, a compact anticorrelation is anticipated and frequently found for the two tracers. However, deviations from this corelation can occur due to processes that redistribute the abundance of reactive nitrogen within the stratosphere, e. g. by particle formation, sedimentation and reevaporation. As such processes alter the balance between ozone destructing radicals, they can have substantial in fluence on <b>stratospheric</b> ozone <b>chemistry...</b>|$|R
50|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), {{nitrogen}} trioxide (NO3), and {{chlorine dioxide}} (OClO) play crucial roles in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> and the catalytic cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. SAGE III NO2 measurements {{are important because}} the processes {{that occur in the}} Antarctic winter and spring and give rise to the ozone hole effectively convert NO2 to nitric acid (HNO3). Thus NO2 is an important diagnostic of ozone hole chemistry. Since it is measured during both solar and lunar occultation events, SAGE III observations of NO2 will improve our understanding of the strong diurnal (daily) cycles in stratospheric processes. In addition, SAGE III will make virtually unique measurements of nitrogen trioxide (NO3). Although it is short-lived in the presence of sunlight, NO3 plays {{an active role in the}} chemistry of other reactive nitrogen species such as NO2 and di-nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and, thus, indirectly in ozone chemistry. Since few other measurements of NO3 are available, SAGE III measurements, which are made during lunar occultation (nighttime) events, will provide crucial validation for our current understanding of reactive nitrogen chemistry.|$|E

Uncertainties in theory and observations of polar ozone depletion and limitations {{in the implementation of}} Chemistry and Transport Models (CTMs) are an issue that is often neglected. Here, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>chemistry</b> and denitrification are simulated for the Arctic winter 2009 / 2010. Several sensitivity runs are used to explore the impact of uncertainties in chlorine activation and denitrification on the model results.

Additionally, the impact of changes in reaction rate coefficients, in the particle number density of Polar Stratospheric Clouds, in supersaturation or the extent of denitrification are investigated. Results are compared to satellite measurements of MLS and ACE-FTS and to in-situ measurements onboard the Geophysica airplane during the RECONCILE measurement campaign. It is shown that even large changes in the underlying assumptions have only a relatively small impact on the modeled ozone loss, even though they can cause considerable differences in chemical evolution and denitrification.
