50|$|In a <b>stem</b> <b>family,</b> {{a type of}} {{extended}} family, first presented by Frédéric Le Play, parents will live with one child {{and his or her}} spouse, as well as the children of both, while other children will leave the house or remain in it unmarried. The <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> is sometimes associated with inegalitarian inheritance practices, as in Japan and Korea, but the term has also been used in some contexts to describe a family type where parents live with a married child and his or her spouse and children, but the transfer of land and moveable property is more or less egalitarian, {{as in the case of}} traditional Romania, northeastern Thailand or Mesoamerican indigenous peoples. In these cases, the child who cares for the parents usually receives the house in addition to his or her own share of land and moveable property.|$|E

30|$|China {{has many}} contextual {{variations}} which {{may contribute to}} different understandings of vehicle ownership such as a denser population, more mixed land use [9, 10], better transit coverage [10], more bicycle use, {{a greater percentage of}} <b>stem</b> <b>families</b> (parents with married children), and higher degrees of car pride [11].|$|R
50|$|In these mono-marital <b>stem</b> <b>families,</b> {{the family}} head, {{who had a}} {{dominant}} role in the family, was called trong bey abo (or simply abo).

Sometimes, a younger brother would assume the abo role when the eldest male retired.|$|R
30|$|To draw policy recommendations, {{planning}} {{programs and}} engineering approaches cannot effectively curb car growth, however, they could reshape mode preferences. In addition, {{given the influence}} of income in determining car purchase, authorities may increase the overall cost of driving through proposing new polices, such as license auction, parking pricing, and vehicle tax. Furthermore, smaller household sizes such as core family and DINK family have lower rates of car purchase. To facilitate their mobility and accessibility, a responsive planning approach would provide more small apartments and restricted parking in neighborhoods with greater transit proximity. The sizes of apartments and zoning principles should be adjusted to the locations. Finally, providing safe, pleasant, and efficient alternative modes and routes for children and seniors may derive less car demand in <b>stem</b> <b>families,</b> such as improving pedestrian and bicycle paths. Although indirectly, these socioeconomic factors contribute to higher rates of household car ownership among <b>stem</b> <b>families.</b> A more sustainable transport system needs to be further investigated with contextual variations to develop measurements and tools to link household composition and car ownership.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2006, President Sarkozy {{put into}} effect a law on {{immigration}} based upon the notion of [...] "chosen immigration", which allows immigration into France to a restricted field of employment sectors, notably the hotel and restaurant industries, construction and seasonal employment. The following summer of 2007, Sarkozy amended the law to require the acquisition of the French language as a pre-condition. According to Christophe Bertossi, immigration expert in France's Institut français des relations internationales (IFRI), [...] "there is a dominant trend in the French policy to <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> migration, notably conditioned after the 2007 law by a minimum level of French language tested and by the demonstration that he/she endorses the main French constitutional principles".|$|E
50|$|Hmong {{households}} traditionally {{consist of}} large patrilineal extended families, with the parents, children, and {{wives and children}} of married sons all living under the same roof. Households of over twenty persons are not uncommon, although ten to twelve persons are more likely. Older sons, however, may establish separate households with {{their wives and children}} after achieving economic independence. By the 1990s, a tendency had developed in Laos for households to be smaller and for each son and his wife to establish a separate household when the next son married. Thus, the household tends toward a <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> pattern consisting of parents and unmarried children, plus perhaps one married son. Following this pattern, the youngest son and his wife frequently inherit the parental house; gifts of silver and cattle are made to the other sons at marriage or when they establish a separate residence. In many cases, the new house is physically quite close to the parents' house.|$|E
50|$|The {{survival}} {{and well-being of}} children in India and China is positively influenced {{by the number of}} older siblings of the opposite sex and negatively influenced by the number of older siblings of the same sex. However, definitive celibacy was historically relatively uncommon in India and China, but relatively common in many European societies where inheritance was impartible. The Han Chinese first sons historically married earlier, had lower rates of definitive celibacy and more children (especially males) than their younger brothers. However, they suffered higher mortality rates. This has been attributed to the fact that eldest sons needed to have more children to succeed them as heads and were willing to take more risks and suffer a higher drain of resources to achieve this. The Chinese joint family system had strong inegalitarian traits that made it demographically more akin to a <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> system. According to Emmanuel Todd and others, it be reminiscent of the system of patrilineal primogeniture prevalent during the Longshan culture period and the period of the Three Dynasties.|$|E
30|$|A major {{limitation}} in {{this research}} is that the data are gathered through spatial cluster sampling. The location-based selection bias may result in insufficient variations in home built environment features. Hence, home built environment features are excluded from this study. Secondly, as car purchase policy remained stable in Shanghai during the research period, no policy-related indicators are adjusted {{in this research}}. Another limitation is that <b>stem</b> <b>families</b> are possibly over represented in the sample. The average household size in the sample is larger {{than that of the}} Shanghai average, and bigger households {{are more likely to be}} <b>stem</b> <b>families.</b> However, considering that younger and older respondents have more time available to complete the survey, the sampling methodology still needs to be improved in order to produce more accurate results. Finally, the variable intention of purchasing a car is underreported in the data. As noted, 30  % of households in the sample already had private cars, and they are unlikely to respond with intentions to purchase a second car. This may have caused a bias when estimating the residents’ transportation mode preferences.|$|R

30|$|Vehicle {{ownership}} rate in China remains {{relatively low}} {{compared to that of}} developed countries. However, continual economic growths, relaxed birth control policy, as well as a forthcoming aging society, all contribute to increasing the number of <b>stem</b> <b>families.</b> In addition, non-commuting trips, such as shopping, entertainment, and recreational trips are attached to household composition and represent an undeniable growth trend. The current transport policies in China emphasize the importance of home-based working trips, while ignoring non-commuting trips and unemployed people. This analysis provides evidence that household composition is essential in deciding vehicle ownerships. Therefore, transport policy should focus on household rather than individuals.|$|R
5000|$|As can be {{seen from}} the former examples, {{societies}} based on lineage hierarchy are particularly common in central, east and southeast Asia. Lineage hierarchy was present even in the stem-family systems of Korea, Vietnam and Japan. In Korea, the main house, that of the eldest son, was called the [...] "big house" [...] or superordinate descent group (taejong), while the houses of younger sons were called [...] "small houses" [...] or subordinate descent groups (sojong). It was through the <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> of the eldest son that the main line of descent was traced from generation to generation. Patrilineal primogeniture became prevalent during the time of the Choson dynasty. Even modern businesses are passed down according to male primogeniture in most cases. Discussing patterns of adoption in Korean families, Roger L. and Dawnhee Yim Janelli write in [...] "Ancestor Worship and Korean Society":"When adoption involves the transfer of a son between households headed by brothers, the relative seniority of the brothers usually determines whether an eldest or junior son is selected as the adoptee. younger brothers give their eldest sons to eldest brothers, but eldest brothers give one of their younger sons to younger brothers. This rule, which is common throughout Korea, was violated only twice. In both cases, eldest brothers were given to younger sons. The nonreciprocal transfer of eldest sons to eldest brothers reflects the special status accorded to a primogeniture descendant (chongso: eldest son, eldest son's eldest son, etc.) by those who belong to junior descent lines. Just as an elder brother has a higher status than his younger siblings, so his own eldest son retains some of that status over the younger brothers's sons. Giving eldest sons to senior descent lines, therefore, preserves the relative statuses of siblings based on birthright. One who had enjoyed superior status as an eldest brother before adoption enjoys it as a primogeniture descendant after adoption. Occasional violations of this adoption rule wreak havoc on the relative seniority of descent lines. Violations occur because Korean adoption practices also attempt to preserve the respective property rights of descendants. Since an eldest brother inherits more property, he is usually wealthier than his younger siblings. If he dies without descendants, his younger brother would inherit his larger share of property from their parents and in turn pass it on to his own eldest son. That eldest son, by becoming the adoptive heir of the elder brother, therefore inherits essentially the same property he would have without the adoption".In Korea, chiefdom confederacies where male primogeniture was the rule were a fact of early Korean history since the first millennium BC. The first may have been Old Joseon (also Kochosŏn, Gojoseon), said to be a confederacy of three tribes (Lee et al. 2005: 53).3 'The Hwanug tribe formed an aggregation with adjacent tribes or villages and then subjugated other aggregations…' (ibid.: 54). 'Old Joseon was basically a confederation and could not be easily ruled from the center' (ibid.: 64). Old Joseon's counterpart in South Korea was Jin (also Chin), also described as a loose confederacy. These confederacies ultimately broke apart into their constituent units (geosuguk), which then reformed into new confederacies: Puyŏ (also Buyeo), Koguryŏ (also Goguryeo), Ye, the Three Han (Samhan), and Gaya. These chiefdom confederacies were eclipsed by the consolidation of three of these polities into the states of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla in the first century CE. However even these polities did not really develop centralized systems of territorial administration until the fourth century AD (Lee et al. 2005: 179).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the issue of intergenerational farm {{transfer}}. The farm transfer process is influenced by many factors. The type of farming or farm size is important, but perhaps more so is the type of ownership; business type or family system; family farm or corporate farm, conjugal or <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> system. Such institutional factors including the taxation system, inheritance customs, and the pension system form the farm transfer system. The current farm transfer system in Japan is a <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> system. Japanese agriculture has been struggling to reform such traditional systems. The basic idea should not be the change from the <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> but to expand the range of farm transfer systems to include both the <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> system and new types. One new farm transfer system is farm succession by an unrelated party of the farm family. There are two ways to do this. One is the foundation of a new farm and another is to use the corporate farm system. In general, corporate farms can accept beginning farmers as employees or regular members (shareholders). But most of corporate farms are organized as farmers' groups on the principle of equality. New farmers are required to invest equal amounts of capital and hold farmland to obtain regular membership. In order to overcome these obstacles, a corporate farm has to change from a farmers' group to a company with greater entrepreneurial skills. Policies should encourage corporate farms to change their business plans and organization. On the other hand, policies should try to establish modern corporate farms that can co-exist with traditional ones because creating new systems is easier that transforming old ones...|$|E

30|$|The <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> and {{the nuclear}} family have always been, respectively, the primary and {{traditional}} forms of Chinese intergenerational relationship—after the children are grown, most children form their own core family and leave one child living with parents to form a <b>stem</b> <b>family.</b> These intergenerational forms are relatively stable. In these stable intergenerational forms, adult {{children and their parents}} maintain a strong and stable connection, forming an intergenerational family relationship with Chinese characteristics. However, over the past few decades, the macro environment of the family has changed as a result of China’s enormous political, economic, cultural, social, and demographic changes; the size of the family has shrunk; and the family structure has been reconstructed. This is bound to bring new challenges to traditional family intergenerational relations (Ma Chunhua et al. 2013).|$|E

50|$|In Japan, Korea and Vietnam, {{as well as}} in some {{of those}} European regions where male primogeniture was practiced, parents didn't {{transfer}} their property to the inheriting son at the point of his marriage as among Germans. Instead, the first son remained under his father's authority even after he had married and had had children, and the father remained the nominal head of the family until his death, relinquishing his actual authority slowly and gradually. In Japan, only the inheriting son stayed in the parental household. He could become head of the family any time between his marriage and the death of his predecessor.

40|$|Research on the {{relation}} between family and happiness {{has focused on the}} micro level and considered the effects of an individual’s place in the family system, such as whether or not one is married and exchange of support with kin. Macro level differences in the family system as such have received little attention as yet. In this paper we consider regional differences in family types in Europe and explore {{the relation}}ship with average happiness. Data on dominant family type in regions are taken from Todd (1990), who distinguishes five family types: 1) absolute nuclear, 2) egalitarian nuclear, 3) communitarian, 4) <b>stem</b> <b>family,</b> and 5) incomplete <b>stem</b> <b>family.</b> Data on average happiness in regions are taken from the Eurobarometer surveys. Average happiness appears to be highest in regions where family pattern of ‘absolute nuclear’ prevails and lowest in the regions where ‘egalitarian nuclear’ family dominates. Control for economic prosperity in regions does not change this picture. A possible interpretation of these findings is that freedom adds more to happiness than equality does. It is not true for types of freedom. If horizontal freedom (intergenerational freedom) seems to be important in terms of well-being, the results are much less convincing as far as vertical freedom (intergenerational freedom) is concerned. The findings might have some far reach contribution in the field of family policy...|$|E
30|$|The form of intergenerational {{relationship}} {{is one of}} the most direct and objective dimensions of observing intergenerational family relationships (Bengtson and Roberts 1991). However, in the study of intergenerational relations, classical family modernization theory has had an enduring impact, and the intergenerational relationship form in China often categorized according to the classic division of “extended-stem-unclear” as a basic reference. Scholars have analyzed changes in the proportion of <b>stem</b> <b>family</b> and nuclear family based on sample surveys of typical areas or large population census data, and have taken the changes as a basis for studying the classical family modernization theory.|$|E
30|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the intergenerational relationship in this living arrangement {{and that of the}} <b>stem</b> <b>family.</b> That is, the functional support between generations is not weakened by spatial distance. In case E, whether the parents or adult children are facing difficulties, such as taking children to and from school or the elderly require care because of illness, the other party will come to help without any hesitation. The two families often visit each other, and if the children are too busy to cook, the parents will help with cooking or invite the children to dine together at the parents’ house. Some scholars have called this type of intergenerational living arrangement “temporary stem family” (Yao 2012). It has a similar function to a <b>stem</b> <b>family,</b> but is not exactly the same. Each of the generation has a certain amount of independence. Besides mutual help, each generation has their own independent freedom and space. The elderly in case E told the author that “life became freer after living separately. I can now invite some old friends to our house, which was unthinkable in the past.” It is probably because of such independence, the spatial separation did not create a rift in intergenerational relations; to the contrary, the connection of function and emotion increased. Compared with the intergenerational relationship between two nuclear families that live far apart, the intergenerational relationship between the neighboring families is very different.|$|E
