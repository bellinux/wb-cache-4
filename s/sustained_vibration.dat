40|$|Chatter is the {{self-excited}} vibration that occurs during cutting. The entire {{structure of a}} {{self-excited vibration}} comprises two core mechanisms, i. e., stability limit and <b>sustained</b> <b>vibration</b> with finite amplitude after onset. The latter mechanism remained unnoticed until {{the discovery of the}} multiple regenerative effect (MRE) in 1980. However, its effects have not yet been recognized correctly. This paper summarizes the problems that could be resolved by considering the MRE in the analysis from the theoretical and practical viewpoints. In conventional stability limit analyses, tool traces never intersect; however, after the onset of chatter in an actual system, traces immediately intersect. This results in tool-workpiece separation, chip thickness variation during the separation period, and chip breakage. A solution for equation of motion considering the MRE agrees well with chatter behaviour in actual applications. In addition, the solution yields the phase relationship between the displacement of work motion and the cutting force, although this relationship is not considered in the equation of motion. Further, the relationship between the penetrating cutting speed and the resistive force, confirmed experimentally, is introduced in equation of motion, which verifies the widening of the stability region at low cutting speeds. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{evaluating}} the service life of marine {{structures such as}} risers, one must assess their dynamic response to vortices excitation (vortex-induced vibrations or VIV). At lock-in, i. e. when {{the frequency of the}} shedding of vortices synchronizes with the natural frequency of the structure, the amplitude of vibration of the structure is of the order of its diameter. <b>Sustained</b> <b>vibration</b> of this amplitude causes material fatigue which leads with time to failures. Predicting the flow velocity range for which lock-in occurs is thus of importance. It is also important in cases of flexible structures to predict which mode of vibration will lock-in with the wake. The interest here is in predicting lock-in for rigid and flexible structures like tensioned beams using a linear wake oscillator model: here, lock-in is interpreted as a linear instability caused by the merging of the two natural frequencies of a dynamic system that includes two coupled oscillators, namely the wake and the structure. This instability is also referred as couple mode flutter. It is found that the linear wake oscillator model predicts lock-in range for both elastically supported rigid cylinder and for flexible structures subjected to uniform flows. In particular, the linear approach is able to predict transition from one lock-in mode to another for flexible structures (mode-switching). it is also capable of predicting when more than one mode can lock-in with the wake for a fixed velocity (time sharing) ...|$|E
40|$|Vertically-sided {{offshore}} structures occasionally experience <b>sustained</b> <b>vibration</b> due to drifting ice sheets crushing against them. These vibrations {{may lead to}} problems associated with structural integrity and safety. Traditionally, three regimes of interaction are distinguished: intermittent crushing, frequency lock-in and continuous brittle crushing. These regimes correspond to the dynamic ice-structure interaction at low-, intermediate- and high ice sheet velocities respectively. In this paper the effect of friction at the ice-structure interface on the frequency lock-in regime is studied. This investigation is a follow-up of a comparison between prediction models and full-scale data for ice induced vibrations which {{has been carried out}} in the framework of an Ice Induced Vibrations JIP (IIV JIP). This comparison showed that no simultaneous match could be found for both the structural acceleration of and ice force on cylindrical structures. This raised {{the question of whether or}} not the neglected in the models frictional interaction at the ice-structure interface could be a reason for such an inconsistency. In order to answer this question the interaction at the ice-structure interface is implemented, in a simplified manner, according to the Coulomb friction law in one of the models tested in the framework of the IIV JIP. In this model it is assumed that the three regimes of the dynamic ice-structure interaction can be described based on the distribution of ice strength in the ice sheet. It is concluded that friction alone cannot explain the large inconsistency in case of cylindrical shaped structures. It is suggested that the way the current models translate the available measurement data to input might be worth further investigation. Effects of friction on the range of velocities for which frequency lock-in might occur are expected to be minimal when a fully confined scenario is considered, although an overall increase in loads is predicted. The influence of friction for scenarios with marginal confinement needs further investigation with a more advanced model. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{employing}} a low-mass-damping cylinder {{have been conducted}} to determine the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) response of four suppressors of the flexible-shroud family. The VIV suppressors were inspired {{in the concept of}} the Ventilated Trousers (VT), a flexible shroud composed of a flexible net fitted with three-dimensional bobbins. Reynolds number varied between 5 × 10 ^ 3 and 25 × 10 ^ 3, while reduced velocity varied from 2 to 26. The VIV dynamic response showed that the VT suppressed the peak amplitude of vibration down to 40 % of that of a bare cylinder. Other flexible shrouds also achieved suppression, but not as efficiently. Drag was reduced during the VIV synchronization range, but remained above the value for a bare static cylinder thereafter. Spectral analysis of displacement and lift revealed that, depending on the geometry and distribution of the bobbins, the flexible shroud can develop an unstable behavior, capturing energy from the wake and <b>sustaining</b> <b>vibrations</b> for higher reduced velocities.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the research completed during 2011 for the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project. The research {{is motivated by}} the desire to safely send humans in deep space missions and to keep radiation exposures within permitted limits. To this end current material shielding, developed for low earth orbit missions, is not a viable option due to payload and cost penalties. The active radiation shielding is the path forward for such missions. To achieve active space radiation shielding innovative large lightweight gossamer space structures are used. The goal is to deflect enough positive ions without attracting negatively charged plasma and to investigate if a charged Gossamer structure can perform charge deflections without significant structural instabilities occurring. In this study different innovative configurations are explored to design an optimum active shielding. In addition, to establish technological feasibility experiments are performed with up to 10 kV of membrane charging, and an electron flux source with up to 5 keV of energy and 5 mA of current. While these charge flux energy levels are much less than those encountered in space, the fundamental coupled interaction of charged Gossamer structures with the ambient charge flux can be experimentally investigated. Of interest are, will the EIMS remain inflated during the charge deflections, and are there visible charge flux interactions. Aluminum coated Mylar membrane prototype structures are created to test their inflation capability using electrostatic charging. To simulate the charge flux, a 5 keV electron emitter is utilized. The remaining charge flux {{at the end of the}} test chamber is measured with a Faraday cup mounted on a movable boom. A range of experiments with this electron emitter and detector were performed within a 30 x 60 cm vacuum chamber with vacuum environment capability of 10 - 7 Torr. Experiments are performed with the charge flux aimed at the electrostatically inflated membrane structure (EIMS) in both charged and uncharged configurations. The amount of charge shielding behind and around the EIMS was studied for different combinations of membrane structure voltages and electron energies. Both passive and active shielding were observed, with active shielding capable of deflecting nearly all incoming electrons. The pattern of charge distribution around the structure was studied as well as the stability of the structures in the charge flow. The charge deflection experiments illustrate that the EIMS remain inflated during charge deflection, but will experience small amplitude oscillations. Investigations were performed to determine a potential cause of the vibrations. It is postulated these vibrations are due to the charge flux causing local membrane charge distribution changes. As the membrane structure inflation pressure is changed, the shape responds, and causes the observed <b>sustained</b> <b>vibration.</b> Having identified this phenomenon is important when considering electrostatically inflated membrane structures (EIMS) in a space environment. Additionally, this project included a study of membrane material impacts, specifically the impact of membrane thickness. Extremely thin materials presented new challenges with vacuum preparation techniques and rapid charging. The thinner and lighter membrane materials were successfully inflated using electrostatic forces in a vacuum chamber. However, care must be taken when varying the potentials of such lighter structures as the currents can cause local heating and melting of the very thin membranes. Lastly, a preliminary analysis is performed to study rough order of magnitude power requirements for using EIMS for radiation shielding. The EIMS power requirement becomes increasingly more challenging as the spacecraft voltage is increased. As a result, the emphasis is on the deflection of charges away from the spacecraft rather than totally stopping them. This significantly alleviates the initial power requirements. With modest technological development(s) active shielding is emerging to be a viable option...|$|E

Most geothermal production wells are currently drilled with tungsten-carbide-insert roller-cone bits. PDC bits have significantly improved penetration rates and bit life beyond roller-cone bits in {{the oil and gas industry}} where soft to medium-hard rock types are encountered. If PDC bits could be used to double current penetration rates in hard rock geothermal well-drilling costs could be reduced by 15 percent or more. PDC bits exhibit reasonable life in hard-rock wear testing using the relatively rigid setups typical of laboratory testing. Unfortunately, field experience indicates otherwise. The prevailing mode of failure encountered by PDC bits returning from hard-rock formations in the field is catastrophic, presumably due to impact loading. These failures usually occur in advance of any appreciable wear that might dictate cutter replacement. Self-induced bit vibration, or ''chatter'', is one of the mechanisms that may be responsible for impact damage to PDC cutters in hard-rock drilling. Chatter is more severe in hard-rock formations since they induce significant dynamic loading on the cutter elements. Chatter is a phenomenon whereby the drillstring becomes dynamically unstable and excessive <b>sustained</b> <b>vibrations</b> occur. Unlike forced vibration, the force (i. e., weight on bit) that drives self-induced vibration is coupled with the response it produces. Many of the chatter principles derived in the machine tool industry are applicable to drilling. It is a simple matter to make changes to a machine tool to study the chatter phenomenon. This is not the case with drilling. Chatter occurs in field drilling due to the flexibility of the drillstring. Hence, laboratory setups must be made compliant to observe chatter...|$|R

40|$|When {{a pair of}} tandem {{cylinders}} is {{immersed in}} a flow the downstream cylinder can be excited into wake-induced vibrations (WIV) due to the interaction with vortices coming from the upstream cylinder. Assi, Bearman & Meneghini (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 661, 2010, pp. 365 – 401) concluded that the WIV excitation mechanism has its origin in the unsteady vortex–structure interaction encountered by the cylinder as it oscillates across the wake. In the present paper we investigate how the cylinder responds to that excitation, characterising the amplitude and frequency of response and its dependency on other parameters of the system. We introduce the concept of wake stiffness, a fluid dynamic effect that can be associated, to a first approximation, with a linear spring with stiffness proportional to Re and to the steady lift force occurring for staggered cylinders. By a series of experiments with a cylinder mounted on a base without springs we verify that such wake stiffness is not only strong enough to sustain oscillatory motion, but can also dominate over the structural stiffness of the system.

The comparison was done for the two hypotheses, namely: those of Timoshenko and Kirchhoff-Love. The calculation was performed under the following assumptions: all Poisson's ratios of orthotropic material were taken to be zero; the principal axes of anisotropy coincide with the lines of curvature, the coefficients of mutual influence of forces per unit length and bending moments were taken to be zero, which is valid for sufficiently thin shells. Analysis of the phase velocity of the cylindrical shell has shown that at low frequencies of traveling wave Timoshenko’s hypothesis gives an infinite value of the phase velocity. However, with increasing frequency of the traveling wave phase velocities obtained with different kinematic hypotheses, in the limit approach each other.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of string instruments was covered {{earlier in this}} course. However, {{a discussion of the}} bowing mechanism was delayed because of its inherent non-linearity. As we’ll see here, there is much similarity between model approximations for the clarinet reed and the bowed string mechanism. 1. 1 The String Model • As previously discussed, wave propagation along a string of finite length can be efficiently and accurately modeled with digital waveguide techniques. • The “nut ” is assumed ideally rigid, resulting in a reflection coefficient of- 1 for displacement or velocity wave components. • The bridge is assumed to have a finite impedance, so that some energy is transferred from the string to the instrument body. • Losses along the string cause the string energy to decay (in the absence of a driving mechanism). The losses can be commuted and implemented at discrete positions along the distrubuted string model. • The effects of dispersion resulting from string stiffness are less important in bowed string instruments because a driven system is forced to vibrate periodically. However, the natural inharmonicity of the strings will “color ” the resulting harmonic sound spectrum. 1. 2 The Bowing Mechanism • Under normal, ideal bowing conditions, the bow and string interaction is referred to as a “stick-slip” mechanism: During the greater part of each vibration, the string is “stuck ” to the bow and is carried with it in its motion. Then the string suddenly detaches itself and moves rapidly backward until it is caught again by the moving bow. • The beginning and end of the slipping are triggered by the arrival of the propagating bend or “kink”. • The string’s vertical motion at any one point is given by a sawtooth pattern. • The round-trip time depends only on the string length and the wave velocity. • This mechanism allows the player to add energy to the string and to <b>sustain</b> its <b>vibrations.</b> • Bowing near the string end requires greater force and produces a louder, brighter sound than bowing farther from the end. • The amplitude of vibration can be increased either by increasing the bow speed or by bowing closer to the bridge...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to Pb toxicity, {{there are other}} problems with SnPb solders. In automotive applications, where solder joints are subjected to thermal cycles, severe <b>vibrations,</b> <b>sustained</b> temperatures up to 150 degrees C and peak temperatures of 180 degrees C, the critical failure mode of eutectic SnPb solder in assemblies is bump fatigue. For flip chip technology, induced thermal stresses and strains in solder joints are very hazardous. This paper presents a flip chip process based on electroless Ni/Au bumping and stencil printing of solder paste on wafers. Chemical nickel plating combined with solder printing is a very flexible and cost effective bumping method. The basic process steps and key aspects of this technology are described in detail. Experimental results for an ultra fine pitch printing technique on wafers are shown, and reflowed solder bumps are characterized for uniformity and strength. In comparison to eutectic SnPb, SnBiCu, SnAg, SnCu, and AuSn solder alloys are selected and investigated. The alloys are compared for flip chip technology applicability, microstructure and phase compositions are presented. Microstructure coarsening and phase growth after thermal aging are also investigated. In order to investigate substrate material CTE effects on reliability, flip chip assembly was performed on low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) and FR- 4 substrates. The flip chip joint quality was investigated by metallurgical cross sections and electrical and mechanical measurements. Finally, the reliability results of these joints after thermal cycling with and without underfill on both types of substrate materials are presented...|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{perception}} adapts {{to diverse}} environment. Although {{studies in the}} last few decades have started to address the question of how sensory systems transduce signals, how these systems cross-modulated is largely unknown. In this thesis, I study mechanosensation in the C. elegans touch receptor neurons (TRNs) to understand how sensory systems are modulated and adapt to the environment. I find that the touch sensitivity in the TRNs is modulated by both mechanical and non-mechanical factors. The mechanical factors are transduced directly by a secondary mechanosensory system in the TRNs, and the non-mechanical factors are detected by other neurons and relayed to the TRNs by neuropeptides. Both pathways converge through a common mechanism to regulate the surface expression of the MEC- 4 mechanotransduction channels, which are needed for sensing touch. I then explore the consequences of modulation, and show that modulation by mechanical and non-mechanical factors adjusts the balance between the sensitivity to strong mechanical stimuli that predict dangers and sensitivity to weak stimuli that are usually not associated with danger. Such a balance maintains sensitivity to biologically-relevant mechanical stimuli while reducing unnecessary responses to weak stimuli, thus increasing the ability to survive under different conditions. I used neuronal-enhanced RNAi and mosaic analysis to discover two convergent signaling pathways, the integrin/focal adhesion signaling and insulin signaling, that modulate anterior touch sensitivity. Additional genes and pathways are also needed for optimal touch sensitivity in the TRNs, including the RAS/MAPK pathway, Rho-GTPases, cytoskeleton genes, and 43 other genes that cause lethality when mutated. The integrins/focal adhesion proteins act cell-autonomously in the TRNs to detect the mechanical environment. The focal adhesion proteins modulate force sensitivity and subsequent calcium signaling, and they are needed for long-term sensitization of touch sensitivity in response to <b>sustained</b> background <b>vibration.</b> Such sensitization maintains normal touch sensitivity under background vibration by partially counteracting the effect of habituation. This sensitization does not require the MEC- 4 /MEC- 10 transduction channel, suggesting that the integrins may act as secondary force sensors. Insulin signaling, however, responds to non-mechanical signals that reduce touch sensitivity by decreasing the expression of insulin-like neuromodulators, including INS- 10 and INS- 22. The reduced touch sensitivity facilitates the completion of other tasks such as chemotaxis under background mechanical stimuli, thus increasing the chance of survival by escaping stressful conditions. Both insulin signaling and integrin signaling converge on AKT- 1 and DAF- 16, which modulate touch sensitivity by regulating the transcription of mfb- 1, an E 3 ubiquitin ligase expressed in the TRNs. MFB- 1 regulates the amount of MEC- 4 channel on the plasma membrane, thus modulating touch sensitivity. Together, these results describe an integrated pathway that transduces both mechanical and non-mechanical signals to modulate touch sensitivity through a common mechanism. These modulation mechanisms maintain optimal sensitivity to mechanical stimuli while avoiding unnecessary responses...|$|R
40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to hand-arm vibration {{through the use}} of vibrating hand tools can result {{in the development of the}} disorder known as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS; (1, 3)). One of the hallmark symptoms of HAVS is cold-induced peripheral vasospasms that result in finger blanching (4). Although the vascular and neural pathology associated with vasospasms has been described, little is known about cellular mechanisms leading to this damage (4). To understand how vibration may alter vascular and neural physiology and anatomy, rats were exposed to a single bout of tail vibration and the molecular responses of neural and vascular tissues were measured to determine if there are immediate or <b>sustained</b> affects of <b>vibration</b> that may underlie longer term changes in physiology. Methods Experiment 1. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 32, 6 weeks of age) were housed in AAALAC accredited facilities. All procedures were approved by the NIOSH Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with the CDC guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. Vibration exposures were performed by restraining rats in Broome-style restrainers, and securing their tails to a vibration platform using 6 mm wide straps that were placed over the tail every 3 cm. Restraint control rats were treated in the same manner, except that the tail platform was mounted on isolation blocks and not on a shaker. The vibration exposure was 125 Hz, 49 m/s 2, for 4 h. Rats were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) 1 h or 24 hours after the exposure. RTqPCR was used to measure transcript levels for endothelin 1 (ET- 1), the 3 forms of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) NOS- 1, NOS- 2, NOS- 3 and norepinephrine receptor subtypes 1 D, 2 A, 2 C, in artery tissue, and to measure calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nitric oxide synthase- 1 (NOS- 1) in ventral nerves. Data were analyzed using 2 -way ANOVAs. Experiment 2. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 24, 6 weeks of age) were maintained as described above. Animals were exposed to a single bout of restraint or vibration. Another group of animals served as cage controls. All animals were euthanized 24 h after the exposure, and tail arteries were isolated and frozen. Reactive oxygen species ROS) were measured using electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). Arteries were homogenized over ice in 1 ml of PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail, using a tissue tearer (Biospecs Products Inc. Racine, WI USA). The sample was split into two 0. 5 ml samples. One set had PBS and the spin label hydroxyl-TEMPO [0. 1 mM] added while the other set had hydroxyl-TEMPO [1. 0 mM] plus the specific hydroxyl radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), added to confirm the presence of the hydroxyl radical. Samples were vortexed and then placed in a flat cell for ESR analysis. The ESR spectrometer settings were: receiver gain, 6. 32 x 102; time constant, 0. 02 s; modulation amplitude, 1. 0 G; scan time, 20 sec; magnetic field, 3490 21 100 G (2).
