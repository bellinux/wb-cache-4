50|$|The fourth {{cranial nerve}} innervates the <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> for each eye. The <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> {{is one of}} the six extraocular muscles that allow {{movement}} of eye. Specifically, the <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> primarily intorts the eye (such that the top of the eye rolls toward the nose), with secondary actions of depression (downgaze) and abduction (looking away from the nose). When this muscle’s function is diminished due to a fourth cranial nerve (CN IV) palsy, the affected eye will extort, deviate upward (hypertropia), and, to a smaller extent, drift inward.|$|E

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{pattern of}} dissociated eye movements {{was observed in}} {{a large proportion of}} our patients with a variety of craniosynostosis syndromes. These anomalies simulate overaction of the inferior oblique and underaction of the <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> which, however, cannot fully explain the abnormalities. In a number of cases, excyclorotation of the muscle cone was observed, with the upper pole of the eye tilted away from the midline. It is postulated that such excyclorotation of the eyes will lead to dissociated eye movements which can be explained on physiological grounds according to Hering's law.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} investigation into {{the location of the}} motoneurons innervating the extra-ocular muscles of the rat. Injections of horseradish peroxidase, bisbenzimide, propidium iodide and DAPI-primuline were made either in one or simultaneously in two muscles. Unlike those of the cat, rabbit and monkey, the motoneurons which make up the oculomotor nucleus of the rat are not arranged in spatially separate subgroups belonging each to its corresponding extra-ocular muscle, but instead allow a high degree of superposition among the motor pools which they compose. The motoneurons innervating the lateral rectus and inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> are all homolateral; those of the medial and inferior rectus muscles are mainly homolateral with a few contralateral exceptions; and those of the superior rectus, levator palpebrae and <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> are mainly contralateral with a small minority of homolateral exceptions. As well as from the main motor pools with which they are associated, the medial rectus, inferior rectus, superior rectus, levator palpebrae, <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> and lateral rectus muscles all receive innervation from motoneurons lying among the fibres of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis.

The present experiments {{were performed to}} verify these findings and investigate {{the nature of this}} association. We presented subjects with a dichoptic image of concentric circles in which a step in vertical disparity of 1 deg was introduced. After 4 sec the disparity was eliminated. Eye movements were measured with scierai coils. We confirmed Enright's findings in that a left-over right vertical vergence was associated with levo-cycloversion (upper poles towards left shoulder) and vice versa. The size of the cycloversion and the vertical vergence were in the same range. In addition we found that part of the cycloversion response was {{in the form of a}} torsional nystagmus and that the relative contribution of the left and right eyes was independent of the horizontal gaze angle. These additional findings are in conflict with the hypothesis, offered by Enright, that the association is caused by a bilateral activity of the <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the clinical {{features of a}} Caucasian female patient {{with a history of}} treated gastrointestinal Whipple's disease (WD) who developed new-onset diplopia, with a description of the histopathological features of the extraocular muscle biopsies. Methods: A previously fit 38 -year-old Caucasian female presented with acute-onset diplopia after being on a sustained medication regime for biopsy-proven gastrointestinal WD. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of her orbits with gadolinium revealed diffuse enhancement of the bellies of the extraocular muscles bilaterally, particularly the medial rectus, superior rectus, and <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles,</b> consistent with an infiltrative myositis. She underwent unilateral extraocular muscle biopsies. Results: The extraocular muscle biopsies contained macrophages between the muscle fibres. These contained periodic acid-Schiff-positive cytoplasmic granules. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody raised to Tropheryma whipplei showed positive staining of the same macrophages. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of effete T. whipplei cell membranes in lysosomes. Conclusion: This case describes bilateral WD-associated extraocular muscle myositis. The exact mechanism for this unusual presentation is unclear, but both a WD-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and treatment failure are possibilities, with a good response observed to antibiotic therapy and adjunctive corticosteroids...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of miniature end-plate currents (m. e. p. c. s) was {{studied in the}} <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> and interhyoideus <b>muscles</b> of Xenopus laevis. An analysis of m. e. p. c. decays shows that each muscle possesses its own characteristic programme of end-plate current development. In the <b>superior</b> <b>oblique,</b> the exponential decay constants of m. e. p. c. s were initially about 3 ms; they declined within half a day to 1 ms and remained at that value for six weeks. They then gradually became longer, reaching a mean value of 1. 7 ms at late metamorphosis. In the interhyoideus, m. e. p. c. decay constants were initially about 6 ms. They declined in less than one day to a mean value of 2. 6 ms and remained there for the following seven weeks. Upon completion of metamorphosis, the decay constants underwent a further decrease to about 1 ms. In both muscles, the changes in m. e. p. c. decays were correlated with developmental changes in muscle contraction speeds, as measured by maximum twitch frequencies.

The <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> is innervated by cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve). Incyclotorsion may {{also be used to}} describe one part of the condition of the eye when a patient has an oculomotor nerve palsy. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) supplies the inferior oblique muscle (along with four other eye muscles - superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus and the striated muscle of levator palpebrae superioris), and when this muscle is non-functional (as in oculomotor palsy) the eye incyclotorts; i.e. twists/rotates inward.|$|E
40|$|The motor nuclei of the {{hindbrain}} can {{be divided}} into those that supply striated ("voluntary") muscle fibers and those which supply smooth muscle fibers or secretory glands. The latter, the general visceral efferent nuclei, comprise the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the salivatory nuclei. The brainstem nuclei which supply striated muscle {{can be divided}} into those that supply muscles which are believed to have arisen from the early vertebrate branchial (gill) arch system and those which supply muscles of purely somatic origin. The phox 2 b gene is expressed in the branchial motoneurons during development, and not in somatic motoneuorons. The expression of phox 2 b in the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei is something of a surprise, since they are traditionally classified with the somatic motor nuclei. Motor nuclei in the brainstem and spinal cord are often subdivided into motor neuron clusters, each of which supplies a different muscle or muscle group. This {{is referred to as the}} somatotopic or musculotopic arrangement of motor neurons. The facial nucleus is an outstanding example of musculotopic organization. Almost all of the branchial and somatic motor neurons supply muscles in the ipsilateral side of the head; the major exceptions are the oculomotor neurons which supply the contralateral superior rectus and the trochlear motor neurons which supply the <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> of the eye...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Clinical data {{indicate}} that extraocular muscles have different susceptibilities for some orbital immune disorders depending on their anatomic location. The resident immunocompetent cells may be important mediators in the local pathogenesis of such disorders so the distribution of these cells was studied in extraocular muscles obtained from normal human donors. For comparison skeletal muscles were studied. METHODS: The cell distributions were analyzed quantitatively in cryostat cross-sections subjected to a two-step immunoperoxidase method using monoclonal antibodies against T cells, B cells, macrophages and several other markers for cell differentiation or activation. The macrophage distribution was analyzed in more detail using on-line semiautomatic image analysis equipment (VIDAS, Kontron, Elektronik GmbH, Eching, Germany). RESULTS: Extraocular muscles contain numerous macrophages, fewer human leukocyte antigenD-related (HLA-DR) positive cells and T cells, whereas B cells are absent. The numeric density of all cell types, and macrophages in particular, is much higher in extraocular muscles than in skeletal muscles. In extraocular muscles the majority of T cells are positive for the CD 8 antigen (suppressor/cytotoxic), in skeletal muscle CD 4 positive T cells (helper) predominate. CONCLUSIONS: Extraocular muscles contain many more CD 8 -positive cells and macrophages per square millimeter than skeletal muscles. Of all the cell types studied, only the macrophage distribution differs significantly among the normal extraocular muscles: the medial and inferior recti muscles contain about twice as many macrophages as the lateral rectus and <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> Their mean sizes (area) or shape distributions however, appear to be simila...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{wanted to}} {{examine the effect of}} graded {{recession}} and anteriorization of the inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> on patients suffering from unilateral <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> palsy. Methods: Inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> graded recession and anteriorization were performed on twenty-two patients (22 eyes) with unilateral <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> palsy. The recession and anteriorization were matched to the degree of inferior oblique overaction and hypertropia. The inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> was attached 4 mm posterior to the temporal border of the inferior rectus muscle in six eyes, 3 mm posterior in five eyes, 2 mm posterior in five eyes, 1 mm posterior in five eyes, and parallel to the temporal border in one eye. Results: The average angle of vertical deviation prior to surgery was 11. 3 ± 3. 9 prism diopters (PD). The total average correction in the angle of vertical deviation after surgery was 10. 8 ± 3. 8 PD. In the parallel group, the average reduction was 14 PD.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the subjective and objective cyclodeviational changes following different weakening procedures on <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> Design: Comparative case series Materials and Methods: In a prospective institution based study, 16 cases of A pattern horizontal strabismus having <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> overaction were randomized to <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> weakening procedures: either silicon expander or translational-recession. Similarly, 20 cases of V pattern horizontal strabismus with inferior oblique overaction were randomized for inferior oblique weakening procedures: either 10 mm Fink&#x 2032;s recession or modified Elliot and Nankin&#x 2032;s anteropositioning. Cyclodeviation was assessed subjectively with the synoptophore and objectively using the fundus photograph before surgery and 3 months postoperatively.

Results: The difference between the extorsional change induced by the two <b>superior</b> <b>oblique</b> procedures, silicone expander (- 6 &#x 00 B 0;) and translational recession (- 11. 3 &#x 00 B 0;), was statistically significant (P= 0. 001). Translational recession caused more extorsional change (ISE= 296 &#x 0025;) than silicone expander surgery (ISE= 107 &#x 0025;). The two inferior oblique weakening procedures, Fink&#x 2032;s recession (&#x 002 B; 2. 5 &#x 00 B 0;) and modified Elliot and Nankin&#x 2032;s anteropositioning (&#x 002 B; 4. 7 &#x 00 B 0;) produced equitable amount of intorsional shift with no statistical difference (P= 0. 93).
