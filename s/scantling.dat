The design incorporated a diagonal <b>scantling</b> (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

[...] "I suppose you've come to talk to Mrs. McJimsey about the work you've got to do here to make this house fit to live in. But there ain't no Mrs. McJimsey.

500|$|Regulations {{regarding}} {{hatch covers}} have evolved since the investigation following {{the loss of}} the [...] The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that hatch covers be able to withstand load of 1.74tons/m2 due to sea water, and a minimum <b>scantling</b> of 6mm for the tops of the hatch covers. The International Association of Classification Societies then increased this strength standard by creating its Unified Requirement S21 in 1998. [...] This standard requires that the pressure due to sea water be calculated as a function of freeboard and speed, especially for hatch covers located on the forward portion of the ship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1835, the Buffalo Presbytery {{voted to}} {{establish}} a second church {{in addition to the}} First Presbyterian Church in Buffalo. Known as the Pearl Street Presbyterian Church, it began with 33 members who had transferred from First Church, and Lord was appointed as its first minister. Upon arrival, he described the new church building: [...] "The edifice was rudely constructed of hemlock boards doubled upon <b>scantling,</b> and filled in with tan-bark. It cost about three hundred dollars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock IV {{was never}} raced again, but the {{universal}} rule drew significant appeal, {{especially in the}} small M-Class. Believing that the new rule offered a serious opportunity for the British to take the Cup, Lipton challenged for the fifth and last time at age 79, in 1929. The J-Class was chosen for the contest, to which were added Lloyds' A1 <b>scantling</b> rules {{in order to ensure}} that the yachts would be seaworthy and evenly matched, given the Deed of Gift requirement for yachts to sail to the match on their [...] "own bottom." [...] The waterline length was set between [...] and , and there would be no time allowance. Novel rigging technology now permitted the Bermuda rig to replace the gaff rig. Nicholson was chosen to design challenger Shamrock V, and despite the Wall Street Crash, four NYYC syndicates responded to the threat and built a cup contender each. The venue was moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where, the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company's new naval architect Starling Burgess used his success in the M-Class and his experience as a wartime plane designer to build the Vanderbilt syndicate's defender Enterprise, the smallest J-Class. Meanwhile, Herreshoff's son, Lewis Francis Herreshoff, designed a radical boat: The Whirlwind, despite being the most advanced boat with her double-ended [...] "canoe" [...] build and electronic instruments, maneuvered too clumsily. The old 75-footers Resolute and Vanitie were rebuilt and converted to the J-Class to serve as trial horses. The Enterprises skipper Harold Vanderbilt won the selection trials with great difficulty. When Shamrock V was revealed, she was an outdated wooden boat with a wooden mast and performed poorly to windward. Enterprise was then fitted with the World's first duralumin mast, very lightweight at , and beat her opponent soundly.|$|E
60|$|Doctor Wicker {{came to see}} Mrs. Himes in the {{afternoon}} of the day he had promised to come, and early in the autumn they were married. Since Asaph <b>Scantle</b> had married and settled he had not seen his sister nor spoken to her; but he determined that on so joyful an occasion as this he would show no resentment. So he attended the wedding in the village church dressed in the suit of clothes which had belonged to the late Mr. Himes.|$|R
60|$|The other man, Asaph <b>Scantle,</b> {{was of a}} {{different}} type. He was {{a little older than}} his companion, but if his hair were gray, it did not show very much, as his rather long locks were of a sandy hue and his full face was clean shaven, at least on Wednesdays and Sundays. He was tall, round-shouldered, and his clothes were not good, possessing very evident claims to a position on the retired list. His pipe consisted of a common clay bowl with a long reed stem.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Architecture== It {{is located}} {{opposite}} St Senara's Church and was supposedly originally built in 1271 {{to house the}} masons building the church. There is some disagreement {{about the age of}} the building as English Heritage believes it was probably built around the early 18th century and extended in the 19th and 20th centuries. [...] "The building is built of granite rubble with granite moorstone dressings. Grouted or slurried <b>scantle</b> slate roofs. Dressed granite stacks over the original gable ends." [...] It originally had a two-room plan with a larger hall/kitchen to the right and a parlour over lower ground to the left. There may have been an unheated middle room as there is a small blocked window {{to the right of the}} doorway. The two rooms have been consolidated into one and the building was extended in the 19th century to the left at right angles to the front.|$|R
5000|$|The first written {{evidence}} of worked serpentine is from 1828 when a Mr Drew of Penzance, who was repairing the Lizard Lighthouse, carved serpentine {{in his spare}} time. It is likely that he learnt it from a long established local tradition. Serpentine had been used locally for dwellings, farm buildings, stiles, etc., and to build several church towers such as at Mullion and Landewednack. A tour of the Penzance serpentine works, in 1846, by Prince Albert and the royal family, resulted in an order for mantelpieces and pedestals for Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Interest in serpentine products continued to increase following The Great Exhibition of 1851 which was visited by six million people and showcased products {{from all of the}} world. The Lizard Serpentine Company built a factory at Poltesco in 1855 and later increased the buildings to include a showroom, warehouse and offices. The walls were of snecked serpentine blocks and the roof had clay ridge tiles and a <b>scantle</b> slate roof. The company had a showroom on the The Strand, London where there was a 7' 6" [...] tall vase on display. Stone came from local quarries by cart and the finished stoneware was ferried in flat-bottomed barges to schooners offshore. The company was wound-up in 1870 and re-launched as the Poltesco Marble Company.|$|R

60|$|At the word, the men made a {{simultaneous}} effort; and they raised {{the upper part}} of the bent from the timber on which it lay.

60|$|It was a {{peaceful}} autumn day. The gilding of the Indian summer mellowed the pastures far and wide. The russet woods stood ripe to be stripped, but were yet full of leaf. The purple of heath-bloom, faded but not withered, tinged the hills. The beck wandered {{down to the}} Hollow, through a silent district; no wind followed its course or haunted its woody borders. Fieldhead gardens bore the seal of gentle decay. On the walks, swept that morning, yellow leaves had fluttered down again. Its time of flowers, and even of fruits, was over; but a <b>scantling</b> of apples enriched the trees. Only a blossom here and there expanded pale and delicate amidst a knot of faded leaves.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{there is}} one thing worse than sage unadulterated, and that is a prairie city. We stopped at Pasco Junction, and a man {{told me that it was}} the Queen City of the Prairie. I wish Americans didn't tell such useless lies. I counted {{fourteen}} or fifteen frame-houses, and a portion of a road that showed like a bruise on the untouched surface of the blue sage, running away and away up to the setting sun. The sailor sleeps with a half-inch plank between himself and death. He is at home beside the handful of people who curl themselves up o' nights with nothing but a frail <b>scantling,</b> almost as thin as a blanket, to shut out the unmeasurable loneliness of the sage.|$|E

The next moment a hail reached me from the boat; and bursting through the bushes and the rising sea-fowl, I said farewell (I trust for ever) to that desert isle.|$|E

I, who had looked upon cruel sights in my day, was turning {{away with a}} kind of sickening when I saw the slim young man dodge the rush. He did more. With two strides of his long legs he reached the fence, ripped off the topmost rail, and his huge antagonist, having changed his {{direction}} and coming at him with a bellow, was met with the point of a <b>scantling</b> in the pit of his stomach, and Mr. Gibson fell heavily to the ground.

The fallow came on with such a bold face, it was a pleasure to look on him. He was dressed all in white, to signify harmlessness and innocence. The thing was done on a scaffold at Westminster--most likely yours will be at the Charing. There were the Sheriffs and the Marshal's men, and what not--the executioner, with his cleaver and mallet, and his man, with a pan of hot charcoal, and the irons for cautery. He was a dexterous fallow that Derrick. This man Gregory is not fit to jipper a joint with him; it might be worth your lordship's while to have the loon sent to a barber-surgeon's, to learn some needful <b>scantling</b> of anatomy--it may be for the benefit of yourself and other unhappy sufferers, and also a kindness to Gregory." ...|$|E
60|$|Minor artists {{had worked}} with Kano the magnificent. These {{had been allowed to}} lay brush upon panels of wood in the outer verandahs, and very {{faithfully}} had they toiled. It was not till the guide called my attention to them that I discovered scores of sketches in monochrome low down on the verandah doors. An iris broken by the fall of a branch torn off by a surly ape; a bamboo spray bowed before the wind that was ruffling a lake; a warrior of the past ambushing his enemy in a thicket, hand on sword, and mouth gathered into puckers of intensest concentration, were among the many notes that met my eye. How long, think you, would a sepia-drawing stand without defacement in the midst of our civilisation were it put on the bottom panel of a door, or the <b>scantling</b> of a kitchen passage?

They treated their people well--as people don't get treated nowadays, and they were awfully proud of their ships. Nothing ever {{happened}} to them. This last one, the Apse Family, was {{to be like the}} others, only she was to be still stronger, still safer, still more roomy and comfortable. I believe they meant her to last for ever. They had her built composite--iron, teak-wood, and greenheart, and her <b>scantling</b> was something fabulous. If ever an order was given for a ship in a spirit of pride this one was. Everything of the best. The commodore captain of the employ was to command her, and they planned the accommodation for him like a house on shore under a big, tall poop that went nearly to the mainmast. No wonder Mrs. Colchester wouldn't let the old man give her up. Why, it was the best home she ever had in all her married days. She had a nerve, that woman.|$|E
60|$|What strange beings we are! Since we have {{a portion}} of {{conscious}} existence, equally capable of enjoying pleasure, happiness, and rapture, or of suffering pain, wretchedness, and misery, it is surely worthy of an inquiry, whether there be not {{such a thing as}} a science of life; whether method, economy, and fertility of expedients, be not applicable to enjoyment; and whether there be not a want of dexterity in pleasure, which renders our little <b>scantling</b> of happiness still less; and a profuseness, an intoxication in bliss, which leads to satiety, disgust, and self-abhorrence. There is not a doubt but that health, talents, character, decent competency, respectable friends, are real substantial blessings; and yet do we not daily see those who enjoy many or all of these good things, contrive, notwithstanding, to be as unhappy as others to whose lot few of them have fallen? I believe one great source of this mistake or misconduct is owing to a certain stimulus, with us called ambition, which goads us up the hill of life, not as we ascend other eminences; for the laudable curiosity of viewing an extended landscape, but rather for the dishonest pride of looking down on others of our fellow-creatures, seemingly diminutive in humbler stations, etc., etc.|$|E
60|$|But {{since our}} {{voluntary}} actions carry {{not all the}} happiness and misery that depend on them along with them in their present performance, but are the precedent causes of good and evil, which they draw after them, and bring upon us, when they themselves are past and cease to be; our desires look beyond our present enjoyments, and carry the mind out to ABSENT GOOD, according to the necessity which we think there is of it, to the making or increase of our happiness. It is our opinion of such a necessity that gives it its attraction: without that, we are not moved by absent good. For, in this narrow <b>scantling</b> of capacity which we are accustomed to and sensible of here, wherein we enjoy but one pleasure at once, which, when all uneasiness is away, is, whilst it lasts, sufficient to make us think ourselves happy, it is not all remote and even apparent good that affects us. Because the indolency and enjoyment we have, sufficing for our present happiness, we desire not to venture the change; since we judge that we are happy already, being content, and that is enough. For who is content is happy. But as soon as any new uneasiness comes in, this happiness is disturbed, and we are set afresh on work {{in the pursuit of}} happiness.|$|E
6000|$|As a {{porch to}} the great edifice stands Part first, {{entitled}} Wallenstein's Camp, a piece in one act. It paints, with much humour and graphical felicity, the manners of that rude tumultuous host which Wallenstein presided over, and had made the engine of his ambitious schemes. Schiller's early experience of a military life seems now to have stood him in good stead; his soldiers are delineated with the distinctness of actual observation; in rugged sharpness of feature, they sometimes remind us of Smollett's seamen. Here are all the wild lawless spirits of Europe assembled within the circuit of a single trench. Violent, tempestuous, unstable is the life they lead. Ishmaelites, their hands against every man, and every man's hand against them; the instruments of rapine; tarnished with almost every vice, and knowing scarcely any virtue but those of reckless bravery and uncalculating obedience to their leader, their situation still presents some aspects which affect or amuse us; and these the poet has seized with his accustomed skill. Much of the cruelty and repulsive harshness of these soldiers, we are taught to forget in contemplating their forlorn houseless wanderings, and the practical magnanimity, with which even they contrive to wring from Fortune a tolerable <b>scantling</b> of enjoyment. Their manner of existence Wallenstein has, at an after period of the action, rather movingly expressed: ...|$|E
