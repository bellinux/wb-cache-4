5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E

5|$|After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around 300) {{spoke of}} a mineral that when mixed with natron {{produced}} a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. Emsley <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either realgar or orpiment, due to {{the relation between the}} unidentified mineral and his other writings.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> {{it may be a}} planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at Tate, <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for Little John in Daniel Maclise's 1839 Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest. The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> this is not simply for dramatic effect, but {{reflects the fact that}} after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in Trafalgar Square the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by gaslight, which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.|$|E

5|$|Brown <b>speculates</b> <b>that</b> the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
