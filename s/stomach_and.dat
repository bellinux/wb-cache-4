5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including the <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium.

5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> intestines. The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E

5|$|A lone Japanese {{soldier was}} able to fire off three mortar rounds toward the main gate. Although members of F Company quickly located the soldier and killed him, several Rangers, Scouts, and POWs were wounded in the attack. Battalion surgeon Capt. James Fisher was mortally injured in the <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> was carried to the nearby village of Balincari. Scout Alfred Alfonso had a {{shrapnel}} wound to his abdomen. Scout Lt. Tom Rounsaville and Ranger Pvt. 1st Class Jack Peters were also wounded by the barrage.|$|E
5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
40|$|Comparisons between Bosmina coregoni and Bosmina Zongirostris in fish <b>stomachs</b> <b>and</b> net {{plankton}} {{showed a}} larger mean {{size in the}} <b>stomachs</b> <b>and</b> a clear preference for the larger species, B. coregoni. Vertebrate and invertebrate predators may influence distibu-tion and numeric {{relations between the two}} species. Bosmina coregoni Baird and Bosmina longirostris (0. F. Miiller) have been con-sidered to indicate different water types, B. coregoni nutrient-poor and B. Zongiros-tris nutrient-rich. Succession in which B. longirostris replaces B. coregoni during de-velopment of lakes has been recorded in sediment cores. Such replacements are in some cases correlated with shifts from oli-gotrophy to eutrophy (Brehm 1948...|$|R

5|$|In June 1943, after {{returning}} to command of X Corps, Horrocks sustained serious injuries during an air raid at Bizerte, while watching an amphibious rehearsal by the 46th Infantry Division for Operation Avalanche, the Salerno landings. Bullets from a strafing German fighter struck his upper chest and carried on through his body, piercing his lungs, <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> intestines. He underwent five operations and spent fourteenmonths recovering. He was replaced as commander of X Corps by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard McCreery.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E
5|$|She {{participated in}} Germany's Next Topmodel by {{painting}} and photographing {{the final four}} contestants in leopard prints. During the episode, which was Cycle 1 episode 6, she handled two models per day working for six to seven hours with each. The works covered the shoulders, legs, breasts and <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> included long hair extensions. The episode resulted in work that was so successful {{that none of the}} contestants were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E

50|$|Mullets are {{distinguished}} {{by the presence}} of two separate dorsal fins, small triangular mouths, and the absence of a lateral line organ. They feed on detritus, and most species have unusually muscular <b>stomachs</b> <b>and</b> a complex pharynx to help in digestion.|$|R
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
5000|$|Saccopharynx is a genus of deep-sea eel-like fishes {{with large}} mouths, distensible <b>stomachs</b> <b>and</b> long, scaleless bodies. It {{is the only}} genus in the family Saccopharyngidae. The name is from Latin saccus meaning [...] "sack" [...] and Greek φάρυγξ, pharynx.|$|R
