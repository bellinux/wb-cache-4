40|$|As {{part of the}} {{environmental}} impact assessment studies of brackish water aquaculture, the effect of benthic disturbance caused by manual removal of overlying sediment near to the <b>suction</b> <b>sump</b> of an aquaculture pond was studied in the Vellar estuary. The abundance and vertical distribution of meiofauna before and after disturbance were compared. Sediment core and water samples from the pre-and post-disturbance stages were analyzed for meiofaunal abundance, TOC, texture, porosity and physicochemical parameters. Immediately after one day of the benthic disturbance, a drastic decrease in meiofaunal numbers was observed, indicating the deleterious effect of disturbance. On the other hand considerable increase in TOC and meiofaunal numbers from the adjacent sites was observed vouching for the positive impact of such disturbances...|$|E
40|$|In the {{unlikely}} event of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in a pressurized water reactor (PWR), break jet impingement would dislodge thermal insulation from nearby piping, {{as well as other}} materials within the containment, such as paint chips, concrete dust, and fire barrier materials. Steam/water flows induced by the break and by the containment sprays would transport debris to the containment floor. Subsequently, debris would likely transport to and accumulate on the <b>suction</b> <b>sump</b> screens of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) pumps, thereby potentially degrading ECCS performance and possibly even failing the ECCS. In 1998, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) initiated a generic study (Generic Safety Issue- 191) to evaluate the potential for the accumulation of LOCA related debris on the PWR sump screen and the consequent loss of ECCS pump net positive suction head (NPSH). Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), supporting the resolution of GSI- 191, was tasked with developing a method for estimating debris transport in PWR containments to estimate the quantity of debris that would accumulate on the sump screen for use in plant specific evaluations. The analytical method proposed by LANL, to predict debris transport within the water that would accumulate on the containment floor, is to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combined with experimental debris transport data to predict debris transport and accumulation on the screen. CFD simulations of actual plant containment designs would provide flow data for a postulated accident in that plant, e. g., three-dimensional patterns of flow velocities and flow turbulence. Small-scale experiments would determine parameters defining the debris transport characteristics for each type of debris. The containment floor transport methodology will merge debris transport characteristics with CFD results to provide a reasonable and conservative estimate of debris transport within the containment floor pool and subsequent accumulation of debris on the sump screen. The complete methodology will, of course, include a means of estimating debris generation, transport to the containment floor, transport to the sump screen, and the resulting loss of NPSH...|$|E
40|$|During a 5 -year period, 482 {{patients}} with liver injuries were studied prospectively: 65 % resulted from penetrating and 35 % from blunt injuries. The injuries were graded by the hepatic injury scale (grades I to VI); transfusion requirements and perihepatic abscesses correlated with increasing scores. Minor surgical techniques were needed in 338 patients and 144 patients required major techniques. Omental packing {{was used in}} 60 % of the major injuries and yielded 7 % mortality and 8 % abscess rates. Gauze packs were used for management of 10 % of major injuries and yielded 29 % mortality and 30 % abscess rates. The patients were randomized to no drain, closed <b>suction,</b> or <b>sump</b> drainage and respective perihepatic abscess rates were 6. 7 %, 3. 5 %, and 13 % (p less than 0. 03; suction compared to closed suction). Multivariate analysis demonstrated increasing abdominal trauma indices and transfusion requirements as well as sump drainage to be associated independently with perihepatic infection...|$|R
40|$|Developmental radon {{reduction}} {{techniques have}} been installed in 16 houses near Dayton. Sub-slab <b>suction</b> and <b>sump</b> (drain tile) <b>suction</b> have reduced radon levels in five basement houses below 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) -or 148 Becquerels {{per cubic meter}} (B~/I$) [...] based upon short-term radon measurements. In one of these houses, soil gas flow in the system was only 4 ft^/min (2 L/sec). In two houses which had a basement plus an adjoining slab on grade, sub-slab suction in the basement alone adequately reduced radon levels in the entire house. Radon was reduced by over 90 percent in each of four slab-ongrade houses using sub-slab suction from outdoors, even though forced-air heating supply ducts under the slabs appeared to prevent effective extension of. ke suction field under the slab. Forced-air exhaust of the crawl space in four crawl space houses proved more effective in reducing radon in the living area than did natural ventilation of the crawl space. Closure of the wall/floor joint in two basement houses with concrete foundations, and of a sump {{in one of the}} houses, gave moderate reductions in the house with a sump, but limite...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} considerations {{in the design}} of a <b>suction</b> supply <b>sump.</b> It is imperative that the amount of turbulence and entrained air be kept to a minimum. Free aircore vortex occurring at a water-intake pipe is an important problem encountered in hydraulic engineering. These vortices may reduce pump performances, have large effects on the operating conditions and lead to increase plant operating costs. Experiments, conducted in order to select best positions of the suction pipe of a water intake sump, show qualitative results concerning flow disturbances in the pump-intake related to sump geometries and position of the pump intake. The purpose of the paper is to reproduce the flow pattern and confirm the geometrical parameter influences of the flow behavior in such a pump. The numerical model used solves the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and VOF multiphase model for two cases. In the validation of this numerical model, emphasis was placed on the prediction of the number, location, size and strength of the various types of vortices. Previous studies, without simulation of air entrainment, have shown the influence on a single type of mesh with different cell numbers, different intake pipe depths and different water levels, for two turbulence models closure...|$|R
40|$|An 11 -year-old boy {{presented}} moribund, {{with massive}} abdominal distension. A Nissen fundoplication and gastrostomy tube {{had been established}} at age 2 years. After attempts to pass a nasogastric tube were unsuccessful, the old gastrostomy site was used to gain percutaneous access to the stomach resulting in release of gastric contents and stabilization of blood pressure and perfusion. During operation, massive gastric distention with gastric necrosis was found. Subtotal gastrectomy was performed with stapled closure of the distal intraabdominal esophagus and prepyloric region. <b>Sump</b> <b>suction</b> {{was placed in the}} proximal esophagus and the abdomen was drained widely. A distal esophageal perforation was apparent on postoperative day 19 confirmed by imaging and endoscopy. A nasoesophageal tube was passed into the abdomen, tied to a Jackson-Pratt drain, and the composite tube repositioned in the midesophagus allowing controlled proximal and distal drainage. Six months later, a Hunt-Laurence esophagojejunal pouch was created. At age 13, the child is clinically well, and enjoys 50 % of his nutritional needs orally, with the remainder delivered overnight via tube feedings. This case describes gastric necrosis after gas bloat syndrome as a late complication of Nissen fundoplication. A novel approach to the management of distal esophageal perforation allowed preservation of a functional, intact native esophagus...|$|R
