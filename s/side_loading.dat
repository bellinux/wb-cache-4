25|$|MV Pioneer is a stern / <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> ferry {{built in}} 1974, in service for 29 years {{covering}} {{nearly all of}} Caledonian MacBrayne's routes. She now serves the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea and was chartered to rescue Liberian refugees.|$|E
25|$|Built {{as a car}} ferry, Caledonian Princess was a roll-on/roll-off design, with {{a single}} vehicle door in the stern. The vehicle deck had space for 103 cars. To {{facilitate}} the turning of trucks for disembarking, a turntable {{was included in the}} deck. In 1969, she had <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> doors cut into her vehicle deck.|$|E
25|$|From 1980 {{the airline}} {{operated}} a single Boeing 737-2R4C. The aircraft was bought through {{a partnership with}} the Norwegian Armed Forces, in which it was specially equipped to meet military needs. Specifically, it was a combi variant, which encompassed a <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> door and the possibility to quickly rearrange the interior between all-passenger, all-freight, combined passenger and freight, as well as VIP configuration. The aircraft was designed to be able to operate out from gravel runways and was also as the only 737 certified to be used for parachuting.|$|E
40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} the lateral forces, occurring {{as a result of}} asymmetric nozzle flow separation, are discussed. The effect of some parameters on the <b>side</b> <b>load</b> is explained. A new method was developed for calculation of the <b>side</b> <b>load.</b> The values calculated are compared with <b>side</b> <b>load</b> data of the J- 2 engine. Results are used for predicting <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> of the space shuttle main engine...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} investigations on {{the nozzle}} start-up <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics were performed. The {{objective of this}} study is to identify the three-dimensional <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics and to compute the associated aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>load</b> using an anchored computational methodology. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, and pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and a simulated inlet condition based on a system calculation. Finite-rate chemistry was used throughout the study so that combustion effect is always included, and the effect of wall cooling on <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics is studied. The <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics captured include the afterburning wave, transition from free- shock to restricted-shock separation, and lip Lambda shock oscillation. With the adiabatic nozzle, free-shock separation reappears after the transition from free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation, and the subsequent flow pattern of the simultaneous free-shock and restricted-shock separations creates a very asymmetric Mach disk flow. With the cooled nozzle, the more symmetric restricted-shock separation persisted throughout the start-up transient after the transition, leading to an overall lower <b>side</b> <b>load</b> than that of the adiabatic nozzle. The tepee structures corresponding to the maximum <b>side</b> <b>load</b> were addressed...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{three-dimensional}} numerical investigations on the <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics for {{an engine}} encompassing a film cooled nozzle extension and a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, were performed. The objectives {{of this study}} are to identify the three-dimensional <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics and to compute the associated aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>load</b> using an anchored computational methodology. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and a transient inlet history based on an engine system simulation. Ultimately, the computational results will be provided to the nozzle designers for estimating of effect of the peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> on the nozzle structure. Computations simulating engine startup at ambient pressures corresponding to sea level and three high altitudes were performed. In addition, computations for both engine startup and shutdown transients were also performed for a stub nozzle, operating at sea level. For engine with the full nozzle extension, computational result shows starting up at sea level, the peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> occurs when the lambda shock steps into the turbine exhaust flow, while the <b>side</b> <b>load</b> caused by the transition from free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation comes at second; and the <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> decreasing rapidly and progressively as the ambient pressure decreases. For the stub nozzle operating at sea level, the computed <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> during both startup and shutdown becomes very small due to the much reduced flow area...|$|R
25|$|The Mark 6's contact {{exploder}} mechanism {{descended from}} the Mark 3 contact exploder. Both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pin's travel was perpendicular to the torpedo's travel, so the firing pin {{would be subject to}} <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> when the torpedo struck its target. The Mark 3 exploder was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower (the Mark 10 torpedo's speed was 30 knots), but even then the Mark 3 prototypes had problems with the firing pin binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target. The solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding. The Mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed (46 knots), so it would see significantly higher deceleration, but BuOrd apparently just assumed the contact exploder would work at the higher speed. There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact exploder. If BuOrd had tried some live-fire tests of the contact exploder during peacetime, it probably would have experienced some duds and rediscovered the binding problem.|$|E
2500|$|MV Pioneer {{resembled the}} three ferries, , [...] and , (commonly known as 'the three streakers') {{which had been}} {{introduced}} on the Clyde. The [...] passenger accommodation was forward and the open car deck aft. She sported two funnels amidships and her mainmast was a gantry right at the stern. She was fitted with twin controllable pitch propellers, twin rudders, stabilisers and bow thrusters. She was originally stern-loading only with a hydraulic stern ramp and two 3½ ton Hiab cargo cranes just abaft of the superstructure. To take over the Mallaig - Armadale (Skye) service, she was fitted with a hoist, allowing stern / <b>side</b> <b>loading.</b> The hoist was removed again in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|One hope of {{improving}} sales {{was to develop}} the Herald as a military transport. The Royal Air Force had a requirement for 45 tactical transports to replace piston-engined Vickers Valettas, and Handley Page began work in 1960 on the HP.124 to meet this need. This would have a new rear fuselage with a rear loading ramp under the raised tail. The HP.124 was considered favourite to beat Avro's 748 derivative, the Avro 780, with the high wing of the Handley Page expected to give easier loading than the more expensive Avro. While short-field testing of the prototype Herald 200 at RAF Martlesham Heath in 1961 showed off the Herald's good handling and ability to operate from unprepared airstrips, other obstacles were more taxing. [...] The Minister of Aviation, Peter Thorneycroft, refused to sign a contract for the HP.124 unless Handley Page would agree to a merger with British Aircraft Corporation or Hawker Siddeley {{as part of the}} government's policy of consolidation of the British aircraft industry. [...] As Hawker Siddeley offered less than half the valuation that Frederick Handley Page placed on the company, the merger did not occur, and the RAF's order went to the Avro 780, which became the Andover. The Herald Series 400 was a simpler tactical transport with a strengthened cabin floor and <b>side</b> <b>loading</b> doors that could be opened in flight for dropping of supplies or paratroops. Eight were built for the Royal Malaysian Air Force.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort {{is to develop a}} computational methodology to capture the startup <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics and to anchor the computed aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> with the available data from a regeneratively cooled, high-aspect-ratio nozzle, hot-fired at sea level. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based, reacting flow computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer formulation, a transient 5 s inlet history based on an engine system simulation, and a wall temperature distribution to reflect the effect of regenerative cooling. To understand the effect of regenerative wall cooling, two transient computations were performed using the boundary conditions of adiabatic and cooled walls, respectively. The results show that three types of shock evolution are responsible for side loads: generation of combustion wave; transitions among free-shock separation, restricted-shock separation, and simultaneous free-shock and restricted shock separations; along with the pulsation of shocks across the lip, although the combustion wave is commonly eliminated with the sparklers during actual test. The test measured two <b>side</b> <b>load</b> events: a secondary and lower <b>side</b> <b>load,</b> followed by a primary and peak <b>side</b> <b>load.</b> Results from both wall boundary conditions captured the free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation transition with computed <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> matching the measured secondary <b>side</b> <b>load.</b> For the primary <b>side</b> <b>load,</b> the cooled wall transient produced restricted-shock pulsation across the nozzle lip with peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> matching that of the test, while the adiabatic wall transient captured shock transitions and free-shock pulsation across the lip with computed peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> 50 % lower than that of the measurement. The computed dominant pulsation frequency of the cooled wall nozzle agrees with that of a separate test, while that of the adiabatic wall nozzle is more than 50 % lower than that of th...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{estimates}} of nozzle <b>side</b> <b>loads,</b> the off-axis forces that develop during engine start and shutdown, {{are important in}} the design cycle of a rocket engine.

The MSFC Nozzle Test Facility was modified to measure nozzle <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> during simulated nozzle start. <b>Side</b> <b>load</b> results from cold flow tests on two nozzle test articles, one with a truncated ideal contour and one with a parabolic contour are provided.

40|$|Abstract. Bending fatigue {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of gears. The method of gear fatigue design was {{discussed}} in many papers. Most of them are based on GB/T 3480 - 83. But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single <b>side</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. For double <b>sides</b> <b>loaded</b> gear, only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single <b>side</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. A new formula based on fatigue theory is given to modify the mean stress in consideration of the load character of doubled <b>sides</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. The method given in the paper is an addition to the traditional gear design method...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Slightly tapered {{truncated}} cones were manufactured from graphite/epoxy preimpregnated unidirectional {{tape and}} were loaded in compression. Different amounts of <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> were introduced by orienting the loading axis {{away from the}} central axis of the cone. The cones were crushed under quasi-static conditions, and their energy absorption was measured. For small amounts of <b>side</b> <b>load,</b> the energy absorbency was improved; however, {{as the amount of}} <b>side</b> <b>load</b> is increased further, the energy absorption capability of the structure is reduced significantly. Furthermore, a tendency for the specimen to topple is observed {{as a result of the}} moment induced by the <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> which reduces the energy absorption properties even further...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cold flow}} {{subscale}} nozzles were tested for <b>side</b> <b>load</b> characteristics during simulated nozzle start transients. The two test article contours were a truncated ideal and a parabolic. The current paper {{is an extension}} of a 2009 AIAA JPC paper on the test results for the same two nozzle test articles. The <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments were measured with the strain tube approach in MSFC s Nozzle Test Facility. The processing techniques implemented to convert the strain gage signals into <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moment data are explained. Nozzle wall pressure profiles for separated nozzle flow at many NPRs are presented and discussed in detail. The effect of the test cell diffuser inlet on the parabolic nozzle s wall pressure profiles for separated flow is shown. The maximum measured <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments for the two contours are compared. The truncated ideal contour s peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moment was 45 % of that of the parabolic contour. The calculated <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments, via mean-plus-three-standard-deviations at each nozzle pressure ratio, reproduced the characteristics and absolute values of measured maximums for both contours. The effect of facility vibration on the measured <b>side</b> <b>load</b> moments is quantified and the effect on uncertainty is calculated. The nozzle contour designs are discussed and the impact of a minor fabrication flaw in the nozzle contours is explained...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional planar and {{axisymmetric}} numerical investigations on {{the nozzle}} start-up <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics were performed. The {{objective of this}} study is to develop a computational methodology to identify nozzle <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics using simplified two-dimensional geometries, in order to come up with a computational strategy to eventually predict the three-dimensional <b>side</b> <b>loads.</b> The computational methodology is based on a multidimensional, finite-volume, viscous, chemically reacting, unstructured-grid, and pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and a transient inlet condition based on an engine system modeling.

The mutual interaction of the shock pattern of the overexpanded flow and a recirculation region behind the shock seems to cause a short, asymmetric reattachment of the flow to the wall.

40|$|The contour {{inflection}} of {{the dual}} bell nozzle forces the flow to a symmetrical and controlled separation in sea level mode. At a certain altitude, {{the transition to}} high altitude mode takes place: the flow attaches rapidly to the nozzle extension wall, down to the exit plane. During this transition, the separation point moves in the extension generating potential high <b>side</b> <b>load</b> peaks due to its asymmetrical position. A cold flow subscale test campaign has been conducted on three nozzle models at the German Aerospace Center to evaluate the generation of <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> in dual bell nozzles. The phenomenology is given for the different nozzle flow regimes. Both operating modes are related to very low <b>side</b> <b>loads.</b> Transition and retransition induce a strong short time peak. The phase of sneak transition, corresponding to a flow separation within the inflection region {{before the start of}} the actual transition, generates comparable <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> to separated conventional nozzles. The influence of the various geometrical parameters on flow behavior and <b>side</b> <b>load</b> generation was also investigated in this study. The extension length is shown to be the critical parameter for flow stability, transition duration and <b>side</b> <b>load</b> generation, leading to the necessity of a trade off for the optimization of the dual bell concept in rocket applications...|$|R

40|$|DLR {{conducted}} {{tests to}} study the <b>side</b> <b>load</b> characteristics in cold flow subscale dual bell nozzles. The <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> are related to different nozzle flow regimes. The most important are strong short time peaks induced by transition and retransition from sea level to high altitude mode and vice versa. In sea level and high altitude mode the dual bell creates less <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> than a comparable conventional nozzle. An additional flow regime could be confirmed, addressed as sneak transition. Contrary to the accepted doctrine, the flow separation in sea level mode will not be continuously fixed at the contour inflection. Before the actual transition to high altitude mode takes place the flow separates within the inflection region. As a result a distinct phase of <b>side</b> <b>loads</b> comparable to separated conventional nozzles is given. A procedure to reduce the regime of sneak transition is proposed...|$|R
