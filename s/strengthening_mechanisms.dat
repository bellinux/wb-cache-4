Therefore, pistons experience a progressive loss of strength due to over-aging during service. This contribution reports of a structural investigation on a eutectic AlSi 12 CuNiMg alloy before and after fatigue testing at high temperatures (up to 350 °C). Metallography, color etching, SEM and TEM are used to elucidate the following aspects: 1) the structural features of the alloy (dendrites of α−phase, primary Si particle size and distribution, morphology and distribution of intermetallic phases); 2) {{the evolution of the}} <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> (GP zones) with high temperature exposure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlloy 3 J 40 is a nickel-based alloy {{with high}} {{hardness}} and high elasticity. Alloy 3 J 40 was widely used as bears and conical pivots in many fields, such as, navigation, aviation and antiaircraft gun {{due to its}} excellent properties of elasticity, strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, nonmagnetic characteristics and so on. However, after aging treatment, the hardness of 3 J 40 alloy was uneven, there were large differences in hardness between the air-cooled and the furnace-cooling alloys, and the properties were unstable. Previous researches basely focused on the distribution, size, shape {{and other aspects of}} inclusions, to improve the plasticity and thermal processing properties of the alloy. Studies about properties and microstructure of the alloy devoted to the studies of the traditional Ni 3 Al-γ-phase. Up to now no public research report had been found about the α-Cr phase <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the 3 J 40 alloy. In this paper, the effect of α-Cr phase on the <b>strengthen</b> <b>mechanism</b> in 3 J 40 alloy was investigated. By thermodynamic phase equilibrium calculation, the possible phases, which may precipitate after heat treatment, have been predicted. Relationships between the mechanical properties and the ageing heat treatment parameters, such as, ageing temperature, ageing time and cooling rate, had been studied. Microstructure of the alloy under different heat-treatment process has been analyzed, especially cared about the morphology, particles size and quantity of the α-Cr phase. And the <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> was also investigated. The results showed that the microstructure of the aged 3 J 40 alloy were composed of γ-based phase, precipitated γ’ phase, (Ni 3 Al) phase, and α-Cr phase in granular and laminar. And the main contribution for the <b>strengthen</b> <b>mechanism</b> may be associated with the α-Cr phase laminar...|$|R
50|$|A material's {{strength}} {{is dependent on}} its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter its microstructure. The variety of <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that alter {{the strength of a}} material include the mechanism of grain boundary strengthening. Thus, although yield {{strength is}} maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. Considered in tandem {{with the fact that the}} yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending on its microstructural properties and the desired end effect.|$|E

USAID's Democracy and Governance program also emphasizes encouraging greater civil society involvement in national decisionmaking; <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to promote transparency and accountability; improving the environment for decentralized private and local initiatives; and enhancing the electoral system and the national legislature. A panoply of military-to-military cooperation programs reinforces democratizing efforts. U.S.-Benin military cooperation is now being expanding, both bilaterally and within a broader regional framework.|$|E
50|$|Methods {{have been}} devised to modify the yield strength, ductility, and {{toughness}} of both crystalline and amorphous materials. These <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit {{a variety of different}} applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from interstitial incorporation of carbon into the iron lattice. Brass, a binary alloy of copper and zinc, has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening. Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce dislocations into materials, increasing their yield strengths.|$|E

The microstructure of the electroformed copper layer is observed by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The tensile strength is evaluated with a tensile tester. It is found that bulk crystal of electroformed copper's surface layer is changed to nanocrystals (about 10 nm in size) after the ultrasonic-assisted mechanical treatment (UMT) but the whole monocrystalline structure still remains. The tensile strength exhibited by the new copper layer is two times better than the regular electroformed copper layer, while the fracture strain remains constant.

50|$|The {{theory of}} stress fields {{can be applied}} to various <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for materials. Stress fields can be created by adding {{different}} sized atoms to the lattice (solute strengthening). If a smaller atom is added to the lattice a tensile stress field is created. The atomistic bonds are longer due to the smaller radius of the solute atom. Similarly if a larger atom is added to the lattice a compressive stress field is created. The atomistic bonds are shorter due to the larger radius of the solute atom. The stress fields created by adding solute atoms form the basis of the material strengthening process that occurs in alloys.|$|E

The crystal structure of γ" [...] is body-centered tetragonal (BCT), and the phase precipitates as 60 nm by 10 nm discs with the (001) planes in γ" [...] parallel to the {001} family in γ. These anisotropic discs form {{as a result of}} lattice mismatch between the BCT precipitate and the FCC matrix. This lattice mismatch leads to high coherency strains which, together with order hardening, comprise the primary <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The γ" [...] phase is unstable above approximately 650 °C.|$|E
50|$|A material's {{strength}} {{is dependent on}} its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter this microstructure. The variety of <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that alter {{the strength of a}} material includes work hardening, solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening and grain boundary strengthening and can be quantitatively and qualitatively explained. <b>Strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are accompanied by the caveat that some other mechanical properties of the material may degenerate in an attempt to make the material stronger. For example, in grain boundary strengthening, although yield {{strength is}} maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. In general, the yield strength of a material is an adequate indicator of the material's mechanical strength. Considered in tandem {{with the fact that the}} yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending its microstructural properties and the desired end effect. Strength is expressed in terms of the limiting values of the compressive stress, tensile stress, and shear stresses that would cause failure. The effects of dynamic loading are probably the most important practical consideration of the strength of materials, especially the problem of fatigue. Repeated loading often initiates brittle cracks, which grow until failure occurs. The cracks always start at stress concentrations, especially changes in cross-section of the product, near holes and corners at nominal stress levels far lower than those quoted for the strength of the material.|$|E

40|$|A {{potential}} {{high temperature}} <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> for alloys {{based on the}} intermetallic compound NiAl was investigated. This study forms {{part of an overall}} program at NASA Lewis Research Center for exploring the potential of alloys based on NiAl for high temperature applications. An alloy containing 2. 26 at% Nb and produced by hot extrusion of blended powders was examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy. Interdiffusion between the blended Nb and NiAl powders results in the formation of intermediate phases. A fine dispersion of precipitates of a hexagonal, ordered NiAlNb phases in a matrix of NiAl can be produced and this results in strengthening of the alloy by interfering with dislocation motion at high temperature. These precipitates are, however, found to coarsen during the high temperature (1300 K) deformation at slow strain rates and this may impose some limitatioins on the use of this <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The stress {{required}} to cause dislocation motion is {{orders of magnitude}} lower than the theoretical stress {{required to}} shift an entire plane of atoms, so this mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on {{the ease with which}} dislocations move. Pinning points, or locations in the crystal that oppose the motion of dislocations, can be introduced into the lattice to reduce dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may be pinned due to stress field interactions with other dislocations and solute particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming along grain boundaries. There are four main <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required to start irreversible (plastic) deformation is greater than it was for the original material.|$|E

The strength of these alloys is modified and enhanced by different <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of these alloys and their composites have been extensively studied {{during the past}} decades. Important mechanisms applied to strengthening the alloys include precipitation strengthening, solution strengthening, grain and subgrain strengthening, and dislocation density strengthening. Precipitation and solution <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are strongly dependent on composition of the alloys and thermal treatment processes, whereas grain and subgrain and dislocation density <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> majorly depend on thermomechanical processing.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the magnesia {{core material}}. Six batches of the magnesia core material were made by reacting magnesia with a silica glass with holding times ranging from 17 to 120 min. The flexural strength was measured using three-point loading according to the ISO specification for dental ceramics. The forsterite content was measured using quantitative x-ray diffraction. A statistically significant correlation was found between the forsterite content and flexural strength. The proposed <b>mechanism</b> for <b>strengthening</b> is the precipitation of fine forsterite crystals in the glass matrix surrounding unreacted magnesia. Longer reaction times produced more dissolution of magnesia and subsequent precipitation of forsterite. This method results in a new <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> for dental ceramics which have previously relied on the incorporation of alumina, leucite or ceramic whiskers...|$|R

30|$|The alloys {{investigated}} exhibit exceedingly different evolutions in residual properties. This {{is expected}} as the residual mechanical behavior {{is governed by}} the relative state and evolution of the microstructural <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which are discussed in detail by (Summers 2014). The primary evolving <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are the grain structure in 5083 -H 116 and precipitates in 6061 -T 651. These mechanisms are developed during material processing, i.e., strain hardening (5083) and precipitation hardening (6061), to a state resulting in the desired mechanical properties. Further evolution of these mechanisms at elevated temperatures governs residual mechanical behavior.|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{operative}} <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in low carbon martensitic steels {{that depend on}} the alloy and prior processing conditions. It is very challenging to deconvolute these <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> because lath martensite is a complicated, multiscale microstructure. In an effort to identify prominent <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in low carbon lath martensite, an Nb-microalloyed low carbon steel was subjected to different austenite conditioning and postquench tempering treatments. Austenite conditioning was performed to generate different prior austenite grain sizes and to thermomechanically process austenite below its recrystallization temperature. After processing, {{the strength of the}} as-quenched or as-quenched and tempered martensite was assessed through tensile or hardness experiments at room temperature. The results were correlated to measurements of dislocation density in the martensite, martensite microstructure including martensite block and packet size measured using electron backscatter diffraction imaging, and precipitation strengthening. For the processing conditions that were selected, strength was predominantly controlled by martensite dislocation density, which can be altered by reducing the prior austenite grain size and thermomechanical processing. The tempering response of the alloy was also sensitive to prior austenite grain size...|$|E
40|$|The {{laminated}} metal composites (LMCs) of dissimilar metals (aluminium alloys: AA 1100 /AA 7075) were fabricated using the accumulative roll bonding technique {{in conjunction with}} cold rolling. The LMCs of ultrafine grained AA 1100 and nanostructured precipitates of AA 7075 achieved metallurgical bonding. The microstructure of the bonding interfaces and constituent metals was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for the LMCs with different layers. The deformation incompatibility and shear actions were analyzed using the microanalysis of dissimilar bonding interfaces. The mechanism of grain refinement of LMCs was investigated and described based on the microstructure characterization. The mechanical properties, <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and fracture mechanism of LMCs were also investigated.
