5000|$|Workstation {{design is}} {{important}} to reduce awkward posture for the neck, back and shoulders. The sewing machine table, chair and paddle positions should be adjusted considering the worker’s body height in a sitting position. Sewing machine table heights should be adjusted between 10 cm to 15 cm above elbow height for everyone. It should also have tilted 10° to 15° towards the operator and the needle at 20° backward inclination and the pedal position should be placed forward and adjusted per user’s comfort. The adjustable desk height, inclined slope of the table, needle angle and the pedal position should induce a more upright position of the head, neck and trunk. Adjustment of the sewing machine table alone does not ensure good posture; adjustment of the chair {{is also an important}} factor. The chair should adjust between 51 cm and 61 cm; the backrest distance should adjust horizontally by about 5 cm and the backrest height should be fixed at 25 cm. Studies also show significant reduction of physical discomfort experienced by the sewing machine operators by changing the angle of <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and backrest of the chair.|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of vehicle ride comfort {{is influenced by}} the dynamic performance of full-depth foam used in many vehicle seats. The effects of the thickness of foam on the dynamic stiffness (i. e., stiffness and damping as a function of frequency) of foam cushions with three thicknesses (60, 80, and 100 mm), and the vibration transmitted through these cushions at the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and the backrest were measured with 12 subjects (6 males and 6 females). With increasing thickness, the stiffness and the damping of the foam decreased. With increasing thickness of foam at the <b>seat</b> <b>pan,</b> the resonance frequencies around 4 Hz in the vertical in-line and fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibilities of the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> cushion and the backrest cushion decreased. For the conditions investigated, it is concluded that the thickness of foam at a vertical backrest has little effect on the vertical in-line or fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibilities of the foam at either the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> or the backrest. The frequencies of the primary resonances around 4 Hz in the vertical in-line transmissibility and the fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibility of foam at the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> were highly correlated. Compared to sitting on a rigid <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> with a foam backrest, sitting with foam at both the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and the backrest reduced the resonance frequency in the vertical in-line transmissibility of the backrest foam and increased the associated transmissibility at resonance, while the fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibility of the backrest was little affected. Compared to sitting without a backrest, sitting with a rigid vertical backrest increased the resonance frequency of the fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibility of the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> cushion and increased the transmissibility at resonance. Relevance to industry: The transmissibility of a seat is determined by the dynamic properties of the occupant of the seat and the dynamic properties of the seat. This study shows how the thicknesses of foam at a <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and foam at a backrest affect the in-line and cross-axis transmissibilities of the foams at the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and the backrest. The findings have application to the design of vehicle seats to minimise the transmission of vibration to the body. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Absorbed power {{characteristics}} of seated human subjects under fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) vibration are investigated through measurements of dynamic interactions {{at the two}} driving-points formed by {{the body and the}} <b>seat</b> <b>pan,</b> and upper body and the backrest. The experiments involved: (i) three back support conditions (no back support, and back supported against a vertical and an inclined backrest); (ii) three <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> heights (425, 390 and 350 mm); and three magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 m/s 2 rms acceleration) of band limited random excitations in 0. 5 – 10 Hz frequency range, applied independently along the x- and y- axes. The force responses, measured at the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and the backrest are applied to characterize total energy transfer reflected on the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and the backrest. The mean responses suggest strong contributions due to back support, and direction and magnitude of vibration. In the absence of a back support, the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> responses dominated in lower frequency bands centered at 0. 63 and 1. 25 Hz under both directions of motion. Most significant interactions of the upper body against the back support was observed under fore-aft vibration.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the vibration mitigation properties of selected seat cushions and the effects of occupant seating posture during exposure to higher frequency multi-axis vibration associated with military propeller aircraft. Methods A Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye crew seat was mounted onto the Six Degree-of-Freedom Motion Simulator (SIXMODE). Six <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> cushion configurations were tested during exposure to an E- 2 C vibration signal collected in the field 1. <b>Seat</b> <b>pan</b> cushions 1 - 5 were used with the original E- 2 C seat back cushion. Cushion configuration 6 included <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> cushion 5 with a prototype seat back cushion. Triaxial accelerometer pads were mounted onto the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and seat back cushions to measure the vibration entering the human. Data were collected for seven subjects seated upright with their backs in contact with the seat (back-on) and not in contact with the seat (back-off). Spectral analysis techniques were used to analyze data at the two dominant frequencies associated with the propulsion system (propeller rotation frequency (PRF) ~ 18. 5 Hz, and blade passage frequency (BPF) ~ 73. 5 Hz). Overall accelerations were also calculated between 1 and 80 Hz. Vibration Total Values (VTVs) were calculated using the weighted <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and seat back (back-on only) accelerations and compared to the comfort reactions given in ISO 2631 - 1 : 19972. Results In general, the highest accelerations observed at the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> occurred in the fore-and-aft (X) direction at both the PRF and the BPF for all cushions and both postures. The most pronounced effect was at the BPF in the X direction, where all configurations showed significantly lower <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> accelerations than configuration 1 (original E- 2 C cushion) with the back-on posture. Configuration 5 was the exception with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 A, Repeated Measures ANOVA, P< 0. 05). The most pronounced effect of posture occurred at the PRF in the X direction, where all cushion configurations showed significantly lower <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> accelerations with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 B). All configurations except configuration 2 showed similar VTVs as compared to Configuration 1 (Fig. 2, P< 0. 05). Configuration 2 tended to show the lowest weighted acceleration levels.

Submarining is an undesired phenomenon during a frontal crash scenario and is dependent on design features of the <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> and seatbelt system. The lack of adequate anti-submarining features at any seating position with three-point restraint can cause abdominal solid and hollow organ injuries.

The experiments involved: (i) three different back support conditions (no back support, and upper body supported against a vertical and an inclined backrest); (ii) three different <b>seat</b> <b>pan</b> heights (425, 390 and 350 mm); and three different magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 m/s 2 rms acceleration) of band limited random excitations in the 0. 5 – 10 Hz frequency range, applied independently along the fore-aft and lateral directions in an uncoupled manner.

Unlike the widely reported responses of seated occupants under vertical vibration, the responses to horizontal vibration show strong effect of excitation magnitude.

40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available in the}} literature concerning an ergonomic systems view of industrial seats. This study has been aimed at expanding knowledge of industrial seat design. For this purpose, a model for evaluating industrial seats has been proposed, listing demands and restrictions from the task and the workplace. It also includes responses and effects on the sitter, and methods of measurement for evaluating industrial work seats. The appropriateness of work seat design has been assessed in laboratory and field studies, using methods to measure body loads, their effects and responses. These have been body height shrinkage, biomechanical methods, subjective assessment, and posture assessment. The shrinkage method, including equipment and procedures, has been developed in this project. It assesses the effect of loads on the spine in vivo by using body height changes as a measure of disc creep. The results are well correlated with spinal loads. The method is sensitive enough to differentiate between spinal loads of 100 N difference. The results are also related to the perception of discomfort. Biomechanical methods have been developed for calculating compressive, shear, and momental loads on the spine. Ratings of discomfort, body mapping, interviews, video recordings, and prototype equipment for the recording of head posture have also been used. The methods {{have been shown to be}} appropriate for seat evaluation.
