40|$|A {{number of}} {{findings}} {{have shown that}} the test procedures currently available to determine the reliability and durability of photovoltaic (PV) modules are insufficient to detect certain problems. To improve these procedures, ongoing research into the actual performance of the modules in the field is required. However, scientific literature contains but few references to field studies of defective modules. This article studies two different localized heating phenomena affecting the PV modules of two large-scale PV plants in Spain. The first problem relates to weak solder joints whilst the second is due to microcracks on the module cells. For both cases, the cause is identified, and consideration is given with regard to the effect on performance, the potential deterioration over time, and a way to detect the problems identified. The findings contained in this paper will prove to be of considerable interest to maintenance personnel at large-scale PV plants and also to those responsible for <b>setting</b> <b>module</b> quality standards and specifications, and even the PV module manufacturers themselves...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram, the system is mainly {{composed}} of channel parameter control <b>setting</b> <b>module,</b> related energy accumulation and signal acquisition module, pseudo-code generator, sampling date memory, and two data pre-processing modules. Among them, the first input first output (FIFO) and channel parameter control are used to store the data and control parameters for each channel, respectively. The multi-channel PRN generator {{is responsible for producing}} a local pseudo code of each system, and the pseudo code should be sent into the data pre-processing module to realize the bit expansion of the code data. The sampling data memory is used to store the 1 -ms satellite signal to be captured, and the output data of this module also needs to be preprocessed. Two data pre-processing modules and a related energy accumulation and signal acquisition module are designed to realize the parallel treatment for GNSS signal capture, so as to achieve the features of multi-logic channel capture and multi-functional reuse. Because the official ICD document of the Galileo system does not give the way of its PRN code generation, the PRN code generation of Galileo signal can only be realized by register storage. Therefore, the system’s pseudo-code generator module includes a universal code generator and a memory code controller. The former is used to generate PRN codes for GPS, BDS, and GLONASS systems, and the latter is used in the Galileo system.|$|E

40|$|According to the invented “Automatic Rice Quality Inspection Machine”, the {{purposes}} of this study are to improve the performance of the machine and to develop a “Rice Quality Inspection and Classification System Software”. There were three computer classification algorithms which are “if-then-else” rule base, artificial neural network and hybrid method, designed in this software to study their accuracy of inspection on this machine. Several devices of the machine are improved. They are the automatic kernel intake device, the cracked kernel photographic device, the automatic belt stretch adjustment device and the sorting boxes. From the functions of image analysis and static kernel image grabbing designed in the software, the first needed classifying parameters can be built. These parameters are adjusted and remodified according to their performance from online testing with the machine. The inspection software comprises seven modules and each has many functions on it. They are PLC control module, rice kernel inspection and statistical module, parameter <b>setting</b> <b>module,</b> continual selecting module, image processing module, rice parameter calculating module and neural network classifying module. Assume the kernel fill rate reaches the average level of 90 %, the system can deal with 1200 rice kernels per minute at least. From the experimental results, when using the method of “maximum gray level difference of contiguous blocks”, the exactitude of the cracked kernel inspection can reach 89 %. According to the Scheffe test of the SAS and the analysis of the normalized value scope of those parameters, we choose the suitable parameters to build the rules and to set the artificial neural network. Each output of the neural network represents one of dead, discolored, off-type, broken, chalky, cracked, immature or sound kernel or rough rice. After the learning and testing process of the artificial neural network, the experiment shows that the accuracy of the classification reaches 92 %. Inspecting brown rice kernel with the “if-then-else” rule base, artificial neural network, and the hybrid method of combining both, it shows that the “if-then-else” rule base and the hybrid method have better validity. Considering the accuracy and the stability of classification and the parameter adjustment, the hybrid method of combining “if-then-else” rule base and the artificial neural network shows higher performance on the rice quality classification. 本研究以「稻米品質自動檢測分級機」為研究改進之基礎，發展稻米檢測分級之系統軟體。探討了條件式、類神經網路與混合兩種分類機制等三種分類演算法分類檢測之性能。本研究中改進檢測機上的米粒自動進料機構、胴裂粒的偵測環境、皮帶張力之自動調整與米粒分類收集盒等機構之設計。檢測軟體的靜置取像與分析功能可建立檢測機線上檢測時所需的辨識參數，而由線上檢測之結果可作為分類參數設定的依據。檢測軟體包含有PLC控制模組、米粒參數測試與統計分析模組、分類參數設定模組與連續選取分類模組、影像處理模組、米粒參數計算模組與類神經網路分類模組等 7 個不同模組。當檢測系統的米粒填佈率達 90 %以上時，檢測系統每分鐘可處理 1200 顆以上之米粒。 實驗結果顯示，計算「相鄰區塊最大灰階值之差」進行胴裂粒檢測，檢出率可達 89 %。經由SAS統計軟體之Scheffe測試與數值區間分佈的探討，可挑選出合適的米粒品質檢測參數，進行白死米、青死米、病蟲害粒、異型粒、碎粒、白堊質粒、胴裂粒、白未熟粒、青未熟粒、完整粒、活青米與稻穀等米粒種類的類神經網路分類，正確率最高可達 92. 0 %。分別以條件式、類神經網路與混合式等三種分類機制，配合檢測分級機進行稻米品質的線上分類檢測，顯示以條件式與混合式之檢測正確率較高。考量分類正確度、穩定度與分類參數的調整三種條件，建議以混合條件式與類神經網路之分類方式，在米粒分類的推廣應用上會有較好的表現。第一章 前言與研究目的 1. 1 前言 1. 2 研究目的 第二章 文獻探討 2. 1 影像處理原理與應用 2. 1. 1. 數位影像的原理 2. 1. 2. 影像技術在農產品檢測上之應用 2. 2 類神經網路原理與應用 2. 3. 1. 類神經網路之原理 2. 3. 2. 誤差倒傳遞類神經網路 2. 3. 3. 類神經網路在農產品檢測上之應用 2. 3 糙米的種類與量化參數 2. 4 糙米辨識演算法 2. 5 糙米外觀品質檢測分級系統 第三章 實驗設備與材料 3. 1 實驗設備 3. 2 實驗材料 第四章 研究方法 4. 1 胴裂粒的偵測 4. 2 糙米參數資料的建立 4. 3 類神經網路分類機制的建立 4. 4 條件式分類機制的使用 4. 5 混合分類機制之使用 4. 6 不同分類機制性能的比較 第五章 檢測系統 5. 1 檢測分級機的改進 5. 1. 1. 米粒入料方式的改進 5. 1. 2. 打光取像設計的改良 5. 1. 3. 輸送皮帶的張力調整 5. 1. 4. 米粒出料的設計 5. 2 檢測軟體的設計 5. 2. 1. 檢測系統的功能設計 5. 2. 2. 分級檢測的流程規劃 5. 2. 3. 分級檢測的程式發展 5. 2. 4. 檢測分級軟體 5. 2. 5. 動態檢測的控制流程與效能 第六章 結果與討論 6. 1 偵測胴裂的結果 6. 2 類神經網路的設定與測試 6. 2. 1. 分類參數之分類分析 6. 2. 2. 類神經網路的設定與測試 6. 2. 3. 配合條件式進行分類之測試結果 6. 3 不同分類機制之效能比較 6. 3. 1. 檢測系統的穩定度測試 6. 3. 2. 不同分類機制的分類效能之比較 第七章 結論 第八章 建議 參考文獻 附錄A 檢測分級系統的介紹 附錄B 米粒分類參數之分析資料 附錄C 不同分類機制的分類測試結...|$|E

The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed in prior quarters while Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in cast iron test pipe segments. Efforts in this quarter continued to focus on Tasks 4 - 8, with significant progress made in each as well as field testing of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. The field tests were conducted August 23 - 26, 2004 in Oradell, New Jersey. The field tests identified several design issues which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter cast iron repair robots to assure their commercial success. Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train) progressed {{to the design of}} the control electronics and pneumatic system to inflate the bladder robotic patch <b>setting</b> <b>module</b> in the last quarter 5. In this quarter, work has been concentrated on increasing the nitrogen bladder reservoir volume to allow at least two complete patch inflation/patch setting cycles in the event the sleeve does not set all ratchets in the same row on the first attempt. This problem was observed on a few of the repair sleeves that were recently installed during field tests with the small-diameter robotic system. For Task 5 (Design & Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera) it was observed that {{it will be necessary to}} add a stiff brush to push debris away from the immediate vicinity of the bell and spigot joints in mains having low gas velocities. Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (which were found to be very effective in cleaning bell and spigot joints) simply falls to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak free repair. Similarly, it is also necessary to design a small magnet to capture existing service tap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. These coupons were found to cause difficulty in launching and retrieving the small pipe repair robot; one coupon lodged beneath the end of the guide shoe. These new features require redesign of the pipe wall cleaning train and modification to the patch setting train. Task 6 (Design & Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabView. However, this must now be re-visited to add control routines for the coupon catcher to be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design & Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design of the entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast iron pipe in the previous quarter. Field tests with the 4 -inch size fitting were completely successful and did not reveal any significant design issues. The primary suggestion from the PSE&G field crew was to produce a version which completely bolts together and does not require a long seam weld. This could be used in low-pressure cast iron mains to reduce installation time. A bolt-on version is now being designed based on this recommendation. Task 8 (System Integration and Laboratory Validation) continued with the development of the robot module inter-connects and of a master LabView-based system display and control software...|$|E
