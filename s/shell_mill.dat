However, this method is developed late, and the technique for collecting the vibration signal from <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> is immature.

Subsequently, some considerations were given on the quality of surface roughness by this technique. Accordingly, the effects of the cutterdiameter and of the feed per tooth on the quality of the machined surface are discussed in this paper. The feed per tooth was changed in the following ways : 1. by changing the revolution of the workpiece, namely the feed rate in the cutting direction. 2. by changing the number of the cutter teeth. As a result, it is clarified that there are not so much difference in quality between the machined surfaces.

This class of mechanical systems is used to grind to a desired quality different material {{in at least three}} industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries (ore, clinker and metal powder). These tumbling mills range in size from small 1 ft diameter lab mills to a 40 ft diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are composed of three main interactive and interdependent elements: the <b>mill</b> <b>shell,</b> liners/lifters and charge. These three elements work together to impact energy to the mill charge through the rotational motion of the <b>mill</b> <b>shell.</b> As with any mechanical system, the natural frequency of that system is essentially dictated by its mass and stiffness.

The gasifier will {{be placed in a}} central point between the three buildings previously chosen, while the mill is about 10 km away. Despite the geographical distance between the cobs collection and energy conversion points, it is fundamental to evaluate if the idea is sustainable from an energy point of view. In particular, the energy produced by cobs gasification has to be higher than the one used for corn processing. The choice of the gasification derives from the high energy conversion efficiency, together with the chance to exploit existing skills on engines to maintain the plant. On the other hand, the gasification of corn cobs is poorly investigated in literature [14, 15, 16]. For this reason, the samples of corn cobs were tested in the laboratory while the gasification process was modeled in order to evaluate the overall efficiency and weak points of the proposed solution.

In order to prepare samples for the experiment, samples were milled on a knee and column type of a horizontal milling machine. Depending on cutting conditions and machining tool, there were set intervals of roughness of machined surface which are commonly achievable on this type of machine. It is a roughness in the interval of 0. 4 – 1. 6 µm (finishing), 1. 6 – 6. 3 µm (standard milling) a 6. 3 – 12. 5 µm (roughening). Removable cutting tips were used as a machining tool and for roughening, a <b>shell</b> end <b>milling</b> cutter NAREX 63 x 40 HSS 90 was used.

40|$|Mining mill linings are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} wear {{induced by the}} charge, and thus, mill operation has to be interrupted {{on a regular basis}} for inspections. Stoppages due to inspections and replacement of linings lead to large production and monetary losses; especially in case of unplanned corrective maintenance. Condition monitoring during mill operation can assist in the maintenance planning and decision process to increase the availability and the overall performance of the material processing. In this pilot study, the feasibility of using waterflow ultrasonics for condition monitoring of the lining of mining mills during operation is to be investigated. The proposed waterflow ultrasonic technique uses a water beam to transmit the ultrasound to the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> and lining. By measuring the time of flight (TOF), it can be possible to monitor the thickness of mill linings, without the need of interrupting operation. The method can lead to significant energy and monetary savings by reducing inspections and corrective maintenance stoppages, and possibly increase product quality by optimised performance. Since steel has a very high acoustic impedance in comparison to rubber, TOF measurements on aluminium-rubber has been used as an intermediate step towards the goal of measuring steel-rubber combinations. TOF measurements of aluminium-rubber layers have been achieved, and advancement towards the understanding of TOF measurements in steel-rubber laysers have been achieved. The following conclusions have been reached:- Rubber thickness can be measured through aluminium. In practice, aluminium plugs/rivets can be mounted on the steel <b>shell</b> of a <b>mill</b> to measure TOF of rubber shell plates and lifter bars. - Ultrasound signals can be measured through steel-rubber layers in through-transmission and pitch-catch set-ups. - Ultrasound signals measured in pulse-echo or pitch-catch set-up on a solid steel plate connected to rubber, give rise to reverberations (ringing signal) that mask the rubber backwall echoes. For avoiding reverberations of steel plate sides, an experimental set-up requires the steel plate to be at least eight times wider and deeper (x- and y-axis) than the thickness (z-axis) of the rubber under inspection.
