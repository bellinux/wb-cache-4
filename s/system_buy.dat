50|$|Unlike {{continental}} European trading hubs such as Zeebrugge and TTF, trades {{made at the}} NBP are {{not required}} to be balanced, and there is no fixed penalty for being out of balance. Instead, shippers out of balance {{at the end of the}} day are automatically balanced through the 'cash-out' procedure whereby the shipper is automatically made to buy or sell the required quantity of gas to balance their position at the marginal <b>system</b> <b>buy</b> or sell price for that day. This cash out process is not considered to be a penalty in the same way as those imposed on shippers in continental markets, because the cash-out prices are often very close to the spot price. As a result of this daily market liquidity, the UK's NBP is frequently used to balance a shipper's position on the continent by way of the Bacton - Zeebrugge interconnector.|$|E
5000|$|Trenton Webb {{reviewed}} The Planewalkers Handbook for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. He {{quoted the}} song [...] "it aint {{what you do}} but {{the way that you}} do it... thats what gets results!" [...] and noted [...] "Its one of lifes great quirks that trashy lines often contain valuable nuggets of philosophy. The lyrics of Fun Boy Three/Bananaramas hit is a case in point, because it encompasses the core ethic of The Planewalkers Handbook, A practical guide for players in the multiverse, it aims to teach both planars and primes that the secret of survival aint who you are, its what you know." [...] Webb continued: [...] "And while The Planewalkers Handbook doesnt actually contain that much new information, the old information it contains is clearly presented, logically ordered and well explained. Pulling facts from many different Planescape sources, the Walkers guide works perfectly as a beginners introduction to the Planes. Yet the encyclopedic range of topics it deals with means that even old-hands will find there are some facts they didnt know and a few that they plain misunderstood the first time round." [...] He added: [...] "What makes The Planewalkers Handbook, truly great, though, {{is the fact that it}} lies to you. ... On the jacket it claims to be a survival guide. And while to a lesser extent this is true, its real aim is to keep you alive just long enough to die somewhere really interesting. Players are fairly and squarely warned against the kind of innocent (but stupid) actions that will get them killed within seconds of arrival in Sigil. But this guide is so crammed with juicy hints about what the weirder Planes hold that beginners and experienced players alike will not be able to resist leaping headlong into even greater peril in an even more inhospitable place." [...] Webb commented that [...] "Codifying the sprawling worlds, peoples and powers of the Planescape multiverse is no mean feat. Essentially a Players Guide, TPHs sense of style, graphic wit and Planescapes own brand of mind-bending lunacy means that, even if you know most of the facts it contains, the book remains massively readable. Written with precision, it progresses from the basic what are the planes and how to travel between them, through the factions of Sigil, to Planewalker kits and the kit they carry. So that by the time you get to the new Power of Belief youre fully prepped and eager to tackle some of the fearsome mysteries of the system." [...] He stated that [...] "If your group is playing a Planescape campaign this is an essential purchase. If youre a referee thinking of trying a new <b>system,</b> <b>buy</b> this before the boxed set to get a real feel of just how wonderfully bizarre multiplanar adventures can be. In fact the only people who shouldnt consider getting hold of The Planewalkers Handbook are roleplaying virgins, and thats simply because Planescape is such a fast and loose system that a certain foundation of normal terrestrial adventures help to keep the whole thing in perspective." [...] Webb concluded the review by saying that [...] "Because, as Kenny Rodgers once said, youve got to know when to walk away and know when to hide, and thats the fun of Planescape - and its what The Planewalkers Handbook aims to hammer home to berks before its too late!" ...|$|E

The paper starts by describing a new agent-based modelling framework that involves electricity producers, consumers and suppliers as agents participating in a market environment. The framework allows for investigating the effect of demand elasticities on bidding of generators in the short term market and its influence on their revenue in the long term. We focus on the increasingly important issue of renewable technology such as wind generation and the volatility it brings into the electricity market.

The simulation probabilistically selects historical market data and includes analysis on the impact on the <b>system</b> <b>buy</b> price of historical unplanned generator shutdowns. A case study is presented for one revolutionary nuclear power station design concept, the Accelerator-Driven Subcritical Reactor (ADSR). The reliability of ADSRs is a key issue facing their future development. The model is used to identify when the economic cost of improving reliability exceeds the cost of unplanned shutdowns. The results are presented in a form that allows the reader to scale the cost of accelerator system failures for any capacity factor and coefficient of reliability, for a range of discount rates and electricity prices. unplanned shutdown, cost, intermittent, accelerator-driven subcritical reactor Contac...|$|E

30|$|This section {{implements}} {{an advance}} contracting market structure, {{where there is}} a short-term power exchange (STPX) with hourly energy prices available in a rolling basis. This market is assumed to be closed 4 -hour ahead of real-time operation. Once STPX is closed, all market players submit their final positions to system operator (SO) as the contracted obligations. However, some participant {{may not be able to}} provide the contracted energy due to the plant outages or generation variation. Therefore, SO re-dispatches the system in real time to manage system imbalance. In particular, flexible resources would bid into the balancing market to balance the supply and demand. Any real-time energy imbalances are cleared at either the <b>system</b> <b>buy</b> price (SBP) for short positions or system sell price (SSP) for long positions. To avoid the risk of high imbalance charges, a market participant could buy a balancing contract with another party. In this case, if one party were short on its contracted position, the second party would increase output to keep the group position in balance and hence avoid paying high SBP in the balancing market. This is extremely relevant for WF due to the difficulties associated with accurate forecast of wind generation. In such situation, the combined operation of ES and WF may become attractive.|$|E
