Brooks executive produced Crowe's first directing effort, 1989's Say Anything..., about a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. Though it could have easily ended up a formulaic teen love story, Say Anything... got glowing reception from critics.

25|$|Many of the European comics {{based on}} the Disney Universe have created {{their own version of}} Scrooge McDuck, usually {{involving}} him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s-1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and <b>shady</b> <b>business</b> deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss, or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings {{up at the end of}} the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb – something which Scrooge shows little concern for – he tends to end up with nothing.|$|E

His {{colourful}} memoir Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber (1740) describes {{his life in}} a personal, anecdotal and even rambling style.

Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on doing something else.
