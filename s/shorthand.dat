5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as <b>shorthand</b> for the numbers 6 (ÂÖ≠) and 8 (ÂÖ´), and solid lines were <b>shorthand</b> for values of 7 (‰∏É) and 9 (‰πù). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

During the Carnival season; the mystic {{societies}} build colorful floats and parade throughout downtown. Masked society members toss small gifts, known as 'throws,' to parade spectators. The mystic societies, which in essence are exclusive private clubs, also hold formal masquerade balls, usually by invitation only, and oriented to adults.|$|E

25|$|Many Duployan <b>shorthands</b> use small unattached marks, as well {{as various}} {{crossing}} and touching strokes, as markers for common prefixes and suffixes. Individual letters and letterlike symbols are also used in many Duployan <b>shorthands</b> to stand for common words and phrases. Overlapping two or more letters and signs {{can be used in}} some <b>shorthands</b> as word signs and abbreviations.|$|R
25|$|Several {{adaptations of}} Duployan were {{developed}} for writing English, including those by Helen Pernin, J. Matthew Sloan, Denis Perrault, Carl Brandt, and George Galloway. The Pernin, Perrault, and Sloan <b>shorthands</b> are distinguished from other Duployan <b>shorthands</b> {{by the presence}} of the quarter-arc compound consonants. They also make use of affix marks, and omit redundant vowels. Galloway and Brandt <b>shorthands</b> are not included in the Duployan Unicode proposal.|$|R
5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the event is based on a month-long {{preliminary}} hearing held afterward, generally known as the Spicer hearings. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from The Daily Nugget knew <b>shorthand.</b> The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, O'Hara {{joined the}} Abbey Theatre. Though she was mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, she found her time at the theatre disappointing. In 1934, {{at the age of}} 15, she won the first Dramatic Prize of the {{national}} competition of the performing arts, the Dublin Feis Award, for her performance as Portia in The Merchant of Venice. She trained as a <b>shorthand</b> typist, working for Crumlin Laundry before joining Eveready Battery Company, where she worked as a typist and bookkeeper. She later put her skills to use when she typed the script of The Quiet Man for John Ford.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering <b>shorthand</b> for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman <b>shorthand,</b> which is written in a similar way.|$|E

40|$|A key {{aspect of}} the focal {{concerns}} perspective of sentencing is that time and information restrictions within the courtroom create {{the conditions under which}} perceptual <b>shorthands</b> may impact sentencing determinations. These <b>shorthands</b> are based stereotypes related to offender characteristics including minority group statuses (i. e. ethnicity, race, Indigenous status) (Steffensmeier et al., 1998). To date, sentencing scholars drawing on the focal concerns perspective have only considered the impact of minority group statuses on sentencing in the mainstream courts (Mitchell, 2005; Spohn, 2000). Utilizing multiple regression techniques the current paper explores the impact of Indigenous status on the decision to imprison in the problem solving courts of South Australia. Unlike the mainstream courts, sentencing determinations within the therapeutic problem-solving court environment involve a more extensive examination of offenders and their cases and by extension, perceptual <b>shorthands</b> should be less influential. Evidence supporting this argument is provided by the current research. Results show a direct relationship between Indigenous status and the likelihood of imprisonment, with leniency being extended to Indigenous offenders.

5|$|Thomas Robinson Ferens (4 May 1847 ‚Äì 9 May 1930) was a British politician, a philanthropist, and an industrialist. He was the Member of Parliament for Hull East for 13 years, {{and served}} {{the city as}} a Justice of the Peace and as High Steward. He helped {{establish}} Reckitt and Sons, a manufacturer of household goods, as one of Kingston upon Hull‚Äôs foremost businesses.

5|$|While at school, Gibbons {{formed an}} {{ambition}} to be a writer, and on leaving in 1921 began a two-year Diploma in Journalism at University College, London (UCL). The course {{had been established}} for ex-servicemen returning from the First World War, but attracted several women, among them the future novelist Elizabeth Bowen. As well as English Literature, the curriculum covered economics, politics, history, science and languages; practical skills such as <b>shorthand</b> and typing were not included.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned <b>shorthand</b> at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

2500|$|Alcohols {{are then}} {{classified}} into primary, secondary (sec-, s-), and tertiary (tert-, t-), {{based upon the}} number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl functional group. (The respective numeric <b>shorthands</b> 1¬∞, 2¬∞, and 3¬∞ are also sometimes used in informal settings.) The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH2OH. The simplest primary alcohol is methanol (CH3OH), for which R=H, and the next is ethanol, for which R=CH3, the methyl group. Secondary alcohols {{are those of the}} form RR'CHOH, the simplest of which is 2-propanol (R=R'=CH3). For the tertiary alcohols the general form is RR'R"COH. The simplest example is tert-butanol (2-methylpropan-2-ol), for which each of R, R', and R" [...] is CH3. In these <b>shorthands,</b> R, R', and R" [...] represent substituents, alkyl or other attached, generally organic groups.|$|R
5|$|Bottomley {{spent five}} years in an orphanage before {{beginning}} his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent experience as a solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in his court appearances. After working as a <b>shorthand</b> writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company which launched numerous magazines and papers, including, in 1888, the Financial Times. He over-reached himself with an ambitious public flotation of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.|$|E
5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal record-keeping. Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} <b>shorthand</b> script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E
5|$|The Frank sisters each {{hoped to}} return to school {{as soon as they were}} able, and {{continued}} with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a <b>shorthand</b> course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E
