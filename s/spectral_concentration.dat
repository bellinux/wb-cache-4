The severe spectral overlaps generated by heterogeneity were resolved by multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methods. The purity based method (SIMPLISMAX) was used to resolve both luminescence spectra and pure Raman spectra without prior information.

50|$|These {{problems}} are often overcome by averaging over many realizations {{of the same}} event. However, this method is unreliable with small data sets and undesirable when one {{does not wish to}} attenuate signal components that vary across trials. Instead of ensemble averaging, the multitaper method reduces estimation bias by obtaining multiple independent estimates from the same sample. Each data taper is multiplied element-wise by the signal to provide a windowed trial from which one estimates the power at each component frequency. As each taper is pairwise orthogonal to all other tapers, the windowed signals provide statistically independent estimates of the underlying spectrum. The final spectrum is obtained by averaging over all the tapered spectra. Thomson chose the Slepian or discrete prolate spheroidal sequences as tapers since these vectors are mutually orthogonal and possess desirable <b>spectral</b> <b>concentration</b> properties (see the section on Slepian sequences). In practice, a weighted average is often used to compensate for increased energy loss at higher order tapers.|$|E

The ability to monitor a reaction in real time is invaluable to the production process of industrial and pharmaceutical products. However, {{it is not a}} commonly used technique, due to some of its limitations. Currently, a great deal of work has been done showing the ability of a kinetic model to accurately estimate the <b>spectral</b> profiles and <b>concentrations</b> of reaction systems as a function of time. Some models have even demonstrated the technique’s ability to model the transitions of analytes during dissolution and crystallization processes, but little has been done to combine all of these processes into a flexible, robust modeling system that incorporates all of these processes simultaneously. The goal of this work is three-fold: (1) to demonstrate the ability of a kinetic model to cohesively model dissolution, reaction, and crystallization processes, (2) accurately predict the <b>spectral</b> and <b>concentration</b> information produced by the reaction system, and (3), to accurately model an actual industrial slurry reaction using these same methods.

After a long organization period, the laser photolysis of DPA occluded in M 6. 6 ZSM- 5 generates long-lived DPA •+ radical cation as primary phenomenon. Charge recombination occurs mainly through electron transfer and DPA@M 6. 6 ZSM- 5 •−•+ electron–hole pair formation. This subsequent electron transfer takes place between the electron deficient radical cation DPA •+ and the electron donor oxygen atom of zeolite framework. The multivariate curve resolution analysis of the DRUVv spectra recorded during the reaction sequence including charge separation, electron transfer and charge recombination provide the specific absorption spectra and respective <b>spectral</b> <b>concentrations</b> of all species as function of time. The DRUVv spectrum assigned to the long-lived DPA@M 6. 6 ZSM- 5 •−•+ electron–hole pair exhibits broad bands between 450 and 550 nm. The electron–hole pair recombination depends on M + {{and appears to be}} in relation with the electron donor properties of the framework. The charge recombination rate decreases in the order Cs + > Rb + ~ K + > Na + > Li +. The electron–hole pair lifetime exceeds several hours at room temperature. The stabilization of DPA •+ -electron pair and DPA@M 6. 6 ZSM- 5 •−•+ electron–hole pair depends on the combined effects of confinement which dramatically reduces the DPA mobility in the zeolite void space and on the intrazeolithe electrostatic field of DPA@M n ZSM- 5 (M = Li +, Na +, K +, Rb +, Cs +) ...|$|R

The method is demonstrated with the determination of mixtures of chlorinated hydrocarbons by estimating the kinetic and spectral profiles of the chemical species formed in the Fujiwara reaction. The three key aspects of the proposed method are (1) the initial estimation of the kinetic concentration profiles from evolving factor analysis; (2) the implementation of an alternating and constrained least squares method to optimize the determination of both the <b>spectral</b> and <b>concentration</b> profiles of the species present in the reaction, and (3) {{the development of a}} quantitative approach based on the simultaneous analysis of standards and unknowns for the determination of the initial concentration of the analytes in the mixture...|$|R

In this section, I’ll begin by defining <b>spectral</b> <b>concentration</b> and then prove, following Kato, that it is implied by the existence of pseudo-eigenvectors.

Taking into account the high growth rate (about 105 /s), short relaxation distance (about 106 cm), and energy flux partition between the waves and the beam after relaxation (PKAW/PPB about 1), we conclude that PB-driven KAW instability is an efficient energy conversion mechanism in flaring loops.
