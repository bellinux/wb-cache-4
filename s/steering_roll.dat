40|$|Nothing is {{more vital}} to a {{spacecraft}} than power. Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) uses that power {{to provide a}} safe, reliable, and, most importantly, fuel efficient means to propel a spacecraft to its destination. The power performance of an SEP vehicle s solar arrays and electrical power system (EPS) is largely influenced by {{the environment in which}} the spacecraft is operating. One of the most important factors that determines solar array power performance is how directly the arrays are pointed to the sun. To get the most power from the solar arrays, the obvious solution is to point them directly at the sun at all times. Doing so is not a problem in deep space, as the environment and pointing conditions that a spacecraft faces are fairly constant and are easy to accommodate, if necessary. However, large and sometimes rapid variations in environmental and pointing conditions are experienced by Earth orbiting spacecraft. SEP spacecraft also have the additional constraint of needing to keep the thrust vector aligned with the velocity vector. Thus, it is important to analyze solar array power performance for any vehicle that spends an extended amount of time orbiting the Earth, and to determine how much off-pointing can be tolerated to produce the required power for a given spacecraft. This paper documents the benefits and drawbacks of perfectly pointing the solar arrays of an SEP spacecraft spiraling from Earth orbit, and how this might be accomplished. Benefits and drawbacks are defined in terms of vehicle mass, power, volume, complexity, and cost. This paper will also look at the application of various solar array pointing methods to future missions. One such pointing method of interest is called roll <b>steering.</b> <b>Roll</b> steering involves rolling the entire vehicle twice each orbit. Roll steering, combined with solar array gimbal tracking, is used to point the solar arrays perfectly towards the sun at all points in the orbit, while keeping the vehicle thrusters aligned in the velocity direction. Roll steering is particularly attractive for a recently proposed mission that involves a spiral trajectory from low Earth orbit (LEO) to the Earth-Moon Lagrange Point 1 (E-M L 1). During the spiral, the spacecraft will spend over 300 days experiencing the full spectrum of near-earth environments and solar array pointing conditions. An extensive study of the application of SEP (and roll steering) to this spiral mission is included, highlighting the ultimate goal of reduced vehicle cost and mass. Tools used for this analysis include the Systems Power Analysis for Capability Evaluation (Refs. 1 and 2) (SPACE) electrical power systems code, and SEP trajectory simulation tools developed at NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|E

The work reported here investigates control issues for a parafoil and payload system with {{left and right}} parafoil brakes used as the control mechanism. It is shown thatparafoilandpayloadsystems can exhibit two basicmodesof lateral control, namely,roll and skid steering. These twomodes of lateral steering generate lateral response in oppositedirections. For example, a roll steer con guration turns left when the right parafoil brake is activated, whereas a skid steer con guration turns right under the same control input. In transition between roll and skid lateral steering, the lateral response is zero, and the system becomes uncontrollable.

40|$|Roll {{stabilization}} (damping) is {{an important}} problem of ship motion control since excessive roll motion may cause motion sickness of human occupants and damage fragile cargo. This problem becomes especially non-trivial in situations where the same actuators are used for the vessel's roll and yaw stabilization. To keep the "trade-off" between the concurrent goals of accurate course <b>steering</b> and <b>roll</b> stabilization, an optimization problem is usually solved where the cost functional penalizes the <b>roll</b> angle, the <b>steering</b> error and the control effort. Since the vessel's motion {{is influenced by the}} uncertain wave disturbance, the optimal value of this functional and the optimal process are also uncertain. A standard approach, prevailing in the literature, is to approximate the wave disturbance by the "colored noise" with a known spectral density, reducing the optimization problem to conventional LQG control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimal roll damping, approximating the disturbance by the polyharmonic signal with known frequencies yet uncertain amplitudes and phase shifts. For this class of external disturbances, an optimal universal controller (OUC) can be found. Unlike the LQG controller, minimizing only the expected value of the cost function, the OUC delivers the optimal solution for any uncertain parameters of the signal.

40|$|There {{are still}} {{important}} knowledge gaps regarding stability {{and safety of}} bicycle riding. Every year around 60, 000 people need hospital treatment for single sided accidents in the Netherlands alone. Supporting the need for understanding lateral bicycle dynamics. One of the prominent disturbances on lateral bicycle and rider behaviour is pedalling. However, {{although there is a}} good understanding of the determinants effecting the forward or propulsive behaviour of the bicycle associated with pedalling, the effect on the lateral bicycle and rider behaviour is still poorly understood. This study focusses on determining what the effect of pedalling is on the lateral behaviour of the bicycle-rider system. This determination is three fold. First the nature of the pedalling disturbance and parameters influencing it is ascertained. This is used to develop a pedalling disturbance model which can be easily applied to any dynamical bicycle-rider model, by applying harmonic external torques on the <b>steering</b> and <b>roll</b> of the bicycle. Secondly the direct response of this pedalling disturbance of the bicycle-rider system is ascertained for a variety of models and cycling conditions. This is achieved by applying the pedalling disturbance to multiple bicycle-rider models for multiple cycling conditions. Methods, with various model complexity and solution approaches, are evaluated. Based on this evaluation we propose a simple and effective method of analytically obtaining a periodic solution based on a linearised time-invariant bicycle-rider system. This periodic solution represents the open loop lateral bicycle response corresponding to the periodic pedalling disturbance. Thirdly the overall effect of pedalling, the closed loop response, is ascertained using experimental data. Specific cycling conditions are chosen to validate the open loop response of the model, since these cycling conditions should be only minimally effected by control. The experimental data corresponding to other cycling conditions are explored for parameter dependence and influence of control and upper body motions. The nature of the pedalling disturbance is now understood. The pedalling disturbance is determined by vertical and the forward acceleration of the left and right leg centre of mass, the leg mass, the hip width and the cadence. This motion of mass promotes roll and yaw disturbances, where the yaw disturbance can be translated to a steering disturbance by bicycle parameters defining yaw-steering coupling. The direct lateral response and the overall lateral bicycle-rider behaviour due to pedalling are explored. This uncovered parameter dependencies of the bicycle-rider system, differences due to rider upper body movements, rider control and cycling conditions such as forward speed and cadence. We developed and validated a simple method of ascertaining the direct effect of a pedalling disturbance on the lateral behaviour of a bicycle-rider system. This is done by applying harmonic <b>steering</b> and <b>roll</b> toques to an easily obtained time-invariant linearised bicycle model. Some bicycle-rider combinations exhibit resonance behaviour due to pedalling within the normal cycling range, this model could be used to slightly change bicycle design parameters such that this dangerous behaviour is avoided.

40|$|The major {{advantage}} of a motorcycle {{with respect to a}} passenger car is the possibility of the driver to tilt during cornering and thereby maintaining stability whereas a passenger car will suffer from the risk of capsizing at high speed. This observation has motivated recently various manufacturers to develop new concepts of narrow vehicles that are able to tilt like a motorcycle but offer the comfort of a passenger car, allowing further downsizing of vehicles enabling higher fuel efficiency. As a result, there seems to arise a whole new class of vehicles, which cannot be compared, to either passenger cars or motorcycles, with typical examples such as the Ford Gyron and the GM Lean Machine. More recent examples are the Daimler Benz Life Jet and the Carver of Brink Dynamics. This paper includes a mathematical treatment of the dynamic behaviour of such vehicles, denoted here as a Narrow Tilting Vehicle (NTV). The analysis is based on a vehicle concept consisting of three main rigid bodies, a front assembly (front fork), a mid-assembly (passenger cabin) and a two-wheeled rear-assembly (engine, rear part of chassis including rear suspension, wheels, etc.). Important criteria for the designer are a stable behaviour and, on the other hand, a smooth, responsive cornering performance. As it turns out, various eigenmodes related to yaw, <b>steering</b> and <b>roll</b> behaviour of the vehicle are working against each other in this respect. Obviously, many vehicle design parameters play an important role where which {{have a major impact on}} the vehicle behaviour. One might distinguish the overall dimensions, mass distribution, front-fork geometry, tyre characteristics, suspension layout, the tilting controller design, etc. Due to the large variety in parameter-combinations, sensitivity regarding one single parameter always depends on the selected reference case for the remaining parameters, and therefore cannot be extrapolated easily to reach its optimal value. In the paper, the design parameters having a major impact on the vehicle performance are identified. The impact of parameter modifications on the vehicle stability and handling performance is discussed on the basis of mathematical analysis, and interpreted in physical terms (supported by numerical analysis and experimental results). That means that, finally, tendencies in changes in vehicle performance can be and resulting in general guidelines for the design of this new class of vehicle...|$|R
