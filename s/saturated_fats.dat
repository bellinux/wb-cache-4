Those who eat a diet high in <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharide) have a higher risk. The Mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and trans fats. Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats {{has been linked to}} a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom, National Health Service {{claims the}} {{majority}} of UK people eat too much <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> The British Heart Foundation also advises people {{to cut down on}} <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> People are advised to cut down on <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> and read labels on food they buy.|$|R

25|$|Various fats contain {{different}} {{proportions of}} <b>saturated</b> and unsaturated <b>fat.</b> Examples of foods containing {{a high proportion}} of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol. Certain vegetable products have high <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Many prepared foods are high in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, and sausage.|$|R
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
25|$|While {{consumption}} of {{small amounts of}} <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> is common in diets, meta-analyses found a significant correlation between high {{consumption of}} <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and blood LDL concentration, {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular diseases. Other meta-analyses based on cohort studies and on controlled, randomized trials found a positive, or neutral, effect from consuming polyunsaturated fats instead of <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> (a 10% lower risk for 5% replacement).|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Those having lower amounts of <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E
40|$|Recent meta-analyses {{have found}} no {{association}} between heart disease and dietary saturated fat; however, higher proportions of plasma saturated fatty acids (SFA) predict greater risk for developing type- 2 diabetes and heart disease. These observations suggest a disconnect between dietary <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> and plasma SFA, but few controlled feeding studies have specifically examined how varying <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake across a broad range affects circulating SFA levels. Sixteen adults with metabolic syndrome (age 44. 9 ยก 9. 9 yr, BMI 37. 9 ยก 6. 3 kg/m 2) were fed six 3 -wk diets that progressively increased carbohydrate (from 47 to 346 g/day) with concomitant decreases in total and <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Despite a distinct increase in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake from baseline to the low-carbohydrate diet (46 to 84 g/day), and then a gradual decrease in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> to 32 g/day at the highest carbohydrate phase, {{there were no significant}} changes in the proportion of total SFA in any plasma lipid fractions. Whereas plasma <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> remained relatively stable, the proportion of palmitoleic acid in plasma triglyceride and cholesteryl ester wa...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> on risk of disease is controversial. Many reviews {{recommend}} a diet low in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> and argue it will lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or death.

25|$|The French paradox implies two {{important}} possibilities. The {{first is that}} the hypothesis linking <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the French diet or lifestyle mitigates this riskโpresumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it {{can be incorporated into}} the diet and lifestyle of other countries, with the same lifesaving implications observed in France. Both possibilities have generated considerable media interest, as well as some scientific research.|$|E
25|$|Nutritionists {{also agree}} on the {{importance}} of avoiding fats, especially <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> to reduce weight and to be healthier. They also {{agree on the}} importance of reducing salt intake because foods including snacks, biscuits, and bread already contain ocean-salt, contributing to an excess of salt daily intake.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of the French paradox has caused some researchers to speculate that the link between dietary consumption of <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and coronary heart disease {{might not be as}} strong as had previously been imagined. This has resulted in a review of the earlier studies which had suggested this link.|$|E
25|$|That {{study also}} {{suggests}} that <b>fat</b> and <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> are not likely contributors to pancreatic cancer.

25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of doctors and medical scientists consider that there is a link between cholesterol and atherosclerosis as discussed above, a 2014 meta-analysis of over 500,000 patients concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> for cardiovascular health.|$|E
25|$|Production of {{hydrogenated}} fats increased steadily until the 1960s, as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries.

40|$|Trimming fat {{off meat}} is {{recommended}} for reducing intake of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> This paper reviews trends over 20 years that have influenced the red meat supply in response to consumer and health professional demands for lean meat, drawing on published survey data, marketing information, analysis of meat content and qualitative research commission by Meat and Livestock Australia. Separable fat is the greatest determinant of the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> in Australian red meat, and changes in processing and butchering practices have combined to produce red meat today with significantly lower <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Nutrient analyses in 2002 showed that the separable fat on raw retail samples was up to 38 % less than in comparable cuts in 1983. Further trimming by consumers prior to consumption is also increasing. In 2007, 89 % of consumers reported buying trimmed meat or removing some or all fat prior to consumption. The 1995 National Nutrition Survey showed that red meat contributed less than 10 % of dietary <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake in Australia, and continues to make {{an important contribution to}} intake of iron, zinc, omega- 3 and vitamin B 12, as well as encouraging consumption of vegetables. Deitary messages and strategies for reducing <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> have increased fat trimming practices by retailers as well as consumers. Consequently, trimmed red meat is not a major source of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> in the Australian diet. To avoid overestimating total and <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake, dietary advice and analyses should ensure data reflects red meat as consumed rather than as purchased...|$|R

25|$|The Australian federal {{government}} has indicated that it wants to pursue actively a policy of reducing trans fats from fast foods.

40|$|OBJECTIVE This article {{investigates the}} effects of a brief {{psychological}} intervention-implementation intentions training-on the reduction of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake among patients after myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS One hundred fourteen patients who had experienced a first uncomplicated MI took part in the study. Data were collected at approximately 1 week after MI, 2 weeks after short-term Phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation (approximately 2 months after MI), and 6 months after rehabilitation (8 months after MI). After data collection at 2 weeks after rehabilitation, patients were randomly assigned to the control group or the intervention group (an individually delivered implementation intentions training). Daily <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake was used as the primary outcome; total fat intake and percentage of calories from fat were secondary outcomes. RESULTS Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant TimexGroup interaction: Compared to time before MI, patients in both groups reported a decrease in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake at 2 weeks after rehabilitation. Those who participated in the implementation intentions intervention were able to further decrease <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake from 22. 88 g at 2 months after MI to 19. 71 g at 8 months after MI. Patients from the control group maintained the same level of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake at 2 months after MI (mean= 22. 30) and 6 months later (mean= 22. 47).
