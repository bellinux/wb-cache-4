40|$|In this work, {{we examine}} the kink-nucleation process in BCC screw dislocations using atomistic {{simulation}} and transition pathway analysis, with a particular focus on the compact core structure. We observe {{the existence of a}} threshold stress, which results in an abrupt change in the minimum energy path of the kink-nucleation process, and hence, a discontinuity in the activation energy versus stress for the process. The magnitude of the discontinuity is found {{to be related to the}} degree of metastability of an intermediate <b>split-core</b> structure. This feature appears to be a direct consequence of the so-called ‘camel-hump’ nature of the Peierls potential, which manifests itself in the existence of a metastable, intermediate <b>split-core</b> structure. The effect is observed in a number of empirical EAM potentials, including Fe, Ta, V, Nb and Mo, suggesting a generality to the observations.

The presence of high strength material at shallow penetration depths is confirmed through laboratory mini-ball penetration and Cam-shear testing.

Results from initial Cam-shear tests comparing reconstituted sterile and bacterially-inoculated samples are presented.

40|$|Systems {{and methods}} for {{implementing}} line overload control via providing distributed series impedance are disclosed. One system, amongst others, comprises {{at least one}} distributed series reactor (DSR). Each DSR comprises a single turn transformer (SST) comprising two <b>split-core</b> sections (132), a winding (120), and an air-gap (138), the air-gap designed such that a magnetizing inductance is produced when the two <b>split-core</b> sections (132) are clamped around a conductor (108). Each DSR further comprises a contact switch (122) that short circuits the winding when the contact switch (122) is in a closed condition, a power supply (128) that derives power from conductor line current, and a controller (130) configured to open the contact switch when the conductor line current reaches a predetermined value, thus causing insertion of the magnetizing inductance into the conductor.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a magnetic field on the shape and director field of nematic droplets in dispersions of sterically stabilized and charge-stabilized colloidal gibbsite platelets with a negative diamagnetic anisotropy. Depending on the magnetic field strength and tactoid size, we observe with polarized light microscopy several interesting structures, with different shapes and director fields both with and without defects. In particular, our findings provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of the <b>split-core</b> defect structure predicted ten years ago by Mkaddem and Gartland [Phys. Rev. E 62, 6694 (2000) ]. The <b>split-core</b> structure is a metastable director-field configuration that can be stabilized by a sufficiently strong externally applied magnetic field but only if the diamagnetic anisotropy of the particles is negative. To account for our observations, we present a calculation of the stability regions of different shapes and director-field structures as a function of tactoid size, anchoring conditions, surface tension, elastic constants, and magnetic field strength. By fitting the experimental data to the theoretically predicted structures, we are able to extract values for the splay elastic constant, interfacial tension, and anchoring strength. Remarkably, we find {{significant differences between the two}} systems studied: for sterically stabilized gibbsite in bromotoluene the anchoring strength is one order of magnitude larger than that of aqueous gibbsite, with the latter exhibiting weak and the former strong anchoring of the director field to the interface. The splay elastic constants that we obtain are in agreement with earlier experiments, simulations, and theory, while the interfacial tension and anchoring strength are considerably larger than what was found in earlier experiments...|$|E
40|$|Thick Holocene {{sedimentary}} sections (> 45 m) cored in the Palmer Deep by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) {{and during}} Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 178 provide {{the first opportunity}} to examine past geomagnetic field behavior at high southern latitudes. After removal of a low-coercivity drilling overprint the sediments display a stable, single-component remanent magnetization. Two short cores that recovered the uppermost 2. 6 m of sediment have inclinations that fluctuate about the present day inclination (- 57 °) measured at Faraday Station, and several features with wavelengths of 10 to 20 cm appear to be correlative. However, shipboard measurements of inclination fluctuations on <b>split-core</b> samples from three holes drilled at ODP Site 1098 do not correlate well with each other, even though the intensity and susceptibility data correlate very well and the overall mean inclination for cores from each hole {{is consistent with the}} expected geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination. The correlation is improved dramatically by using inclinations measured on u-channels taken from the pristine center of a split core. Consequently, the anomalous directions and the resulting poor between-hole correlation of inclinations obtained from shipboard data can be attributed to coring-induced deformation, which is common on the outer edge of ODP piston cores, and/or measurement artifacts in the <b>split-core</b> data. Our preferred inclination record is thus derived from u-channel results. The upper ~ 25 m represents continuous sedimentation over the past 9000 yr, with an average sedimentation rate exceeding 250 cm/kyr (0. 25 cm/yr). Given that remanence measurements on u-channels average over an interval < 7 cm long, we obtained independent measurements of the paleo-geomagnetic field that average over only ~ 30 yr. This high-resolution record is characterized by an inclination that fluctuates within +/- 15 ° of the current GAD inclination...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} have been traditional users of eddy-current technology in nondestructive evaluation (NDE).

40|$|Two-dimensional {{simulations}} of the coarsening {{process of the}} isotropic/smectic-A phase transition are presented using a high-order Landau-de Gennes type free energy model. Defect annihilation laws for smectic disclinations, elementary dislocations, and total dislocation content are determined. The computed evolution of the orientational correlation length and disclination density {{is found to be}} in agreement with previous experimental observations showing that disclination interactions dominate the coarsening process. The mechanism of smectic disclination movement, limited by the absorption and emission of elementary dislocations, is found to be facilitated by curvature walls connecting interacting disclinations. At intermediate times in the coarsening process, <b>split-core</b> dislocation formation and interactions displaying an effective disclination quadrupole configuration are observed. This work provides the framework for further understanding of the formation and dynamics of the diverse set of curvature defects observed in smectic liquid crystals and other layered material systems...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} Frank-Oseen {{elasticity}} theory for {{the shape and}} structure of deformable nematic droplets with homeotropic surface anchoring {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Inspired by recent experimental observations, we focus on the case where the magnetic susceptibility is negative, and find that small drops have a lens shape with a homogeneous director field for any magnetic-field strength, whereas larger drops are spherical and have a radial director field, at least if the magnetic field is weak. For strong magnetic fields the hedgehog configuration transforms into a <b>split-core</b> line defect that, depending on the anchoring strength, can be accompanied by an elongation of the tactoid itself. We present a three-dimensional phase diagram that shows the tactoid shape and director field for a given anchoring strength, tactoid size, and magnetic-field strength. Our findings rationalize the different shapes and structures that recently have been observed experimentally for nematic droplets found in dispersions of gibbsite platelets in two types of solvent...|$|E
40|$|We used paleomagnetic {{results from}} Sites 998, 999, 1000, and 1001 to {{estimate}} the paleolatitude of the Caribbean region over the past 80 m. y. The data include remanence measurements of <b>split-core</b> sections (typically 1. 5 m long) and discrete samples (6 - 12 cm** 3 in volume) from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. From these, we computed 15 new paleolatitude estimates for Sites 999 and 1001 on the Caribbean plate and three new paleolatitude estimates for Site 998 on the Cayman Rise, currently on the southern North American plate. One estimate from Site 1001 is based on 230 measurements made along <b>split-core</b> sections of basalt after demagnetization of 20 - 25 mT. The other 17 estimates are based on principal component analysis of demagnetization data from 438 discrete paleomagnetic samples from sedimentary units. Where necessary, the 18 new paleolatitude estimates are corrected for a polarity ambiguity bias that occurs when averaging paleomagnetic data from drill cores that have shallow inclinations and are not azimuthally oriented. We also investigated the contribution of additional biases that may arise from a compaction-related inclination error, which could affect the sedimentary units, though not the basalt units. Several lines of evidence, including {{the lack of a}} correlation between porosity (or water content) and inclination, indicate that the inclination error is small, if present at all. The results from Sites 999 and 1001 indicate that the Caribbean plate was 5 °- 15 ° south of its current position at ~ 80 Ma, possibly placing it directly over the equator in the Late Cretaceous. Although the data do not preclude changes in the rate of northward motion over the past 80 m. y., they are consistent with a constant northward progression at a rate of 18 km/m. y. Given the uncertainties in the data, rates of northward motion could be as low as 8 km/m. y. or as high as 22 km/m. y. These results are compatible with several existing models for the evolution of the Caribbean plate, including those that have the Caribbean plate originating in the Pacific Ocean west of subduction zones active in the Central American region during the Cretaceous, and those that have the Caribbean plate originating within the Central American region, though more than 1000 km west of its current position relative to North and South America...|$|E
40|$|For {{wireless}} {{sensor node}} (WSN) applications, {{this paper presents}} the harvesting of energy from the stray electromagnetic field around an electrical power line. Inductive and capacitive types of electrodynamic energy harvesters are developed and reported. For the produced energy harvesters, solid core and <b>split-core</b> designs are adopted. The inductive energy harvester comprises a copper wound coil which is produced on a mild steel core. However, the capacitive prototypes comprise parallel, annular discs separated by Teflon spacers. Moreover, for the inductive energy harvesters’ wound coil and core, the parametric analysis is also performed. A Teflon housing is incorporated to protect the energy harvester prototypes from the harsh environmental conditions. Among the inductive energy harvesters, prototype- 5 has performed {{better than the other}} harvesters and produces a maximum rms voltage of 908 [*]mV at the current level of 155 [*]A in the power line.

40|$|Sediments in the {{southeast}} Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean were cored during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 177 to study the paleoceanographic history of the Antarctic region on short (millennial) to long (Cenozoic) timescales. Seven sites were drilled along a north-south transect across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) from 41 ° to 53 °S. The general goals of Leg 177 were twofold: (1) to document the biostratigraphic, biogeographic, and paleoceanographic history of the Paleogene and early Neogene, a period marked by {{the establishment of the}} Antarctic cryosphere and the ACC, and (2) to target expanded sections of late Neogene sediments, which can be used to resolve the timing of Southern Hemisphere climatic events on orbital and suborbital time scales (Gersonde, Hodell, Blum, et al., 1999, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. ir. 177. 1999). Closely spaced measurements of sedimentary physical properties were obtained from all cores recovered during Leg 177 using the ODP whole-round multisensor track. In addition, high-resolution diffuse color reflectance and resistivity measurements were collected on the Oregon State University Split Core Analysis Track. These whole-core and <b>split-core</b> measurements provide high-resolution proxy data sets for the estimation of biogenic and terrigenous mineralogy and mass flux. To assist investigators in calibrating these proxy data sets from sites located within the circum-Antarctic opal belt, samples from Sites 1093 (50 °S) and 1094 (53 °S) were analyzed for biogenic opal content...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for in situ diagnostic testing of dc-actuated solenoid-operated valves (SOVs) by analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the transient current waveform accompanying valve actuation. This waveform, which is used to identify abnormal operation, is obtained inductively by a small <b>split-core</b> current transformer clamped around one of the valve`s solenoid leads. The digitized waveforms are subsequently compared with similar waveforms obtained when the valve was known to be operating normally, and the results used to detect faulty valve operation. This methodology is noninvasive because direct access to the SOV is not required; also, the current transformer has negligible effect on the solenoid current and does not require the lifting of any electrical leads. Analysis is performed by first extracting various waveform features. A subset of these features is examined by diagnostic algorithms, tuned to identify faults for that valve type, that compare the features with those obtained from a previously acquired waveform for the particular valve under examination. Two methods of analysis have been examined. One utilizes fuzzy logic in an expert system diagnostic. The other performs pattern recognition using an artificial neural network approach. The overall analysis is robust in that it can deal with minor deviations of the waveform shape experienced during repeated operation of a normal valve while successfully identifying abnormal valve operation. In the present application, analysis has been specialized to SOVs used on space-based systems; however, the methodology has sufficient flexibility to be applicable {{to a wide variety of}} valves and other industrial electrically controlled components...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a non-contact approach to whole-core and <b>split-core</b> resistivity measurements, imaging a 15 mm-thick, dipping, conductive layer, producing a continuous log {{of the whole}} core and enabling {{the development of a}} framework to allow representative plugs to be taken, for example. Applications include mapping subtle changes in grain fabric (e. g. grain shape) caused by variable sedimentation rates, for example, as well as the well-known dependencies on porosity and water saturation. The method operates at relatively low frequencies (i. e. low induction numbers), needing highly sensitive coil pairs to provide resistivity measurements at the desired resolution. A four-coil arrangement of two pairs of transmitter and receiver coils is used to stabilize the measurement. One ‘coil pair’ acts as a control, enabling the effects of local environmental variations, which can be considerable, to be removed from the measurement at source. Comparing our non-contact approach and independent traditional ‘galvanic’ resistivity measurements indicates that the non-contact measurements are directly proportional to the reciprocal of the sample resistivity (i. e. conductivity). The depth of investigation is discussed in terms of both theory and practical measurements, and the response of the technique to a variety of synthetic ‘structures’ is presented. We demonstrate the potential of the technique for rapid electrical imaging of core and present a whole-core image of a dipping layer with azimuthal discrimination at a resolution of the order of 10 mm. Consequently, the technique could be used to investigate different depths within the core, in agreement with theoretical predictions. ...|$|E
40|$|Lonestone abundances in CRP- 1 were {{investigated}} using three methods: core examination at Cape Roberts Camp, analysis of digital core images and follow-up core examination. For all images of <b>split-core,</b> we determined size {{and depth of}} every detectable lonestone larger than 3 mm. Lonestone abundance decreases exponentially with clast size. Although no significant depth-dependent variations in lonestone size distribution were detected, a strong 0. 5 - 0. 7 m abundance periodicity, of unknown origin, is evident within diamicts. Lonestone volume percentage was estimated from size distribution: most size classes contribute approximately the same volume to the total. Sizes > 16 mm have rare enough lonestones that their counts are nonrepresentative when based on short intervals of split core. This problem does not affect total counts significantly, but the volume analysis needs to be confined to <= 6 mm lonestones to avoid instability induced by rare and nonrepresentative larger lonestones. If lonestone abundance {{can be used as}} an indicator of glacial proximity, then our CRP- 1 lonestone abundance logs confirm the overall character of previously inferred variations in relative distance to the ice margin. Large-scale changes in lonestone abundance also reflect the CRP- 1 sequence stratigraphy, with individual sequences generally characterised by basal lonestone-rich diamict overlain by lonestone-poor sands and muds. The relationship between glacial proximity and lonestone abundance within diamicts and within sand-mud intervals is, however, less certain. For example, two or three gradual lonestone increases may indicate regressions during glacial advances, in contrast to the more common CRP-l pattern of dominantly transgressive sequences...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 776 {{sediment}} samples were measured for percent CaCO 3 using a coulometer. These data are compared with percent blue reflectance (450 - 550 nm) measured with the Oregon State University <b>split-core</b> analysis track. In previous studies percent blue reflectance {{has been an}} excellent proxy for percent CaCO 3 and in this study shows many of the main depositional trends (i. e., a 100 -k. y. cycle, with a 55 % reflectance range {{is evident in the}} upper 900 k. y., underlain by sediments exhibiting a 40 -k. y. cycle with only a 30 % reflectance range). Between ~ 21 and 5 Ma the average percent reflectance decreases from ~ 35 % to ~ 8 %. A similar decrease is also recorded between ~ 24 and 22 Ma. Percent CaCO 3 trends closely match those of the percent blue spectral reflectance. This is especially well shown in the 100 -k. y. cyclicity and in the interval between 24. 5 and 21. 5 Ma. In both intervals CaCO 3 analyses are abundant. An exception occurs in the interval between 2 and 5 meters composite depth (~ 193 and 240 k. y.). There, percent CaCO 3 and percent reflectance are out of phase. The lack of agreement {{is not likely to be}} due to a very wet core, in which water would dominate the spectral reflectance instead of sediment, or to problems with the composite depth slice. The discrepancy remains unexplained and provides clear evidence that when noninvasive measurements are used as proxies for chemical measurements they must be substantiated by the actual chemical or physical measurements...|$|E
40|$|Sum {{rules for}} {{magnetic}} x-ray dichroism, relating the signals of the spin-orbit split core level absorption edges to the ground-state spin and orbital operators, {{are expressed in}} jj-coupled operators. These sum rules {{can be used in}} the region of intermediate coupling by taking into account the cross term between the j=l+/- 1 / 2 ground-state levels and are, therefore, particularly useful in the study of actinides. The calculated expectation values for the ground-state moments of the actinide ions in intermediate coupling show that the spin-orbit-induced operators, such as the magnetic-dipole term, differ strongly from their Hund's rule ground-state values. We also prove the general rule that, when there is a perturbing interaction which is weak compared to the spin-orbit interaction, the ratio of operators with the same total moment remains constant. This rendition is usually fulfilled for the crystal-field interaction in the lanthanides and actinides. The values of the ground-state moments as a function off count give rise to an interesting trend in the dichroism of the spin-orbit <b>split-core</b> edges. The branching ratio of the 3 d and 4 d circular dichroism signal gradually increases from nearly zero for 5 f(1) to similar to 0. 4 for 5 f(5) and is close to unity for a more than half-filled shell. The unusual behavior of the branching ratio can be related to the higher (lower) value of the magnetic dipole term, Ti, for a less (more) than half-filled shell of the actinides in the presence of spin-orbit interaction. Uranium compounds will have a much larger value of T-z than the corresponding 4 f compounds. Its precise value {{can be used as a}} measure for the f count...|$|E
40|$|Live working is {{not useful}} for line or {{substation}} maintenance activities only, {{although this is}} the more common application: other practices are made possible too, such as measurement devices installation. Besides well known donuts for line temperature measurement, other new, important applications are currently being developed, {{such as the one}} here presented: the live working installation of a reference measuring system for on-site accuracy check of instrument transformers. The reference system is composed by live-installable transducers for voltage and current (a capacitive-resistive voltage divider and a <b>split-core,</b> openable Rogowski coil), optical data transmission and a data acquisition and analysis system. The reference voltage divider can be installed using a hand operated “distance” technique, by means of a copper plait inserted in a reel connected to a short-circuit device, while the Rogowski coil can be positioned with a bare-hand technique. The innovative methodology was set up and successfully experimented in Italian Rondissone HV substation in the frame of a research project led by CESI S. p. A. Innovation is not related to intervention typology, common to a lot of live working activities, but to to installed measurement apparatus features, allowing to avoid service interruption during insertion operations. This work has been supported by MAP (Italian Ministry for Productive Activities) in the frame of Public Interest Energy Research Project named "Ricerca di Sistema" (MAP Decree of February 28 th, 2003). 1 Foreword HV instrument transformers accuracy may deteriorate with ageing, as demonstrated by recent studies and laboratory tests [1]. The reduction of the instrument transformers accuracy causes slight unbalances in power measurement, which may translate into heavy unbalances in energy measurement and, consequently, in money flows associated with metering and energy trading. Moreover, for transparency and correctness reasons, to all electricity market actors should be granted the right of being able to check, at scheduled time intervals or whenever desired, that HV components of energy measurement chains be accurate, exactly as happens for the LV ones (meters). In the past this was possible only theoretically, since service removal was necessary for current transformers and often for voltage transformers too, adding to the cost...|$|E
40|$|As part of Ocean Drilling Program Leg 204 at {{southern}} Hydrate Ridge off Oregon we have monitored changes in sediment electrical resistivity during controlled gas hydrate dissociation experiments. Two cores were used, each filled with gas hydrate bearing sediments(predominantly mud/silty mud). One core was from Site 1249 (1249 F- 9 H 3), 42. 1 m below seafloor (mbsf) {{and the other}} from Site 1248 (1248 C- 4 X 1), 28. 8 mbsf. At Site 1247, a third experiment was conducted on a core without gas hydrate (1247 B- 2 H 1, 3. 6 mbsf). First, the cores were imaged using an infra-red (IR) camera upon recovery to map the gas hydrate occurrence through dissociation cooling. Over {{a period of several}} hours, successive runs on the multi-sensor track (includes sensors for P-wave velocity, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and gamma-ray density) were carried out complemented by X-ray imaging on core 1249 F- 9 H 3. After complete equilibration to room temperature (17 - 18 8 C) and complete gas hydrate dissociation, the final measurement of electrical resistivity was used to calculate pore-water resistivity and salinities. The calculated pore-water freshening after dissociation is equivalent to a gas hydrate concentration in situ of 35 - 70 % along core 1249 F- 9 H 3 and 20 - 35 % for core 1248 C- 4 X 1 assuming seawater salinity of in situ pore fluid. Detailed analysis of the IR scan, X-ray images and <b>split-core</b> photographs showed the hydrate mainly occurred disseminated throughout the core. Additionally, in core 1249 F- 9 H 3, a single hydrate filled vein, approximately 10 cm long and dipping at about 658, was identified. Analyses of the logging-while-drilling (LWD) resistivity data revealed a structural dip of 40 - 808 in the interval between 40 and 44 mbsf. We further analyzed all resistivity data measured on the recovered core during Leg 204. Generally poor data quality due to gas cracks allowed analyses to be carried out only at selected intervals at Sites 1244, 1245, 1246, 1247, 1248, 1249, and 1252. With a few exceptions, data from these intervals yield low to no gas hydrate concentration, which corresponds to estimates from downhole resistivity logs. However, since the gas cracking {{may be the result of}} gas hydrate dissociation, this is a biased sampling. Cores that had contained some gas hydrate may have been excluded...|$|E
