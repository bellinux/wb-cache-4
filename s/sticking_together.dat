5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from <b>sticking</b> <b>together.</b> The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
25|$|Atoms <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> in {{molecules}} or crystals {{are said}} to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them. More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.|$|E

25|$|Azeotropes {{can form}} {{only when a}} mixture {{deviates}} from Raoult's law. Raoult's law applies when the molecules of the constituents stick to each other {{to the same degree}} as they do to themselves. For example, if the constituents are X and Y, then X sticks to Y with roughly equal energy as X does with X and Y does with Y. A positive deviation from Raoult's law results when the constituents have a disaffinity for each other – that is X sticks to X and Y to Y better than X sticks to Y. Because this results in the mixture having less total <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> of the molecules than the pure constituents, they more readily escape from the stuck-together phase, which is to say the liquid phase, and into the vapor phase. When X sticks to Y more aggressively than X does to X and Y does to Y, the result is a negative deviation from Raoult's law. In this case because there is more <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> of the molecules in the mixture than in the pure constituents, they are more reluctant to escape the stuck-together liquid phase.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{strategy}} is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork {{will be seen}} {{at the beginning of}} the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and {{strategy is}} seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.|$|E
25|$|CIDR1 {{protein in}} the semi-conserved head {{structure}} {{is the principal}} and best understood adhesion site of PfEMP1. It binds with CD36 on endothelial cells. Only group B and C proteins are able to bind, and that too with only those having CIDRα2-6 sequence types. On the other hand, group A proteins have either CIDRα1 or CIDRβ/γ/δ, and {{they are responsible for}} the most severe condition of malaria. Binding with ICAM1 is achieved through the DBLβ domain adjacent to the head structure. However, many PfEMP1s having DBLβ domain do not bind to ICAM1, and it appears that only the DBLβ paired with C2 domain can to bind to ICAM1. The DBLα-CIDRγ tandem pair is the main factor for rosetting, <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> the infected RBC with the uninfected cells, and thereby clogging of the blood vessels. This activity is performed through binding with CR1.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, rats did not {{directly}} start {{the spread of the}} bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person, and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.|$|E

500|$|The Giro's eighteenth {{stage was}} a [...] {{individual}} time trial that stretched from Chiavari {{to the summit}} finish on the Passo del Bocco. The race leader Evgeni Berzin won the stage by twenty seconds over Miguel Indurain. Stage 19 saw the day of racing {{come down to a}} sprint finish that was won by Massimo Ghirotto. The twentieth stage saw the Giro race through the Alps and up to the summit of Les Deux Alpes for the stage finish. The lead group up Les Deux Alpes contained the likes of Evgeni Berzin, Marco Pantani, and Miguel Indurain who had attacked each other multiple times but to no avail. The trio was later joined by Vladimir Poulnikov and Nelson Rodriguez who both eventually left them to go on for the stage win. Poulkinov edged out Rodriguez to the stage win atop the mountain. The penultimate stage of the Giro saw a summit finish atop the Sestriere. The stage saw snow and chilling temperatures which led to the general classification contenders <b>sticking</b> <b>together,</b> while Pascal Richard {{went on to win the}} summit finish and solidify his lead atop the mountains classification. The Giro's final stage came down to a sprint finish that was won by Stefano Zanini as Evgeni Berzin won the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

2500|$|Krill {{are thought}} to undergo between one and three {{vertical}} migrations from mixed surface waters to depth each day. The krill is a very untidy feeder, and it often spits out aggregates of phytoplankton (spit balls) containing thousands of cells <b>sticking</b> <b>together.</b> It also produces fecal strings that still contain significant amounts of carbon and the glass shells of the diatoms. Both are heavy and sink very fast into the abyss. This process is called the biological pump.

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the cold end just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold end coating. At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E

However, in contrast to his freebooting style, his pilots always flew in disciplined formations in practice, and he repeatedly drilled them in his tactics. Among them were his famed combat rules, called [...] "Boelcke's Dicta", which were the first systematic analysis of air combat and continued to be applicable through World War II. Despite his run of personal successes, Boelcke's attitude is best expressed thus, in his own words: [...] "Everything depends on <b>sticking</b> <b>together</b> when the Staffel goes into battle. It does not matter who actually scores the victory as long as the Staffel wins." [...] He not only preached this doctrine to his own [...] "cubs"; he proselytized throughout the Luftstreitkräfte.
