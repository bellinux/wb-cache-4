5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from <b>seepage</b> <b>water,</b> even under severe seismic loading.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in karst environments has provided {{an assessment of}} the vulnerability of karst water and the study of PAH records in stalagmites. The major source of PAHs has generally been considered to be the soil. In this study, we report the quantification of PAHs in the ecosystem compartments of a mountain karst system over a snow-melting period and the spring to summer dry period. PAH profiles in karst <b>seepage</b> <b>waters</b> were consistently similar to those in wet deposits, following the change in PAH profiles between winter and summer periods. However, PAH signatures of atmospheric wet deposits were modulated by a loss of the high molecular weight PAHs, which appear to accumulate in soils. A PAH mass balance was calculated during a summer storm event. This mass balance suggests that dry deposits and canopy throughfall could account for the PAH abundance in karst <b>seepage</b> <b>waters.</b> This study demonstrates the ability of organic hydrophobic compounds to be directly transferred from the atmosphere or canopy into <b>seepage</b> <b>waters,</b> giving new emphasis to the study of PAHs recorded in stalagmites...|$|R

On 31 December 2004, the HKSAR Government set up the Joint Office to deal with the complaints of <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> {{in buildings}} and to carry out investigations. With over 25, 000 complaints each year, it is necessary to review and develop technologies {{to address the problem of}} <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> in buildings. Common methods of investigation are dye test, protimeter measurement, infrared thermography and microwave moisture measurement. With the purposes of issuing a notice, an order, a charge, or to satisfy the burden of proof in civil proceedings, the standard of investigating <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> has to one with high degree of certainty. Such standard is generally unachievable due to, inter alia, (a) inability to identify the source(s) /cause(s) of <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> and (b) non-corporation of owners/occupiers of premises alleged of causing <b>water</b> <b>seepage.</b> In respect of (a), it depends on the condition of the affected areas; how the tests are performed; and correct interpretation of the test results. To improve the methods of investigating <b>water</b> <b>seepage,</b> an alternative approach is developing to identify the source(s) of <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> from moisture readings obtained from the alleged <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> sites and vibration readings obtained from exposed waste pipes without entering the alleged source sites. It is necessary to dedicate tools to match the accuracy/reliability of methods of investigation with the goals of the parties and the goals of the investigation and to provide the parties with opportunities to decide how they would like to proceed. By applying a performance-based approach, the method of investigation is shifted from an informative approach to a consultative approach with interaction by the party/parties. By not carrying out unnecessary and/or unreliable tests, overall cost and time can be reduced.

The New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was used. To be able to keep the tunnel open to workday railroad traffic, the repairs had to be performed during operational breaks at night and on weekends. To do this, the floor and arch were constructed in 8 m sections.|$|E
