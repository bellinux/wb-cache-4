50|$|A {{heterogeneous}} system (comprising different substances {{or different}} phases) may be anisotropic if the loss tangents {{of the components}} are considered. As a result, it can be expected that the microwave field energy will be converted to heat by different amounts {{in different parts of}} the system. This inhomogeneous energy dissipation means <b>selective</b> <b>heating</b> of different parts of the material is possible, and may lead to temperature gradients between them. Nevertheless, the presence of zones with a higher temperature than others (called hot spots) must be subjected to the heat transfer processes between domains. Where the rate of heat conduction is high between system domains, hot spots would have no long-term existence as the components rapidly reach thermal equilibrium. In a system where the heat transfer is slow, it would be possible to have the presence of a steady state hot spot that may enhance the rate of the chemical reaction within that hot zone.|$|E
5000|$|Non-thermal {{microwave}} {{effects or}} specific microwave effects have been posited {{in order to}} explain unusual observations in microwave chemistry. As the name suggests, the effects are supposed not to require the transfer of microwave energy into thermal energy. Instead, the microwave energy itself directly couples to energy modes within the molecule or lattice. Non-thermal effects in liquids are almost certainly non-existent, as the time for energy redistribution between molecules in a liquid is {{much less than the}} period of a microwave oscillation. A 2005 review has illustrated this in application to organic chemistry, though clearly supports the existence of non-thermal effects. It has been shown that such non-thermal effects exist in the reaction of O + HCl(DCl)->OH(OD)+Cl in the gas phase and the authors suggest that some mechanisms may also be present in the condensed phase.Non-thermal effects in solids are still part of an ongoing debate. It is likely that, through focusing of electric fields at particle interfaces, microwaves cause plasma formation and enhance diffusion in solids via second-order effects. As a result, they may enhance solid-state sintering processes. Debates continued in 2006 about non-thermal effects of microwaves that have been reported in solid-state phase transitions. A 2013 essay concluded the effect did not exist in organic synthesis involving liquid phases.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop the {{fundamentals}} of materials modelling to enable effective process control of hot stamping for forming UHSS panels with graded properties for optimised functional performance. A <b>selective</b> <b>heating</b> and press hardening strategy is adopted to grade the microstructural distribution of a press hardened component through differential heat treatment of the blank prior to forming. Comprehensive material models, to enable prediction of austenite formation and deformation behaviours of boron steel under hot forming conditions, as well as the dynamic response of a press hardened part with tailored properties in collision situations, have been developed based on experimental investigations and mechanism studies. The research work is concerned with four aspects: feasibility of the <b>selective</b> <b>heating</b> and press hardening strategy, austenite formation in boron steel during <b>selective</b> <b>heating,</b> thermo-mechanical properties of boron steel under hot stamping, and mechanical properties of boron steel with various microstructures at room temperature. Feasibility studies for the <b>selective</b> <b>heating</b> and press hardening strategy were carried out through a designed experimental programme. A lab-scale demonstrator part was designed and relevant manufacturing and property-assessment processes were defined. A heating technique and selective-heating rigs were designed to enable certain microstructural distributions in blanks to be obtained. A hot stamping tool set was designed for forming and quenching the parts. Test pieces were formed under various heating conditions to obtain demonstrator parts having variously graded microstructures. Microstructural distributions in the as-formed parts were determined through hardness testing and microstructural observation. Ultimately, the structural performance of the parts was evaluated through bending tests. Heat treatment tests were performed to study the formation of austenite in boron steel during <b>selective</b> <b>heating.</b> Characterisation of the effects of heating rate and temperature on transformation behavior was conducted based on the test results. A unified austenite formation model, capable of predicting full or partial austenite formation under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions, was developed, and determined from the heat treatment test results. Hot tensile tests were performed to study the thermo-mechanical properties of the austenite and initial phase (ferrite and pearlite) of boron steel.
