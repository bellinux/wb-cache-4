5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> {{story of a young}} woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, {{but those were}} unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented from carrying out their work by the local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still under constant guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> occasion to stress U.S. support for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which {{had been set up}} in 1993.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Cowboy Bebop: The Movie was {{composed}} by Yoko Kanno, composer {{for the original}} series, and performed by her band Seatbelts. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> same mixture of music genres (western, opera, jazz) as with the TV series, but also added Arabic elements {{in keeping with the}} film's thematic feel. She used Arabic and English for the music lyrics. Alongside these, the soundtrack made use of a large amount of rock instruments. Five tracks from the film were released on the Seatbelts mini-album Ask DNA, released on July 25, 2001. The soundtrack's official release, , was released on August 22, 2001.

5|$|Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were {{interested}} in the same sheriff's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. Marcus ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to a doctor, George Goodfellow.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Anderson was {{institutionalized}} in {{a mental}} hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. At first, she went by the name Fräulein Unbekannt (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family {{and those who had}} known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gorman alleges, Kelly {{was looking}} after the daughter, Alice, both {{during and after}} the raid. Gorman asserts that at first Kelly was content to hide the child, but then she, along with her friends Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman and Elizabeth Stride, decided to {{blackmail}} the government. Gorman accuses Salisbury of conspiring with his fellow freemasons, including senior policemen in the London Metropolitan Police, to stop the scandal by staging the murders of the women. Gorman says Salisbury assigned the task to Gull, who lured the four women into a carriage individually where Gull murdered them with the assistance of coachman John Netley and Sir Robert Anderson, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard. Gorman claims a fifth victim, Catherine Eddowes, was killed accidentally in a case of mistaken identity because <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> alias Mary Ann Kelly and was confused with Mary Jane Kelly. Gorman alleges that Netley tried to kill the young Alice twice but after the second unsuccessful attempt several witnesses chased Netley, who threw himself into the Thames and drowned. Gorman completes the story by saying that Alice lived well into old age, later becoming Walter Sickert's mistress, and that Alice and Walter Sickert are his parents.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Sarah’s {{personal}} income was now considerable, and <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> money {{to invest in}} land; she believed this would protect her from currency devaluation. The dowager duchess purchased Wimbledon manor in 1723, and rebuilt the manor house. Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, for which she would pay a massive dowry of £100,000. However, Robert Walpole, the First Lord of the Treasury (effectively the same as today's Prime Minister) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, {{good relations with the}} royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by Queen Caroline, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.|$|E
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
