40|$|Abstract. Understanding the {{evolving}} user <b>session</b> <b>profile</b> {{is key to}} maintaining service performance levels. Clustering techniques {{have been used to}} automatically discover typical user profiles from Web access logs. But it is a challenging problem that many clustering algorithms yield poor results because the session vectors are usually high dimensional and sparse. Although standard non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF) can be used in reducing the dimensionality of the session-URL matrix, the clustering results is not precise, because the basis vectors SNMF gets are not orthogonal and usually redundancy. In this paper, we apply local nonnegative matrix factorization (LNMF), which get basis vectors as orthogonal as possible, to reduce the dimensionality of the session-URL matrix. The experiment results show that LNMF performs better than SNMF for mining typical user <b>session</b> <b>profile.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of search personalisation largely {{depends on how}} to build user profiles effectively. Many approaches {{have been developed to}} build user profiles using topics discussed in relevant documents, where the topics are usually obtained from human-generated online ontology such as Open Directory Project. The limitation of these approaches is that many documents may not contain the topics covered in the ontology. Moreover, the human-generated topics require expensive manual effort to determine the correct categories for each document. This paper addresses these problems by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation for unsupervised extraction of the topics from documents. With the learned topics, we observe that the search intent and user interests are dynamic, i. e., they change from time to time. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} temporal aspects in personalisation, we apply three typical time scales for building a long-term profile, a daily profile and a <b>session</b> <b>profile.</b> In the experiments, we utilise the profiles to re-rank search results returned by a commercial web search engine.

Methods Men (n [*]=[*] 23) and women (n [*]=[*] 13) consumed a 24 –h standardized diet and reported 2 – 4 h post-prandial for all test sessions. After a familiarization session, participants completed 50 min of stationary cycling in a warm environment (wet bulb globe temperature[*]=[*] 25. 0 °C) at ~ 60 - 65 % of heart rate reserve (146 [*]±[*] 4 bpm) interspersed with 5 rest periods of 2 min each. During exercise, participants consumed W, CE, or NCE, served in a counterbalanced cross-over design. Beverage volume was served in 3 aliquots equaling each individual’s sweat losses (mean 847 [*]±[*] 368 mL) during the familiarization <b>session.</b> <b>Profiles</b> of Mood States questionnaires (POMS) were administered and blood glucose levels were determined pre- and post- sub-maximal cycling. Following sub-maximal exercise, participants completed 3 30 –s Wingate anaerobic tests (W AnT) with 2. 5 min rest between tests to assess performance. Results Blood glucose was higher (p[*] AnT for CE (6. 1 [*]±[*] 1. 7 mmol/L) compared to W (4. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 5 mmol/L) and NCE (4. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 2 mmol/L). Nonetheless, {{there were no differences}} among treatments in peak (642 [*]±[*] 153, 635 [*]±[*] 143, 650 [*]±[*] 141 watts for W, NCE, and CE, respectively; p[*] =[*] 0. 44) or mean (455 [*]±[*] 100, 458 [*]±[*] 95, 454 [*]±[*] 95 watts for W, NCE, and CE, respectively; p[*]=[*] 0. 62) power for the first W AnT or mean (414 [*]±[*] 92, 425 [*]±[*] 85, 423 [*]±[*] 82 watts, respectively; p[*]=[*] 0. 13) power output averaged across all 3 W AnT. Likewise, RPE during submaximal exercise, session RPE, and fatigue and vigor assessed by POMS did not differ among beverage treatments (p[*]>[*] 0. 05). Conclusions Carbohydrate ingestion consumed by recreational exercisers during a 1 –h, moderate-intensity aerobic workout did not alter mood or perceived exertion, nor did it affect subsequent anaerobic performance under the conditions of this study.

40|$|The primary aim of {{the present}} thesis was to gain an insight into the {{usefulness}} and potential impacts of producing individual athlete performance profiles within a group environment (Butler & Hardy, 1992). Given the limited, and mainly descriptive, profiling literature, a strong two-stage research design, adhering to many of Denzin's (1978) triangulation principles, examined {{the perceptions of the}} two primary user populations (sport psychologist and athlete). Firstly British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES) accredited sport psychologists (n= 6) were interviewed to provide an in depth understanding of the usefulness and impact of the technique. Higher order themes, obtained via an inductive content analysis of the interviews, were combined with {{a review of the literature}} to produce a quantitative questionnaire examining the perceptions of a large number of BASES accredited consultants (n= 56). An investigation of athlete perceptions regarding the impact of the technique firstly involved employing the group performance profiling procedure (Butler & Hardy, 1992) on a male collegiate rugby union squad. Following the <b>profiling</b> <b>session</b> players (n= 8) were randomly chosen and interviewed regarding their perceptions of the usefulness and impact of the technique. An inductive content analysis of the interviews produced a number of higher order themes that were combined with a review of the profiling literature to produce a quantitative questionnaire. Following the successful piloting of the questionnaire ten group performance <b>profiling</b> <b>sessions</b> were performed with a variety of sports teams. On completion of the <b>profiling</b> <b>sessions</b> athletes (n= 191) were asked to complete the questionnaire to help ascertain what athletes perceived to be the most important impacts of performance profiling within a group environment. Inspection of both the consultant and athlete responses to the qualitative and quantitative procedures indicated that group profiling is useful in increasing athlete self awareness, evaluating performance, as a basis for goal setting, and enhancing communication and interaction both within teams and between athlete and coach. In addition, both consultants and athletes believed that performance profiling within a group environment would help to improve athlete intrinsic motivation. Hence the final study examined experimentally the impact of repeated group performance profiling on athletes' intrinsic motivation. Results showed that profiling on three occasions within a competitive season is useful in significantly improving athlete intrinsic motivation. The findings provide empirical support for Butler and Hardy's (1992) suggestion that performance profiling would positively influence athlete intrinsic motivation.

Demographic and clinical characteristics and exercise capacity at baseline and at follow-up were compared between the two groups.

Peak and mean force, power, velocity, and peak displacement were collected with a linear position transducer attached to the weight stack. Mean values at each load were used to calculate different regression lines and estimate maximal strength, force, velocity, and power. All variables were found reliable (change in the mean [CIM] ¼ - 1 to 14 %; coefficient of variation [CV] ¼ 3 – 18 %; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ¼ 0. 74 – 0. 99), but were likely to benefit from a familiarization, apart from the unreliable maximal force/velocity ratio (CIM ¼ 0 – 3 %; CV ¼ 23 – 25 %; ICC ¼ 0. 35 – 0. 54) and load at maximal power (CIM ¼ - 1 to 2 %; CV ¼ 10 – 13 %; ICC ¼ 0. 26 – 0. 61).

40|$|Program {{execution}} traces {{provide the}} most intimate details of a program’s dynamic behavior. They {{can be used for}} program optimization, failure diagnosis, collecting software metrics like coverage, test prioritization, etc. Two major obstacles to exploiting the full potential of information they provide are: (i) performance overhead while collecting traces, and (ii) significant size of traces even for short execution scenarios. Reducing information output in an execution trace can reduce both performance overhead and the size of traces. However, the applicability of such traces is limited to a particular task. We present a runtime framework with a goal of collecting a complete, machine- and task-independent, user-mode trace of a program’s execution that can be re-simulated deterministically with full fidelity down to the instruction level. The framework has reasonable runtime overhead and by using a novel compression scheme, we significantly reduce the size of traces. Our framework enables building a wide variety of tools for understanding program behavior.
