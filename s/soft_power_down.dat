40|$|Food {{is often}} cited {{as a form of}} <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> with Joesph Nye {{explicitly}} mentioning food in his initial writings upon <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> However, the understanding of food as a form of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> remains questionable with most academics glossing over food’s <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> in preference to other forms that possess greater politically visibility. This paper addresses this lack of scholarly discussion that surrounds the subject of food as a source of <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> providing a comprehensive guide to the utilisation of food as a vehicle for <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> Citing contemporary academic and real world conceptualisations of <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> this paper creates a framework to identify how <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> is implemented by political actors, allowing food to become both a source and a means of implementing coercion at different political levels. Case studies will validate this framework and cover the full spectrum of political actors including nation states (America and Japan); corporations (McDonalds and Monsanto); interest groups and organisations (Slow Food); as well as individuals (Michal Pollan and Jamie Oliver). This paper summates that food can be a useful <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> vehicle, and when applied correctly can produce control and coercion in both the political and social spheres. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1990, Joseph Nye {{coined the}} term “soft power” to define co-optive power {{that is based on}} {{attraction}} rather than coercion. For quite a long time it was believed that <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> was a prerogative of Western-style democracies as they were closest to the values constituting the basis of Nye’s classical <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> concept. Nye remained skeptical over the ability of hard states to produce <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> However, nowadays all types of governments including non-democratic ones turn to <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> In Russia <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> has become a priority since early 2000 s, making it no longer a newcomer in this regard. Russia’s experience shows an alternative way to wield <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> Thus, the aim of this thesis is to understand how Nye’s classical <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> concept is re-conceptualized within the Russian context. In doing so it promises to go beyond a Western-centric understanding of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> and to contribute to a discussion on how hard states adopt and adjust <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> to their needs. Discourse analyses is employed as a specific method of qualitative research to decode the meaning attributed to the concept of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> within Russian official <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> discourse. The sources that are analyzed include official documents, speeches, articles, and interviews by key Russian political figures (V. Putin, D. Medvedev, S. Lavrov, K. Kosachev, V. Nikonov). The timeframe of analyses focuses on the period from 2012 when the term ‘soft power’ first appeared in Russian official discourse to the end of 2015, one year after a striking event for Russian <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> - the annexation of Crimea. The main findings of this thesis support the initial assumption that Russia’s <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> is more than just “an act of mimicry” or an attempt {{to catch up with the}} West. Approaching Nye’s concept through the prism of own historical, political and socio-economic background, Russian authorities develop a significantly different de-Westernized understanding of <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> First, while the aim of Nye's concept is to make a country attractive, Russian <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> concentrates on elaborating Russia's political stance and actions in order to withstand the discrepancy between Russia’s reality and its international perception. Second, it is revealed that Russia understands and articulates <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> through four main groups of narratives - centrality of the state, pragmatic instrumental approach, geopolitical concerns and reactive argumentation. Finally, it is suggested that those narratives appear to be more universal than the Western values that backbone Nye's classical <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> concept and their further studies within other contexts could extend academic knowledge on the <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> concept...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, one hears {{frequently}} about Chinese "soft power". This work deals with Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> in three Asian subregions - Southeast Asia, Japan & South Korea and Central Asia - in order to verify to what extent can <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> be regarded a universal approach in Chinese foreign policy. After introducing the concept of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> this work is aiming to explain the characteristics of Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> define the potentials and limits of Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> resources and explain how <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> corresponds with China's general strategy of foreign policy. In order to create an image of Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> {{in each of the three}} subregions, I define the key <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> tools according to which I measure Chinese soft power: Bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, promotion of culture and language (mainly through Confucius institutes), education of foreign students at Chinese universities and foreign aid.

40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>power</b> {{has enabled}} China and South Korea to {{position}} themselves as emerging powers in Latin America. Yet, only South Korea has risen through {{the deployment of}} cultural <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> while China´s rise has taken place through the attraction its economic strength creates and not by using cultural <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> as a strategic tool. The sub goal was achieved as the concept of emerging powers was further conceptualized, for example by showing that one country can rise through culture (South Korea) and that countries can rise in regions besides their own, {{which means that they}} can be a middle power in one region and emerging powers in the other one. The main goal of operationalizing the concept of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> was obtained as the Chilean case demonstrated how cultural <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> can be analyzed by filtering it through several benchmarks and interpreted through indicators, how statistical data along with qualitative analysis can be combined and how comparisons can be made of two actors within a third state. The conceptualization of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> was further specified. The elements that it consists of and that were ambiguous, were described and analyzed throughout the research, for example by showing that <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> does not necessarily benefit from the cultural closeness between two countries, that hard and <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> cannot be differentiated by “carrot” and “stick” categories, governments do not have complete control over <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> and a foreign policy that is perceived as <b>soft,</b> is <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> as it fulfills its goal to create that type of attraction. The main result from this study is that <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> and what it achieves lies on {{the eye of the beholder}} — the country — that is on the receiving end. If the population of country A perceives B´s military exercises as soft, then that is <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> If, instead, the people from country A perceive C´s ideology as hard (for example as repressive), then that is hard and not <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> If China´s attraction is created through economic strength, then China has used economic <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> if South Korea attracts through the Korean Wave and its culture, then South Korea has used cultural <b>soft</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> is widely embraced in the {{academic}} realm, mainstream media and political arenas all over the world. Unlike previous studies, which relied primarily on the theoretical discussion of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> and emphasised the Anglophone world, this study aims to investigate {{the ways in which}} China, a non-democratic regime, engages with <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> Among the few empirical studies of China’s <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> most have focused upon the state-funded Confucius Institute and state-owned media enterprises. Film, considered to be an important instrument of <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> has been neglected in the research on China’s <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> so far. To address these concerns, I employed constructivism in international relations as the theoretical approach to examine film as a tool of China’s <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> For the empirical investigation, I firstly adopted secondary data analysis to highlight the characteristics of film policy in terms of the international market over a period of 60 years; then I conducted semi-structured interviews with the key state and non-state actors to investigate how they understand their role in promoting Chinese film onto the international stage. Finally I scrutinised the statistical record of Chinese film’s global performance to examine its potential ability to wield <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> By weaving together these rich and diverse data sets, this study proposes a new formula in assessing the role of film in promoting <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> It also contributes to the existing scholarly debates in the <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> literature by providing a thorough empirical study with a focus on the relationship between film and <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> from an authoritarian regime. This study reveals that China has formulated the so-called “Going-Out Policy” aiming to promote <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> and oversee the film industry through the censorship system. It shows that the non-state actors have {{played an important role in}} disseminating China’s <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> and the outcome of film Going-Out Policy is not as optimistic as official statements have claimed. Ultimately, I argue that China’s practice of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> is consistent with the constructivist school of thought that ideas, ideology and identity are as essential as material strength in constructing international relations. As the main obstacles result from its ruling party’s political ideology and censorship system, there seems limited space for China to strengthen <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> under the current circumstances. ...|$|R

This thesis examines China’s <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> strategy and its key objectives in the Middle East through an in-depth analysis focusing on economic, cultural, political and military <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> initiatives.

It begins by defining the notion of <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> distinguishing it, for this purpose, from the concepts of hard power and smart power. In a first phase, the text brings to bear theory in order to highlight the main features of <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> The second - essentially practical - phase is based on a case study: the analysis of China's behavior in terms of <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> The text thus provides the notion of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> with practical applicability, these two elements being shown to be not mutually exclusive, but rather able to interact harmoniously. How does the Chinese "charm offensive" manifest itself in Southeast Asia? What are {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power?</b> How does China behave when dealing with the issue of rogue states? How does the Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> behave in the framework of China's maritime strategy? These and other issues are addressed in this article. In practice,it will be demonstrated that, unlike in the past, <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> is no longer a "strange" element in Chinese official discourse. In fact, the China of today seems to be more concerned with the image it has in the world...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the historical}} ‘direct’ <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> of American missionary universities in China and their ‘reverse’ <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> towards American society until their nationalization {{in the early}} 1950 s. The paper also addresses the <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> of the legacies of these historical universities. This analysis {{is based on the}} cases of St. John’s University, Yale-in-China and Yenching University. American missionary universities were founded with the clear ‘direct’ <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> purpose of attracting the Chinese ‘other’ to Christianity. However, <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> resources often have unintended behavioral consequences and a particularly interesting one is ‘reverse’ soft power: Where the intended object society of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> influences the originator society of <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> for example, through education and advocacy. American missionary universities exercised substantial <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> both toward the Chinese host society and toward the American society. The institutions in China also left institutional legacies at American—and Canadian—universities which continue to hold <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> in the relationship between American and Chinese society. The extent and limitation of this bidirectional <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> can be discerned from what attracted different actors to these universities and what those and other actors rejected about these universities; this is based on a detailed analysis of the relations between the universities and different public and private actors in the host society and the society of origin. These relations were characterized by the role of the universities as bridges between host society and society of origin carrying much information between societies, raising awareness and interest about the other society, moving elite-level human resources back and forth and raising large financial resources in the USA for education and research in China...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe American scholar Joseph Nye {{was the first}} to coin the term <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> The <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> of a country is based on three resources: the culture, the value of internal policy, and the strength of the foreign policy. In international politics, <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> is among the ways in which success can be achieved without hard power. The concept of <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> has {{become an integral part of}} today’s language for Saudi Arabia’s political leaders, who use <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> to confront challenges with Iran. Such a concept has to be maintained for Iran to stop increasing its influence in the region. This thesis explores Saudi Arabian <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> aimed at counteracting challenges presented by Iran’s hegemonic ambitions in the Middle East. Accordingly, the thesis explores the tools at Saudi Arabia’s disposal that could enable it to counter Iran's ambition of dominating the Middle East and the rest of the Arab world.
