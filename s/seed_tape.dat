40|$|In {{view of the}} {{development}} of various technological alternatives in precision seed drilling, it has become a matter of research whether there are clear criteria for {{the success or failure of}} technological innovations. Around the turn to the 20 th century, two very different precision seed drill methods were developed almost at the same time. Band seeding made it possible to achieve nearly perfect single grain sowing. For this purpose, individual, equally spaced seeds were embedded into bands of paper or cotton. In the field, these <b>seed</b> <b>tapes</b> were then unreeled from large drums. The pneumatic system proposed in 1897, by contrast, introduced grain singling using a vacuum for the first time. Although band seeding presented a satisfactory technological solution, it was never widely applied. Pneumatic systems, on the other hand, took long to catch on and only started to be successful in the late 1960 s. Up to then, these innovative systems had to be considered as failures. Changing the period under review, however, may completely reverse the assessment of whether an innovation is a success or a failure...|$|R

40|$|This 1 -group, 4 -week {{observational}} study aimed to (1) assess {{the feasibility of}} recruiting, retention, and completion of a 4 -week auricular point acupressure (APA) treatment protocol for chronic pain in adult patients and (2) assess the effects of APA in pain reduction (pain severity and pain interference) among these patients. The participants received a 4 -week APA treatment protocol in weekly cycles. Each weekly cycle included 5 days with APA <b>seeds</b> <b>taped</b> onto the ear and 2 days without. Each participant was called every day to monitor adherence to the treatment protocol (the actual times the participant pressed the seeds each day and the duration of applied pressure), to answer analgesic use, and to answer the pain intensity questionnaire. Thirty participants were initially enrolled in this study, but 5 did not continue. The retention rate was 83 % (n = 25). Approximately 60 % of the participants (n = 15) adhered to the 4 -week APA and completed all data assessments. At baseline assessment, only 40 % of all participants (n = 12 of 30) were confident that APA would reduce and eliminate pain; nonetheless, all participants reported fewer episodes of pain occurrences and pain intensity with the APA treatment. For the participants who completed the 4 -week APA protocol (n = 15), 96 % (n = 14) decreased analgesic medication intake and 88 % (n = 13) felt "much better" after the APA treatment. Participants reported an average reduction of 63 % in the worst pain intensity at day 7. By {{the end of the}} 4 -week APA protocol, an even greater reduction in pain intensity was reported (66 %, n = 10, at day 28). The participants who did not complete the treatment protocol reported an average pain reduction of 29 %, which fluctuated to 22 % before they dropped out. Auricular point acupressure is feasible for patients with chronic pain. The preliminary findings of this feasibility study show a reduction in pain intensity and improvement in physical function, which demonstrate the potential for APA as a treatment option for patients with chronic pain.

40|$|Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) is {{a source}} of high quality rubber and low-allergenic latex. Commercial {{potential}} of guayule to produce high value latex products has increased due to the increased incidence of deadly diseases in humans. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of direct seeding in southeast Queensland as an alternative to establishment by the current high cost transplanting method. Experiments were conducted for 2 years at Gatton, Queensland using physical and chemical seed treatments. NaOCl plus GA 3, osmo-priming with polyethylene glycol, seed pelleting and <b>seed</b> <b>tape</b> planting were tested. Planting depth had a significant influence on seedling emergence. Emergence at 18 mm depth (1. 5 seedlings/m) was significantly reduced compared with 10 mm depth (2. 9 seedlings/m). Osmo-priming was effective in increasing germination from 36 to 47 %. It also improved seedling emergence and vigour. Osmo-priming significantly increased establishment (7. 5 seedlings/m) compared with untreated seed (3. 3 seedlings/m). NaOCl plus GA 3 did not have a significant influence on germination (38 %) or seedling emergence (5. 0 seedlings/m) but increased survival at 42 days after planting. Establishment as a percentage of emerged seedlings was high for both osmo-primed and NaOCl plus GA 3 treatments with 89 and 88 % respectively, whereas untreated seed had only 70 % survival. Osmo-priming also increased vigour as indicated by increased root length (101 mm), shoot height (123 mm), and seedling dry matter (379 mg/seedling) compared with the control (83, 107 mm and 206 mg/seedling, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} of this one-group, repeated-measures design was to explore the acceptance of auricular point acupressure (APA) to reduce chronic low back pain (CLBP) and estimate minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for pain intensity change. Methods. Subjects received 7 -day APA treatment. After appropriate acupoints were identified, vaccaria <b>seeds</b> were carefully <b>taped</b> onto each selected auricular point for 7 -day. The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI) was used to collect outcome data. Results. A total of 74 subjects participated in the study. Ten subjects dropped out and the retention rate was 87 %. Subjects reported a 46 % reduction in BPI worst pain, and over 50 % reduction in BPI average pain, overall pain severity and pain interference {{by the end of}} study, and 62. 5 % subjects also reported less pain medication use. The MCIDs for the subscale of BPI ranged from. 70 to 1. 86 points. The percentage improvement of MCIDs from baseline was between 14. 5 – 24. 9 %. Discussion.

In this study, we investigated whether auricular acupressure therapy reduced the incidence of PONV. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 female patients (ASA I-II, aged 18 - 65 years) scheduled to undergo myomectomy or hysterectomy were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study and {{randomly assigned to one}} of three groups. In groups I and II, we <b>taped</b> <b>seeds</b> of Wangbuliuxing onto auricular points (two sets of four) and asked patients to compress these points four times a day. Group III acted as the control group. Results: Data were available for 124 patients.

40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{proposed}} to quantify volume {{of potato chips}} by measuring the displaced volume of a finely granular material (<b>tape</b> <b>seeds)</b> by {{the volume of the}} chips. Firstly, compaction of the seeds was studied to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the technique. The results obtained indicate an encouraging potential of the technique to estimate the apparent volume of potato chips and give some indications of variation of chip apparent density with some important technological parameters such as chip thickness, frying temperature, and pretreatment of the slices before frying (e. g., blanching). This technique showed that the apparent volume of un-blanched potato slices increased clearly (P = 0. 007) with frying temperature (from 120 degreesC to 190 degreesC) until the chips reached final moisture contents < 3 % (wet basis). For 180 and 190 degreesC, the final apparent volume of these samples indicated that the chips expanded in similar to 6 % beyond its original volume before frying (14. 1 mL). For potato slices blanched in hot water (80 degreesC and 3. 5 min) and fried under the same temperature intervals and conditions, this trend was not statistically significant (P = 0. 088), and the average apparent volume of the chips was 10. 9 mL which correspond as an average to a shrinkage of similar to 23 %...|$|R
40|$|This study aimed (1) {{to examine}} the {{feasibility}} of an auricular point acupressure (APA) research protocol in terms of recruitment and for the assessment and management of pain and (2) {{to examine the}} potential APA analgesic effects for cancer patients. This study was a repeated-measures one-group design. Participants were recruited from the cancer center follow-up clinic affiliated with a large university hospital in the northeastern United States. Participants included 50 patients aged 55 - 87 years with a diagnosis of cancer. Participants received 7 days of APA treatment for their pain. After appropriate acupoints were identified, vaccaria <b>seeds</b> were carefully <b>taped</b> onto each selected auricular point on each ear. The study recruitment and retention rates were 92 % and 91 %, respectively. Importantly, the study found preliminary evidence for the analgesic effects of APA for cancer pain management. For example, {{by the end of}} the 7 -day study, APA reduced pain intensity more than 55 % for "worst pain" and about 57 % for "average pain" and "pain intensity. " Moreover, the use of pain medication was reduced during the APA treatment (e. g., 78 % of patients [n = 39] took less pain medication than before the treatment). APA appears to be highly acceptable to patients with cancer-related pain. However, without a placebo control, we cannot draw conclusive evidence for the analgesic effect of APA for cancer patients. A sham group must be added to future studies to differentiate the true effects of APA from the possible psychological effects of the APA treatment. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|Em ambiente protegido, os gastos com sementes de cultivares híbridas e fita gotejadora influenciam, acentuadamente, o custo de produção de tomate (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Para reduzir custos, idealizou-se o método denominado DFT que combina a utilização de menores densidades de plantio (D), comprimento da fita gotejadora (F) e maior número de caules por planta, especialmente tutorados (T) com fitilho. Com o presente trabalho, objetivou-se comparar os métodos DFT com o convencional (TEST) de produção de tomate em ambiente protegido. Foram realizados dois experimentos, utilizando-se o híbrido Carmen.
