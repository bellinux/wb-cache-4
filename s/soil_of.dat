40|$|Abstract [...] The <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> {{the summit}} region of Mauna Kea {{are similar to}} the <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> the high {{mountain}} deserts and to the <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> cold deserts.

The <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> some of the cones of the summit area are clay rich and contain phyllosilicate minerals; the <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> the glaciated terrain are sandy and contain X-ray amorphous clay. Montmorillonite and a Mg-rich trioctahedral mineral identified as saponite are the clay minerals of the summit. Because the summit area of Mauna Kea supported an ice cap {{at the time of the}} formation of the cones, the origin of the smectite minerals could have resulted from the alteration of the tephra by steam and water released in the melting of the ice. Hypogene fluids are, however, more likely to be responsible for the genesis of the phyllosilicate minerals...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to produce a physiographic soil map with correlated attributes to be a base for extra modifiers within the land information system. This integrated data will serve the purposes of land use planning, precision farming practices and to be applied in other areas using the extrapolation approach. The Satellite data of EgyptSat- 1 were projected on an area of Middle Egypt that represents unique physiographic features over portions of Beni Suef, El Fayoum, Helwan, and October Provinces. The spectral signatures of the land patterns were delineated by the visual interpretation using the physiographic approach, while soil taxa were categorized according to the key <b>of</b> <b>Soil</b> Taxonomy (USDA, 2010), resulting in two landscape categories. The first category includes older and developed parent materials, covering the following units: (a) Pediplains <b>of</b> residual <b>soils</b> over limestone parent rock, having <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Lithic Haplocalcids, loamy skeletal. (b) Terraced old alluvial plains represent the formerly deposited alluvium that preceded the recent one of the River Nile alluvium. They includes <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Calcigypsids, loamy skeletal and old alluvial plain but are currently managed under cultivation. The soils are dominated by Typic Haplocalcids, loamy skeletal. (c) Wadis that were shaped by the paleodrainage erosion, are currently subjected to the seasonal flush flooding and are sparsely vegetated including <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Torrifluvents, lamy skeletal (calcareous); Typic Torriorthents, sandy skeletal, and Typic Torriorthents, sandy. (d) Aeolian plain “partly cultivated” includes <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Torripsamments (calcareous). The second category is a recent River Nile alluvium that formed the following units: (a) Terraced recent alluvial plain “cultivated” includes <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Entic Calcitorrerts, fine and Typic Haplotorrerts fine. (b) Recent flat alluvial plain includes <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Haplotorrerts, fine. (c) Meandering belt is aligning the River Nile course with courser sediments comparing to the recent alluvial plains. This belt is sub divided as levees that have <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Torriorthents, fine lomy; point bars with <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Torriorthents, coarse lomy; river banks with <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Torriorthents, coarse lomy; bow bars with Typic Torriorthents, sandy and Typic Torriorthents, coarse loamy and meander scars with <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Typic Torriorthents, sandy.

5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E

5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264 BC when {{settlements}} on Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay– Rome and Carthage– in order to solve internal conflicts.

The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the Battle of Agrigentum, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the First Punic War in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in Italy. The new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E

The test soils were characterized by natural content of zinc, lead, and cadmium in most cases. Only one type <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> located on Śląskie Foothills developed increased levels of Cd (1. 1 mg · kg- 1). The content of zinc, lead, and cadmium in the surface layer (0 - 30 cm) was higher in the <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Śląskie Foothills than in <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Ciężkowickie Foothills. The bedrocks from which the <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> these two mesoregions are formed differed significantly only in the content of zinc (it was higher in the <b>soils</b> <b>of</b> Śląskie Foothills). The content of Zn, Pb, and Cd in the surface layer <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> depends on its texture and organic carbon and total nitrogen content. There was also a positive correlation between the content of Pb and Cd and hydrolytic acidity and between the content of Zn and Ca and CEC. Different types of land uses did not influence the content of the metals...|$|R

Studies conducted in this work were aimed at searching for relationships between brightness temperature <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> surface layer &# 8211; derived from satellite images &# 8211; and various properties <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> (type <b>of</b> <b>soil,</b> class <b>of</b> agricultural suitability, texture of top layer <b>of</b> <b>soil,</b> land use). As {{a result of the}} analysis it was found that mainly the class of agricultural suitability and the type <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> have an important influence on brightness temperature <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> surface layer. Lower correlations with brightness temperature were observed in the case of texture of surface and under-surface layers <b>of</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|R
