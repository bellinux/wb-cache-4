The second category also included three types, Type II markers <b>shared</b> <b>bands</b> in male and female parents, Type V markers were presented in the female parent only, Type VI markers {{were present in the}} male parent only. Third category contained Type VII markers which were present in offspring only. The shared marker (category 1) ranged from 77. 22 % for cross number 2 to 96. 2 for cross number 1.

40|$|Large populations with {{extensive}} breeding distributions may sustain greater genetic variability, thus producing {{a positive relationship}} between genetic variation and population size. Levels of genetic variability may also be affected by sexual selection, which could either reduce levels because a small fraction of males contribute to the following generation, or augment them by generating genetic variability through elevated rates of mutations. We investigated to what extent genetic variability, as estimated from <b>band</b> <b>sharing</b> coefficients for minisatellite markers, could be predicted by breeding distribution range, population size and intensity of sexual selection (as reflected by degree of polygyny and extra-pair paternity). Across a sample of 62 species of birds in the Western Palearctic, we found extensive interspecific variation in <b>band</b> <b>sharing</b> coefficients. High <b>band</b> <b>sharing</b> coefficients (implying low local genetic variability among individuals) were associated with restricted breeding distributions, a conclusion confirmed by analysis of statistically independent linear contrasts. Independently, species with large population sizes had small <b>band</b> <b>sharing</b> coefficients. Furthermore, bird species with a high richness of subspecies for their breeding distribution range had higher <b>band</b> <b>sharing</b> coefficients.

He created his own 9x9 foot studio in his apartment, and used a homebuilt computer, two cheap monitors, a condensor microphone, an electric and acoustic guitar, a bass guitar, a keyboard, two amplifiers, and a drum machine to begin creating an album.

40|$|Recent {{initiatives}} by {{regulatory agencies}} to increase spectrum resources available for broadband access include rules for sharing spectrum with high-priority incumbents. We study {{a model in}} which wireless Service Providers (SPs) charge for access to their own exclusive-use (licensed) band along with access to an additional <b>shared</b> <b>band.</b> The total, or delivered price in each band is the announced price plus a congestion cost, which depends on the load, or total users normalized by the bandwidth. The <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> is intermittently available with some probability, due to incumbent activity, and when unavailable, any traffic carried on that band must be shifted to licensed bands. The SPs then compete for quantity of users. We show {{that the value of}} the <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> depends on the relative sizes of the SPs: large SPs with more bandwidth are better able to absorb the variability caused by intermittency than smaller SPs. However, as the amount of shared spectrum increases, the large SPs may not make use of it. In that scenario shared spectrum creates more value than splitting it among the SPs for exclusive use. We also show that fixing the average amount of available shared bandwidth, increasing the reliability of the band is preferable to increasing the bandwidth...|$|E
30|$|A more {{challenging}} interference situation is obtained {{by dividing the}} UEs and BSs into two closed subscriber groups (CSGs) operating on a <b>shared</b> <b>band.</b> The UEs of the two CSGs are still distributed evenly over the floor, but are only allowed to connect to own CSG BS, which may be much further away than the closest BS. Figure 4 (b) shows the resulting throughput distributions. As expected, the PF scheduler is struggling with coverage due to the very high amount of interference between the two CSGs. Interference awareness is able {{to get rid of}} the coverage issue completely and make the <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> operation for two CSGs possible. The difference between the IA scheduler and the global optimum is very small compared to the gain relative to PF scheduler, and we may conclude that very high gain in system utility can be obtained with the proposed distributed scheme. Note that one can estimate a rough upper bound on the performance of a system where the two CSGs use orthogonal bands by scaling the no CSG results of Figure 4 (a) by half. It can be seen that the <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> solution with IA scheduler would beat the orthogonal bands PF scheduler by a significant margin.|$|E

30|$|The {{cumulative}} user throughput distributions {{are shown}} in Figure 6. Comparing IA scheduler and PF scheduler in case of no CSGs shows that there is roughly 1.5 - and 2.5 -fold increase in the lower percentiles of DL and UL user throughput distributions when IA scheduler is employed. In the higher percentiles, the situation is the other way around, indicating the relatively unfair resource allocation of PF scheduler. Median throughput is higher with IA scheduler in both DL and UL, but with a higher margin in UL. When there are two CSGs, the coverage achieved with PF scheduler is poor with roughly 20 % of DL outage and 5 % UL outage. IA scheduler is able to restore the coverage in the CSG case, thus enabling <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> operation. It is interesting to compare {{the performance of a}} conventional system that would give orthogonal bands for the two CSGs with PF scheduler to the proposed IA scheduler with <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> operation. The conclusion is that around 40 % gain in median user throughputs is available by switching to interference-aware shared-band operation. Comparing the lower percentiles shows that this gain is not in the expense of coverage. On the contrary, IA scheduler gains also in coverage with fifth percentile user throughput increasing of 1.2 -fold in DL and 2.6 -fold in UL.|$|E

30|$|Finally, Figure 7 {{displays}} {{the distribution of}} the geometric mean of the throughput over all 96 UEs in the scenario. In the OSG case, the gain from IA scheduler over PF scheduler is 10 % and 30 % in the DL and UL, respectively. This shows that even when considering a scenario that is least challenging in the sense of absence of strong interferers, IA scheduler is able to provide gain in system-wide performance over PF scheduler (imperfect interference CSI and 10 % signaling overhead are taken into account in the IA scheduler results). When the two CSGs are operating on a shared-band, the significant portion of zero geometric mean throughputs in the PF scheduler case {{is due to the fact}} that the geometric mean is taken over 96 users. If any of the 96 users is in outage, the geometric mean throughput will be zero. If we take the more reasonable case of PF schedulers on orthogonal bands for the CSGs as the comparison point to IA scheduler, we see that a roughly 1.5 -fold increase in system performance is available by switching to <b>shared</b> <b>band</b> operation and IA scheduling.|$|E
