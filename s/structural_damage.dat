40|$|Key words: damage diagnosis; natural frequency; {{eigenvalue}} perturbation Abstract: This paper {{presents an}} improved method to identify <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> only by changes of natural frequencies. The underlying {{principle of the}} proposed technique is to measure the natural frequencies of the damaged system, and then use this set of data {{as well as the}} original test data of undamaged system to identify <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> with the help of eigenvalue perturbation method. In this contribution, a simple accelerated formula is developed to improve the accuracy of the eigenvalue perturbation method. With the introduction of the accelerated formula, the proposed method is able to achieve more accurate results than that obtained by the original eigenvalue perturbation method without any high-order analysis or multi-iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using simulated data on a published numerical example. From the numerical results, it can be conclued that the proposed approach is simple to implement and can identify <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> very accurately only by the first few natural frequencies...|$|R

5|$|In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen {{people were}} injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy <b>structural</b> <b>damage</b> afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C.

50|$|Due to a {{considerable}} reduction of the lake level in the early 19th century, serious and unexpected <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> to the church vaults and roofs were detected. Three important renovation campaigns took place - {{the first in the}} 1830s to repair the <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> including the removal of the paradisium's upper storey (it had an upper storey at that time for accommodation facilities), the second in the 1880s including repairs after a serious fire in the southern round tower in 1885, and the third in the 1930s. Many former changes to the buildings carried out in Gothic (e. g. steep tower roofs) and Baroque style (e. g. wider windows) have been re-altered to Romanesque style.|$|R
30|$|Images of facades are {{publicly}} available {{for almost all}} urban areas from web services like Google Street View or can easily be gathered. For this reason, we propose a pattern recognition approach to detect windows in facade images. This allows for automatically inferring the opening-ratio from existing structures. Through this, required information can be provided to risk analyses with significantly less effort. Accordingly, alternative tunneling routes can be evaluated already in early phases of planning which enables the selection of an optimal route. It {{can be taken to}} be optimal if it minimizes <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> to buildings inflicted by settlements. <b>Structural</b> <b>damages</b> are considered relevant if they cause a tilt and potentially induce cracks in structural and non-structural members that impair appearance, serviceability or even bearing capacities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>structural</b> <b>damages,</b> which {{result from}} the {{inadequate}} bearing capacity or the asymmetric support of foundation, {{are one of the}} crucial works in the conservation of historical masonry constructions. Firstly,the box girders are slowly and evenly jacked by the manual pipe jacking technique,and then casting the core beam to form a whole, so the construction is gradually situated on a "tray " with sufficient rigidity. Consequently, the <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> caused by the inadequate bearing capacity or the asymmetric support of foundation is thoroughly treated. Based on the field test, the principle of the underpinning by manual pipe-jacking, the mutual effect mechanism between box girders and soil, the calculation of jacking force and its influence factors are investigated in detail, and the empirical formula of calculating jacking force is also presented...|$|R

5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27.

High winds caused power outages and <b>structural</b> <b>damage,</b> as well as destroyed wheat fields across Ontario. In Toronto, the storm killed three people and injured others.|$|E
50|$|The church {{suffered}} severe damages during World War II on 2 March 1942 {{during a}} German air raid. Besides <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> various {{works of art}} had been lost.

50|$|In general, <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> to any {{anatomical}} {{part of the}} ear {{can cause}} hearing-related problems. Usually, minor bending of the stereocilia of the inner ear is associated with temporary hearing loss and is involved in auditory fatigue.

40|$|A damage {{detection}} method of mechanical {{system based on}} output measurements only and on the subspace identification concept is presented. The method uses the definition of null subspace analysis of the Hankel matrix. It is demonstrated {{to be sensitive to}} small-size <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> and suitable for continuous on-line monitoring. The measured response records of structures under environmental or artificial vibrations are assembled in the Hankel matrix that is further factorized into special subspaces. The active subspace defined by the first principal components is shown to be orthonormal to the null subspace defined by the remaining principal components. Therefore, any evident increase of the residues signifies possible <b>structural</b> <b>damages.</b> The method is illustrated by an application to fatigue tests of a street lighting device (luminaires). Experimental methods and numerical calculations on luminaires are simply described and discussed. The test results show that the developed methods may be easily used to effectively monitor the damage evolution during the fatigue tests...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} efficient {{models in}} the area of damage potential classification of seismic signals. After an earthquake, {{one of the most important}} actions that authorities must take is to inspect structures and estimate the degree of damages. The interest is obvious for several reasons such as public safety, economical recourses management and infrastructure. This approach provides a comparative study between the Mamdani-type and Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems (FIS). The fuzzy models use a set of artificial accelerograms in order to classify <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> in a specific structure. Previous studies propose a set of twenty well-known seismic parameters which are essential for description of the seismic excitation. The proposed fuzzy systems use an input vector of twenty seismic parameters instead of the earthquake accelerogram and produce classification rates up to 90 %. Experimental results indicate that these systems are able to classify the <b>structural</b> <b>damages</b> in structures accurately. Both of them produce the same level of correct classification rates but the Mamdani-type has a slight superiority...|$|R
