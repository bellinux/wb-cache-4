40|$|Methane is {{a highly}} potent {{greenhouse}} gas and contributes significantly to climate change. Recent studies have shown significant methane production in sewers. The studies conducted so far have relied on manual sampling followed by off-line laboratory-based chromatography analysis. These methods are labor-intensive when measuring methane emissions from {{a large number of}} sewers, and do not capture the dynamic variations in methane production. In this study, we investigated the suitability of infrared spectroscopy-based on-line methane sensors for measuring methane in humid and condensing <b>sewer</b> <b>air.</b> Two such sensors were comprehensively tested in the laboratory. Both sensors displayed high linearity (R- 2 > 0. 999), with a detection limit of 0. 023 % and 0. 110 % by volume, respectively. Both sensors were robust against ambient temperature variations in the range of 5 to 35 degrees C. While one sensor was robust against humidity variations, the other was found to be significantly affected by humidity. However, the problem was solved by equipping the sensor with a heating unit to increase the sensor surface temperature to 35 degrees C. Field studies at three sites confirmed the performance and accuracy of the sensors when applied to actual sewer conditions, and revealed substantial and highly dynamic methane concentrations in <b>sewer</b> <b>air...</b>|$|E

40|$|Research has {{identified}} that humidity plays a fundamental {{role on the}} conversion of hydrogen sulphide into sulphuric acid during corrosion of concrete in gravity sewers and that potentially minor reductions in humidity can reduce corrosion rates. The high levels of hydrogen sulfide and the high relative humidity (typically > 98 %) that leads to condensation in <b>sewer</b> <b>air</b> makes humidity measurement within such environment difficult. The work presented here aims to tackle this issue by applying a more durable packaging that could withstand the harsh environment. The humidity monitoring element in the probe {{is based on a}} moisture-sensitive polymer coated fibre grating in series with an uncoated grating for temperature compensation. To optimize the device to be operational, two designs of the probe assembly were configured using different material, thus aiming to provide long term durability. The aim of the probe design evaluated was to achieve both a good sensitivity to humidity and to protect the sensing elements from the aggressive environment and which had rendered ineffective the electrical sensors placed in the sewer and used for cross-comparison. The packaged sensors were trailed in situ over a period of 5 months, during which the sensors were constantly subjected to the prevailing high, but varying levels of humidity and hydrogen sulfide gas. The results show the significant promise for tailor made packaging which will protect the sensor element from the harsh environment while retaining good sensitivity. These outcomes show a promising future for optical fiber sensors to be employed for the measurement of humidity in the long term in harsh environmental applications...|$|E
40|$|Sewage {{consists}} {{of a wide range}} of organic and inorganic constituents originating from domestic and trade waste discharges. Of particular interest are the range of odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by anaerobic reactions (such as fermentation and sulfate respiration) in the sewage, sediments and biofilms on the sewer walls. Complaints due to sewage odour are a major issue for wastewater utilities because the repeated release of unpleasant odours from a sewer network constitutes both a public nuisance and possible regulatory violation. However, the complex nature of sewer odours provides many challenges with regards to the management and control of these emissions. This thesis aims to improve understanding of the emissions of compounds and odorants from sewage collection facilities by developing and benchmarking analytical methodologies. A highly sensitive and reliable method using gas chromatograph was developed and evaluated for the analysis of full spectra of compounds that present at the headspace of <b>sewer</b> <b>air.</b> While identifying the emitted chemical species provides useful information, the key to understanding the odour is establishing which of the chemical species odorants are. The use of gas chromatograph with simultaneous mass spectrometer and olfactory detection port (GC-MS/ODP) provides a method of prioritising the chemical species present along with their odour potential. The VOCs identified within emissions included alkanes, aromatics, halogenated hydrocarbon and terpenes, esters, aldehydes and alcohols whiles non-H 2 S VSCs related were: methyl methanethiol (MeSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), Carbon disulfide (CS 2), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). The spatial-temporal variability of VOCs and VSCs were clearly identified and evaluated. A similar range of VOCs and VSCs have been identified in sewer headspace air across diverse countries and climatic regions, demonstrating that the data and conclusions presented in this present work would extend to context out of Australia and is useful for identifying the odour implications of sewer headspace VOCs for the wider industry. However, measured VSC concentrations from the Perth sampling sites were significantly higher than those at the Melbourne and Sydney sites. This indicates the possibly important role of climatic conditions played for VSCs emission at sewer networks...|$|E
40|$|The acid {{production}} from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in <b>sewer</b> <b>air</b> results in serious corrosion of exposed concrete surfaces in sewers. Large fluctuations of gaseous H 2 S concentrations occur in sewers {{due to the}} diurnal profiles of sewage flow and retention times {{and the necessity of}} intermittent pumping of sewage from pressure pipes into gravity pipes. How the high concentrations of H 2 S due to these events may affect H 2 S uptake and subsequent corrosion by concrete sewers is largely unknown. This study determined the effect of short- and long-term increases in H 2 S levels on the sulfide uptake rate (SUR) of concrete surfaces with an active corrosion layer. The results showed that during the high load situation the SUR increased significantly but then decreased (compared to the baseline SUR) by about 7 - 14 % and 41 - 50 % immediately after short- and long-term H 2 S high-load periods, respectively. For both exposure conditions, the SUR gradually (over several hours) recovered to approximately 90 % of the baseline SUR. Further tests suggest multiple factors may contribute to the observed decrease of SUR directly after the high H 2 S load. This includes the temporary storage of elemental sulfur in the corrosion layer and inhibition of sulfide oxidizing bacteria (SOB) due to high H 2 S level and temporary acid surge. Additionally, the delay of the corrosion layer to fully recover the SUR after the high H 2 S load suggests that there is a longer-term inhibitive effect of the high H 2 S levels on the activity of the SOB in the corrosion layer. Due to the observed activity reductions, concrete exposed to occasional short-term high H 2 S load periods had an overall lower H 2 S uptake compared to concrete exposed to constant H 2 S levels at the same average concentration. To accurately predict H 2 S uptake by sewer concrete and hence the likely maximum corrosion rates, a correction factor should be adopted for the H 2 S fluctuations when average H 2 S levels are used in the prediction.

40|$|Supercritical flow in a bend manhole for {{combined}} sewer systems is considered for typical relative curvature and deflection angles of 45 ° and 90 °. The typical features of bend flow in a U-shaped channel are determined, including the surface profiles along the inner and the outer bend walls, impact flow at the manhole outlet into the downstream <b>sewer</b> pipe, <b>air</b> entrainment characteristics, and wave development in the downstream sewer. Also, typical velocity distributions along the manhole are presented, and {{the capacity of the}} conventional bend structure is determined. To increase the discharge capacity across a bend manhole, the so-called bend cover is introduced. This cover element finished in steel can be removed for maintenance and inspection purposes. It limits the wave height close to the bend outlet to 90 % of the sewer diameter and allows air entrainment into the downstream sewer. The performance and capacity of bend flow may significantly be increased, and the novel element may easily be added to existing manholes...|$|R
40|$|Odour {{control systems}} in {{wastewater}} collection systems are typically designed to remove hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S); however other compounds in <b>sewer</b> related foul <b>air</b> {{also lead to}} odour complaints. Methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide are rarely investigated for performance in these treatment systems despite being key odorants. Volatile organic compounds readily occur and rarely contribute substantially to odour impact, but could affect the removal of other more odorous compounds. The most common odour control systems are biologically based (biofilters or biotrickling filters) or adsorption based (predominantly activated carbon). Samples on the inlet and outlet of 10 activated carbon systems, 5 biofilters and 3 biotrickling filters across Sydney, Melbourne and Perth in Australia were taken approximately every month for 18 months. Samples were analysed {{for a wide range}} of volatile organic and sulfurous compounds as well as H 2 S. The collected data were filtered for warm and non-warm periods, wet weather, and for those where data points were greater than three times the standard deviation over the average (known as ‘spikes’). Performance of treatment systems were analysed under these conditions. An analysis of the most common volatile organic and sulfurous compounds on the inlet samples found that there was no clear relationship between any compounds, meaning that when sampling <b>sewer</b> foul <b>air,</b> all key odorants needed to be tested. All treatment system types perform well at H 2 S removal. Activated carbon systems exhibited the poorest and most variable treatment of non-H 2 S based compounds, particularly halogenated volatile organics; however treatment of most compounds improved during spike conditions. Biofilters generally showed the most stable and greatest removal of non-H 2 S based compounds; however treatment deteriorated during spike conditions. In selecting an odour treatment technology, the concentration and variability of contaminants, treatment required and the space available, allow the most efficient technology selection to be made. Two stage processes are generally required for high level treatments whilst single stages are appropriate for lower treatments. Biofilters are generally preferred as the first (or only) stage, with biotrickling filters used where space is constrained. Activated carbon is suitable for low load scenarios or as a polishing filter...|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{below to}} access the article (may not be free). Understanding {{environmental}} impacts of nanomaterials necessitates analyzing the life cycle profile. The initial emphasis of nanomaterial life cycle studies {{has been on the}} environmental and health effects of nanoproducts during the production and usage stages. Analyzing the end-of-life (eol) stage of nanomaterials is also critical because significant impacts or benefits for the environment may arise at that particular stage. In this article, the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) Consumer Products Inventory (CPI) model was used, which contains a relatively large and complete nanoproduct list (1, 014) as of 2010. The consumer products have wide range of applications, such as clothing, sports goods, personal care products, medicine, as well as contributing to faster cars and planes, more powerful computers and satellites, better micro and nanochips, and long-lasting batteries. In order to understand the eol cycle concept, we allocated 1, 014 nanop! roducts into the nine end-of-life categories (e. g., recyclability, ingestion, absorption by skin/public sewer, public <b>sewer,</b> burning/landfill, landfill, <b>air</b> release, <b>air</b> release/public <b>sewer,</b> and other) based on probable final destinations of the nanoproducts. This article highlights the results of this preliminary assessment of end-of-life stage of nanoproducts. The largest potential eol fate was found to be recyclability, however little literature appears to have evolved around nanoproduct recycling. At lower frequency is dermal and ingestion human uptake and then landfill. Release to water and air are much lower potential eol fates for current nanoproducts. In addition, an analysis of nano-product categories with the largest number of products listed indicated that clothes, followed by dermal-related products and then sports equipment were the most represented in the PEN CPI ([URL] 2010).
