40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a part of work for the UNIDO {{initiative}} on technology transfer for sustainable industrial development. The proposed technology transfer framework, adapted from the East Asian late industrialisers model, identifies two categories of countries requiring support for enhancing their technological capabilities: (a) very late industrialisers (“low income” developing countries), and (b) slow industrialisers (countries with sizeable manufacturing sectors but limited success in gaining international competitiveness) and three technology transfer routes: (a) through trade and aid to strengthen indigenous production for domestic markets (Route 1); (b) through FDI and contracting to develop export oriented firms (Route 2), and (c) through the supply chain of capital equipment and materials to develop local <b>subcontracting</b> <b>capacity</b> (Route 3). Very late industrialisers need support to start with Route 1 in selected sectors and upgrade through imported mature technologies. Appropriate product innovations are also possible. The slow industrialisers have more scope for increased technology transfer through Routes 2 and 3...|$|E

This system {{is very important for}} foreign (commerce: over 75 % of Romanian export to the European Union is in subcontracting for re-exportation system. This huge percent is possible because the subcontracting for re-exportation system allows a better management of the production capacities in order to maintain jobs or to create new ones, and in this way the competition producers a more important roll in what cancers the demands of consumers and it attracts foreign investors, also. <b>subcontracting,</b> production <b>capacities,</b> trade...|$|R
30|$|The {{survival}} of the company can be well explained by the links established by the entrepreneurs between them and distant markets and {{the analysis of the}} role of export agents. Moreover, intense competition marks horizontal relationships between new firms, which is all the stronger as barriers to entry are low. However, the latter can be achieved in areas such as the technical training services sector {{or in the case of}} large companies benefiting from <b>capacity</b> <b>subcontracting.</b> These include the benefits of market access and skilled labor, the use of advanced technologies and the desire to benefit other less developed counterparts, and intensive inter-firm cooperation.|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} question encountered in acquiring capacity to meet nonstationary demand over a multi-period horizon {{is how to}} balance the tradeoff between having insufficient capacity in some periods and excess capacity in others. In the former situation part of the demand is subcontracted, while in the latter capacity that has been paid for is rendered idle. <b>Capacity</b> and <b>subcontracting</b> decisions arise in many economic activities ranging from production capacity planning in semiconductor fabs to leasing communication networks, from transportation contracts to staffing of call centers. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs between acquiring <b>capacity,</b> <b>subcontracting,</b> production, and holding inventory to satisfy nonstationary demand over a finite horizon. We present capacity acquisition models with holding and without holding inventory and identify forecast-robust properties of the models that restrict the dependence of optimal capacity decisions on the demand forecasts. We deve [...] ...|$|R

In this research we consider a supply chain including multiple suppliers, multiple manufacturers and multiple customers, addressing a multi-site, multi-period, multi-product aggregate production planning (APP) problem under uncertainty. First a new robust multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is proposed to deal with APP considering two conflicting objectives simultaneously, as well as the uncertain nature of the supply chain. Cost parameters of the supply chain and demand fluctuations are subject to uncertainty. Then the problem transformed into a multi-objective linear one. The first objective function aims to minimize total losses of supply chain including production cost, hiring, firing and training cost, raw material and end product inventory holding cost, transportation and shortage cost. The second objective function considers customer satisfaction through minimizing sum of the maximum amount of shortages among the customers' zones in all periods. Working levels, workers productivity, overtime, <b>subcontracting,</b> storage <b>capacity</b> and lead time are also considered. Finally, the proposed model is solved as a single-objective mixed integer programming model applying the LP-metrics method. The practicability of the proposed model is demonstrated through its application in solving an APP problem in an industrial case study. The results indicate that the proposed model can provide a promising approach to fulfill an efficient production planning in a supply chain.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel {{extension of the}} targeting methods front pinch analysis to aggregate planning in supply chains. Aggregate planning aims at meeting demand over a specified time horizon {{in a way that}} maximizes profit through optimal levels of production, <b>capacity,</b> <b>subcontracting,</b> inventory, and stockouts. It is demonstrated how minimum production rates for a given demand forecast may be targeted through composite curves on a time versus material quantity plot. The grand composite curve (GCC) representation may be conveniently used to depict how surpluses and shortages in inventory fluctuate over time. The pinch corresponds to the point of minimum lead time and zero inventory. An example problem is used to illustrate the approach. The initial aggregate plan from pinch analysis exactly matches the solution reported in literature obtained by solving a linear programming formulation. On the other hand, the final aggregate plans from the pinch targeting method are superior to the solution in literature, as they are more realistic. It may be concluded that the production composite determined by the pinch targeting method provides either the best aggregate plan or an excellent starting point to reduce computational time for a solution by mixed integer linear programming...|$|R
30|$|In effect, this {{globalization}} induced dynamic {{generates a}} return to capacity or “verlängerte Werkbank” contracting inside Germany. Unlike the new forms of collaborative subcontracting that emerged {{over the course of}} the last twenty years (Herrigel 2010, Chap.  5), this new <b>capacity</b> <b>subcontracting</b> does not involve joint component development or collaborative exploration for cost reduction possibilities. It is simply a relief valve for internal workshops to enable the latter to engage in specialized work. Indeed, many firms insist that these new suppliers use the same machinery and same dies as the internal operations do. In some cases they provide the suppliers with the equipment; in many other cases, they seek out suppliers who already use the same equipment that internal workshops use (e.g. Heller Machining Centers or Liebherr Lathes). The outsourcing firms in these cases do not expect that the supplier firms will have the same skilled worker allocation that their own workshops have. The workers at suppliers must only produce existing products efficiently, while workers in internal workshops must work with development engineers on new product development. As a result, outsourcing firms look for competent suppliers with a narrower skill base and, crucially, with a lower cost structure, especially lower wages.|$|R
30|$|Entrepreneurial would-be German {{capacity}} suppliers {{see this}} situation {{as an opportunity}} to gain home market business. Such firms are typically not members of their local Employer Association and, as a result, are not bound to pay the collectively bargained wages or abide by other collectively agreed upon conditions that employer association member firms negotiate with trade unions. These firms hire older skilled workers who have been made redundant in their customer firm operations. They then supplement these workers with immigrant labor that they are able to draw on from eastern and southern Europe. One supplier we visited, for example, had a robust mixture of Italian, Greek, Polish and Ukranian personnel. The immigrant mix can vary; the point is that these firms offer German customers reliable local <b>capacity</b> <b>subcontracting</b> service without any of the distance induced unpredictability and cost of CEE rivals. Interestingly, this shift in home country production location needs and CEE supplier competitiveness is leading to a revival of traditional German capacity sub-contracting regions, such as the Schwaebische Alb, (e.g. Albstadt), or the traditional small producer metalworking areas south and east of the Ruhr (Bergisches Land, Sauerland, Siegerland). Though these regions have long traditions in capacity outsourcing (Herrigel 1995), the new emerging suppliers there constitute new terrain in the contemporary German manufacturing landscape.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a call center outsourcing contract analysis and choice problem faced by a contractor and a service provider. The service provider receives an uncertain call volume over multiple periods and is considering outsourcing {{all or part}} of these calls to a contractor. Each call brings in a fixed revenue to the service provider. Answering calls requires having service capacity; thus implicit in the outsourcing decision is a capacity decision. Insufficient capacity implies that calls cannot be answered, which in turn means there will be a revenue loss. Faced with a choice between a volume-based and a capacity-based contract offered by a contractor that has pricing power, the service provider determines optimal capacity levels. The optimal price and capacity of the contractor together with the optimal capacity of the service provider determine optimal profits of each party under the two contracts being considered. This paper characterizes optimal capacity levels and partially characterizes optimal pricing decisions under each contract. The impact of demand variability and the economic parameters on contract choice are explored through numerical examples. It is shown that no contract type is universally preferred and that operating environments as well as cost-revenue structures have an important effect. call center, outsourcing, <b>subcontracting,</b> contract choice, <b>capacity</b> investment, pricing...|$|R
40|$|Outstanding {{progress}} toward reaching NREL/DOE goals was achieved during this subcontract: (1) Siemens Solar Industries (SSI) introduced two new CIS {{products to the}} SSI ST family of products, including an approximately 1 -ft {times} 4 -ft, 40 -Wp module. (2) Process data {{for the production of}} circuit plates for the CIS family of products demonstrates improved efficiency and exhibits generally good control for extended periods. (3) The first subcontract milestone and the deliverables for this subcontract phase were met by delivering product samples that are larger and of higher efficiency than originally promised for this <b>subcontract</b> phase. (4) <b>Capacity</b> has been increased while also increasing the average efficiency of 1 -ft {times} 4 -ft circuit plates from 10. 8 % to 11. 2 %. (5) Yield improvements have been made by implementing improvements in processes and manufacturing protocols. (6) FM and UL approval was obtained for the ST series of products. (7) Long-term outdoor stability has been demonstrated at NREL, where 30 -cm {times} 30 -cm and 30 -cm {times} 120 -cm modules have undergone testing for more than 11 years. (8) SSI is addressing near-term and longer-term R&D topics through SSI's participation in NREL CIS National Team activities. (9) NREL confirmed a world-record 12. 1 % conversion efficiency large-area (3651 cm{sup 2 }) CIS module. (10) R&D Magazine awarded the prestigious R&D 100 Award to SSI, NREL, and the California Energy Commission for the SSI family of CIS modules. CIS has demonstrated the prerequisites for a commitment to large-scale commercialization - high efficiency, long-term outdoor stability, and attractive cost projections. Remaining challenges are to: scale the processes to even larger areas, reach higher production capacity, demonstrate in-service durability over even longer times, and advance the fundamental understanding of CIS-based materials and devices, with the goal of further efficiency improvements for future products...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the competition between suppliers for a buyer’s procurement business with consideration of <b>subcontracting,</b> commitment and <b>capacity</b> reservation. Under the circumstance where suppliers face diseconomies of scale, it may be cost effective for a buyer to split an order across different suppliers. Even when the buyer chooses only one supplier, the winning supplier may subcontract {{part of the work}} to the others subsequently. Motivated by these observations, Chapter 2 studies a supplier bidding game where a buyer requests quotes from two competing suppliers. We consider two procurement scenarios: (1) Order Splitting where each supplier submits a function bid which specifies different payments for different quantities, and the buyer may split the order; (2) Single-Sourcing Commitment where the buyer commits to purchasing from only one supplier before suppliers submit their bids, and the winning supplier may subsequently subcontract with the losing one. The second and third papers investigate the competitive behaviour of suppliers with capacity reservation. To hedge against financial risks, the suppliers often require a buyer to reserve capacity in advance by paying an upfront fee. In Chapter 3, we consider a discrete version of this problem where competing suppliers each choose a reservation price and an execution price for blocks of capacity, and the buyer needs to decide which blocks to reserve. Chapter 4 studies a continuous version of the problem where we allow general cost functions. The suppliers compete by offering the price functions (for reservation and execution) and the buyer decides how much to reserve from each supplier. This thesis sheds light on how suppliers compete with each other by considering a variety of factors. We believe an in-depth look at the competitive behaviour of suppliers will deepen our understanding of a buyer’s procurement process, and hence helps a buyer make a better sourcing decision...|$|R
