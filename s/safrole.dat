25|$|Bark: Commonly used barks include {{cinnamon}} and cascarilla. The fragrant oil in sassafras root bark {{is also used}} either directly or purified for its main constituent, <b>safrole,</b> which {{is used in the}} synthesis of other fragrant compounds.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} methods available to synthesize MDMA via different intermediates. The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating <b>safrole</b> to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P {{in turn is}} generally synthesized from piperonal, <b>safrole</b> or isosafrole. [...] One method is to isomerize <b>safrole</b> to isosafrole {{in the presence of}} a strong base, and then oxidize isosafrole to MDP2P. Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize <b>safrole</b> directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a reductive amination leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (R)-MDMA and (S)-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of Ocotea cymbarum, for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% <b>safrole.</b> This allows 500ml of the oil to produce between 150 and 340 grams of MDMA.|$|E
50|$|Besides being a hepatocarcinogen, <b>safrole</b> {{exhibits}} further {{adverse effects}} {{in that it}} will induce the formation of hepatic lipid hydroperoxides. <b>Safrole</b> also inhibits the defensive function of neutrophils against bacteria. In addition to the inhibition of the defensive function of neutrophils, {{it has also been}} discovered that <b>safrole</b> interferes with the formation of superoxides by neutrophils. Furthermore, <b>safrole</b> oxide, a metabolite of <b>safrole,</b> has a negative effect on the central nervous system. <b>Safrole</b> oxide inhibits the expression of integrin β4/SOD, which leads to apoptosis of the nerve cells.|$|E

50|$|<b>Safrole</b> is not {{available}} in any other forms. Isosafrole however, closely resembles <b>safrole.</b> Isosafrole is produced synthetically from <b>safrole</b> and is not found in nature. Isosafrole comes in two forms, trans-isosafrole and cis-isosafrole. Isosafrole {{is used as a}} precursor for the psychoactive drug MDMA. When <b>safrole</b> is metabolized several metabolites can be identified. Some of these metabolites have been shown to exhibit toxicological effects, such as 1’-hydroxysafrole and 3’-hydroxysafrole in rats. Further metabolites of <b>safrole</b> that have been found in urine of both rats and human include 1,2-dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene or 1(2)-methoxy-2(1)hydroxy-4- allylbenzene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safrole</b> (4-allyl-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene or shikimol) is a phenylpropene. It is a {{colourless}} {{or slightly}} yellow oily liquid which is typically {{extracted from the}} root-bark or the fruit of Sassafras albidum (native to eastern north America) {{in the form of}} sassafras oil, or from Ocotea odorifera, a Brazilian species. It can also be synthesized from catechol or other related methylenedioxy compounds. <b>Safrole</b> is also present in certain essentials oils and in brown camphor oil, which is in small amounts present in many plants and functions as a natural pesticide. <b>Safrole</b> {{is a member of the}} methylenedioxybenzene group, of which many compounds are used as insecticide synergists; for example, <b>safrole</b> is used as a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide piperonyl butoxide. <b>Safrole</b> is also used as a precursor in the synthesis of the drug N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy). <b>Safrole</b> can be found in anise, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper, and as an additive in root beer, chewing gum, toothpaste, soaps, and certain pharmaceutical preparations. Before <b>safrole</b> was banned by the FDA in 1960 for use in food, it was used as a food flavour for its characteristic ‘candy-shop’ aroma. <b>Safrole</b> has been shown to exhibit antibiotic and anti-angiogenic functions.|$|E
5000|$|The root bark of American {{sassafras}} {{contains a}} low percentage of steam-volatile oil, which is typically 75% <b>safrole.</b> [...] Attempts to refine <b>safrole</b> from sassafras bark in mass quantities {{are generally not}} economically viable due to low yield and high effort. However, smaller quantities can be extracted quite easily via steam distillation (about 10% of dry sassafras root bark by mass). Demand for <b>safrole</b> is causing rapid and illicit harvesting of the Cinnamomum parthenoxylon tree in Southeast Asia, in particular the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia. However, {{it is not clear}} what proportion of illicitly harvested <b>safrole</b> is going toward MDMA production, as over 90% of the global <b>safrole</b> supply (about 2000 metric tons per year) is used to manufacture pesticides, fragrances, and other chemicals. Sustainable harvesting of <b>safrole</b> is possible from leaves and stems of certain plants.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{sassafras}} {{roots and}} bark, the tree's leaves (from which filé is produced), {{do not contain}} a detectable amount of <b>safrole.</b> [...] This is significant because in 1960, the FDA banned the use of sassafras oil and <b>safrole</b> in commercially mass-produced foods and drugs based on the animal studies and human case reports suggesting <b>safrole</b> is a carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|Rats {{and mice}} with {{a diet of}} 0.5-1% <b>safrole</b> {{for a long period}} of time {{developed}} hepatic tumors, and direct injections gave a similar result. Additionally, male mice nursed by safrole-treated mothers developed hepatic tumors, though female mice of these mothers had a low incidence of forming renal carcinomas. The formation of these hepatic tumors and renal carcinomas is caused by the metabolism of <b>safrole</b> with liver microsomes to 1-hydroxyl derivates, which are stronger carcinogens than <b>safrole</b> itself. <b>Safrole</b> has the same effect on hamsters and guinea pigs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safrole</b> {{is listed}} as a Table I {{precursor}} under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.Due to {{its role in the}} manufacture of MDMA, <b>safrole</b> and isosafrole, as well as piperonal, are Category I precursors under regulation No 273/2004 of the European Community. In the United States, <b>safrole</b> is currently a List I chemical.|$|E
50|$|Studies in the 1960s {{suggested}} that <b>safrole</b> was carcinogenic, causing permanent liver damage in animals. Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned sassafras and <b>safrole</b> for human consumption.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safrole</b> can be {{obtained}} through natural extraction from the Sassafras albidum and the Ocotea cymbarum. Sassafras oil for example is obtained by steam distillation of the root bark of the Sassafras tree. The resulting steam distilled product contains about 90% <b>safrole</b> by weight. The oil is dried by mixing it {{with a small amount}} of anhydrous calcium chloride. After filtering-off the calcium chloride, the oil is vacuum distilled at 100◦ C under a vacuum of 11 millimeters of mercury or frozen in (melting point of 11◦C) to crystallize the <b>safrole</b> out. This technique works with other oils in which <b>safrole</b> is present as well.|$|E
50|$|Toxicological {{studies have}} shown that <b>safrole</b> is a weak hepatocarcinogen at higher doses in rats and mice. <b>Safrole</b> {{requires}} metabolic activation before exhibiting toxicological effects. Metabolic conversion of the allyl group in <b>safrole</b> is able to produce intermediates which are directly capable of binding covalently with DNA and proteins. Metabolism of the methylenedioxy group to a carbene allows the molecule to form ligand complexes with cytochrome P450 and P448. The formation of this complex leads to lower amounts of available free cytochrome P450. <b>Safrole</b> can also directly bind to cytochrome P450, leading to competitive inhibition.  These two mechanisms result in lowered mixed function oxidase activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oils within the leaf {{are rich in}} <b>safrole,</b> a substance also found in sassafras, which {{has been shown to}} be carcinogenic in animals. In 1960, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned sassafras bark along with sassafras oil and <b>safrole</b> as flavoring agents because of their carcinogenic properties and the Council of Europe imposed the same ban in 1974, although toxicological studies show that humans do not process <b>safrole</b> into its carcinogenic metabolite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safrole</b> {{is still}} {{regarded}} by FDA to be a weak carcinogen in rats. However, {{according to a}} 1977 study of the metabolites of <b>safrole</b> in both rats and humans, two carcinogenic metabolites of <b>safrole</b> found in the urine of rats, 1'-hydroxysafrole and 3'-hydroxyisosafrole, were not found in human urine. The European Commission on Health and consumer protection assumes <b>safrole</b> to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. It occurs naturally {{in a variety of}} spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper, and herbs such as basil. In that role, <b>safrole,</b> like many naturally occurring compounds, may have a small but measurable ability to induce cancer in rodents. Despite this, the effects in humans were estimated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to be similar to risks posed by breathing indoor air or drinking municipally supplied water. In the United States, it was once widely used as a food additive in root beer, sassafras tea, and other common goods, but was banned by the FDA after its carcinogenicity in rats was discovered. Today, <b>safrole</b> is also banned for use in soap and perfumes by the International Fragrance Association.|$|E

50|$|Many foods contain natural {{substances}} {{which are}} carcinogenic, for example <b>safrole,</b> which occurs in sassafras and sweet basil. Even these substances {{are covered by}} the Delaney clause, so that, for example, <b>safrole</b> may not be added to root beer in the USA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safrole,</b> the {{aromatic}} oil found in sassafras roots and bark that gave traditional root beer its distinctive flavour, was banned for commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or sassafras oil that contained large doses of <b>safrole</b> developed permanent liver damage or {{various types of}} cancer. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes substituted with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the <b>safrole</b> distilled and removed are available.|$|E
50|$|As said <b>safrole</b> can be {{synthesized}} from catechol {{and other}} related methylenedioxy compounds. Catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) reacts in a basic solution with dibromomethane (CH2Br2) to 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene. 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene is selectively brominated with N-bromo-succinimide to form 4-bromo-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene. The 4-bromo-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene reacts with Mg to give the Grignard adduct (R-MgBr), and couples with allyl bromide to form <b>safrole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some {{members of}} the magnoliids have served as {{important}} food additives. Oil of sassafras was formerly used as a key flavoring in both root beer and in sarsaparilla. [...] The primary ingredient responsible for the oil's flavor is <b>safrole,</b> {{but it is no}} longer used in either the United States or Canada. Both nations banned the use of <b>safrole</b> as a food additive in 1960 as a result of studies that demonstrated <b>safrole</b> promoted liver damage and tumors in mice. [...] Consumption of more than a minute quantity of the oil causes nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and shallow rapid breathing. It is very toxic, and can severely damage the kidneys. In addition to its former use as a food additive, <b>safrole</b> from either Sassafras or Ocotea cymbarum is also the primary precursor for synthesis of MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), commonly known as the drug ecstasy.|$|E

Many other trees contain similarly high percentages and their extracted oils are {{sometimes referred to as}} sassafras oil., which once was extensively used as a fragrance in perfumes and soaps, food and for aromatherapy. <b>Safrole</b> is a precursor for the clandestine manufacture of the drugs MDA and MDMA, and as such, sales and import of sassafras oil (as a <b>safrole</b> containing mixture of above threshold concentration) are heavily restricted in the US.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Safrole</b> is a phenylpropene, which {{consists}} of a benzene ring with an allyl group attached to it, it has the molecular formula C10H10O2 and a molecular weight of 162,188 g/mol.

50|$|<b>Safrole</b> {{itself is}} an acetal which is readily {{hydrolysed}} in acidic solutions to give 4-allylpyrocatechol and formaldehyde (or formaldehyde polymers).|$|E
50|$|<b>Safrole</b> can be {{synthesized}} {{into many}} compounds. Examples are N-acylarylhydrazones, isosters, aryl-sulfonamide derivatives, acidic sulphonylhydrazone derivatives, benzothiazine derivatives. and many more.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Safrole</b> can undergo {{many forms}} of metabolism. The two major routes are the {{oxidation}} of the allyl side chain and the oxidation of the methylenedioxy group. The oxidation of the allyl side chain is mediated by a cytochrome P450 complex, which will transform <b>safrole</b> into 1’-hydroxysafrole. The newly formed 1’-hydroxysafrole will undergo a phase II of Drug Metabolism reaction with a Sulfotransferase enzyme to create 1’-sulfoxysafrole, which can cause DNA adducts. A different oxidation pathway of the allyl side chain can form <b>safrole</b> epoxide. So far, this has only been found in rats and guinea pigs. The formed epoxide is a small metabolite due to the slow formation and further metabolism of the compound. An epoxide hydratase enzyme will act on the epoxide to form dihydrodiol, which can be secreted in urine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Safrole</b> is a phenylpropene. It is a colorless or {{slightly}} yellow oily liquid typically {{extracted from the}} root-bark or the fruit of sassafras plants {{in the form of}} sassafras oil (although commercially available culinary sassafras oil is usually devoid of <b>safrole</b> due to a rule passed by the FDA in 1960), or is synthesized from catechol or other related methylenedioxy compounds. It is the principal component of brown camphor oil, and is found in small amounts {{in a wide variety of}} plants, where it functions as a natural pesticide. Ocotea cymbarum oil made from Ocotea pretiosa, a plant growing in Brazil, and sassafras oil made from Sassafras albidum, a tree growing in eastern North America, are the main natural sources for <b>safrole.</b> It has a characteristic [...] "sweet-shop" [...] aroma.|$|E
50|$|The phenylpropenes, {{including}} eugenol, chavicol, <b>safrole</b> and estragole, {{are derived}} from the monolignols. These compounds are the primary constituents of various essential oils.|$|E
50|$|The main {{constituents}} of the witch hazel extract include calcium oxalate, gallotannins, <b>safrole,</b> {{as well as}} chemicals found in the essential oil (carvacrol, eugenol).|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>safrole</b> {{through the}} oxidation of the methylenedioxy proceeds via the cleavage of the methylenedioxy group. This results in two major metabolites: allylcatechol and its isomer, propenylcatechol. Eugenol {{is a minor}} metabolite of <b>safrole</b> in humans, mice, and rats. The intact allyl side chain of allylcatechol may be oxidized to yield 2’,3’-epoxypropylcatechol. This {{can serve as a}} substrate for an epoxide hydratase enzyme, and will hydrate the 2’,3’-epoxypropylcatechol to 2’,3’-dihydroxypropylcatechol. This new compound can be oxidized to form propanoic acid (PPA), which is a substance that is related to an increase in oxidative stress and Glutathione S-transferase activity. PPA also causes a decrease in glutathione and Glutathione Peroxidase activity. The epoxide of allylcatechol may also be generated from the cleavage of the methylenedioxy group of the <b>safrole</b> epoxide. The cleavage of the methylenedioxy ring and the metabolism of the allyl group involve the hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidases.|$|E
