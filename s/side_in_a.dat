5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Roma {{underwent}} a change of ownership, with the former club owner Rosella Sensi being replaced by an American consortium led by Thomas DiBenedetto. Under the new management, the club did not offer a permanent contract to Montella, which led to him leaving to coach another Serie A side, Catania. The Roma management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B <b>side,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategic}} {{position of the}} Low Countries, located between France and Germany on the uncovered flanks of their fortification lines, made the area a logical route for an offensive by either <b>side.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 20 January 1940 radio speech, Winston Churchill tried to convince them not to wait for an inevitable German attack, but to join the Anglo-French Entente. Both the Belgians and Dutch refused, even though the German attack plans had fallen into Belgian hands after a German aircraft crash in January 1940, in {{what became known as}} the Mechelen Incident.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that <b>side.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|Born in Enfield, London, Morison joined Northampton Town {{as part of}} the club's youth system after a {{successful}} trial period with the club, having also spent time on trial at Leicester City. When Morison turned 18, he signed a two-year professional contract with Northampton. He impressed manager Kevan Broadhurst and subsequently made his debut {{at the end of the}} 2001–02 season in a 2–2 draw against Cambridge United. The following season, Morison featured regularly as a substitute, playing a total of 15 games, scoring his first goal for the Northamptonshire <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 draw against Plymouth Argyle. However, the 2003–04 season witnessed Morison feature in only 5 games, getting on the scoresheet once. In June 2004, he was offered a new six-month contract at the club, and told by manager Colin Calderwood that he had to prove his worth at the club.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{was born}} on 6 February 1969 in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire. He {{attended}} Walney Comprehensive in Barrow, and after completing his studies, joined the engineering firm Vickers. Burns began his county career playing Minor Counties cricket with Cumberland. He made his debut for the <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-day Championship match against Norfolk in July 1988. Playing as wicket-keeper, he claimed one catch and one stumping. He did not appear for the county's first team again for another year; in 1989, he played three times for Cumberland, appearing on each occasion as a specialist lower-order batsman. Early during the 1990 season, Burns played one match, without excelling, for Glamorgan's second team. He was a regular for Cumberland during 1990, and in his seven appearances in the Championship, he scored 180 runs {{at an average of}} 22.50, and took eleven catches and three stumpings.|$|E
5|$|By April 1975, morale in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{had sunk}} {{so low that}} some of their {{personnel}} simply defected to the Communist <b>side.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> well-known incident, South Vietnamese pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F-5E fighter-bomber to attack the Presidential Palace in Saigon instead of North Vietnamese troops. Shortly afterwards, Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to train a group of North Vietnamese pilots to operate the U.S.-made A-37 Dragonfly fighter-bomber, in order to support the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. On the afternoon of April 28, 1975, Trung led a flight of five A-37 fighter-bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base, which temporarily stopped U.S. and South Vietnamese evacuation efforts.|$|E

5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} Carre's School is not known. From 1653, it operated in buildings on Eastgate, adjacent to Carre's Hospital. After these fell into disrepair {{in the late}} 18th century, pupils were taught in the vestry of St Denys' Church until the school was closed in 1816. In 1826, the trustees purchased a house on Northgate {{at the cost of}} £545 3s. from one Mr Squires. In 1834, the Chancery Court agreed to fund the rebuilding of the school according to plans by the Sleaford architect and builderCharles Kirk, who constructed it at a cost £1,168 15s. The building is in the Tudor Gothic style and built in Ashlar stone with slate roofs. It has three stories of three bays, with the upper floor housed in two gables. A shield with the arms of the Marquis of Bristol and his wife are located above the four-centre arch doorway. One storey wings exist on either <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar style.

5|$|Despite {{being born}} in Lagos, Nigeria, Odubade {{grew up in}} East Sussex. He {{attended}} The Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne. He began his football career in England, playing in the Sussex County League for Eastbourne Town in 2002. He scored over 70 times in just two seasons at the East Sussex club in all competitions, before attracting the attention of then–Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season, he subsequently joined the club on a one-year contract in July 2004 after a successful trial. He made his debut as a substitute for the Somerset <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 4–3 defeat against Torquay United in the Football League Trophy in September 2004. He made his second Yeovil appearance in a 3–1 victory away at Histon in an FA Cup tie, scoring his only goal for the club deep into injury-time. He made a further four appearances for the side, before leaving the club in February 2005 due to personal reasons, and subsequently joined Conference South side Eastbourne Borough two days later. Odubade made his Eastbourne Borough debut in the club's 2–0 victory against Basingstoke Town just three days after signing for the club, playing 45 minutes of the match. In the following game, he scored twice as Eastbourne came from back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 at Cambridge City, scoring both goals within the space of five minutes. Odubade made it five goals in his first three games for Eastbourne, as he scored a hat-trick in the club's 4–0 home victory against Thurrock. He also scored Eastbourne's third goal in a 3–1 win in the following game against Newport County, latching onto a long ball and beating the goalkeeper first time. Throughout March 2005, Odubade scored in four consecutive games, netting against Cambridge City, Havant & Waterlooville, Sutton United, and Hayes to take his tally to ten goals for the club. He also provided the assists for two of Eastbourne's goals in a 3–0 win against Redbridge, and scored two goals in late April 2005 against Bishop's Stortford and Weston-Super-Mare respectively. He scored his last goal of the season in Eastbourne's 3–0 away win against Cambridge City in the play-off, and was in the side that lost 2–1 to Altrincham in the final.

5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left <b>side</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E
