The United States has run up massive accounts and budget deficits, export-led surpluses are developing in Asia. It also marks the debut to the G7 meetings, that is United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was formerly the {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Goldman Sachs.

In 2004, then opposition leader Don Brash refused to confirm or deny that he told visiting US senators the nuclear ban would be repealed [...] "by lunchtime" [...] if he was elected prime minister.

This paper reports a study that used a pre-test post-test design to measure teaching effectiveness.

We do not rest satisfied with asking the patient about the process of treatment. However, when it comes to teaching a course, we seem to be satisfied with asking the students about the process of teaching. Student assessment of teaching may be useful input for teachers to modify their teaching style, but it cannot be taken as a measure of teaching effectiveness. Effectiveness is a question of whether intended objectives are achieved or not, just as a physician is considered effective if the disease is cured.
