50|$|Beginning in the 1980s, Carinatae {{was given}} several phylogenetic {{definition}}s. The first {{was as a}} node-based clade uniting Ichthyornis with modern birds. However, in many analyses, this definition would be synonymous with the more widely used name Ornithurae. An alternate definition was provided in 2001, naming Carinatae an apomorphy-based clade defined by the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>keeled</b> sternum.|$|R
40|$|The Lonchocarpus cruentus complex, within sect. Lonchocarpus, is described. This {{complex is}} {{characterized}} by the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>keeled</b> vexillary margin on the pod. Five of the six species described and illustrated are new to science: Lonchocarpus aequatorialis, L. alternifoliolatus, L. guianensis, L. septentrionalis and L. trinitensis.

50|$|Shitiks {{are useful}} in {{overcoming}} shoals; they have speed and adequate capacity. The absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>keel</b> is <b>a</b> problem, as is poor stability. Such a boat does not transfer a wave, and every movement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passenger risks capsizing the vessel. But this combination of features suits hunters and fishermen, who {{can use it to}} cross rivers of 30 cm - 40 cm depth.|$|R
50|$|The ram was {{commonly}} used in antiquity, and was <b>an</b> important part <b>of</b> the armament of the galleys of Imperial Rome. The ancient Greeks used their trireme vessels for ramming as well. In ancient China, rams were largely unknown, as the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>keel</b> and the flat shape of the junk's bow was not conducive to the build <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elongated underwater spur.|$|R

50|$|The {{species has}} an {{elongate}} body with nearly parallel flanks. It bears <b>a</b> pattern <b>of</b> brown or pink blotches {{that serve as}} camouflage. A pronounced rostrum or spike extends {{from the front of}} the head and runs backwards over the center of the back in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>keel.</b> The segments <b>of</b> the pleon are fused to the telson. Average size is 40 mm.|$|R
25|$|Of Gondwanan origin, {{tinamous}} {{are members}} of the ratites, which comprise the Palaeognathae ("old jaws"), while all other living birds {{are members of}} Neognathae ("new jaws"). Unlike other palaeognaths, tinamous do have <b>a</b> <b>keeled</b> sternum, but like the other palaeognaths, they have a distinctive palate. It was formerly believed that the Tinamiformes separated from the ratites early on due to their retention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>keeled</b> sternum. The tinamous' possession of powder-down feathers and preen glands, which the ratites lack, was <b>a</b> source <b>of</b> confusion in determining their taxonomy.|$|R
