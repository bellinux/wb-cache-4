40|$|Lapped joints of cold-formed steel (CFS) Z-shaped purlins are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} building roof systems. The {{research that has}} been carried out so far for these lapped connections is primarily focused on connections with round holes. However, the lapped connections with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> are extensively used in current construction practice to simplify the erection of continuous Z-shaped roof purlins. There is no design guideline or recommendation available for CFS Z-purlin lapped connections with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> Presented in this paper are the results of an experimental study and analysis of the structural behaviour of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlin connections with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> 42 flexural tests were performed on lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with vertical slotted connections with different lap lengths, purlin depths, thicknesses and spans. The flexural strength and deflection of each specimen were measured. The characteristics of moment resistance and flexure stiffness of the lapped purlins were computed. The test results show that the lapped purlins with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> may be more flexible than the lapped purlins with round holes or continuous purlins without lapped joint. Thus, the slotted connections may need greater lap lengths to achieve full stiffness of continuous purlins. The results also indicate that the characteristics of moment resistance and flexural stiffness in the slotted connections are dependent on the ratio of lap length to purlin depth, the ratio of lap length to purlin thickness, the ratio of purlin depth to purlin thickness, and the ratio of lap length to span. Based on the results, design recommendations for evaluating the moment resistance and flexural stiffness of lapped slotted connections were proposed...|$|R

40|$|In cold-formed steel (CFS) construction, bolted {{connections}} without washers for either oversized or slotted holes may significantly expedite the installation process {{and lower the}} cost. However, the North American Specification (AISI S 100, 2007) for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members requires washers to be installed in {{bolted connections}} with oversized or slotted holes. A research project (Phase 1) sponsored by American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) was recently completed at the University of North Texas (UNT) that investigated the performance and strength of bolted CFS connections with oversized and slotted holes without using washers. The research presented in this thesis is the Phase 2 project in which the bolted CFS connections were studied in a broader respect {{in terms of the}} failure mechanism, the material thickness, and the hole configurations. Single shear and double shear connections without washers using oversized holes, oversized combined with standard or slotted holes were experimentally examined. Combined with Phase 1 results, the Phase 2 gives a comprehensive evaluation of the behavior and strength of bolted CFS connections with oversized and slotted holes without using washers. Revisions to the existing AISI North American Specification requirements for bolted connections are proposed to account for the reduction in the connection strength caused by the oversized and <b>slotted</b> <b>hole</b> configurations without washers.

The negative poisson ratio yarn structure is twisted by first yarns and second yarns, wherein the tensile modulus of each first yarn is {{greater than that of}} each second yarn. The manufacturing method of the structure comprises the following steps of: 1) yarn feeding: feeding the first yarns and the second yarns which are arrayed at intervals into a yarn forming area simultaneously, and 2) yarn twisting: twisting the fed first yarns and the second yarns simultaneously by rotating a <b>slotted</b> <b>hole</b> rotating disc, and then allowing the first yarns and the second yarns to be converged into the negative poisson ratio yarn structure at an inlet of a twisting aggregation device. The negative poisson ratio yarn structure is twisted by the two groups of yarns with different moduli, and is stable, and uniform in twist distribution, the yarns on the surface layer is free from slippage, and the surfaces of the yarns are level when tensioned. The manufacturing method is simple to operate, convenient to implement and low in used equipment cost, can be used for continuous production, and is convenient to popularize and implement. 本发明属于纺织技术领域，并公开了一种负泊松比纱线结构及其制造方法，该负泊松比纱线结构由第一纱线和第二纱线加捻形成，第一纱线的拉伸模量大于第二纱线的拉伸模量。其制造方法包括以下步骤： 1) 纱线喂入：将相间排列的第一纱线和第二纱线同时喂入到纱线形成区域； 2) 纱线加捻：通过转动槽孔转盘对喂入的第一纱线和第二纱线同时加捻，第一纱线和第二纱线随后在加捻集聚装置的入口处汇聚成负泊松比纱线结构。本发明的负泊松比纱线结构采用两组不同模量的纱线一起加捻完成，结构稳定、表层纱线无滑移、捻度分布匀且拉伸时纱线表面平整。本发明的制造方法操作简单、实施方便且所用设备成本低，可连续化生产，便于推广实施。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 胡红Inventor name used in this publication: 刘世瑞Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種負泊鬆比紗線結構及其製造方法Chin...|$|E

Therefore the divertor is a key component of the WEST project, and so is its support structure, which has to handle strong mechanical loads. The WEST upper and lower divertor are made of 12 30 ° sectors, each one composed of 38 PFU that can be made of tungsten, CuCrZr or graphite. A generic 316 L stainless steel 30 ° conic support plate is used to hold the 38 PFU together, regardless of their material.

40|$|International audienceConnections {{in steel}} {{structures}} are of main {{importance in the}} design process. Cover-plate connections with circular or slotted holes are of common use in steel structures. The behavior of such connections is characterized by various failure modes. Bearing mode {{is one of the}} most complex due to the distribution of stresses and strain around the loaded holes. This paper deals with the characterization of the behavior of cover-plate bolted joints with slotted holes. Numerical simulations using the Cast 3 M FE package are performed in association with an original experimental method based on full-field measurements. The strain fields obtained with these methods (grid method and Digital Image Correlation (DIC)) give the possibility to observe the evolution of the local deformations in the loaded zones of the connections. These evolutions are compared to those given by the Finite Element model for each configuration at different loadings stages. Thus, the experimental results are used to validate the numerical model. The comparisons are based on the load-displacement curves, the failure modes and the local deformations in the zones around the bolts holes. Six different geometrical parameters of the holes and their positions are considered in the tests. The validated numerical model is used to evaluate the influences of the dimensions of the <b>slotted</b> <b>hole.</b> The results showed that the geometry has a significant influence on the failure mode of the connections such as net section and bearing. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to those given by the analytical approach of Eurocode 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the analytical prediction. The study shows the influence of various geometrical parameters on the resistance and the failure mode of the connections with slotted holes. The strain fields obtained with the grid method and DIC are observed in the plate around the bolt in the elastic and plastic phases. They give the possibility to observe experimentally the evolution of strains in a wide area of the most stressed zones in order to develop more accurate analytical models based on experimental evolutions of strains...|$|E
40|$|Among passive energy {{dissipation}} devices, friction dampers are used worldwide as means of increasing damping into structural building systems {{with the aim}} to reduce the seismic response. These devices, added either in-line with diagonal braces, or at the intersection zone of X- and chevron-bracing and installed in moment frame buildings, can reduce the demand of the primary frame system, the interstorey drift, and control the damage of non-structural components as building envelope. Regarding to their mechanical behavior, friction dampers dissipate energy through the relative sliding of plates clamped with post-tensioned bolts, while slipping occurs {{along the length of}} the <b>slotted</b> <b>hole.</b> This device reveals a rigid-plastic behavior defined by three phases such as: “stick-slip” before sliding occurs, “slipping”, and the “slip-lock” when the force in the device increases due to the bearing of the post-tensioned bolts. Thus, the first part of this study is focused on establishing a computer model able to simulate the three-phase behavior of the friction damper installed in diagonal bracing by using OpenSees software framework. In light of this, the Bouc-Wen material characterized by smooth transition from elastic to plastic was calibrated through parametric study and employed to characterize the first two behavioural phases mainly controlled by the slip-force and available slip-distance. In addition, earlier experimental studies conducted by Pall (1979) were used to control the calibration. To simulate the slip-lock phase exhibited due to bearing of post-tensioned bolts, gap-elements were added in parallel to the Bouc-Wen model. In addition, to complete the friction-damped brace model, the action in series of the elastic brace and the friction damper model is considered. The second part of this study illustrates the behavior of the 4, 8 and 12 -storey building designed as moderately ductile (MD) moment resisting frame structure accordingly to NBCC 2010 and CSA/S 16 - 2009. The studied buildings are located in Montreal and are subjected to 15 simulated and historical ground motions scaled to match the uniform hazard spectrum. Herein, beams and columns were defined as nonlinear force-based beam column element with fiber section and Steel 02 material. From analyses, the mean values of the following parameters: maximum interstorey drift, maximum drift angle and maximum beam rotation are computed. The third part is designated to analyze the seismic response of MD-MRF structures equipped with friction-damped brace devices through numerical simulations of 4 -, 8 - and 12 -storey building, using OpenSees. It is showed that the proposed hysteresis model for friction-damped brace responds well under dynamic loading and it is able to tune the response within the prescribed limits. Driving devices into bearing shows transitional changes consisted of decreasing damping and increasing stiffness. When this phase is encountered, the MD-MRF might respond as a back-up system and as a re-centering system. It is revealed that the three-phase hysteresis model of friction damper developed in this study must be calibrated against experimental test results conducted under cyclic loading until failure is reached. Due to lack of experimental test results several assumptions were made. ...|$|E

Representative non-linear finite element models of the bolted test coupons have been constructed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the short- and long-term behaviour of injected bolted connections (IBCs) with oversize holes for various injection materials. A central theme in this thesis the demountability of IBCs, {{as a result of}} which several release agents are tested for their suitability in and effects on IBCs. Injection bolts have been used successfully in engineering practice using epoxy resin to limit the amount of slip in bolted shear connections with normal clearance holes, but no explicit results are available for connections with oversize or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> The use of oversize or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> may be beneficial for the (re-) erection process of structures, and thus it is investigated what the effects of such oversize or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> are on the connection behaviour. First, it is examined if grout is suitable as an injection material in injected bolted connections (IBCs), as well as what precautions are necessary to ensure proper demountability of grout- and (epoxy) resin-injected bolted connections. Secondly, the connection behaviour under short-term loading is determined, on the basis of which long-term creep tests are carried out. Finally, a new injection material is developed based on the preliminary conclusions drawn from the short- and long-term tests. It is concluded that IBCs can be demounted by treating the connection members with a release agent. The results of the experiments show that the long-term behaviour of resin-injected connections is governing the design, but that modelling of this time-dependent behaviour requires additional testing. The short and long-term performance of the newly developed material (resin reinforced with steel shot) in IBCs with oversize holes is significantly better than that of only resin, on the basis of which it is recommended to further investigate the potential and behaviour of this material in engineering applications.

Friction connections with long open <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> havepreviously {{been proven to}} be a competitive alternative. In this work, the newtype of connection is investigated in various scales: segment tests, down-scaledexperiments and full-scale models. The influence of tower cross-section shape,execution tolerance (horizontal gap between the tower segments) and length ofthe connection on the bending resistance is thoroughly studied. In addition,buckling behaviour of the shell {{in the vicinity of the}} friction connection intowers with circular and polygonal cross-sections is analysed in order to checkpossible advantages of either cross-section. The influence of two types of theexecution tolerances on the connection strength is investigated: inwards bent“fingers”, leading to inclined gaps, and a parallel gap created by differentdiameters of the tower segments. Based on validated finite element analysesrecommendations for execution tolerances are proposed. A closer look is taken at the level of bolt forces under load application for thenew friction connections as well as for the ring flange connection. For theformer case, the influence of <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> on the joint resistance is checked.
