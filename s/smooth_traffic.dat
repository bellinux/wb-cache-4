25|$|Most heavy {{vehicles}} are only allowed to travel 80–90km/h by law. Considering that two lanes are inadequate for <b>smooth</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, the expressway is being widened {{as a result}} of the increasing number of fatal accidents along this highway.|$|E
25|$|A road {{without a}} central {{reservation}} {{is a single}} carriageway regardless {{of the number of}} lanes. Dual carriageways have improved road traffic safety over single carriageways and typically have higher speed limits as a result.

25|$|Overall, the ALS was {{successful}} in ensuring <b>smooth</b> <b>traffic</b> flow in the Central Business District. After about 10 years of planning and testing, in September 1998, the Area Licensing Scheme was terminated as Singapore upgraded to the current Electronic Road Pricing system, which is completely automatic and allows passing the control gantries at normal speeds. The ERP system is still in use in Singapore, and many similar schemes were based on Singapore's ERP system, i.e.London Congestion Charge, Edinburgh Congestion Charge etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{scheme in}} packet switching networks {{is one of}} the most critical features that can affect the performance of the network. Hence, many scheduling algorithms have been suggested and some indices, such as fairness and latency, have been proposed for the comparison of their performances. While the nature of Internet traffic is bursty, traditional scheduling algorithms try to <b>smooth</b> the <b>traffic</b> and serve the users based on this <b>smoothed</b> <b>traffic.</b> As a result, the fairness index mainly considers this <b>smoothed</b> <b>traffic</b> and the service rate as the main parameter to differentiate among different sessions or flows. This work uses burstiness as a differentiating factor to evaluate scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature. To achieve this goal, a new index that evaluates the performance of a scheduler with bursty traffic is introduced. Additionally, this paper introduces a new scheduler that not only uses arrival rates but also considers burstiness parameters in its scheduling algorithms...|$|R
50|$|Traffic volume at the {{at-grade}} junction {{will also}} decrease allowing <b>smoother</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, especially for motorists entering Pan Island Expressway (westbound) from Upper Serangoon Road and MacPherson Road.

25|$|During festive seasons such as Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Christmas and Hari Raya, {{activities}} such as construction, road repairs and maintenance works are temporarily stopped to ensure a smoother traffic flow on the expressways. Meanwhile, heavy goods vehicles such as logging trucks, cement trucks, container trucks, construction materials trucks and other heavy goods vehicles (except tanker lorry, provision goods truck, crane, tow truck, fire engine, ambulance, etc.) are banned from using roads, highways, and expressways during festive seasons. A massive nationwide operation known as Ops Selamat (previously called Ops Sikap) is held annually by the Malaysian police to ensure safety on all roads in Malaysia during festive seasons. To <b>smooth</b> <b>traffic</b> flow during peak periods in the festive seasons, a Travel Time Advisory (TTA) {{has been set up}} at all interstate expressways such as PLUS Expressways network and East Coast Expressway.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology to provide soft real-time guarantees over Ethernet. To resolve unpredictable delay characteristics of Ethernet, we designed, implemented, and evaluated adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>smoothing.</b> Specifically, a <b>traffic</b> <b>smoother</b> is installed between the TCP/IP layer and the Ethernet MAC layer, and {{works as an}} interface between them. The <b>traffic</b> <b>smoother</b> first gives real-time (RT) packets priority over non-RT ones in order to eliminate contention within the local node. Second, it smooths a non-RT stream so as to reduce collision with RT packets from the other nodes. This <b>traffic</b> <b>smoothing</b> can dramatically decrease the packet-collision ratio on the network. The <b>traffic</b> <b>smoother,</b> installed at each node, regulates the node's outgoing non-RT stream to achieve a certain traffic-generation rate. In order to provide a reasonable non-RT throughput, the traffic-generation rate is allowed to adapt itself to the underlying network load condition. Our implementation of the <b>traffic</b> <b>smoother</b> requires only a minimal change in the OS kernel without any modification to the current standard of Ethernet MAC protocol or the TCP or UDP/IP stack...|$|R

50|$|Until recently, {{the roads}} had the {{original}} 90 km/h speed limit in use on most highways. As {{a result of}} this, many people drove at 90 km/h at 1-lane parts but 110 km/h at 2-lane parts, this being the speed limit on motorways. The speed limit has now been changed to 100 km/h with a notably <b>smoother</b> <b>traffic</b> flow.|$|R
50|$|Proponents for {{a second}} Gotthard Road Tunnel bore refer to the Seelisberg Tunnel, which they claim, due to split traffic, results in not only <b>smoother</b> <b>traffic,</b> but blocked traffic only on one side {{in the case of}} an {{accident}} inside the tunnel. However, opponents of the second Gotthard Road Tunnel have indicated that such measure would severely hinder the strategy of the transfer of marchandise from road to rail.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{reconstruction}} of the Hermsdorfrer Kreuz and its opening in 1992 it was stated that another reconstruction would be reuqired starting in 2010. Further reconstructions were then intended to follow, including upgrading both motorways to a 2x3 lane layout, with the aim of providing <b>smoother</b> <b>traffic</b> flow between the A4 coming from Erfurt. Semi-direct two lane on-ramps were intended to mitigate traffic jams due to the expected rising vehicle numbers on the A4 and A9.|$|R

50|$|A smart {{motorway}} (formerly managed motorway) is {{a section}} of motorway in Great Britain that uses active traffic management (ATM) techniques to increase capacity by use of variable speed limits and hard shoulder running at busy times. Benefits include <b>smoother</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, more reliable journey times, fewer road traffic collisions, and reduced noise and harmful vehicle emissions. The term controlled motorway is used for schemes that use variable speed limits without hard-shoulder running (for example, the M25 from J27 to J30).|$|R
