5|$|The section {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} social behaviour in different taxa. The theme is that evolution is progressive, with four pinnacles of <b>social</b> <b>evolution,</b> namely the colonial invertebrates such as corals, the social insects, mammals other than humans, and finally humans. The last chapter argues that natural selection has made humans far more flexible in social organisation than any other species.|$|E
5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the French National Assembly, where he maintained a political platform against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the <b>Social</b> <b>Evolution</b> of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>social</b> <b>evolution</b> {{from the}} archaic age to the classical, the public ceased {{carrying}} weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{writes that}} along with the ongoing <b>social</b> <b>evolution</b> that {{occurred}} after humans left Africa, the human physical form also continued to evolve. This {{is the subject of}} chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths. Race is not well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races – Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises that racial differences may have an influence on sporting achievement. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants – such as Proto-Indo-European – possibly spread through agriculture. By citing linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} main factor, genetic polymorphism, it is theorized that Euglossini bees have not {{reached a point}} where the {{threshold}} of genetic homogeneity permitting colony fitness has crossed the expected individual fitness.

In this paper, we present a study of understanding <b>social</b> relationship <b>evolution</b> by using real-life anonymized mobile phone data. First, we define a friendship as a directed relation, i. e., person A regards another person B as his or her friend but not necessarily vice versa. Second, we recognize human friendship from a supervised learning perspective. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach is adopted as the inference model to predict friendship based {{on a variety of}} features extracted from the mobile phone data, including proximity, outgoing calls, outgoing text messages, incoming calls, and incoming text messages. Third, we demonstrate the <b>social</b> relation <b>evolution</b> process by using the social balance theory. For the friendship prediction, we achieved an overall recognition rate of 97. 0 % by number and a class average accuracy of 89. 8 %. This shows that social relationships (not only reciprocal friends and non-friends, but non-reciprocal friends) can be likely predicted by using real-world sensing data. With respect to the friendship evolution, we verified that the principles of reciprocality and transitivity {{play an important role in}} <b>social</b> relation <b>evolution...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Frankfurt School avoided {{taking a}} stand on the precise {{relationship}} between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers.
