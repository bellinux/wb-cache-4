5|$|Electron beam {{processing}} is used {{to irradiate}} materials in order to change their physical properties or <b>sterilize</b> medical and food products. Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to <b>sterilize</b> an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to <b>sterilize</b> the base instead with a timed radiation pulse {{so that it can}} be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{fermentation}} experiments, Pasteur {{demonstrated that}} the skin of grapes was the natural source of yeasts, and that <b>sterilized</b> grapes and grape juice never fermented. He drew grape juice from under the skin with <b>sterilized</b> needles, and also covered grapes with <b>sterilized</b> cloth. Both experiments could not produce wine in <b>sterilized</b> containers.|$|R
25|$|Presser’s {{analysis}} {{also found}} that 46.7% of women who reported they were <b>sterilized</b> were {{between the ages of}} 34 and 39. Of the sample of women <b>sterilized,</b> 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10 to 14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20 to 24 years. Nearly 50% of women <b>sterilized</b> had three or four births.

40|$|From December 1979 to February 1980, {{data were}} {{collected}} on access to postpartum sterilization for all obstetric patients at a large maternity hospital in Campinas, Brazil. Of the 827 women wanting no additional children and having knowledge of sterilization, 481 (58 %) reported {{that they wanted to}} be <b>sterilized.</b> Of these women, 226 (47 %) were <b>sterilized</b> postpartum. One year following their deliveries, follow-up forms were administered to the women desiring sterilization, but who had not been <b>sterilized</b> postpartum, to determine if they had been <b>sterilized</b> {{over the course of the}} year. Only 13 % of the women had been <b>sterilized,</b> but almost 75 % of the women not <b>sterilized</b> said they were still interested in getting <b>sterilized.</b> Of the women interviewed, 18 % either had become pregnant again since the initial survey or were currently pregnant. ...|$|R
5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She {{assisted in the}} clinic of Marie Curie in Paris {{as well as in}} the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to <b>sterilize</b> and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E

30|$|Blood agar base (Oxoid, England) was {{prepared}} {{according to the}} manufacturer's instructions.

40|$|Different {{methods of}} <b>sterilizing</b> {{sprouting}} media {{for the control}} of rot in minisetts of Dioscorea rotundata var Pona and Dente were evaluated. Sawdust and topsoil sprouting media were <b>sterilized</b> by roasting, solarization and fumigation in a completely randomized block design replicated thrice in the laboratory. Significantly higher percentage rot was recorded for minisetts planted in unsterilized sprouting media than those in <b>sterilized</b> media. Incidence of minisett rot was, however, higher in unsterilized topsoil than in unsterilized sawdust. Roasting was most effective in <b>sterilizing</b> the sprouting media, followed by fumigation and the least was solarization.

40|$|Background: High blood {{cholesterol}} level {{is a risk}} factor of atherosclerosis, a condition causing coronary heart disease, obesity and others. The utilization of live cell like probiotic was proven to reduce cholesterol level in blood. The problem of the utilization of live cell was the low of distribution and difficulty in storage. Should be invented an alternate to produce the product with the same characteristic, that is, by utilization of inactive cell. Objective: to evaluate the effect of <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk on cholesterol reduction in vitro, that is the binding of cholesterol by the component of <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk. Method: The ability of <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk to bind cholesterol was assayed using inoculation of <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk in MRS medium with 0, 1 % pure cholesterol then was incubated at 37 C for 24 hours. After incubation, the cholesterol level bonded was measured by O-Pthalaldehid method. Result: The {{research has shown that}} the <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk and the fermented milk could bind the cholesterol. The <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk could bind the cholesterol the higher than the non <b>sterilized</b> fermented soymilk.

40|$|The role of <b>sterilized</b> and nonsterilized crab extract on the {{separation}} of coconut oil was examined using grated coconut meat as substrate. <b>Sterilized</b> crab extract was prepared by suspension and centrifugation of crushed crab and then filtrated using Millipore Utter. <b>Sterilized</b> crab extract has proteolytic activity but not lipolytic one.

Both <b>sterilized</b> and nonsterilized crab extract gave {{no significant difference in the}} quantity of coconut oil obtained. However, coconut oil from the <b>sterilized</b> crab extract has better quality.

25|$|The {{application}} of UVGI to disinfection {{has been an}} accepted practice since the mid-20th century. It has been used primarily in medical sanitation and sterile work facilities.

25|$|Based on {{a report}} by {{journalist}} Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, {{in a loss of}} the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity. In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient. In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to <b>sterilize</b> women in order to control the population. Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to <b>sterilize.</b> These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.|$|E
