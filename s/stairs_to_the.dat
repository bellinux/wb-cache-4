5|$|Since 2001, {{the tower}} has {{played host to}} an annual stair climb race up 53 flights of <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof.|$|E
5|$|The current {{concrete}} <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> keep are modern, and {{the original}} medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors. The basement contained a well, which could also {{be drawn from the}} 1st floor {{through a hole in the}} stone floor.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two {{going up to}} the northeastern corner of the intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one {{going up to the}} northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeastern corner of the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E

50|$|Internally, {{the first}} floor is not unusual. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vaults is not {{accessible}} in the present day. Some steps of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor are, however, {{to be seen in}} a cupboard in the north-east corner. The second floor was likely one room with plain stone corbels around the walls.|$|R
5|$|Either {{entrance}} can be {{the front}} entrance for this symmetric building under the elevated railway. The lobby {{on the ground floor}} greets visitors entering or exiting the building. Entering the ticketing gate, travelers can take the escalators or <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waiting areas on the second floor. Two waiting areas for passengers that lead to the northbound and southbound trains are connected by an air bridge. Two escalators and one stairway take passengers to the platforms. There are ten emergency exits around the platforms.|$|E
5|$|From 1944 to 1979, the {{configuration}} of Readville was static: the two-story depot served the lower level (Northeast Corridor) tracks, while the elevated track to Franklin and beyond was served by a small shack with <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower level. Starting in 1979, construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills. From November 3, 1979 until October 5, 1987, all Franklin Line and Providence/Stoughton Line service ran to Boston on the Midland Division via Readville.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police down the <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
50|$|Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former kitchen wing {{is through}} single half glass door with lead light over onto the {{northern}} verandah. This verandah leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former kitchen and a secondary <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first floor.|$|R
50|$|Teams had <b>to</b> climb <b>the</b> tower's <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> Pit Stop; {{they could}} not use elevators.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} six narrow {{terraces}} {{at the base}} was traversed by a monumental central <b>stair</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wide middle terrace. <b>The</b> divided <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uppermost terrace, with flights running on either side against <b>the</b> retaining wall <b>to</b> a landing and returning towards the center, was another innovation by Bramante. His long corridor-like wings that enclose the Cortile now house the Vatican Museums collections. One of the wings accommodated the Vatican Library. The wings have three storeys in the lower court and end in a single one enclosing the uppermost terrace.|$|R
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. The <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric piano in the lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
50|$|From Wickham Street is {{a second}} {{entrance}} lobby, and vestibule with tessellated tiles. The timber stair features substantial newels, twisted balusters, and boarding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underside. From the mid landing is <b>the</b> window opening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former chamber, and a doorway to a small room and <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exterior.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{entrance}} and exit points. The western exits are one <b>stair</b> each <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern and eastern corners of Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street and contains a 24-hour booth. The eastern exits are one <b>stair</b> each <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern and eastern corners of North 7th Street and Driggs Avenue.|$|R
5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking down the <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
5|$|First class mourners {{entered through}} the {{driveway}} under {{the office building}} which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The driveway ran past mortuaries and storerooms to the lifts and <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase led from the lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 an unexplained fire {{destroyed}} much of {{the interior}} of the house, which had been turned into a cemetery chapel. The local fire brigade managed to stop the fire reaching the wooden <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the tower. Prebendary F. E. Murphy, the rector of Walcot, established an appeal for funds of £300 for the restoration. By 1954 the stairs up the tower had become unsafe and a further appeal for public funds for the restoration was started. In 1970 the Church Commissioners declared the chapel redundant and plans drawn up by the new owners, Dr & Mrs Hilliard, to renovate the tower and create two flats. The Beckford Tower Trust and the museum were established in 1977.|$|E

50|$|The House is an L-plan tower, {{the stair}} tower being an addition. The {{entrance}} was originally {{on the first}} floor, being accessed by a removable wooden bridge from the parapet wall. There is a straight <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basement, which is vaulted. A late 16th-century two-storey hall range lies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east; it was altered in 1857.|$|R
5|$|Opposite the Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which bears an {{electronic}} scoreboard on its roof and can seat {{a maximum of}} 1,800 fans. Originally a home section, the Oak Road End {{was turned into a}} stand for away fans only {{at the start of the}} 1991–92 season. Early in the 2013–14 season, the Oak Road End was re-opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low, with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games. Later that season, it was announced that the stand was available for shared use between both home and away supporters, increasing Kenilworth Road's home capacity by 15%. The Oak Road End has an entrance that is often considered unusual, requiring spectators to go through an entrance built into the row of houses and up <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stand.|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of a tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E
5|$|The African art and Sackler {{buildings}} were built as twin pavilions, each one story above ground and with similar display space: five galleries each, {{and only one}} with natural light. They are differentiated by their roof adornments: domes on the African art building and pyramids on the Sackler. The African art pavilion was built in red granite and uses the circle shape as its architectural theme, with round windows, rounded entrance staircase, and six, round domes on its roof. Inside, a limestone foyer overlooks the gardens and a curving stair hall leads visitors down curving <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> galleries. The galleries are large and customized by exhibition designers into smaller rooms to better suit small objects. The buildings are visible from Independence Avenue, and the new Enid A. Haupt Garden runs {{between them and the}} Smithsonian Institution Building. Underground, the museum and offices occupy the first two levels, and a third level hosts exhibition and educational rooms. Its levels are connected by a three-story enclosed arcade with large skylights set into the gardens above, through several feet of dirt. The pavilion was renovated in the early 2000s with a major donation from Eastman Kodak.|$|E
50|$|The breezeway is {{interrupted}} by an early concrete storage space around which a timber <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower floor winds. The first floor has several elements of high quality timber joinery including architraves, window framing and skirtings. The lower floor is a more rudimentary space, with lower ceilings, very little decorative treatment and plain concrete dividing walls.|$|R
50|$|From 1982 {{the former}} Naval Offices {{was used as}} Muddies Seafood Restaurant, and {{alterations}} were made including removing walls between the ground floor offices, constructing a new stair in the ground floor hall, removing internal partitions in the rear timber extensions on both levels, a new kitchen fit-out on the first floor, and adding a fire escape <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear.|$|R
50|$|Because the East Sitting Hall is {{situated}} above the East Room (which has a 22-foot ceiling), access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Sitting Hall was originally by way a small set of stairs from the Stair Landing. During the Truman reconstruction, {{the room was}} reduced {{by the addition of}} a lavatory and side <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third floor; the steps were replaced with a ramp through an arched corridor.|$|R
25|$|The {{manor house}} {{is laid out}} symmetrically. It is 33 meters from {{the foot of the}} <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the tower, and 33 meters from the foot of the <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main gate portal.|$|E
25|$|Martinez, Crum, and Day {{searched the}} 27th floor, {{where they found}} M. J. Gabour; Day removed him. Martinez started up the <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{observation}} deck, and Crum insisted on covering him, asking Martinez to deputize him first.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, a pony truss bridge carried Landing Road over the Morris Canal (eastern span) and the DL {{mainline}} (western span). The steel, cable-stayed structure had two towers to support it, with <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station below. The structure also had two pony truss sidings.|$|E

50|$|Entry is {{from the}} {{northern}} side via a twin <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> a landing and a single <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> verandah, which is framed by an arched timber battened valance and brackets. The verandah has battened timber balustrade and timber brackets, and single skin tongue and groove walls with French doors and fanlights. The recessed entry door has art nouveau leadlight fanlight, side lights and central panel with the name BUDERIM HOUSE depicted. The eastern dining room also has leadlight panels. The northeastern verandah has been screened for insects.|$|R
50|$|The Dodge Lane {{elevation}} in red {{face brick}} houses banks of timber framed casement windows with fanlights to both storeys. A solid timber sliding door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} elevation provides entry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> showroom level and access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> timber <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper storey. A narrow rectangular fixed glass window is <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north side of this entrance. Lintels and sills are distinguished in rendered cement.|$|R
