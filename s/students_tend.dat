25|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} who arrive at the student union per minute will likely not follow a Poisson distribution, because the rate is not constant (low rate during class time, high rate between class times) and the arrivals of individual students are not independent (<b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to come in groups).|$|E
50|$|However, it {{is noted}} in several studies the {{difficulty}} in having students self-assess. One of the greatest difficulties is the accuracy of scores. Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling (1997) found that students often misjudged their assessments. Using a science class assessment project, they compared students' self-assessment scores {{with those of the}} teacher. They found that there was an overall disagreement between the markings of 86%, with 56% of students over-marking and 30% under-marking. They also noted a general trend of poor <b>students</b> <b>tending</b> to over-mark their work while the good <b>students</b> <b>tended</b> to under-mark their work.|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, more male {{students}} than fe{{male students}} enrolled in Biology, implying that more female <b>students</b> <b>tended</b> to achieve the course credits prior to high school or through CBE while in high school. In the early years, more female students than male <b>students</b> <b>tended</b> to enroll in Chemistry but the gap between two genders decreased. In Physics, there was no distinguishable gender gap in the enrollment in early years, but the gap became apparent in the subsequent years, with more female students than male students. More male {{students enrolled in}} Integrated Physics and Chemistry (IPC) than female students, and the gender gap was steady.|$|R
25|$|In {{continental}} Europe, <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> {{to shower}} communally after physical education classes, separated by gender.

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students. However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
25|$|Academic Row {{is known}} to be the central {{pedestrian}} concourse and maintenance vehicle highway in the campus that borders along a series of buildings. Beginning south at Administration Drive, the pathway is covered by mature trees on either side. Friendly squirrels are a common sight near the University Center where <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to feed them waffle fries from Chick-fil-A. Academic Row is bordered by the Administration Building, the Retriever Activities Center, Janet and Walter Sondheim Hall, Sherman Hall (Previously named Academic IV), University Center, Math and Psychology Building, Biological Sciences Building, and the Meyerhoff Chemistry Building. At the northern end, the walkway is intersected by Schwartz Breezeway leading to the Commons, the university's student union. Academic Row terminates at the Albin O.

2500|$|Jobs for chemists usually require {{at least}} a bachelor's degree, but many positions, {{especially}} those in research, require a [...] Master of Science or a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD.). Most undergraduate programs emphasize mathematics and physics as well as chemistry, partly because chemistry {{is also known as}} [...] "the central science", thus chemists ought to have a well-rounded knowledge about science. At the Master's level and higher, <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to specialize in a particular field. Fields of specialization include biochemistry, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, quantum chemistry, environmental chemistry, and thermochemistry.

2500|$|Shinya Takahashi, {{general manager}} of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development {{division}} (EPD), considered that the Switch's design addresses the cultural differences between Western and Japanese gamers, particularly students; while Japanese students generally spend more time together after school and where gaming is integral to that social time, Western <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to have busier schedules that limit this, making the portability features of the Switch capable of meeting both lifestyles. In some cases, games for the Switch are designed to encourage social interactions in groups, such as 1-2-Switch which requires players to look face-to-face {{rather than at the}} screen. Kimishima said that, as Nintendo is an entertainment company, they see games on the Switch that encourage enjoyable social interactions as supporting their ultimate goals. The [...] "Switch" [...] name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present [...] "the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way people experience entertainment in their daily lives".|$|E

30|$|While Tyson et al. (2007) {{showed that}} female <b>students</b> <b>tended</b> to take {{low-level}} mathematics courses, the Texas data revealed that female students took advanced mathematics courses, such as AP Calculus AB and AP Statistics, comparable to {{or more than}} male students across 6  years (Fig.  7). Along with the trends that more female <b>students</b> <b>tended</b> to achieve credits for Algebra I and Geometry prior to high school, which are required for high school graduation and prerequisite for advanced mathematics courses, AP Calculus BC was the only advanced mathematics course with lower enrollment rates of female students than male students. This is a positive trend {{because of the potential}} to reduce gender disparity in postsecondary STEM majors.|$|R
2500|$|Research {{has found}} {{that there is a}} high risk of {{educational}} underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are indeed many explanations for why <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to drop out of school. One is the conditions of which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an urban war zone is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even war-like conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior. Because of poverty, [...] "Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advent of}} social {{networking}} platforms {{may also be}} impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general. For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of {{the ease with which}} people of a certain age range—in particular those born before and after 1980—use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's [...] "Visitors" [...] and [...] "Residents" [...] (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), [...] "Social networking sites, like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policy makers." [...] Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website. Same survey found that 73% of online teenagers use SNS, which is an increase from 65% in 2008, 55% in 2006. Recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education, curriculum education, and learning. However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students have been known to negatively affect their academic life. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to invest {{a good deal of time}} in the use of such technologies.|$|E
2500|$|The New Brunswick Campus (or Rutgers–New Brunswick) is {{the oldest}} and largest campus of Rutgers; it {{is the site of}} the {{original}} Rutgers College. It is spread across six municipalities in Middlesex County, New Jersey, chiefly in the City of New Brunswick and adjacent Piscataway. It resides right along Route 18. It is composed of five smaller campuses, and a few buildings in downtown New Brunswick. The original and historic College Avenue Campus is adjacent to downtown New Brunswick, and includes the seat of the University, Old Queens and other nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century buildings that constitute the Queens Campus and Voorhees Mall. This campus is the main campus that many <b>students</b> <b>tend</b> to hang out on due to the proximity to New Brunswick's train station as well as its proximity to the numerous food options located downtown. In addition, the large amount of off-campus housing as well as fraternities and sororities sitting on this campus makes it the most active with groups of students flocking to this hot destination on Friday nights. On {{the other side of the}} city, Douglass Campus and Cook Campus are adjacent and intertwined with each other, and are often referred to collectively as the Cook/Douglass Campus. Cook Campus has extensive farms and woods that reach into North Brunswick and East Brunswick. Separated by the Raritan River are Busch Campus, in Piscataway, and Livingston Campus, also mainly in Piscataway but including remote sections of land extending into Edison and the Borough of Highland Park. The Busch Campus is noted to be the home for Rutgers' highly ranked Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, as well the other biological and engineering majors. On this campus is the golf course as well as the football stadium. The Livingston campus is home to Rutgers' Basketball team as well as many other sports teams at the RAC, a trapezoidal building which currently acts as home for most notably the Men's Basketball Team. Additionally, this campus has undergone many renovations to be regarded as the most [...] "modern" [...] campus. The entrance into this campus is well-stated by an all-glass business building known as the [...] "100 Rock". From this building's fifth floor lounge, one can see the Manhattan Skyline in the heart of New York City on many clear days. Surrounded by arguably the best dining hall, as well as top notch housing, Livingston intrigues many students who may want a quieter city-life experience than the one on College Avenue.The Rutgers Campus Buses transport students between the various campuses.|$|E
