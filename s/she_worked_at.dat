5|$|In 1921, Hu went to Luzhou in {{southern}} Sichuan, {{the base of}} the progressive warlord Yang Sen, where <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> the elementary school of South Sichuan Teachers College and studied at the college. She taught two of Yang's five wives (polygamy being legal at the time) to read and befriended another, but when Yang proposed to Hu, she angrily refused to become his sixth wife. When the influential writer Mao Dun heard about her story from a mutual friend, he wrote the novel Rainbow, which was published in 1929. The novel's heroine Mei, modelled after Hu Lanqi's life from 1920 to 1924, would become much better known in China than Hu herself.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{was born}} to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; {{her father was a}} mathematician, Max Noether. She {{originally}} planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.|$|E

5|$|Runnels was {{originally}} a make-up artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, {{where she worked}} on Larry King's make-up. On the weekends, she did makeup for the wrestlers of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). When the company was purchased by Ted Turner in 1988 and renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW), she moved to Atlanta and continued doing make-up {{for some of the}} wrestlers. Booker Ole Anderson eventually asked her {{to become part of the}} roster as a manager. Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who led an alliance known as the York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks. The York character was created over a lunch with Tony Schiavone, one of WCW's announcers. <b>She</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> WCW for two years.|$|E

It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
5|$|Born in Birkenhead, Jones {{first became}} {{involved}} in archaeology while studying at the University of Liverpool, where she volunteered on W. J. Varley's excavations. After graduating {{she worked as a}} wartime postal censor and freelance photojournalist, whilst continuing to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain. In 1956, Jones began working for the Ministry of Works as a freelance archaeologist in the burgeoning field of rescue archaeology. <b>She</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> a number of sites, but is best known for her excavations at Mucking, a major Anglo-Saxon settlement and associated cemetery, with finds ranging from the Stone Age to the Medieval period. The Mucking excavation, which Jones directed from 1965 to 1978, became Britain's largest ever archaeological excavation. It produced an unprecedented volume of material, although some academic archaeologists have criticised the fact that the results did not appear in print until decades after the excavation had ended. Jones' work at Mucking, as well as her role in founding the campaign group Rescue, was influential in the establishment of modern commercial archaeology in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{within two}} weeks of {{finishing}} her GCSE examinations, Winslet made her screen debut {{as one of the}} main cast members of the BBC science fiction television series Dark Season. Her part was that of Reet, a schoolgirl who helps her classmates fight against a sinister man distributing free computers to her school. She did not earn much from the job, and at age 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, <b>she</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> a delicatessen. In 1992, she had a small part in the television film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, an adaptation of Angus Wilson's satirical novel of the same name. Winslet, who weighed 185 pounds at the time, played the daughter of an obese woman in it. While filming, an off-hand comment from the director Diarmuid Lawrence about the likeness between her and the actress who played her mother prompted Winslet to lose weight. She next took {{on the role of the}} young daughter of a bankrupt middle-aged man (played by Ray Winstone) in the television sitcom Get Back (1992–93). She also had a guest role in a 1993 episode of the medical drama series Casualty.|$|E
