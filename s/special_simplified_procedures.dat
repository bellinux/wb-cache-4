To that end, Congress enacted section 833 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which provides DHS with special streamlined acquisition authorities. Before those authorities could be used, however, the Secretary of Homeland Security or a delegate would have to determine in writing that the DHS mission would be seriously impaired without the use of the authorities. The special streamlined acquisition authorities including the following three items. First, increasing the micro-purchase threshold from $ 2, 500 to $ 7, 500. Purchases below the micro-purchase threshold do not require competitive quotes or compliance with the "Buy America" act. Only certain employees would be authorized to make procurements under this authority. Second, increasing the limit on the use of simplified acquisition procedures from $ 100, 000 to $ 200, 000 for contracts awarded and performed within the United States, and to $ 300, 000 for contracts awarded and performed outside the United States. Simplified acquisition procedures permit agencies to use streamlined techniques to acquire good and services. Third, increasing from $ 5, 000, 000 to $ 7, 500, 000 the ceiling on the use of <b>special</b> <b>simplified</b> <b>procedures</b> to acquire property and services the Secretary deems to be "commercial items" under federal procurement laws. These authorities are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2007. Section 833 of the act directed us to report on the Department's use of these special streamlined acquisition authorities. Our objectives were to determine (1) the extent to which DHS has used the special authorities and (2) whether DHS sees a need to extend the authorities beyond September 2007. ...|$|E

The approach described in this paper is a <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure</b> of considerable interest. It requires only a small quantity of data and can be computed in a short time. The performance of this procedure was evaluated by a more complex sizing method based on detailed simulation. The <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure</b> {{was applied to the}} case of an individual dwelling using a solar collector field to produce domestic hot water and space heating. The building and the solar installation have then been modelled with the software TRNSYS 16 and their behaviour was simulated during a whole year.

40|$|Extensive and {{spectacular}} phenomena of soil liquefaction were observed during the Emilia seismic sequence that struck northern Italy on May-June 2012.

Multiple and close-in-time events were a peculiar {{aspect of the}} sequence but cannot be accounted for within the <b>simplified</b> <b>procedure.</b> This study investigates their possible role in excess pore pressure build-up and hence liquefaction triggering. Results of a numerical analysis suggest that aftershocks played a determinant role, leading liquefaction phenomena to such a great extent as observed in the field.

40|$|Compared {{with other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques, which {{are limited to}} the local investigation, the structural dynamic monitoring allows to obtain information about seismic response and vulnerability of structures, in their whole.

The possibility of applying the <b>simplified</b> <b>procedures</b> for the dynamic identification of the different historic structural typologies is, therefore, strategic to obtain useful information to apply the design criteria and the structural verifications in the seismic field.
