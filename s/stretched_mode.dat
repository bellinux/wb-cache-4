40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{spectra of}} sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (NaAOT), and NaAOT exchanged with alkali-metal (Li+, K+, Rb +, Cs-), Ba 2 + and Ce 3 + and tetraphenylarsonium (TPA+) cations have been investigated. The {{effect of the}} charge-to-radius ratio of the counterion on the symmetric and antisymmetric sulfonate <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> has been studied to obtain a more comprehensive assignment of these modes for NaAOT. The symmetric sulfonate <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> shifted to lower wavenumber with increasing counterion radius, due to {{a decrease in the}} interaction between the cation and the SO 3 - group. A difference was observed between the IR and Raman spectra for the wavenumber of the symmetric sulfonate <b>stretching</b> <b>mode,</b> which was attributed to correlation coupling. This difference also decreased with increasing counterion radius. In the limiting case involving the large (TPA+) counterion, the symmetric sulfonate <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> appeared at the same wavenumber in the Raman and IR spectra. The spectrum of a model compound, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) succinate (i. e. NaAOT without the sulfonate moiety), was used to assign bands in the 1300 - 1100 cm- 1 region of the IR spectrum of NaAOT. This region consists of C-C and C-O <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> associated with the succinate backbone, and non-degenerate, antisymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> of the SO 3 - group. The correlation splitting yields four antisymmetric sulfonate <b>stretching</b> <b>modes.</b> The splitting decreases with increasing counterion radius, due to a reduction in the interaction between the cation and the SO 3 - group. The doubly degenerate, antisymmetric sulfonate <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> appeared as a single, broad band in the spectrum of (TPA) AOT. The carbonyl <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> of NaAOT appears as an asymmetric band between 1720 and 1740 cm- 1. This asymmetry was attributed to different conformations about the acyl C-C bond. Weak interactions between the Na+ counterion and the carbonyl group may also contribute to the intensity of the lower-wavenumber band...|$|R

VSFG spectra revealed symmetric and asymmetric C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> {{in addition to a}} Fermi resonance mode resulting from the interaction of the asymmetric C–H bending overtone with the symmetric C–H stretching vibration. The polarization dependence of the C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> was consistent with the propynyl groups oriented such that the Si–C≡C bond is normal to the Si(111) surface. The azimuthal angle dependence of the resonant C–H stretching amplitude revealed no rotational anisotropy for the symmetric C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> and a 3 -fold rotational anisotropy for the asymmetric C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> in registry with the 3 -fold symmetric Si(111) substrate. The results are consistent with expectation that the C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> of a –CH_ 3 group are decoupled from the Si substrate due to a –C≡C– spacer. In contrast, the methyl-terminated Si(111) surface, Si–CH_ 3, was previously reported to have pronounced vibronic coupling of the methyl <b>stretch</b> <b>modes</b> to the electronic bath of bulk Si. Vacuum-annealing of propynyl-terminated Si(111) resulted in increased 3 -fold azimuthal anisotropy for the symmetric stretch, suggesting that removal of propynyl groups from the surface upon annealing allowed the remaining propynyl groups to tilt away from the surface normal, into one of three preferred directions towards the vacated neighbor sites...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} structure and hydrogen bonding of water molecules at the CCl 4 /water interface {{in the presence}} of a charged soluble surfactant has been explored in this study using vibrational sum frequency generation. By examining OH <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> that are highly sensitive to the local hydrogen bonding environment it is found that water molecules at the CCl 4 /water interface both in the presence and absence of a charged soluble surfactant are predominantly in a tetrahedral arrangement much like the structure ofice. Isotopic dilution studies have been employed to further characterize this icelike interfacial structure. Ablueshift ofapproximately 120 cm- 1 of the icelike OH <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> is observed upon dilution with D 2 O. The first vibrational spectra of the OH <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> from uncoupled HOD molecules at the CCl 4 /water interface is also reported...|$|R
40|$|The mixed anion mineral parnauite Cu 9 [(OH) 10 |SO 4 |(AsO 4) 2]. 7 H 2 O {{has been}} studied by Raman spectroscopy. Characteristic bands {{associated}} with arsenate, sulphate, hydroxyl units are identified. Broad bands are observed and are resolved into component bands. Two intense bands at 859 and 830 cm- 1 are assigned to the  1 (AsO 4) 3 - symmetric stretching and  3 (AsO 4) 3 - antisymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>modes.</b> The comparatively sharp band at 976 cm- 1 is assigned to the ν 1 (SO 4) 2 - symmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> and a broad spectral profile centered upon 1097 cm- 1 is attributed to the ν 3 (SO 4) 2 - antisymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>mode.</b> A comparison of the Raman spectra is made with other arsenate bearing minerals such as carminite, clinotyrolite, kankite, tilasite and pharmacosiderite. ...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafast {{dynamics}} of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) {{has been extensively}} studied experimentally and theoretically. However, there are several contradictory results reported, indicating that its detailed dynamics and initial process {{have not yet been}} fully clarified. In this work, changes in the amplitude and phase of molecular vibration in the isomerization process of bR were real-time probed simultaneously at 128 different wavelengths through intensity modulation of the electronic transition. Systematic information on the transient change in continuous spectrum extending from 505 nm (2. 45 eV) to 675 nm (1. 84 eV) showed different dynamics in each spectral region reflecting the difference in the excited states and intermediates dominating the dynamics during the photoisomerization. Careful analysis of the transient spectral changes and spectrograms calculated from the vibrational real-time traces elucidated that the primary event just after photoexcitation is the deformation of the retinal configuration, which decays within 30 fs near the C=N bond in the protonated Schiff base. The intensity of C=N <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> starts to decrease before the initiation of the frequency modulation of the C=C <b>stretching</b> <b>mode.</b> The C=C <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> frequency was modulated by a coupled torsion around the C 13 =C 14 bond, leading to the photoisomerization around the bond. This study clarified the {{dynamics of}} the C=N and C=C <b>stretching</b> <b>modes</b> working as key vibration modes in the photoisomerization of bR. Furthermore, we have elucidated the modulation and decay dynamics of the C=C <b>stretching</b> <b>mode</b> in the photoreaction starting from H (Franck-Condon excited state) followed by I (twisted excited), and J (first intermediate) states...|$|R
