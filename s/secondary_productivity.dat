40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nitrogen}} replenishment on the kinetics of secondary carotenoids, triacylglycerol (TAG) and primary cell components was studied in nitrogen-starved Chromochloris zofingiensis (Chlorophyta), an oleaginous and carotenogenic microalga. Nitrogen resupplied {{after a period}} of starvation was initially consumed at a more than four times higher rate than in an equivalent nitrogen-replete culture. Simultaneously, chlorophylls, primary carotenoids, polar (membrane) lipids and proteins were rapidly produced. After 2 days, the contents of these primary metabolites, as well as the nitrogen consumption rate and the overall biomass production rate, had returned to values equivalent to those of cells grown under nitrogen-replete conditions, indicating that culture recovery required 2 days. Nitrogen resupply was immediately followed by rapid degradation of TAG and starch, suggesting that these metabolites served as carbon and energy source for the recovery process. Also, the secondary carotenoids canthaxanthin and ketolutein were rapidly degraded upon nitrogen resupply, whereas degradation of astaxanthin, the main secondary carotenoid, started only when the cells were fully recovered 2 days after nitrogen resupply. This {{is the first time that}} such culture recovery has been described in detail and, moreover, that astaxanthin was found to be not immediately degraded after nitrogen resupply. The observed rapid recovery of C. zofingiensis and the delay in astaxanthin degradation suggest that a repeated batch cultivation may result in a higher <b>secondary</b> carotenoid <b>productivity</b> than a series of classical single batch cultivations...|$|R

Meals were very similar among species (mean Least–Crested Auklet overlap C = 0. 68; Least–Whiskered Auklet overlap C = 0. 96) and among sites, indicating limited partitioning of prey resources for auklets feeding chicks. The biomass of copepods and euphausiids in Least and Crested Auklet food loads was related negatively to the summer (June–July–August) North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, while in Whiskered Auklet food loads, this was negatively related to the winter (December–January–February) Pacific Decadal Oscillation, both of which track basin-wide sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies. We found a significant quadratic relationship between the biomass of calanoid copepods in Least Auklet food loads at all three study sites and summer (June–July) SST, with maximal copepod biomass between 3 – 6 °C (r 2 = 0. 71). Outside this temperature range, zooplankton becomes less available to auklets through delayed development. Overall, our results suggest that auklets are able to buffer climate-mediated bottom-up forcing of demographic parameters like productivity, as the composition of chick meals has remained constant over the course of our study...|$|R

50|$|The Gulf of Paria is a {{brackish}} water body - wet season salinities are below 23 ppt (parts per thousand) with extensive mangroves along the Venezuelan and Trinidadian coastlines.

Location: Miombo woodland in northwest Zimbabwe. Methods: Macrotermitinae termitaria vary {{in size and}} soil nutrient concentrations, harbouring distinct woody plant assemblages, making them foci for plant and animal diversity, and also influencing primary, <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>productivity.</b> In spite {{of the importance of}} termitaria to heterogeneity and diversity, no studies have investigated changes in plant species assemblages as mound surface area increases to the point where mound vegetation is distinct from that of the matrix. We compared woody plant assemblages on 43 matrix plots with 95 Macrotermes termitaria across a range of surface areas, using ANOSIM, cluster analysis and MDS ordination. We compared soil nutrients, pH and clay, from ten large and ten small termitaria, and ten matrix sites. We also assessed how relative representation of large mound or matrix indicator species changed with mound area. Results: Change was apparent even at mound sizes of > 10 m 2, where both soils and plant assemblages on mounds were significantly different to those of the matrix. Plant assemblages fell into two main groups at 20...|$|R
