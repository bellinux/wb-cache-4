Michael then wakes up, and blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, the two notice a shark is encircling them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is {{not considered to be}} true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> addition to the mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|During {{the two-week}} hiatus between games four and five, the Canadians visited Sweden and played two {{exhibition}} games versus the Swedish national team. The Team Canada management {{had arranged for}} the visit to Sweden {{to get used to}} the bigger ice <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> Europe, and stopping in Sweden would provide some rest for Team Canada before resuming the series in Moscow. The games took place on September 16 and September 17 at the Johanneshovs Isstadion arena in Stockholm. Canada won game one 4–1; the second game was a 4–4 tie. The first exhibition game introduced Canada to the two West German referees, Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader. These two referees would figure prominently in games six and eight of the Canada-Russia series.|$|E
5|$|For <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> higher dimensions, {{there is}} more than one {{definition}} of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E

5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles {{did not yet}} exist however, and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed {{the idea of a}} caterpillar track for snow <b>surfaces.</b> <b>In</b> the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him {{all the way to the}} Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E

5|$|Subdivision <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> {{computer}} graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E
5|$|The animators also {{employed}} subsurface scattering—developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull {{during his}} graduate student {{days at the}} University of Utah in the 1970s—to render <b>surfaces</b> <b>in</b> a more lifelike way.

Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release.|$|E
