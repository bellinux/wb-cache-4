60|$|The fact is, if we {{had ever}} had any {{experience}} in London life {{we should not have}} made three engagements in one day. To my simple eye it is quite amusing to see how they manage the <b>social</b> <b>machine</b> here. People are under such a pressure of engagements, that they go about with their lists in their pockets. If A wants to invite B to dinner, out come their respective lists. A says he has only Tuesday and Thursday open for this week. B looks down his list, and says that the days are all closed. A looks along, and says that he has no day open till next Wednesday week. B, however, is going to leave town Tuesday; so that settles the matter as to dining; so they turn back again, and try the breakfasting; for though you cannot dine in but one place a day, yet, by means of the breakfast and the lunch, you can make three social visits if you are strong enough.|$|E

I saw the wheels of the <b>social</b> <b>machine</b> go around, and I learned that the dignity of manual labour wasn't what I had been told it was by the teachers, preachers, and politicians. The men without trades were helpless cattle. If one learned a trade, he was compelled to belong to a union in order to work at his trade. And his union was compelled to bully and slug the employers' unions in order to hold up wages or hold down hours. The employers' unions like-wise bullied and slugged. I couldn't see any dignity at all. And when a workman got old, or had an accident, he was thrown into the scrap-heap like any worn-out machine. I saw too many of this sort who were making anything but dignified ends of life.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>machines</b> are {{integrated}} systems {{of people and}} computers. What distinguishes <b>social</b> <b>machines</b> from other types of software systems- such as software for cars or air planes- is the unprecedented involvement of data about user behavior,-goals and-motivations into the software system’s structure. In <b>social</b> <b>machines,</b> the interaction between a user and the system is mediated by the aggregation of explicit or implicit data from other users. This {{is the case with}} systems where, for example, user data is used to suggest search terms (e. g. Google Autosuggest), to recommend products (e. g. Amazon recommendations), to aid navigation (e. g. tag-based navigation) or to filter content (e. g. Digg. com). This makes <b>social</b> <b>machines</b> a novel class of software systems (as opposed to for example safety-related software that is being used in cars) and unique in a sense that potentially essential system properties and functions- such as navigability- are dynamically influenced by aggregate user behavior...|$|R
60|$|His kingdom {{was little}} more than the black {{mountain}} after which it was named: we commonly refer to it under its Italian translation of Montenegro. It is worth while to pause for a moment upon his picturesque and peculiar community, because it is perhaps the simplest working model of all that stood {{in the path of the}} great Germanic <b>social</b> <b>machine</b> I have described in the last chapter--stood in its path and was soon to be very nearly destroyed by its onset. It was a branch of the Serbian stock which had climbed into this almost inaccessible eyrie, and thence, for many hundred years, had mocked at the predatory empire of the Turks. The Serbians in their turn were but one branch of the peasant Slavs, millions of whom are spread over Russia and subject on many sides to empires with which they have less sympathy; and the Slavs again, in the broad features which are important here, are not merely Slavonic but simply European. But a particular picture is generally more pointed and intelligible than tendencies which elsewhere are mingled with subtler tendencies; and of this unmixed European simplicity Montenegro is an excellent model.|$|E
60|$|No one worth {{calling a}} man allows his moods {{to change his}} convictions; but it is by moods that we {{understand}} other men's convictions.

At that moment I felt vividly how men might go wrong, even unto dynamite. If one of those huddled men under the trees had stood up and asked for rivers of blood, it would have been erroneous--but not irrelevant. It would have been appropriate and in the picture; that lurid grey picture of insolence on one side and impotence on the other. It may be true (on the whole it is) that this <b>social</b> <b>machine</b> we have made is better than anarchy. Still, it is a machine; and we have made it.

6000|$|The {{season was}} said to begin very late, and it {{was said to}} be a very [...] "bad" [...] season, {{throughout}} May, when the charges of those who live by it ordinarily feel an expansive rise; when rooms at hotels become difficult, become impossible; when the rents of apartments double themselves, and apartments are often not to be had at any price; when the face of the cabman clouds if you say you want him by the hour, and clears if you add that you will make it all right with him; when every form of service begins to have the courage of its dependence; and the manifold fees which ease the <b>social</b> <b>machine</b> seem to lubricate it so much less than the same fees in April; when the whole vast body of London groans with a sense of repletion such as no American city knows except in the rare congestion produced by a universal exposition or a national convention. Such a congestion is of annual occurrence in London, and is the symptomatic expression of the season; but the symptoms ordinarily recognizable in May were absent until June in the actual year. They were said to have been suppressed by the reluctance of the tardy spring, and again by the king's visit to Ireland. As the king is the fountain of social prosperity it is probable that he {{had more to do with}} delaying the season than the weather had; but by what one hears said of him he would not have willingly delayed it. He is not only a well-meaning and well-doing prince, one hears from people of every opinion, but a promoter of peace and international concord (especially with France, where his good offices are believed to have been peculiarly effective), and he is, rather more expectedly, a cheerful sovereign, loving the gayety as well as the splendor of state, and fond of seeing the world enjoy itself.|$|E

5000|$|Abbey’s {{impression}} {{is that we are}} trapped by the machinations of mainstream culture. This is made apparent with quotes such as: “Yet history demonstrates that personal liberty is a rare and precious thing, that all societies tend toward the absolute until attack from without or collapse from within breaks up the <b>social</b> <b>machine</b> and makes freedom and innovation again possible." [...] He also believes the daily routine is meaningless, that we have created a life that we do not even want to live in:My God! I am thinking, what incredible shit we put up with most of our lives - the domestic routine (same old wife every night), the stupid and useless degrading jobs, the insufferable arrogance of elected officials, the crafty cheating and the slimy advertising of the business men, the tedious wars in which we kill our buddies instead of our real enemies back in the capital, the foul diseased and hideous cities and towns we live in, the constant petty tyranny of automatic washers and automobiles and TV machines and telephone!Abbey displays disdain for the way industrialization is impacting the American wilderness. He scolds humanity for the environmental duress caused by man’s blatant disregard for nature: “If industrial man, continues to multiply his numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural, and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making”. Man prioritizes material items over nature, development and expansion for the sake of development: There may be some among the readers of this book, like the earnest engineer, who believe without question that any and all forms of construction and development are intrinsic goods, in the national parks as well as anywhere else, who virtually identify quantity with quality and therefore assume that the greater the quantity of traffic, the higher the value received. There are some who frankly and boldly advocate the eradication of the last remnants of wilderness and the complete subjugation of nature to the requirements of--not man--but industry. This is a courageous view, admirable in its simplicity and power, and with the weight of all modern history behind it. It is also quite insane. I cannot attempt to deal with it here. Another example of this for Abbey is the tragedy of the commons: “A civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild, the spare, the original, is cutting itself off from its origins and betraying the principle of civilization itself. If industrial man continues to multiply its numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making. He will make himself an exile from the earth”. He also criticizes what he sees as the dominant social paradigm, what he calls the expansionist view, and the belief that technology will solve all our problems: “Confusing life expectancy with life-span, the gullible begin to believe that medical science has accomplished a miracle—lengthened human life!” Abbey takes this theme to an extreme at various points of the narrative, concluding that: “Wilderness preservations like a hundred other good causes will be forgotten under the overwhelming pressure, or a struggle for mere survival and sanity in a completely urbanized completely industrialized, ever more crowded environment, for my own part I would rather take my chances in a thermonuclear war then live in such a world”.|$|E
40|$|Although Social Machines do {{not have}} yet a formalized definition, some efforts {{have been made to}} {{characterize}} them from a “machinery” point of view. In this paper, we present a methodology by which we attempt to reveal the sociality of Social Machines; to do so, we adopt the analogy of stories. By assimilating a <b>Social</b> <b>Machine</b> to a story, we can identify the stories within and about that machine and how this storytelling perspective might reveal the sociality of Social Machines. After illustrating this storytelling approach with a few examples, we then propose three axes of inquiry to evaluate the health of a social machine: (1) assessment of the sociality of a <b>Social</b> <b>Machine</b> through evaluation of its storytelling potential and realization; (2) assessment of the sustainability of a <b>Social</b> <b>Machine</b> through evaluation of its reactivity and interactivity; and (3) assessment of emergence through evaluation of the collaboration between authors and of the distributed/mixed nature of authority.
