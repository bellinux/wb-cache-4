40|$|As the {{development}} of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), software testing for WSN-based applications be-comes more and more important. <b>Simulation</b> <b>testing</b> is an important approach to WSN-based software testing, and TOSSIM is {{the most widely used}} <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> tool targeted at TinyOS which is the most popular operating system nowadays. However, <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> tools such as TOSSIM can not reveal program er-rors about communication detail or timing, and lack accurate power consumption model and even can not support power consumption estimation. In this paper, a hybrid testbed H-TOSSIM is proposed, which ex-tends TOSSIM with physical nodes. H-TOSSIM uses three physical nodes, of which, one shares the simu-lated environment with all virtual nodes to test the WSN program, and the other two bridge the real world and the simulated environment. H-TOSSIM combines the advantages of both the simulation in physical node and the <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> tools in WSN software testing. Through experiments, we show that H-TOSSIM really reveals program errors which the pure <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> can not capture, and can support power con-sumption estimation for large WSN with high accuracy and low hardware cost...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the current {{research}} is to developments a real-time Hardware In-the-Loop (HIL) <b>simulation</b> <b>testbed</b> for the satellite formation flying navigation and orbit control. The HIL <b>simulation</b> <b>testbed</b> is integrated for demonstrations and evaluations of navigation and orbit control algorithms. The HIL <b>simulation</b> <b>testbed</b> is composed of Environment computer, GPS simulator, Flight computer and Visualization computer system. GPS measurements are generated by a SPIRENT GSS 6560 multi-channel RF simulator to produce pseudorange, carrier phase measurements. The measurement date are transferred to Satrec Intiative space borne GPS receiver and exchanged by the flight computer system and subsequently processed in a navigation filter to generate relative or absolute state estimates.
