50|$|This {{design is}} based on the Maksutov-Cassegrain. It {{provides}} correction of aberrations via a two-element meniscus-shaped corrector lens in front of the secondary mirror. This design was originally envisaged by G. I. Popov with a practical implementation by Yu. A. Klevtsov. It is produced with apertures of 8, 10.25 and 13 inches. The 8-inch model employs a refractor <b>style</b> <b>rack</b> and pinion focuser, while in the larger designs the primary mirror is moved as in most other small to medium-sized Cassegrain designs.|$|E
50|$|The rack may {{range in}} speed from 8 {{miles an hour}} in {{pleasure}} or <b>style</b> <b>racking,</b> up to as fast as 30 mph in speed racking. It {{is similar to the}} running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse, but with more collection, and without a head nod. Most Racking Horses have two distinct speeds within the rack.|$|R
50|$|Bicycles {{may have}} eyelets, tapped with a {{standard}} thread, at the dropouts on the rear chainstays, and on the front fork blades. Mounting a bike rack is possible without these eyelets, but requires additional hardware. A <b>style</b> of <b>rack</b> clamps only to the seatpost, does not require eyelets or additional hardware, but has a limited capacity.|$|R
50|$|Bamboo {{construction}} style, although historically {{rooted in}} pieces made from bamboo, later saw many pieces made from hardwood with patterning {{to imitate the}} look of bamboo, or simply {{in the style of}} previous pieces made from bamboo. The construction is more similar to the Yoke and <b>Rack</b> <b>style</b> with some apparent crossover.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the III phono stage, the form factor moved from no {{faceplate}} to a small 8.5" [...] <b>rack</b> <b>style</b> faceplate enabling owners to combine the two chassis into one unit, thus forming the first PS Audio preamplifier with phono input. This series marked {{the end of the first}} era of modular chassis approach to preamplification.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bicycle parking}} rack, usually {{shortened}} to bike rack and also called a bicycle stand, is {{a device to}} which bicycles can be securely attached for parking purposes. A bike rack may be free standing {{or it may be}} securely attached to the ground or some stationary object such as a building. Indoor bike racks are commonly used for private bicycle parking, while outdoor bike racks are often used in commercial areas. General <b>styles</b> of <b>racks</b> include the Inverted U, Serpentine, Bollard, Grid, and Decorative. [...] The most effective and secure bike racks are those that can secure both wheels and the frame of the bicycle, using a bicycle lock.|$|R
50|$|Ground effect {{had been}} banned {{at the end}} of 1982, and so the car was built around a flat {{bottomed}} arrangement. It featured enlarged wings to try to claw back as much of the lost downforce as possible. Ren√© Arnoux had left the team to be replaced by Eddie Cheever, whilst Alain Prost was now undisputed no.1 driver. The RE40 was designed around his driving <b>style,</b> and he <b>racked</b> up many miles of testing to avoid the unreliability of the previous two seasons.|$|R
50|$|In a theatre, a {{specialty}} panel {{known as a}} dimmer rack is used to feed stage lighting instruments. A U.S. <b>style</b> dimmer <b>rack</b> has a 208Y/120 volt 3-phase feed. Instead of just circuit breakers, the rack has a solid state electronic dimmer with its own circuit breaker for each stage circuit. This {{is known as a}} dimmer-per-circuit arrangement. The dimmers are equally divided across the three incoming phases. In a 96 dimmer rack, there are 32 dimmers on phase A, 32 dimmers on phase B, and 32 on phase C to spread out the lighting load as equally as possible. In addition to the power feed from the supply transformer in the building, a control cable from the lighting desk carries information to the dimmers in a control protocol such as DMX-512. The information includes lighting level information for each channel, by which it controls which dimmer circuits come up and go out during the lighting changes of the show (light cues), and over what fade time.|$|R
50|$|The primary anti-ship {{armament}} was {{two to four}} Mark 8 torpedoes, which weighed 2600 lb {{and contained}} a 466 lb TNT warhead. These torpedoes were launched by Mark 18 21 in steel torpedo tubes. Mark 8 torpedoes had a range of 16000 yd at 36 knots mph. These torpedoes and tubes were replaced in mid-1943 by four lightweight 22.5 in Mark 13 torpedoes, which weighed 2216 lb and contained a 600 lb Torpex-filled warhead. These torpedoes were carried on lightweight Mark 1 roll-off <b>style</b> torpedo launching <b>racks.</b> The Mk13 torpedo had a range of 6300 yd and a speed of 33.5 knots mph.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of {{the current}} pier {{commenced}} in 1887, and the plans included provision for an electric railway. Construction of the line commenced in 1888, with electrification being carried out by Colonel R. E. B. Crompton. By 1890, 0.75 mi of [...] gauge single track had been laid, and a single toast <b>rack</b> <b>style</b> car was in use. By the following year the line ran the then full pier length of 1.25 mi and trailer cars were in use. The system expanded, until eventually, by 1930, four trains, each made up of seven cars, were running on a line that was double track throughout.|$|R
5000|$|Pallet racking {{is often}} {{bought and sold}} {{multiple}} times. Every time the pallet rack is tore down, installed and moved around, the engineered pallet rack safety clips {{that came with the}} system are lost, damaged or no longer working. Due the difficulty of identifying pallet rack those safety clips can be hard to find when searching for the manufacturer who provides them. The pallet rack safety bolt has a universal design made specifically to work with several <b>styles</b> of pallet <b>rack</b> systems including: SpaceRak, Interlake, Ridg-U-Rak Teardrop, USP, Excel Storage Products, Bulldog, Hannibal, Steel King, Wireway, and many others. The key indicator to see if the universal pallet rack pin will work with used rack systems is finding the 2 [...]30" [...] holes that align in the pallet rack cross beam and upright frame.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the static and dynamic stability analysis of rack or frame computer/server products during shipping and relocation. The static stability {{is the ability}} of server products to resist tipping over on a typical raised floor in a datacenter or when it is installed in its operational product environment. The dynamic stability is the ability to resist tipping over when a velocity change occurs during re-location either on flat or inclined planes. The product consists of a frame or a rack in which components such as processor units, input-output units and power supplies are installed. The static stability analysis presented here calculates the tip over threshold angle, which is the maximum angle of an inclined plane on which the product can be placed without tipping over. The location of the installed components in a frame, the dimension and weight of the installed components, and the dimension of the product dictate the overall static stability of the product. Specifically, those parameters affect the location of the center of gravity of the product and the tip over threshold angle. The tip over threshold angle is a critical parameter influencing the dynamic stability of the product [...] The dynamic stability of an unpackaged product moving on casters can be calculated using the conservation of mechanical energy principle. Finite element modeling {{is a good way to}} evaluate the dynamic stability of a product during manual handling or mechanical handling; for instance, on a forklift. The objective of the finite element modeling is to provide guidelines on the maximum speed, minimum radius curvature, and safe turning speed of a forklift when transporting a product. The main objective of the analysis presented here is to provide a method for analyzing the static and dynamic stability of a <b>rack</b> <b>style</b> computer server product during shipping, relocation, and handling...|$|R
