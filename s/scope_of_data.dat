To ensure a complete identification of data sources, data mapping techniques are often employed. Since the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> can be overwhelming in this phase, attempts are made to reduce the overall scope during this phase - such as limiting the identification of documents to a certain date range or search term(s) to avoid an overly burdensome request.|$|E
50|$|The {{new bill}} proposes that the {{obligation}} imposed on ISP providers to retain data about their clients online activities is vastly expanded.

The UK Internet Services Providers' Association (ISPA) have issued a statement raising concerns about {{the impact on the}} competitiveness of UK CSPs as it creates a less attractive and more onerous environment in which companies have to work.

5000|$|When {{considering}} {{the potential for}} privacy law breaches, particularly within the smart cities context containing a vast <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> that is available to the Government, data may often need to be de-identified to maintain privacy. Whilst this may {{make it difficult to}} reconcile data collected from multiple services, it could still allow for the useful collection and aggregation of data for defined purposes. The E-CAF system (Common Assessment Framework), where a database of all children assessed by government services (including police, social services and schools) is maintained by the UK Government, highlights how anonymity is fading due to data-driven technologies. The system allows authorities to predict which children will commit crime in the future and allow them to intervene, based on a number of risk factors and profiling. It is evident that citizens captured by the database as children will no longer be [...] "anonymous" [...] members of society. Given the potential Government presumption that parties unwilling to share their information are inherently suspicious, the difficulty of maintaining anonymity in modern smart cities is clearly quite high.|$|E
5000|$|Targowski {{found some}} {{difficulties}} in designing information systems {{for business and}} administration {{who did not know}} the meaning of information. The quantitative theory of information (formulated by Hartley and Shannon) defines information as I = -Log2 p(α). In business activities, if someone on Tuesday says that tomorrow is Wednesday, p=1 and then I=0. However, on Wednesday there may be a discount at a given store, what is very meaningful for an information user. He thinks that the traditional theory of information mostly deals with its syntax in a general sense, answering the question: how to process information?. Therefore, he developed the approach based upon its semantics, which means answering the question what information to process? He invented the concept of the Semantic Ladder, composed of the following units of cognition, organized as steps (levels); 1-DATA (measurement), 2-INFORMATION (change), 3-CONCEPT (direction), 4-KNOWLEDGE (principles, rules, laws), 5-WISDOM (judgment & choice). First time he published this DICKW model in his book The Architecture and Planning of Enterprise-wide Information Management Systems (1990:136), consequently he began to improving its graphic model in his following books (2003:115, 2009:223, 2011:27). In his book (2009) he defined several perspectives and images of information. This approach defines the differentiated frameworks of IS design in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> processing, information processing, concept processing, knowledge processing, and wisdom processing. He also differentiated approaches to information's conceptualization {{at the level of the}} macro-information ecology. It allowed him to define four universal laws of information: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} years saw {{significant}} advances {{in the field of}} interlanguage pragmatics development since several researchers' call for more studies focusing on the development of pragmatic competence of second or foreign language learners. The existing literature, however, still leaves us an incomplete picture {{of the nature of the}} relation between pragmalinguistic competence and sociopragmatic competence in the development of L 2 learners' pragmatic competence, as the research findings suggest two conflicting patterns: pragmalinguistic competence precedes sociopragmatic competence and vice versa (Rose, 2000). A review of the preceding research demonstrates contradictory views on the relation between sociopragmatic competence and pragmalinguistic competence in the development of L 2 pragmatic competence and suggests the need to expand the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> analysis in future studies. The present study attempts to shed light on how these two aspects of pragmatic competence are related by collecting both perception and production data and extending the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> analysis to analyze the difference in the use of strategy, content and form across situations involving a teacher and a classmate.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{critically}} assess {{two related}} questions; the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>data</b> protection law {{pursuant to the}} new General Data Protection Regulation, and the one-stop-shop mechanism in the Regulation. The {{first part of the}} thesis is a comparison of Article 4 in the Data Protection Directive and Article 3 <b>of</b> the General <b>Data</b> Protection Regulation. The conclusion on this point is that the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>data</b> protection law has broadened. We have gone from a scope linked to territory, to a scope that also covers undertakings with no establishment, equipment or means for processing on the territory of the Union. This unequivocally severs the link between the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>data</b> protection law and the territory of the Union. The second part of the thesis is an assessment of the new one-stop-shop mechanism in the Regulation. I evaluate whether or not the one-stop-shop mechanism adopted in the Regulation is likely to fulfil the promises of the EU legislature, and reduce administrative burdens, facilitate more efficient cross border flows <b>of</b> personal <b>data</b> and increase legal certainty for controllers, processors and supervisory authorities. My main conclusion for this part of the thesis is that the Regulation fails {{to live up to the}} promises made by the legislature by introducing too many and varied exceptions to the one-stop-shop mechanism. The various exceptions influence both data subjects, supervisory authorities, controllers and processors. In sum, there are grounds for doubting whether the one-stop-shop mechanism succeeds in drastically cutting red tape and doing away with the formalities plaguing the current system. For some controllers and processors covered by the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>data</b> protection law – particularly those without an establishment in the Union – the mechanism may lead to less legal certainty and in fact increase the administrative burden. Considering that the Council considered the one-stop-shop mechanism to be one of two central pillars of the proposal, these are important concerns...|$|R
