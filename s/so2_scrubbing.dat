40|$|Platinum group {{elements}} (PGEs) {{are increasingly}} being used {{in a variety of}} environmentally-related technologies such as catalysts and catalytic converters which have strong expected growth to meet environmental and technological challenges this century. The platinum industry is actively seeking to progress its commitment to sustainability principles by reducing the negative impacts of their mining and mineral processing operations. Technical innovation to improve future plant designs, as well as the development of management policies, guidelines and protocols for efficient operation of process plants has therefore become a strategic priority for the South African platinum industry. The industry has also made an effort to understand the environmental impacts of its products from mine to metal, using life cycle methods. However, very limited research has been done to investigate what environmental value could be created if strategic and design decisions in minerals processing were life cycle based, particularly in the context of PGMs. Seminal work by Stewart (1999) investigating the environmental life cycle consideration for design-related decision making in the minerals industry has not led to significant adoption. Forbes et al. (2000) analysed metal processing using LCA and were able to identify opportunities for improved environmental performance. They however did not explore how it would be incorporated into the decision making cycle. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to determine whether life cycle assessment could help inform design decision making in the minerals industry. In the years 2002 - 2008 several PGM-producing companies commissioned new <b>SO₂</b> <b>scrubbing</b> technologies to meet the regulations that had been set to prevent the release of excessive amounts of sulphur dioxide from smelters in the Rustenburg area, a mining town located in the North West Province of South Africa. Using these cleanup process retrofits as case studies, this dissertation aims to determine whether the introduction of LCA as an environmental analysis tool would have provided additional value to the decision makers. The case study approach that was chosen compared and assessed the performance of SO₂ abatement technologies and the effect of efficiencies chosen on environmental performance by using life cycle assessment modelling. By doing the life cycle assessment on the different options that the companies had, it was possible to evaluate the indirect environmental impacts that could have been overlooked during the design decision making process. In addition, experts {{who were involved in the}} design processes of the SO₂ abatement retrofits were interviewed to establish: i) how the design decisions were made and ii) whether the life cycle based insights into technology performance would have been of use in the design work. The goal of the life cycle assessment was to identify whether there were design decisions that induced environmental burden shifting when platinum smelters in the Rustenburg area added SO₂ abatement technologies to their processes, which could have been avoided had the LCA perspective been taken into account. The assessments considered two key variables, namely extent of recovery and technology choice...|$|E

5000|$|An {{evaluation}} of the potential negative impact of releasing large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere, which, when combined with water moisture ( [...] H2O [...] ) can produce sulfuric acid ( [...] H2SO4 [...] ) is needed. Significant environmental efforts aimed at <b>scrubbing</b> <b>SO2</b> from automobile exhausts and coal-burning power plants over since the 1970s have been largely successful in eliminating acid rain as an environmental pollutant.|$|R
50|$|It is {{produced}} {{on a large}} scale by flue gas desulfurization (FGD). When coal or other fossil fuel is burned, the byproduct is known as flue gas. Flue gas often contains SO2, whose emission is often regulated to prevent acid rain. Sulfur dioxide is scrubbed before the remaining gases are emitted through the chimney stack. An economical way of <b>scrubbing</b> <b>SO2</b> from flue gases is by treating the effluent with Ca(OH)2 hydrated lime or CaCO3 limestone.|$|R
40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} is {{a promising}} CCS technology {{which is being}} demonstrated prior to commercialisation. While the flue gas in oxy-fuel combustion is concentrated in CO₂, it contains impurities such as SO₂. The elimination of SO₂ can provide a clean CO₂ stream ready for storage. This paper is to understand the absorption of <b>SO₂</b> in <b>scrubbing</b> relevant to those used in oxy-fuel technology. Steady state experiments were conducted in a continuous well stirred reactor to understand the absorption rate of SO₂/CO₂ into a total concentration of 0. 28 M of mixtures of NaHSO₃ and NaHCO₃ simulating liquids formed by scrubbers using NaOH as the reagent at solution pH values from 4 to 7 with the exiting gas concentrations of SO₂ from 19 ppm to 1500 ppm and a constant CO₂ concentration of 70 %. Online measurement included gas phase SO₂ and liquid pH, and offline measurement included CO₂ (aq), HCO₃⁻, S (IV), SO₃²⁻ and S (VI) after each experiment. Three aspects investigated were the impacts of pH on the solution chemistry, the significance of solution pH and the concentration of gas phase SO₂ on the absorption rate of SO₂. The total sulphur concentration in liquid {{was found to be}} related to the effectiveness of Na⁺. The effective ratio of Na⁺ can be defined as the total sulphur to Na⁺ ratio and this effectiveness ratio of Na⁺ is pH dependent. At pH 5. 5. The concentration of HCO₃⁻ increases dramatically above pH 6 and below this pH, the concentration of HCO₃⁻ is negligible. The absorption rate of SO₂ was found to increase with pH with some increase with the concentration of SO₂. The operational pH window for scrubbing may be defined by an upper limit pH where the absorption rate of SO₂ starts to decreases from the maximum absorption rate of SO₂ and the lower limit pH where the absorption rate of SO₂ reduces to half of the maximum absorption rate of SO₂. Both the upper limit and the lower limit decrease initially and stay stable with the concentration of SO₂. This decrease is caused by the reversible reaction of the hydrolysis of SO₂ and confirmed by equilibrium experiments of SO₂ and sodium solutions. Operation within region 2 (pH 5 - 6) is recommended, depending on the scrubber design. The operation exit pH of the produced liquid can be varied within the region. The absorption rates of SO₂ obtained in the steady state experiments were predicted by a model based on the instantaneous reaction assumption. This model generally overestimates the absorption rates of SO₂ at pH values below 6 indicating a kinetic limitation of SO₂ and water reaction at low pH values. The analysis on the controlling regions indicates that the gas side mass transfer resistance decreases with the concentration of SO₂. Liquid side resistance becomes more important at a lower pH and a higher concentration of SO₂...|$|R
