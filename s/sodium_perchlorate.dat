40|$|Abstract—Recently, concern {{regarding}} perchlorate contamination {{has arisen}} in many contexts. Perchlorate has many military, commercial, and domestic applications, {{and it has}} been found in milk, drinking and irrigation water, and produce. Perchlorate is harmful at low levels, yet it remains unregulated in the United States while the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency attempts to establish acceptable exposure levels. The present study investigated potential reproductive effects on vertebrates using a model fish species, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Sticklebacks were raised from syngamy through sexual maturity in untreated water and in three target concentrations of <b>sodium</b> perchlorate–treated water. <b>Perchlorate</b> was found to interfere with the expression of nuptial coloration, courtship behavior, and normal sexual development. Genetic testing revealed that some females were masculinized {{to the extent that they}} produced both sperm and eggs, and histological analysis showed that these individuals had intersexual gonads (ovotestes) containing both oocytes and cells undergoing spermatogenesis. In vitro fertilizations revealed that those gametes were capable of self- and cross-fertilization. However, crosses using sperm derived from genetic females died either during the blastula phase or near the onset of organogenesis. Sperm derived from genetic males produced viable fry when crossed with eggs derived from genetic females from all treatments.

40|$|The {{effect of}} trace {{quantities}} of ammonia on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on carbon-supported platinum catalysts in perchloric acid solutions is assessed using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The study demonstrates that ammonia has detrimental effects on ORR. The most significant effect {{takes place in}} the potential region above 0. 7 V vs RHE. The effect is explained by the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia, which blocks Pt active sites and increases the formation of H 2 O 2. This leads to losses in the disk currents and increments in the ring currents. The apparent losses in ORR currents may occur in two ways, namely, through the blocking of the active sites for ORR as well as by generating a small anodic current, which is believed to have a lower contribution. In addition, a detrimental effect of sodium cations in the potential range below 0. 75 V vs RHE was demonstrated. This effect is most likely due to the co-adsorption of <b>sodium</b> cations and <b>perchlorate</b> anions on the Pt surface. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In particular, the heterogeneous electron-transfer kinetics in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dichloromethane (DCM) are studied using the high-speed microband channel electrode. Experiments to investigate the standard electrochemical rate constants, k 0, transfer coefficients, α, and formal potentials, Ef 0, of the observable oxidations of TMPB in both DMF and DCM solutions containing 0. 10 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) are reported for 12. 5 μm platinum microband electrodes using a range of linear flow velocities from 12 to 25 m s- 1. The measured values of k 0 for the two measurable oxidations in DMF are 1. 03 ± 0. 41 and 1. 02 ± 0. 20 cm s- 1, and for the three oxidations in DCM are 0. 44 ± 0. 04, 0. 17 ± 0. 03 and 0. 08 ± 0. 02 cm s- 1, respectively. The values of α for these oxidations in DMF are 0. 48 ± 0. 06 and 0. 52 ± 0. 02, and in DCM are 0. 52 ± 0. 02, 0. 62 ± 0. 03 and 0. 53 ± 0. 07, respectively. The respective formal oxidation potentials (all measured vs Ag) are 0. 533 ± 0. 002 and 0. 766 ± 0. 003 V in DMF, and 0. 161 ± 0. 002, 0. 495 ± 0. 002 and 1. 128 ± 0. 004 V in DCM.

Experiments are also presented to explore the voltammetry of TMPB in microdroplets of toluene {{and also in the}} solid-phase, when in contact with aqueous solutions of <b>sodium</b> fluoride, <b>perchlorate,</b> nitrate and sulphate.

40|$|The {{composition}} of a (μ-oxo) diiron(III) complex coordinated by tris[(3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -methoxy) pyridyl- 2 -methyl]amine (R[subscript 3]TPA) ligands was investigated. Characterization {{using a variety}} of spectroscopic methods and X-ray crystallography indicated that the reaction of iron(III) <b>perchlorate,</b> <b>sodium</b> hydroxide, and R[subscript 3]TPA affords [Fe[subscript 2](μ-O) (μ-OH) (R[subscript 3]TPA) [subscript 2]](ClO[subscript 4]) [subscript 3] (2) rather than the previously reported species [Fe[subscript 2](μ-O) (OH) (H[subscript 2]O) (R[subscript 3]TPA) [subscript 2]](ClO[subscript 4]) [subscript 3] (1). Facile conversion of the (μ-oxo) (μ-hydroxo) diiron(III) core of 2 to the (μ-oxo) (hydroxo) (aqua) diiron(III) core of 1 occurs in the presence of water and at low temperature. When 2 is exposed to wet acetonitrile at room temperature, the CH[subscript 3]CN adduct is hydrolyzed to CH[subscript 3]COO[superscript –], which forms the compound [Fe[subscript 2](μ-O) (μ-CH[subscript 3]COO) (R[subscript 3]TPA) [subscript 2]](ClO[subscript 4]) [subscript 3] (10). The identity of 10 was confirmed by comparison of its spectroscopic properties with those of an independently prepared sample. To evaluate whether or not 1 and 2 are capable of generating the diiron(IV) species [Fe[subscript 2](μ-O) (OH) (O) (R[subscript 3]TPA) [subscript 2]][superscript 3 +] (4), which has previously been generated as a synthetic model for high-valent diiron protein oxygenated intermediates, studies were performed to investigate their reactivity with hydrogen peroxide. Because 2 reacts rapidly with hydrogen peroxide in CH[subscript 3]CN but not in CH[subscript 3]CN/H[subscript 2]O, conditions that favor conversion to 1, complex 1 is not a likely precursor to 4. Compound 4 also forms in the reaction of 2 with H[subscript 2]O[subscript 2] in solvents lacking a nitrile, suggesting that hydrolysis of CH[subscript 3]CN is not involved in the H[subscript 2]O[subscript 2] activation reaction.

Facilities like JPL-SAF, which use "clean rooms" to assemble these craft, are concerned with the presence of microbial populations in these environments and in the assessment of risk microorganisms may pose in the contamination of equipment during assembly. Because of the supposed lack of organics for use as microbial nutrition, these clean room environments are typically considered to be "extreme" conditions for microbial growth. In recent years, research has shown that species of both archaea and bacteria can be isolated from samples taken from various clean rooms currently in use in the fields of medicine, manufacturing, and chemistry. Understanding the microbial communities that live in these environments may shed some light on methods for control and the prevention of contamination. Multiple samplings collected from various distinct locations inside and outside the JPL-SAF location in Pasadena, CA were cultivated, morphologically studied, and subjected to various biochemical and phenetic tests to assess their ability to survive in these clean room environments.

40|$|Although a {{thorough}} investigation of various methods of preparing pure, anhydrous acetone has been made (cf. Sadie), no investigations of methods for determining the moisture content of this solvent have previously been described. A solvent with a consistently low water content is essential for electrochemical measurements. Accordingly an extensive study of moisture content determination in acetone-was made. A modified Karl Fischer titration procedure {{was found to be}} most suitable for the very low moisture contents of the acetone used in this work. All A. C. conductance measurements made using two platinised electrodes are, in some degree, liable to errors due to polarization, end effects and the state of the electrode surfaces. Several workers have also found errors due to the presence of finely divided platinum, such as adsorption of electrolyte on the colloidal platinum, the shaking effect and catalysis of reactions in solution. These errors are reduced by using lightly platinised or bright platinum electrodes, but polished electrodes give rise to increased polarization errors. In this work conductance measurements were made using a new four-electrode A. C. potentiometer, which employs bright platinum electrodes enabling conductance measurements to be carried out in acetone without recourse to platinisation, thus avoiding errors due to the presence of platinum black, contact resistances of electrodes and the like. The measurements on this apparatus were shown to be independent of frequency using aqueous potassium chloride solutions, and the accuracy of the results was tested using aqueous <b>sodium</b> chloride solutions. <b>Perchlorates</b> have been considered by some investigators (e. g. Ross Kane) to be strong electrolytes in acetone solutions and other workers (e. g. Accascina and Schiavo) found the alkali perchlorates to be weak electrolytes. The approximate limiting ionic conductances calculated by these last named workers were at variance with those of other investigators (e. g. Kraus). It therefore appeared that a study of the conductances of solutions in acetone of perchloric acid and some of its salts by the new potentiometric method would be advantageous. The conductances of three alkali perchlorates and the previou 3 ly unknown conductances in acetone of ammonium perchloratey pure anhydrous perchloric acid and lithium chloride were measured by the potentiometric method. Limiting equivalent conductances and dissociation constants were calculated for all the electrolytes and the results discussed. These electrolytes were, in general, found to be relatively weak in acetone, although perchloric acid is considerably stronger than hydrochloric acid. The conductance results indicated that the potentiometric method should be generally applicable to electrolyte solutions in all solvents, and can be used to advantage in all cases influenced by the errors previously mentioned. It is generally recognized that interpretation of conductance data and the development of the theory of electrolyte solutions is seriously hindered by the lack of transport data in non-aqueous solvents. Transference measurements were undertaken using a conductimetric moving boundary method, and a limiting transport number for the anion constituent of potassium thiocyanate was obtained in acetone. This is the first reasonably accurate limiting transport number to have been measured in acetone. From the equivalent conductance data of this work, and the literature, the first limiting ionic conductances in acetone have been calculated and the results discussed. The limiting conductance of the hydrogen ion 101 cm² ohm-¹ equiv-¹, was not found to be anomalous, as for example, in water. Anions were found to have generally higher conductances than cations, which is consistent with the view that cations are in general, more solvated than anions in dipolar aprotic solvents. Conductance results of numerous workers have indicated considerable uncertainty about the entities present in acetone solutions of hydrogen chloride. In order to add to existing knowledge, tracer diffusion coefficients of hydrogen chloride in acetone solutions were measured at 15 &# 8304;, 25 &# 8304; and 35 &# 8304;C over a range of concentrations using hydrogen chloride labelled with chlorine - 36. The capillary tube method was used, and concentrations were measured by a scintillation counting procedure.
