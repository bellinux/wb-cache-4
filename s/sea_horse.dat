The Japanese had held this hilltop {{in the second half}} of 1942 and showered artillery fire on American troops at the Henderson airfield below the hill. Eventually the hill was captured but the Japanese held on to the Gifu, <b>Sea</b> <b>Horse,</b> and Galloping Horse ridges for about a month. Most of the Japanese died of starvation, banzai assaults or direct killing.|$|E

They include the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Mermaid, the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep, the Toad, the Darning Needle, the Emperor's New Clothes, the <b>Sea</b> <b>Horse,</b> the Paper Boat, the Flying Trunk and the Wild Swans. There is also a distinctive statue of Andersen in Eventyrparken (The Fairy Tale Park) beside the cathedral. Sculpted by Louis Hasselriis in 1888, it shows the storyteller with a book in his hand, ready to entertain onlookers with his fairy tales.|$|E

5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} {{was ending}} its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled many more of Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the <b>Sea</b> <b>Horse</b> in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E

Finally, Gaga also wore a seashell bikini top and voluminous wig; the ensemble had been worn by Gaga in previous live performances for the Artpop era.

500|$|As Shōji's forces {{began their}} march {{to rejoin the}} main body of Japanese forces west of the Matanikau River, the U.S. 2nd Marine Raider Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson, which had been {{guarding}} an airfield construction effort underway at Aola Bay, [...] further east from Koli Point—set off in pursuit. Over the next month, with the aid of native scouts, Carlson's raiders repeatedly attacked trailing elements and stragglers from Shōji's forces, killing almost 500 of them. In addition, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled more of Shōji's men. By the time the Japanese reached the Lunga River, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300 men remained with Shōji's main body. Several days later, when Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700–800 survivors were still with him.

50|$|The long {{bodies are}} encased in bony plates {{resembling}} scales. These plates are a protective armour {{and serve as}} camouflage. Even though pipefish have these bony plates, their bodies are very flexible and {{have the ability to}} move much like snakes do. Their elongated head looks like a horse head and resembles that of the related seahorses. They also have the ability to wrap their tails around sea grasses to anchor themselves, just as <b>sea</b> <b>horses</b> do. Unlike <b>sea</b> <b>horses,</b> pipefish swim horizontally. Another unique feature is their long snout, which is where the pipefish gets its name.|$|R
500|$|Barber's quarter eagle (the {{first of}} that {{denomination}} issued as a commemorative) depicts, {{according to the}} Mint Director's report, [...] "Columbia, representing the United States, seated [...] the mythical <b>sea</b> <b>horse</b> , riding through {{the waters of the}} canal, with caduceus in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting {{the nations of the world}} to use the new way from ocean to ocean. Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto 'E Pluribus Unum'". The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is [...] "said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. William C. Gorgas's successful campaign" [...] to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. They wrote that on the reverse, the [...] "defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device".|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the 300 islands {{began in}} 2003, only to halt {{due to the}} 2008 {{financial}} crisis. Though 60 percent of the islands had been sold off to private contractors back in 2008, development on most of these islands has failed to initiate. As of July 2012, the Lebanon Island was developed and was the only island that had so far been developed commercially, being used for private corporate events and public parties. As of late 2013, {{only two of the}} islands had been developed. In January 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of [...] "The Heart of Europe" [...] project; by February 2014, one of Kleindienst Group's brands - JK Properties - announced in their monthly newsletter that the project was [...] "well underway".

2500|$|Commander Henry Montresor took command after Manly {{was sent}} to the Gulf of Mexico. In early December 1814, a British fleet massed for the assault on New Orleans. Between 12 and 15 December 1814, Captain Nicholas Lockyer of HMS Sophie led a {{flotilla}} of some 50 boats, barges, gigs and launches to attack the US gunboats. [...] He drew his flotilla from the fleet that was massing against New Orleans, including the 74-gun third-rate Tonnant, Armide, Seahorse, Manly, and Meteor. Lockyer deployed the boats in three divisions, of which he led one. Commander Montresor of the Manly commanded the second, and Captain Samuel Roberts of Meteor commanded the third. After rowing for 36 hours, the British met the Americans at St. Joseph's Island. On the morning of the 14th, the British engaged the Americans in the short, violent Battle of Lake Borgne. The British destroyed the one-gun schooner USS <b>Sea</b> <b>Horse,</b> and captured almost the entire American force, including the tender, USS Alligator, and five gunboats. The British lost 17 men killed and 77 wounded; Manly fortunately had no casualties. [...] then evacuated the wounded.|$|E
2500|$|It was in {{the northeastern}} North Atlantic that the Basques {{witnessed}} {{the loss of their}} near monopoly on the trade beginning in the early 17th century. Their men were recruited for English (1611), Dutch (1613), northern French (1613), and Danish (1617) whaling expeditions to Spitsbergen, where they hunted the bowhead whale. The first was caught on 12 June 1611 (Old-Style) by one of the six Basque whalemen recruited from the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. When the merchants of San Sebastian learned of this new whaling ground they were eager to expand their operations to that distant corner of the Arctic. The next year, 1612, they dispatched a single ship under the command of Juan de Erauso and piloted by the Englishman Nicholas Woodcock, a former employee of the Muscovy Company of London who had made two prior voyages to Spitsbergen (1610–11). Upon reaching Spitsbergen they discovered such an abundance of whales [...] "that for a stretch of sixty leagues along the coast the sea was obscured." [...] The Englishman Thomas Edge, master of the <b>Sea</b> <b>Horse</b> (180 tons), one of the two ships sent by the Muscovy Company to Spitsbergen, spoke with Woodcock while surveying the coast in a pinnace, reporting that the Basque ship had [...] "made a full Voyage in Green-harbour", or Grønfjorden, {{on the south side of}} Isfjorden. On his return Woodcock spent sixteen months in the Gatehouse and Tower for leading a foreign vessel into an [...] "English preserve". The expedition returned to Spain [...] "with [...] glowing reports of the wealth of the fishery" [...] that a patent was secured from the Viceroy of Navarre, Don Alonso de Idiáquez, conde de Aramayona. Its report led others to send out a fleet of whaleships to Spitsbergen in 1613, including the ports of Holland, northern France, and the Basque provinces. San Sebastian sent out a dozen ships (one of them being the ship Woodcock had piloted the previous year), while Saint-Jean-de-Luz sent out three or four.|$|E
