2500|$|The {{later years}} of this {{generation}} of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire [...] "bent-glass" [...] rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards {{at the touch of}} a button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable solution to the problem was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E

50|$|In 1993 Peugeot {{introduced}} the 205 and 405 STDT, a higher performance diesel model to sit between the standard diesel range {{and the higher}} end GTI cars. The 205 STDT (special trim diesel turbo) was available only in the 3-door bodyshell with a 1,769 cc turbo diesel engine (XUD7 T/K) with the trim and luxuries of the 205 GTI. The car was initially marketed towards executives, with soft cloth bucket seats in Beige with matching carpet and dashboard, as {{also found in the}} Gentry models. The car featured PAS, central locking, electric windows and also electrically heated mirrors. Many were fitted with a large, vacuum-seal <b>slide</b> <b>sunroof.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Ghia {{models were}} {{similarly}} equipped to UK models, {{but only the}} 2.3-litre V6 models featured imported Ford alloy wheels. Ford 'Rostyle' steel rims were fitted to all 2.0 GL, Ghia and S models, optionally on the other models. New Zealand Ghia models, however, did not feature a steel <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> (fitted as standard on UK Ghia models), although some models did feature an aftermarket sunroof.|$|E
5000|$|This model also {{marked the}} end for the pop-up headlights. The 1992 Prelude {{incorporated}} other design features that had also become the [...] "Prelude standard". The rear end was rounded and fairly high {{in comparison to the}} previous square trunk line. The front fascia of the car became wider with fixed headlights. The glass moonroof made way for a steel <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> which no longer retracted into the car but extended out and over it.|$|E
50|$|A sunroof {{package was}} optional, {{featuring}} power <b>sliding</b> glass <b>sunroof</b> with tilt feature, and dual illuminated visor vanity mirrors. An Audio package, featuring a 340-watt Rockford Fosgate 6-CD audio system, with eight speakers (two subwoofers, four mid-range woofers, and two tweeters) was also available.|$|R

25|$|The options {{list was}} not {{extensive}} but, {{as with the}} larger Peugeot saloons, {{it was possible to}} specify a <b>sliding</b> steel panel <b>sunroof.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1976, a {{five-speed}} {{manual transmission}} became available as an option. Starting with the 1976 models, {{the front and}} rear disc rotors were of the vented type. Another new option was the Astroroof, which was a large, heavily tinted, overhead glass roof combined with a wide aluminum band that extended from one B-pillar across the roof to the opposite B-pillar. In 1977, a conventional <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> became optional and also could be ordered with the aluminum band.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth {{generation}} Minicab incorporated many class-leading {{features such as}} an automatic free-wheel hub adopted on all four-wheel drive models, while two-wheel drive models had a turning radius of 3.7 m. The estate models featured the first <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> in their class. In 1987, the Minicab became the first manufacturer to offer a supercharged kei truck. It was also marketed in the United States for off-road purposes only, where it was sold as the [...] "Mighty Mits." ...|$|E
50|$|Across 1989-1990, 1200 GTIs {{were made}} in the then new colours of Miami blue (Bright {{metallic}} blue) and Sorrento Green (a very dark pearlescent green). The cars {{were made in}} an equal mix of 300 blue 1.6 litre, 300 green 1.6 litre, 300 blue 1.9 litre and 300 green 1.9 litre. The cars had a <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof,</b> power steering and full grey leather interior as standard, together with grey carpets and doorcards. These paint colours were later added to the list of available colours for mainstream models.|$|E
50|$|A {{convertible}} version was not produced, although a version with an electrically <b>sliding</b> full length <b>sunroof,</b> called the Polo Open Air, was available.|$|R
50|$|The options {{list was}} not {{extensive}} but, {{as with the}} larger Peugeot saloons, {{it was possible to}} specify a <b>sliding</b> steel panel <b>sunroof.</b>|$|R
25|$|HSV branded {{special order}} options {{included}} electric tilt and <b>slide</b> glass <b>sunroof,</b> VDO MS5000 satellite navigation {{system in place}} of front console ashtray, HSV alloy pedals, limited slip differential, rear deck spoiler and choice of two 17-inch alloy wheel styles. Vehicles specially ordered with any HSV optional extras received a Holden-by-Design individually numbered build plate in the engine bay.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Devon and Dorset were body-on-frame designs {{with modern}} bodies and a 1.2 L straight-4 OHV engine {{producing}} [...] at 4200 rpm. [...] They featured front coil sprung independent suspension but retained a rigid axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The Girling brakes with 9 in drums were operated hydraulically {{at the front}} and mechanically at the rear. Later cars had column operated gear change and full hydraulic braking. A <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> and heater were extra cost options on the UK market.|$|E
50|$|Sunroofs, by {{historical}} definition are opaque. The first car company {{to offer a}} sunroof as a standard option was the Nash Motor Company as an option on some of its 1937 models. Today, most factory <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof</b> options feature a glass panel and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs, a term introduced in 1973 by John Atkinson, a marketing manager at Ford for the Lincoln Continental Mark IV. For the first year, Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American Sunroof Company for offline installation.|$|E
50|$|There {{were four}} models initially, the 2-door and 4-door Bantam Popular {{as well as}} the 2-door and 4-door Bantam De-Luxe. All four shared the same basic {{bodyshell}} but, whereas the De-Luxe models had a <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroof,</b> the Popular version had a fixed panel over the roof opening. In the ensuing years, many cars had the sliding roof removed but the presence of the drainage channels front and rear indicates the De-Luxe origins. Other features of the De-Luxe model were leather seats, chrome bumpers and a rear luggage rack.|$|E
50|$|For 1978, in move {{intended}} to cut weight and cost {{and also to}} refresh the interior, the steel-frame dashboard used since 1970 is replaced with the plastic one sourced from the Mercury Marquis. The rear fender skirts were redesigned, showing more of the wheel opening. Alongside the optional <b>sliding</b> glass <b>sunroof,</b> Lincoln introduced a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade, a feature not offered since the 1955 Skyliner.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrically}} operated <b>sliding</b> steel <b>sunroof</b> was optional in 1962, the second automobile {{model in the}} world to have this option. The styling offered more interior and cargo room than the original Karmann Ghia. It featured an electric clock, three luggage spaces, built-in fog lights, round tail lights, upper and lower dash pads, door pads, and long padded armrests. It was the fastest production VW model of its day.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{production}} of auto parts {{continued in the}} United States and innovation became a crucial component to any manufacturing company’s success. Fisher Body, which had long since expanded its products beyond solely creating auto bodies, shipped its first latches in 1946. Inland also began selling new products in 1951 when it shipped its first door trim panels and later instrument panels in 1956.The automotive industry in Europe was not far behind the American companies. In 1950, Traugotte Golde was renamed Golde GmbH {{and became the first}} supplier of <b>sliding</b> <b>sunroofs.</b> The world’s first sealed door module was launched in France by the Compagnie Industrielle de Mecanismes SA (CIM) in 1968. Soon, window regulators made the shift from manual to electric operation and CIM became the industry’s leader in the investment of electric motors. In 1973, Golde GmbH began the {{production of}} the world’s first tilt and slide module and in the same year was acquired by Rockwell International, a company with a history in the automotive axle business in Detroit.|$|R
