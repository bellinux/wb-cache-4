30|$|Using the 9 <b>scouring</b> depth {{formulas}} and 30 {{pairs of}} water levels and water velocities, 270 {{samples of the}} <b>scour</b> depth are obtained.

The total <b>scour</b> depth of the pier is usually the sum of the depths of the local <b>scouring,</b> contraction <b>scouring</b> and general <b>scouring</b> (i.e., <b>scouring</b> without structures). The local <b>scouring</b> often dominates the overall <b>scouring</b> depth, and thus, other <b>scouring</b> is not considered at present (Alipour et al. 2013; HEC- 18 2012; NRCS of USDA 2010). The correlation coefficients between the <b>scour</b> depth and water level and between the <b>scour</b> depth and water velocity are found to be 0.93 and 0.92, respectively.|$|R

By separating each <b>scour</b> component, a methodology for simulating the temporal variations of the total <b>scour</b> depth under unsteady flow conditions is proposed. The proposed total-scour model integrates three <b>scour</b> components, namely general <b>scour,</b> contraction <b>scour,</b> and local <b>scour.</b> The collected field data, comprising both general <b>scour</b> and total <b>scour</b> depths, are used to validate the applicability of the proposed model.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of an expert}} system (CAESAR for Catalog and Expert Evaluation of <b>Scour</b> Risk and River Stability) for an initial evaluation of <b>scour</b> and stream stability was assessed.

These <b>scour</b> indices include the Observed Streambed <b>Scour</b> index, the INDOT Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index, and the Simon Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index. Ten bridges in Indiana are selected for evaluation in this study. The <b>scour</b> indices and the field inspection information required by CAESAR are retrieved from the USGS data base. In general, {{the results show that}} CAESAR is able to reflect current <b>scour</b> risks as well as the Observed Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index, and the results from CAESAR identifies more bridges as <b>scour</b> critical than the INDOT Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index and the Simon Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index. Because the INDOT Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index and the Simon Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index do {{not take into account the}} overall stream geometry, bank materials, channel and floodplain widths, and other considerations required by CAESAR, the results of these two indices are not as conservative as that given by CAESAR.

40|$|<b>Scour</b> is an {{important}} issue due to the potential great extent of loss and risks associated with <b>scouring.</b> The work described herein constitutes laboratory testing of the time development of <b>scour</b> holes in clayey soils produced by a submerged vertical circular impinging jet. Long term laboratory tests were performed on three types of manufactured pottery clays, Buffstone clay (50. 3 - 51. 7 % clay), P 300 clay (48. 7 - 50. 7 % clay), and M 370 clay (51. 1 - 51. 3 % clay). Detailed measurements of the entire <b>scour</b> hole were performed on a 2 mm grid using a computer controlled laser optical profiler after <b>scouring</b> times of 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 h, 1. 5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 and then at every 24 h interval until the <b>scour</b> hole was considered to have reached equilibrium based on the criterion used by Mazurek et al. (2001). This resulted in long test durations ranging from 120 h to 384 h. For the time development of the <b>scour</b> hole, a three-dimensional <b>scour</b> hole surface was produced using the data taken by an optical profiler. Thereafter, four cross sections of the <b>scour</b> hole were extracted from the three-dimensional <b>scour</b> hole surface. Dimensions considered for analysis were taken from both the three-dimensional <b>scour</b> hole surface and the cross sections of the <b>scour</b> hole. The volume of the <b>scour</b> hole, and the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> hole depths were extracted from the <b>scour</b> hole surface. The section-wise maximum <b>scour</b> depth, radius of the <b>scour</b> hole, half-width about the jet centreline, and half-width about the section-wise maximum <b>scour</b> depth were extracted for each cross-sections. The growth of these dimensions were observed with time. For a significant portion of <b>scouring,</b> the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> hole depths increased linearly with the logarithm of time. For the majority of the tests, the half-widths decreased with time. Temporary ceasing of the increment of the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> hole depths was observed, called “plateaus”, in the time development plot. <b>Scour</b> hole dimensions for the cross-sections showed variability from the average <b>scour</b> hole dimensions. However, for most of the tests this variability decreased with time as the <b>scour</b> test proceeded. To decide on whether the equilibrium state of the <b>scour</b> hole was achieved, all of the aforementioned <b>scour</b> hole dimensions were evaluated. The characteristic <b>scour</b> hole dimension to decide on the equilibrium condition was termed as the “critical equilibrium dimension”. Four of the <b>scour</b> tests reached an overall equilibrium state, the section wise maximum <b>scour</b> hole depth was the critical equilibrium dimension for three of those. The half-widths were the critical equilibrium dimension for one of the tests. However, previous studies did not consider the “side slope erosion” of the <b>scour</b> hole, hence neglected the section-wise maximum <b>scour</b> depth and half widths for identifying equilibrium condition. Dimensionless <b>scour</b> hole profiles were developed using the centreline <b>scour</b> depth as the scale for <b>scour</b> hole depth and the half-width about the centreline depth as the scale for radial distance from the jet centreline. A general equation of the dimensionless equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole profile was developed by fitting a sine function to the equilibrium <b>scour</b> test profiles using linear regression analysis. Dimensionless <b>scour</b> hole profiles with time during the <b>scour</b> test were compared to the dimensionless profile at equilibrium. It was observed that while for some <b>scour</b> tests the equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole shape formed quickly compared to the time to equilibrium, for some <b>scour</b> tests the equilibrium shapes did not form until the <b>scour</b> hole stopped growing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experiment designed to assess the time-development of <b>scour</b> around an offshore wind turbine collared monopile over a number of tidal cycles. One collar shape and location was investigated. The <b>scour</b> developed more slowly and the <b>scour</b> depth was shallower than for the case of a smooth monopile throughout the majority of the first half-cycle. This difference reduced quite rapidly during the second half-cycle and the <b>scour</b> depth at the end of two tidal cycles was essentially the same as for the smooth monopile. The time development of the <b>scour</b> was compared with results from existing empirical models for the time-development of <b>scour</b> under unidirectional flow. As expected, these models give a much smoother evolution of <b>scour</b> and different <b>scour</b> rates than those measured. Time variation in <b>scour</b> depth was better reproduced with a simplified approach for prediction of the time-varying development of <b>scour.</b> This also highlighted a problem with estimation of the time scale {{for the development of the}} equilibrium <b>scour</b> depth. Further investigations are needed before this alternative <b>scour</b> protection is completely rejected...|$|R

The developed probabilistic procedures are consistent with LRFD approaches for bridge design used by structural and geotechnical engineers. As a necessary first step in developing the statistical parameters for risk and reliability analyses, the key bridge <b>scour</b> equations (HEC- 18 pier <b>scour,</b> Florida DOT pier <b>scour,</b> HEC- 18 contraction <b>scour,</b> and NCHRP 24 - 20 abutment <b>scour)</b> were tested against available laboratory and field data sets. The results which are summarized in this presentation include: · The pier <b>scour</b> equations (HEC- 18 and FDOT) are design equations which do not under predict observed <b>scour</b> very often. Consequently, the probabilistic reliability indexes for pier <b>scour</b> compare favorably with those used by structural and geotechnical engineers in LRFD applications for bridges. · In contrast with the pier <b>scour</b> equations, the HEC- 18 contraction <b>scour</b> equations are essentially predictive, given that they are derived from sediment transport principles and theory. Therefore, under predictions of observed <b>scour</b> are much more common, and the resulting reliability is very low compared to typical target values used in LRFD applications. · The NCHRP 24 - 20 equations for live-bed and clear-water abutment <b>scour</b> both use a calculation for contraction <b>scour</b> and then apply an amplification factor to account for the additional <b>scour</b> caused by local effects at the tip of the abutment. The <b>scour</b> predicted by this method is the total <b>scour</b> at the abutment. The reliability of the abutment <b>scour</b> equations was found to be intermediate between those of the pier <b>scour</b> and contraction <b>scour</b> equations.

After the <b>scour</b> change to interium, the flow separate from sand surface at an inclined plane downstream of <b>scour</b> hole. The <b>scour</b> change into progressive stage, in addition to the separation of flow, the intermittent collapse of a slope downstreams of <b>scour</b> hole becomes occour. In this paper, the author describes the results of some experiments on the <b>scour</b> from submerged plane jet, and suggest the method analysed the development of <b>scour</b> hole. As a results of analysis, it becomes clear that the separation of flow and the intermittent collapse are important in order to explane the mechanism of the local <b>scour</b> from submerged plane jet. The experimental results can be analysed sufficiently by the method proposed here...|$|R

Many damages of bridge {{are caused}} by <b>scour.</b> This paper tries {{to find out the}} {{relationship}} between the changes of dynamic properties of bridges and <b>scour.</b> The influence of <b>scour</b> on the Mississippi State Highway 33 Bridge is analyzed considering 2 factors, the <b>scour</b> depth and the water level. A Finite Element model is used to simulate the vibration of the bridge under <b>scour.</b> The results reveal the effects of <b>scour</b> on the dynamic properties of the bridge...|$|R
