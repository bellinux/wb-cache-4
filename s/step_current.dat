40|$|Most {{current clamp}} studies trigger action {{potentials}} (APs) by <b>step</b> <b>current</b> injection through the recording electrode {{and assume that}} the resulting APs are essentially identical to those triggered by orthodromic synaptic inputs. However this assumption is not always valid, particularly when the synaptic conductance is of large magnitude and of {{close proximity to the}} axon initial segment. We addressed this question of similarity using the Calyx of Held/MNTB synapse; we compared APs evoked by long duration <b>step</b> <b>current</b> injections, short <b>step</b> <b>current</b> injections and orthodromic synaptic stimuli. Neither injected current protocol evoked APs that matched the evoked orthodromic AP waveform, showing differences in AP height, half-width and after-hyperpolarization. We postulated that this 'error' could arise from changes in the instantaneous conductance during the combined synaptic and AP waveforms, since the driving forces for the respective ionic currents are integrating and continually evolving over this time-course. We demonstrate that a simple Ohm's law manipulation of the EPSC waveform, which accounts for the evolving driving force on the synaptic conductance during the AP, produces waveforms that closely mimic those generated by physiological synaptic stimulation. This stimulation paradigm allows supra-threshold physiological stimulation (single stimuli or trains) without the variability caused by quantal fluctuation in transmitter release, and can be implemented without a specialised dynamic clamp system. Combined with pharmacological tools this method provides a reliable means to assess the physiological roles of postsynaptic ion channels without confounding affects from the presynaptic input. 1675...|$|E

In voltage-clamp recordings, step depolarization elicited a calcium-dependent outward tail current that reversed near EK. The current was nearly abolished by apamin and by UCL 1684, suggesting mediation by small-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) channels. In current-clamp recordings, depolarizing <b>step</b> <b>current</b> injections evoked action potentials that underwent spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). SK channel blockade with apamin or UCL 1684 increased the spike frequency without changing the rate of SFA. Upon termination of <b>step</b> <b>current</b> injection, a prominent medium after-hyperpolarization potential (mAHP) was observed. SK channel blockade abolished the mAHP and revealed an after-depolarization potential (ADP). In response to ramp current injections, the rate of sub-threshold depolarization was increased during SK channel blockade, indicating that depolarizing input resistance was increased. Miniature EPSC frequency, amplitude, and decay kinetics were unaltered by bath application of apamin, suggesting that SK channel blockade likely increased excitability by a postsynaptic action. We conclude that although SK channels play little role in generating SFA in PVN–RVLM neurones, their activation nevertheless does dampen excitability. The mechanism appears to involve activation of a mAHP that opposes a prominent ADP that would otherwise facilitate firing...|$|E

We investigated the electrophysiological mechanisms of differences in repolarization between control guinea pigs and hypothyroid animals (thyroidectomy plus 5 -propyl- 2 -thiouracil). Hypothyroidism significantly prolonged the rate-corrected Q-T interval in vivo and action potential duration (APD) of isolated ventricular myocytes. Whole cell voltage-clamp studies showed no change in current density or kinetics of L-type Ca 2 + current, inward rectifier K+ current, or Na+ current in hypothyroid hearts. Dofetilide-resistant current (I(Ks)) <b>step</b> <b>current</b> densities were smaller by ~ 65 %, and tail current densities were reduced by 80 % in myocytes from hypothyroid animals compared with controls. The ratio of delayed rectifier <b>step</b> <b>current</b> at + 50 mV to tail current at - 40 mV was significantly larger in hypothyroid cells for test pulses from 60 - to 4, 200 -ms duration, reflecting a smaller I(Ks). Dofetilide-sensitive current (I(Kr)) densities were not significantly changed. I(Ks) half-activation voltage shifted to more positive voltages in hypothyroidism (29. 5 ± 2. 2 vs. 21. 3 ± 2. 7 mV in control, P < 0. 01), whereas I(Kr) voltage dependence was unchanged. We conclude that hypothyroidism delays repolarization in the guinea pig ventricle by decreasing I(Ks), a novel and potentially important mechanism for thyroid regulation of cardiac electrophysiology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

It {{was found that the}} external current was supplied by a capacitive charging current and a metal dissolution current. For samples which had been pretreated with HCl prior to the etch, {{it was found that the}} initial growth of the pits is due a currentless mechanism in parallel with the metal dissolution current density. In contrast, a sample which had not been pretreated gave evidence of electrochemical dissolution only. Vacancy condensation was discussed as a possible currentless mechanism;The results from the <b>step</b> <b>current</b> reduction experiments were used to determine the kinetics of metal dissolution and repassivation. A decrease in the surface over-potential relative to the repassivation potential is associated with an increase in the passivation velocity and a decrease in the metal dissolution current density within a pit. A mathematical model which predicted the potential transient after a <b>step</b> <b>current</b> reduction was developed. A mechanism involving competitive adsorption between specifically adsorbed chloride ions and oxygen, similar to that proposed by Kolotyrkin (1) and Uhlig and Bohni (2), was utilized in this investigation;A study of the pit and tunnel morphology was also used to study the potential driving force for repassivation. These observations gave evidence that nucleation induces the rapid passivation of small etch pits and the sidewalls of tunnels. A computer simulation which assumed that each pit and tunnel experienced the same potential driving force for repassivation was unable to predict the experimentally observed pit and tunnel morphology. Thus it was concluded that local potential changes accompanying pit nucleation are responsible for the rapid passivation that occurs. ftn (1) Ja. Kolotyrkin, J. Electrochem. Soc., 29, 363 (1989).
