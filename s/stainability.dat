50|$|This is {{necessary}} in order to obtain soft sections of the bone using the microtome. Every thin section cut can be processed like any other soft tissue of the body. Calcium ions found in the bones are responsible for its rigid posture, people suffering from diseases like osteomalacia and rickets have an unusually low amounts of calcium ions in their bones thereby rendering their bones flexible and most times unable to carry their body weight. There are two categories of decalcifying agents namely, chelating agents and acids. The acids are further divided into weak (picric, acetic and formic acid) and strong acids (nitric and hydrochloric acid). The acids make up a solution of calcium ions while the chelating agents take up the calcium ions. Most frequently used chelating agent is Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Acids have some effects on the <b>stainability</b> of the tissue.|$|E

This paper reports the results of an extended series of studies of histone and chromatin extracts from thymus glands exposed to antigen in vivo and in vitro. The antigen effect on A-S <b>stainability</b> is demonstrable not only in vitro but also in chromatin fibers representing a DNA histone complex.

40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies was to {{determine}} the effect of environmental pollution on pollen development. Pollen heteromorphism (the presence of pollen morphs differing in aperture number in one flower of a plant), pollen viability (<b>stainability)</b> and pollen grain size in European metallophytes from sect. Melanium Ging. (Viola L., Violaceae) were analyzed by SEM and histochemical staining. Plants’ tolerance to heavy metals is positively correlated with their pollen viability, which should be termed <b>stainability</b> as it depends on the staining method applied and is not correlated with pollen germination. Abortive pollen can be produced as an effect of heavy metals but also may result from hybridization, a very common phenomenon in pansies. Pollen <b>stainability</b> in hybrids can be high (even exceeding 70 %) or low (barely above 20 %), and stainable pollen grains can differ greatly in size (from very small to giant), indicating a cytological imbalance resulting from disturbed meiosis. The number of pollen apertures is an adaptive character in facultative metallophytes. Plants from a metallicolous population produced a wider range of aperture number (3, 4, 5) than plants from a non-metallicolous population, which developed only 4 - and 5 -aperturate pollen. Three-aperturate longer-lived pollen are favored in the harsh conditions of a metal-polluted environment...|$|E

40|$|Lantana camara is an {{important}} ornamental and landscape plant. Yet, it is a Category I invasive species that that can hybridize with the Florida native species Lantana depressa. Sterile cultivars are needed as a preventive measure to control the invasiveness of L. camara. This study sought to identify the primary biological factors controlling L. camara?s male and female fertility, to assess L. camara?s hybridization potential with L. depressa, and to develop new sterile L. camara cultivars. Male fertility was assessed based on pollen <b>stainability.</b> Pollen <b>stainability</b> varied from 1. 8 % to 81. 1 % among 32 L. camara cultivars. Ploidy level {{was found to be}} the most important factor determining L. camara pollen <b>stainability.</b> On average, diploids exhibited the highest pollen <b>stainability,</b> followed by tetraploids, pentaploids, hexaploids, and triploids. L. camara cultivars differed considerably in fruit production, ranging from 0. 003 to 7. 173 fruit per peduncle. Ploidy level, unreduced female gamete (UFG) production, and apomixis played significant roles in determining the fruit production capacity of L. camara. Triploids not producing UFGs and apomitic seed were most female-sterile. Ploidy and simple sequence repeat marker analyses showed that L. camara could form three types of female gametes and two types of male gametes and develop seed through fertilization or apomixis, leading to six modes of reproduction and resulting in six types of progeny [n + n, n + 0 (haploidization), 2 n + n (sexual polyploidization), 2 n + 0 (clonal seed), 4 n + n (sexual polyploidization), and 4 n + 0 (apomictic polyploidization) ]. UFG and apomictic seed production restored the female fertility of triploids in L. camara. The two traits were not observed in any of the five diploids but were present in three of the six tetraploids evaluated in this study. Pollen <b>stainability</b> of L. camara was the most important factor determining the potential of L. camara as a male parent to hybridize with L. depressa. Diploid L. camara cultivars were the most compatible with L. depressa. Triploid L. camara with pollen <b>stainability</b> below 10 % showed little potential to cross-pollinate L. depressa. When L. camara was pollinated with L. depressa, ploidy level and mode of reproduction of L. camara were the primary factors determining fruit production. UFG-producing triploid L. camara was highly crossable as a female with L. depressa, whereas non-UFG-producing triploid L. camara was the least crossable with L. depressa. Interploidy crosses made between diploid and tetraploid cultivars/breeding lines not carrying the UFG production and apomixis traits resulted in four triploids that showed high levels of male and female sterility, and performed and flowered well in southern, central, and northern Florida. These triploids have shown potential to be released as new sterile cultivars...|$|E

Heat-activated spores were germinated in a mixture of glucose and l-alanine. For studies of dipicolinic acid (DPA) release and increase in <b>stainability</b> and phase-darkening, germination levels were stabilized by the addition of 2 mm HgCl 2. Heat resistance was measured by conventional plating techniques and by a new microscopic method. The sequence (50 % completion time) of LB spore germination events was: loss of resistance to heat and to toxic chemicals (3. 0 min); DPA loss (4. 7 min); <b>stainability</b> and Klett-measured loss of turbidity (5. 5 min); phase-darkening (7. 0 min); and Beckman DU-measured loss of turbidity (7. 2 min). The time difference between 50 % completion of <b>stainability</b> and complete phase darkening was 1. 5 min, in excellent agreement with the microgermination time of 1. 49 min as determined by observation of spores darkening under phase optics.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} {{to reveal the}} {{relation}} between cell death and nuclear <b>stainability</b> by supravital staining with basic dyes observations have been made on the cells of bone marrow, peripheral blood and lymph node from anemic and non-anemic rabbit, rat, mouse and chicken, and thymus from young mouse. The cells were stained supravitally in blood serum, isotonic saline, calcium chloride and sucrose solutions with the dyes; brilliant cresyl blue (B. C. B), Nile blue (N. B.), neutral red (N. R.), Janus green (J. G.) and eosin (E.). The following results were obtained: 1. In the presence of blood serum all the living cell nuclei observed were not stained supravitally, except some mature erythroblasts and nucleated red cells. 2. In isotonic saline, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 solutions all the erythroid cell nuclei were stained deep by B. C. B., N. B., N. R., slightly by J. G. but not by E. In <b>stainability</b> the younger the cell is the deeper in its nuclear staining. The nuclei of other cell strains were not stained. 3. In isotonic sucrose the nuclei of mature granulocyte were also stained by B. C. B. and N. B. but not by other dyes. The nuclei of lymphoid cells and myeloid cells appeared pale without being stained by any dyes. The nuclei of erythroblasts in sucrose solution were stained deeper with B. C. B. and N. B. than those in isotonic saline. The differences between supravital <b>stainability</b> of the nuclei among the cells belonging to different strain and among those of the same strain but in different maturation stage and the nuclear staining after cell death have been discussed from the possible dissociation of DNA from histone. </p...|$|E
40|$|Uranyl acetate (UA) {{is known}} to have {{affinity}} for nucleic acids and-COOll groups. Experiments were performed to test the possible affinity of UA for free amino groups. For this purpose,-NH 2 blocking and deamination techniques (with dinitrofluorobenzene, nitrous acid and Chloramine T) were applied to form-aldehyde-fixed pancreas samples, after which the <b>stainability</b> of zymogen granules by UA was strongly reduced. It is concluded that free amino groups may also par-ticipate in the binding of UA in biologic specimens...|$|E
40|$|Hydrolysis of Viciafaba {{primary root}} meristems in 5 N HC 1 at 20 #{ 176 }C,followed by {{reaction}} with the Feulgen reagent, was investigated using microdensitonietry. Some differences in response were observed with prophase nuclei fixed in different solutions, {{but in general}} this type of hydrolysis leads to a plateau for <b>stainability.</b> After plateau hydrolysis most dye binding is completed within 15 mm. For 3 : 1 alcohol-acetic fixatives, fixation times be-tween 1 day and 13 weeks do not affect plateau <b>stainability</b> but shorter (hr) and longer (21 weeks) times give slightly lower values for dye content. Alcohol-acetic fixatives for {{short periods of time}} give the least variable results. A comparison of 5 N HC 1 hydrolysis at 20 #{ 176 }Cand 30 #{ 176 }Cshows that at the higher temperature the plateau is brief but not different in dye binding. However, the peak values for 1 N HC 1 hydrolysis at 60 #{ 176 }Care significantly lower by 20 %. The idea of hydrolyzing cells at room tempera-ture with 5 N HC 1, prior to Feulgen staining, is not new. It was originally proposed by Itikawa and Ogura (8) and analyzed qualitatively b...|$|E
