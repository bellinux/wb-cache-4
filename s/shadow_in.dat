40|$|Current {{commodity}} graphic {{cards are}} capable of generating real-time realistic <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> 3 D scenes. This is possible as they are highly optimized for vector computation due to their highly pipelined architecture. This speed comes at a power cost that is rarely considered. This study investigates the feasibility of generating <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> real-time but on mobile graphics cards.

5|$|Endtroducing..... is {{the debut}} studio album by American music {{producer}} DJ Shadow, released on September 16, 1996 by the British independent record label Mo' Wax Recordings. The album {{is known for}} being composed almost entirely of sampled content, most of which originated from various vinyl records obtained by DJ Shadow during trips to record shops. Endtroducing..... was produced by <b>Shadow</b> <b>in</b> the span of two years using minimal amounts of equipment, most notably the Akai MPC60 sampler. In creating the album's overall atmosphere, he strived to capture the downbeat nature of his previous releases for the Mo' Wax label. The album's content features both moody, slow-paced tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of DJ Shadow's early hip hop influences.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its <b>shadow</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and <b>Shadow</b> <b>in</b> a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E

Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping {{to find a way out}} of the room.|$|E

5|$|The main character, Gabriel Belmont (voiced by Robert Carlyle), is {{a member}} of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend {{innocent}} people against the supernatural creatures. Gabriel's wife Marie (Natascha McElhone) was brutally murdered by one of them, and her soul cannot leave as it is trapped in limbo. Because she is now neither alive nor dead, she realizes what is at stake and guides Gabriel to his destiny to save the world as he investigates the dark spell. He travels the destroyed land, meeting other characters, such as the oldest living member of his order, Zobek (Patrick Stewart, who additionally narrates the game).

5|$|Within {{the realm}} of tie-in {{speculative}} fiction, {{there was also an}} increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was a concerted effort to explore this in licensed Star Trek literature. In the , the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two 'male' and two 'female' species. Andrew J. Robinson's Garak novel, A Stitch in Time, suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack's 2014 novel, The Crimson <b>Shadow.</b> <b>In</b> the original series , created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.|$|E
