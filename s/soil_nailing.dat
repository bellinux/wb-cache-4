25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.|$|E
50|$|Since {{its first}} {{application}} using modern techniques in Versailles in 1972, <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> {{is now a}} well-established technique around the world. One of the first national guideline publications for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> was produced in Japan in 1987. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration issued guideline publications in 1996 and 2003.|$|E
50|$|The first {{application}} of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> was implemented in 1972 for a railroad widening project near Versailles, France. Soil nails {{were used to}} stabilize an 18 m high slope consisting of sandy soil. This method {{proved to be more}} cost-effective, {{while at the same time}} cut down the construction time when compared to other conventional support methods. Germany was the next country to investigate <b>soil</b> <b>nailing.</b> From 1975 to 1981 the University of Karlsruhe and the construction company Bauer collaborated to establish a research program. This program conducted full scale testing of experimental walls with different configurations and developed analysis procedures for use in design. The United States first used <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> in 1976 for the support of a 13.7 m deep foundation excavation in dense silty sands. <b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> was implemented in the expansion of The Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon. This retaining system was produced in approximately half the time at about 85% of the cost of conventional retaining systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} construction, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls have a decisive {{advantage}} over other alternatives. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls require a smaller right-of-way than ground anchor walls and have less environmental impact. Installation of <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls is relatively rapid and typically uses less materials and smaller construction equipment than ground anchor walls.|$|R
40|$|Observed {{performance}} of <b>soil</b> <b>nailed</b> walls in Korea {{based on a}} number of field measurements has been investigated. The investigation has covered interface shear stress development at the nail-soil interface from pull-out tests, lateral ground displacements, tensile force distributions in <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> and back-calculated interface shear stress distributions along <b>soil</b> <b>nails.</b> Insights into the <b>soil</b> <b>nailed</b> wall behaviour based on the shear transfer mechanism at the soil-nail interface and partial mobilisations of the interface shear strength are reported and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Initial design {{considerations}} include wall layout (wall height and length), <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> {{vertical and horizontal}} spacing, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> pattern on wall face, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> inclination, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> length and distribution, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> material and relevant ground properties. With all these variables {{in the mind of}} the design engineer the next step is to use simplified charts to preliminarily evaluate nail length and maximum nail force. Nail length, diameter and spacing typically control external and internal stability of the wall. These parameters can be adjusted during design until all external and internal stability requirements are met. After the initial design is completed, final design progresses where the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall has to be tested for external and internal failure modes, seismic considerations and aesthetic qualities. Drainage, frost penetration and external loads such as wind and hydrostatic forces also have to be determined and included in the final examination of the design. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls are not ideal in locations with highly plastic clay soils. Soils with high plasticity, a high liquid limit and low undrained shear strengths are at risk of long-term deformation (creep).|$|R
50|$|Four {{main points}} to be {{considered}} in determining if <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> would be an effective retention technique are as follows. First, the existing ground conditions should be examined. Next, the advantages and disadvantages for a soil nail wall should be assessed for the particular application being considered. Then other systems should be considered for the particular application. Finally, cost of the soil nail wall should be considered. Soil nail walls can be used for a variety of soil types and conditions. The most favorable conditions for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> are as follows: The soil should be able to stand unsupported one to two meters high for a minimum of two days when cut vertical or nearly vertical. Also all soil nails within a cross section should be located above the groundwater table. If the soil nails are not located above the groundwater table, the groundwater should not negatively affect the face of the excavation, the bond between the ground and the soil nail itself. Based upon these favorable conditions for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> stiff to hard fine-grained soils which include stiff to hard clays, clayey silts, silty clays, sandy clays, and sandy silts are preferred soils. Sand and gravels which are dense to very dense soils with some apparent cohesion also work well for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing.</b> Weathered rock is also acceptable as long as the rock is weathered evenly throughout (meaning no weakness planes). Finally, glacial soils work well for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Geotextiles {{can improve}} soil {{strength}} {{at a lower}} cost than conventional <b>soil</b> <b>nailing.</b> In addition, geotextiles allow planting on steep slopes, further securing the slope.|$|E
50|$|One great {{advantage}} of soil nail walls is their cost-effectiveness over other alternatives. When conventional <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> construction procedures are used, soil nail walls {{are much more}} economical than concrete gravity walls and similarly or more cost effective than ground anchor walls.|$|E

In this study, {{the feasibility of}} using GFRP <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> for slope stabilization is evaluated. The GFRP <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> system consists of a GFRP pipe installed by the double-grouting technique. Two field-scale pullout tests were performed at a slope site. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, strain gauges, linear variable displacement transformers (LVDTs), and a load cell were used to measure axial strain distributions and pullout force-displacement relationships during testing. The pullout test results of steel <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> at another slope site are also presented for comparison. It is proven that the load transfer mechanisms of GFRP and steel <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> have certain difference. Based on these test results, a simplified model using a hyperbolic shear stress-strain relationship was developed to describe the pullout performance of the GFRP <b>soil</b> <b>nail.</b> A parametric study was conducted using this model to study some factors affecting the pullout behavior of GFRP <b>soil</b> <b>nails,</b> including nail diameter, shear resistance of soil-grout interface, and ratio of interface shear coefficient to the Young's modulus of the nail.

40|$|Pullout {{resistance}} of a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> {{is a critical}} parameter in design and analysis for geotechnical engineers. Due {{to the complexity of}} field conditions, the pullout behaviour of cement grouted <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> in field is not well investigated. In this work, a number of field pullout tests of pressure grouted <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were conducted to estimate the pullout {{resistance of}} <b>soil</b> <b>nails.</b> The effective bond lengths of field <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were accurately controlled by a new grouting packer system. Typical field test results and the related comparison with typical laboratory test results reveal that the apparent coefficient of friction (ACF) decreases with the increase of overburden soil pressure when grouting pressure is constant, but increases almost linearly with the increase of grouting pressure when overburden pressure (soil depth) is unchanged. Water contents of soil samples at <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> surfaces show obvious reductions compared with the results of soil samples from drillholes. After <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were completely pulled out of the ground, surface conditions of the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> and surrounding <b>soil</b> were examined. It is found that the water content values of the soil at the soil/nail interfaces decrease substantially compared with those of soil samples extracted from drillholes. In addition, all <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> expand significantly in the diametrical direction after being pulled out of ground, indicating that the pressurized cement grout compacts the soil and penetrates into soil voids, leading to a corresponding shift of failure surface into surrounding soil mass significantly.

50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> {{evolved from}} the New Austrian {{tunnelling}} method, which is a system for underground excavations in rock.

50|$|A list of {{unfavorable}} {{or difficult}} soil conditions for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> can include dry, poorly graded cohesion-less soils, soils {{with a high}} groundwater table, soils with cobbles and boulders, soft to very soft fine-grained soils, highly corrosive soils, weathered rock with unfavorable weakness planes, and loess.

40|$|Experimental {{results of}} a series of {{laboratory}} pullout tests on a new screw <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> are presented. A review of the literature for the screw <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> as well as a comparison of its performance with other conventional types of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> is discussed. The present investigation also examines the fundamental interface mechanism and attempts to define the associated rupture zones in cohesionless material with the aid of thin vertical bands of coloured sand cast in a large distinctly fabricated pullout box. The philosophy behind the design and development of the new screw nail is briefly described first followed by presentation of the laboratory testing procedure and its instrumentation. The results of the testings indicate that the slip mechanism, which controls the pullout behaviour, is rather different to the conventional <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> and the resultant pullout capacity is higher when compared to this type <b>soil</b> <b>nails.</b> This effect is attributed to the geometry of the screw nail and the installation processes that result in the development of different soil stresses around the <b>soil</b> <b>nail.</b> In addition, the experimental pullout results demonstrate, contrary to the conventional <b>soil</b> <b>nail,</b> that the screw nail pullout capacity is dependent on the overburden pressure and that the failure planes extends out a certain radial distance from the soil-nail interface. From the test results, it is shown that the failure of the screw nail satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb failure condition, which is similar behaviour seen in the conventional <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> tests...|$|R

50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|E

In the pullout test, cement slurry was grouted into one predrilled borehole with a GFRP bar in a completely decomposed granite (CDG) soil mass, forming a cement-grouted GFRP bar <b>soil</b> <b>nail.</b> This GFRP bar <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> was pulled out from the CDG soil mass in laboratory to investigate the performance of the GFRP bar <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> during the pullout test process. Three loading cycles were applied to pull the GFRP bar <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> out. Compared with traditional electricity-based strain gauges,FBGsensing technique is a relative novel technology to geotechnical structures health monitoring and has a number of advantages including high accuracy, multiplexing, electromagnetic interference resistance, and good repeatability. In the current study, one fiber line had a series of FBG strain sensors with a sequence of initial wavelengths. This fiber line with five FBG strain sensors was adhered on the pregrooved GFRP bar before grouting and was used to measure the strain distribution along thisGFRPbar with cement grout during a pullout test. The mechanical behavior of theGFRPbar <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> is evaluated by using the measured strain results in the paper.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent earthquake-induced hazards, many {{countermeasures}} are developed to improve the stability of slopes, among which the <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> reinforcement is widely used. The behaviors of the cohesive soil slopes reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> during earthquake are investigated using centrifuge modeling tests; and the unreinforced slope is also investigated for comparison. The responses of the slope reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> are measured during the test, including the time-history curves of displacements and accelerations of the slope. On {{the basis of the}} responses of the slope reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> and the unreinforced slope by the comparison, the deformation rules and reinforcement mechanisms are discussed. The test results show that the nailing arrests a landslide that occurs in the unreinforced slope during earthquake. The displacement of the slope exhibits an evidently irreversible deformation accumulation that is dependent on the magnitude of seismic input amplitudes. The <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> reinforcement mechanism is analyzed based on the comparison of displacement distribution of the lateral sides of both slopes with introducing strain analysis of a soil element within the slope.

Some initial results from field pullout tests on <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> grouted under pressure have indicated that the grouting pressure contributes to the pullout resistance. Pressure grouting is a cost-effective method for increasing the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> pullout resistance, thus improving the performance of the nailed structure.

Results indicated that <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a loose fill slope caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the nail heads when a potential slide was being initiated.

40|$|An {{aspect of}} {{particular}} concern in the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall manual and construction guideline, Geotechnical Engineering Circular No. 7 on <b>Soil</b> <b>Nail</b> Walls, is the creep behavior of <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> systems in high-plasticity clays. This research is aimed {{to gain a better}} understanding of the long-term behavior of the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls in fine-grained soil with plasticity index more than 20. Experimental and numerical investigations are performed in this Ph. D. work in the context of a research project funded by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Field investigation consisted of pullout tests at the National Geotechnical Experimental Site (NGES) at Texas A&M University; and instrumentation, monitoring and testing at the actual <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall project. The tests at NGES-TAMU were focused on effect of load level on creep behavior of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> in a natural clay deposit with high plasticity. The tests were conducted on 10 existing anchors (installed in 1991), 16 new vertical <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> installed in this research, and 6 sacrificial <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> installed during the construction of an actual <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall. This wall corresponded to a new project of an excavation wall in an embankment fill, in which 9 permanent <b>soils</b> <b>nails</b> were instrumented with the aim of monitoring the long term behavior of the wall and performance of the nails in high plasticity clays. Complementary laboratory tests to learn about the creep behavior of clays involved in this research were performed at TAMU using the samples gathered from the field. The main goal of the numerical modeling was to calibrate the constitutive models using the information gathered from the laboratory and pullout tests; and also to simulate the long-term behavior of the actual <b>soil</b> <b>nail.</b> FLAC 3 D was adopted in this research. Monitoring the actual <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall and the numerical modeling results revealed that the maximum horizontal deformation of the wall due to the creep of the wall for one year after the construction is less than 10 % of the horizontal deformation of the wall soon after the construction. According to GEC# 7, the horizontal deformation of the wall after construction usually increases up to 15 % compared to the deformation observed soon after construction. As a results of this movement (i. e. due to the post-construction creep movement of the wall), additional tension load is developed in the nails. The maximum additional load in the nail one year after the construction is 50 % of the axial load in the nails at the end of the construction for the bottom third of the wall. Even with additional 50 % axial load, the axial load in the nails at the bottom third of the wall is less than 30 % of the maximum pullout capacity of the nails...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSoil nails {{are widely}} used in {{stabilizing}} and retaining the ground during constructions, with the high yield steel bar {{the most commonly used}} <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> material at present. The classical method of <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> construction is, however, not effective in soft clay as it is difficult to establish a good bond strength and global soil improvement. An innovative <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> installation method has been developed for the Airport link in Australia, which combines the applications of fracture grouting techniques and composite GFRP <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> to stabilize the ground soil as well as to compensate for the settlement of ground. Extensive laboratory and in-situ tests have been carried out to verify the mass soil properties methods and the performance of the Geonail system for the local and global stabilization of the soft ground...|$|R
