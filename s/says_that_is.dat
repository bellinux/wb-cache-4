5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

Sidney Allen <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> based on an {{interpolation}} in Priscian, and the vowel was actually long or short depending on the root, as for example rēgnum [...] from the root of rēx , but magnus [...] from the root of magis [...] [...] probably did not assimilate to [...] before [...] The cluster [...] arose by syncope, as for example tegmen [...] from tegimen.

2500|$|The Wizard is the {{national}} leader of Oz, thus it is fitting for him to symbolize the President(s) of the United States during the 19th century. Politicians {{have been known to}} have many faces; it is a must {{if they want to be}} able to be everything for everyone. The Great and Terrible Wizard of Oz agrees to meet with each traveler separately, allowing him to alter his appearance to best fit each character. When the gang returns having completed the Wizard's task, they discover that the Wizard is a fake and is actually just [...] "a common man" [...] who has made everyone believe he was powerful. The Scarecrow adds that he is a humbug, in which the Wizard gladly <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> he is exactly that. The Wizard made promises he could not keep, as did many 19th-century politicians. The Wizard later states: [...] "How can I help being a humbug… when all these people make me do things that everyone knows can't be done," [...] showing that he was able to deceive others because others were willing to be deceived.|$|E
50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, we should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God exists in the usual sense of the term, all we can safely <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> not nonexistent. We should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> wise, but we can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). We should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> One, but we can state <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R

2500|$|Anna (Elizabeth Lail) {{arrives at}} Rumplestiltskin's (Robert Carlyle) tower {{and talks to}} him about the {{disappearance}} of her parents. Rumplestiltskin offers to help if she puts the contents of a vial into the Apprentice's drink telling her that he is an evil man. Anna states that she will do [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to find out why her parents visited The Enchanted Forest and Rumplestiltskin comments that he loves when people say they will do whatever it takes. Anna goes to the man's house and after a brief conversation she has a chance to put the vial's contents into his tea but instead decides to throw them into the fire thinking that it is poison. Anna arrives back at Rumplestiltskin's tower and informs him that she gave the contents of the vial to the Apprentice. Mr. Gold <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> good because it is an antidote to a poison he was given yesterday. Anna, horrified by this, tells Rumplestiltskin the truth and says they must go back to the cottage. They look in Rumplestiltskin's crystal ball and see the man succumbing to the poison by turning into a mouse.|$|E
2500|$|Vamp Willow {{appears in}} the third season episodes [...] "The Wish" [...] and [...] "Doppelgangland". She is [...] and aggressive, the {{opposite}} of Willow's usual nature; her bad behavior so exaggerated {{that it does not}} instill fear into the viewer like other female vampires in the series, but indicates more about Willow's personality. Shocked upon seeing her alter ego in [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow states [...] "That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and [...] And I think I'm kinda gay!" [...] Angel is stopped by Buffy in telling the Scoobies that the vampire self carries many of the same attributes as the human self, at which Willow <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> nothing like her. Many Buffy fans saw this as a funny Easter egg when Willow revealed herself to actually be a lesbian in later seasons. As surprised as Willow is with Vamp Willow, she feels bound to her, and does not have the heart to allow Buffy to kill her. Both Willows make the observation that [...] "this world's no fun", before they send Vamp Willow back into the alternate dimension from which she came, whereupon she is staked and dies immediately.|$|E
2500|$|.....the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall boldly uphold {{economy in}} detail; {{and it is}} the mark ... of ... a chicken-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he shrinks from {{upholding}} economy in detail, when, because {{it is a question of}} only £2,000 or £3,000, he <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no matter. He is ridiculed, no doubt, for what is called saving candle-ends and cheese-parings. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration, or any consideration at all, in administrating the public purse. You would not like to have a housekeeper or steward who made her or his popularity with the tradesmen the measure of the payments that were to be delivered to them. In my opinion the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the trusted and confidential steward of the public. He is under a sacred obligation with regard to all that he consents to spend.... I am bound to say hardly ever in the six years that Sir Stafford Northcote has been in office have I heard him speak a resolute word on behalf of economy.|$|E

In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> a drum major for justice, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> a drum major for peace, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> a drum major for righteousness.
