In 1745, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek discovered independently that the electric charge from these machines could be stored in a Leyden jar, named after the city of Leiden in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky.

5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by <b>static</b> <b>electricity.</b> Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, <b>static</b> <b>electricity,</b> and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.|$|E

The research was conducted to enhance the students’ motivation with the Gasing learning in the ARCS learning strategy on the <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>electricity.</b> The specific objectives {{of this research was}} to describe effect of the gasing learning on the students' learning motivation. The research consisted of 3 cycles of Hopkin’s Classroom Action Research  Model. Each cycle consists of the plan, the action/the observation, and the reflective. The data of students learning motivation obtained by questionnaires and be analyzed with method of successive interval (MSI). The findings of the research are: (1) the result of questionnaire of ARCS motivation in cycle I was 3. 71, cycle II was 3, 80, and cycle III was 3, 99. These results indicate an increase in student learning motivation; (2) The completeness of students’ learning outcomes in cycle I was 68, 18 %, in cycle II was 90, 90 %, and in cycle III was 100 %. It can be concluded that the Gasing learning in ARCS strategy can enhances students’motivation on <b>static</b> and dinamic <b>electricity</b> in 9 th grade of Indonesian Junior High-School. The Gasing learning can be an alternative for the teachers to enhance students’ motivation in learning physics through the provision of comic media and calculations without formulas...|$|R
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPolygeneration {{energy systems}} (PES) have the {{potential}} to provide a flexible, high-efficiency, and low-emissions alternative for power generation and chemical synthesis from fossil fuels. This study aims to assess the economic value of fossil-fuel PES which rely on hydrogen as an intermediate product. Our analysis focuses on a representative PES configuration that uses coal as the primary energy input and produces electricity and fertilizer as end-products. We derive a series of propositions that assess the cost competitiveness of the modeled PES under both static and flexible operation modes. The result is a set of metrics that quantify the levelized cost of hydrogen, the unit profit-margin of PES, and the real-option values of ‘diversification’ and ‘flexibility’ embedded in PES. These metrics are subsequently applied to assess the economics of Hydrogen Energy California (HECA), a PES currently under development in California. Under our technical and economic assumptions, HECA’s levelized cost of hydrogen is estimated at 1. 373 $/kgh. The profitability of HECA as a static PES increases in the share of hydrogen converted to fertilizer rather than electricity. However, when configured as a flexible PES, HECA almost breaks even on a pre-tax basis. Diversification and flexibility are valuable for HECA when polygeneration is compared to <b>static</b> monogeneration of <b>electricity,</b> but these two real options have no value when comparing polygeneration to static monogeneration of fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|When I {{started the}} Graduate program in Math, Science and Technology Education, {{it was clear}} to me that I was {{responsible}} for knowing the basic content in Physics. I was a Physics major at Penn, graduating with honors, however that was 30 years ago. Since that time I had occasions to apply some of the Physics and Math that I had learned, however, it was very apparent to me that my knowledge base was not very accessible and that many new discoveries had been made. Therefore, I took it upon myself to slowly read a College level text, "Physics " by Cutnell and Johnson (2001). I was particularly impressed with the organization of the book. Each chapter showed the key physical concepts to be learned and how these related to prior concepts. All chapters stressed conceptual understanding, had model problems and realistic problem applications. That approach led to my making a connection with concept mapping. I tried to integrate some of the concept models from individual chapters into one comprehensive one for kinematics and dynamics (first quarter of the course). I was successful in developing an integrated concept map for <b>static</b> and current <b>electricity.</b> This subsequently led me to think about how a student's conception of a topic in Physics might be influenced by teaching. It would be interesting to study this. Subsequently, I discussed this idea with Dr. Lucia Guarino who said that there was a whole field of research called "Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) ".

40|$|Over {{one billion}} {{people live in}} poverty around the world. Access to modern energy sources such as {{electricity}} is considered important in social and economic development. A number of initiatives {{have been taken to}} improve the situation but one billion people still lack access to electricity around the world, most of whom live in rural and inaccessible areas. One proposed solution to improve electricity access in rural areas is minigrids based on renewable energy sources. Minigrids have been constructed {{in all parts of the}} world with various levels of success. A common challenge for the utility’s operating them has been to achieve the ability to cover their own expenses, leading to financial difficulties. Based on a systemic approach, this work investigates cost-recovery based on a dynamic understanding of the problem. By developing a system dynamics model the problem is analyzed conceptually through a causal loop diagram and mathematically through a stock and flow model. The stock and flow model is then used to investigate the effect different generation and distribution technologies have on cost-recovery. Through the application of the system dynamics model it is found that construction and planning time together with the cost per connection are both important factors for cost-recovery. When construction and planning times are too long, the utility is not able to handle changes in demand. With a reduced power availability, usage and number of users decrease, creating a negative loop driving down the income. Even though both construction and planning time and cost per connection are found to be important, the results implies that reducing connection cost can have a large impact on cost-recovery, given that the utility has the ability to handle changes in demand. The work also identifies a possible future area of research where system dynamics modeling is integrated with load modeling and assessments. This could reduce the issues of using a <b>static</b> relationship between <b>electricity</b> and power and thereby possibly yield new insights into the connection between electricity usage, generation source and cost-recovery...|$|R
