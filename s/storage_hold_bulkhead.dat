50|$|Santa Granda {{initially}} {{made for}} Shanghai, until the Number One <b>Hold's</b> <b>bulkhead</b> began to buckle. Then the Master put the ship about for Whampoa on the Pearl River Delta, arriving on 17 December. After the iron ore was unloaded, ship surveyors allowed the damaged Santa Granda {{to leave to}} make for Hong Kong for repairs. Christmas was spent in Hong Kong, with Drummond arguing against Jebshun representatives who wanted to postpone many of the repairs essential to make the ship safe. Drummond began engine and boiler repairs, and on 29 December the ship moved to drydock in Kowloon.|$|R

2500|$|On {{examination}} of the Prince of Wales after her encounter with the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser , three damaging hits were discovered which had caused {{a total of about}} 400 tons of water to enter the ship. One of these shells, fired from Bismarck, had penetrated the torpedo protection outer bulkhead in a region very close to an auxiliary machinery space causing local flooding within the SPS, while the inner, 1.5-inch ( [...] 2x19 mm) D-steel <b>holding</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> however, remained intact, as the German shell was a dud. The German shell would have actually exploded in the water if its fuse had worked properly, due to the depth to which the shell had to dive before striking the Prince of Wales under her armoured belt.|$|R
50|$|After {{the lessons}} learned during World War I, many capital ships were {{refitted}} with double, triple, or even quadruple torpedo bulkheads, as well as anti-torpedo bulges to {{the exterior of the}} hull. For example, the last US battleship designs during World War II had up to four torpedo bulkheads and a triple-bottom. The innermost bulkhead is commonly referred to as the <b>holding</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> and often this bulkhead would be manufactured from high tensile steel that could deform and absorb the pressure pulse from a torpedo hit without breaking. If the final bulkhead was at least 37 mm thick, it may also be referred to as an armored bulkhead, as it would be capable of stopping splinters and shells with low striking velocities.|$|R

50|$|Frequently, {{the main}} belt's armor plates were {{supplemented}} with a torpedo bulkhead spaced several meters behind the main belt, designed {{to maintain the}} ship's watertight integrity even if the main belt was penetrated. Furthermore, the outer spaces around the main belt in some designs were filled with storage tanks that could contain fuel oil, seawater, or fresh water. The liquids in these tanks absorb or scatter much of the explosive force of warheads and shells. In other designs, the outer spaces were left empty, allowing some the initial blast wave to dissipate, while the inner liquid layers then absorbed shrapnel and spread the shock wave out over a larger area. To deal with the leakage from the tanks and incoming seawater, an armored <b>holding</b> <b>bulkhead</b> prevented liquid from entering {{other parts of the}} ship. This multilayer design is featured in the cross-sectional drawings of Tirpitz and King George V.|$|R

500|$|The Shōkakus {{were the}} first Japanese {{carriers}} to incorporate a torpedo belt system. Based on model experiments that began in 1935, it consisted of a liquid-loaded [...] "sandwich" [...] of compartments outboard of the torpedo bulkhead. The experiments showed that a narrow liquid-loaded compartment was necessary to distribute {{the force of a}} torpedo or mine's detonation along the torpedo bulkhead by spreading it across the full width of the bulkhead and to stop the splinters created by the detonation. Outboard of this were two compartments intended to dissipate the force of the gases of the detonation, including the watertight compartment of the double bottom. The two innermost compartments were intended to be filled with fuel oil that would be replaced by water as it was consumed. The torpedo bulkhead itself consisted of an outer Ducol plate [...] thick that was riveted to a [...] plate. The IJN expected the torpedo bulkhead to be damaged in an attack and placed a thin <b>holding</b> <b>bulkhead</b> slightly inboard to prevent any leaks from reaching the ships' vitals.|$|R

40|$|Results from {{a series}} of eight test fires ranging in size from 2. 2 to 18. 8 MW {{conducted}} aboard the Coast Guard fire test ship Mayo Lykes at Mobile, Alabama are presented and discussed. Tests aboard the break-bulk type cargo ship consisted of heptane spray fires simulating engine room and galley fires, wood crib fires simulating cargo hold fires, and pool fires staged for comparison to land-based regulatory fire results. Primary instrumentation for the tests consisted of two pipe calorimeters that simulated a typical package shape for radioactive materials packages. The calorimeters were both located adjacent to the fires and {{on the opposite side of}} the cargo <b>hold</b> <b>bulkhead</b> nearest the fire. The calorimeters were constructed from 1. 5 m length sections of nominal 2 foot diameter schedule 60 steel pipe. Type K thermocouples were attached at 12 locations on the circumference and ends of the calorimeter. Fire heat fluxes to the calorimeter surfaces were estimated with the use of the Sandia SODDIT inverse heat conduction code. Experimental results from all types of tests are discussed, and some comparisons are made between the environments found on the ship and those found in land-based pool fire tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} order-quantity model {{considers the}} tradeoff between ordering cost and storage cost {{in choosing the}} quantity to use in replenishing item inventories. A larger order-quantity reduces ordering frequency, and, hence ordering cost/ month, but requires holding a larger average inventory, which increases <b>storage</b> (<b>holding)</b> cost/month. On the other hand, a smaller order-quantity reduces average inventory but requires more frequent ordering and higher ordering cost/month. The cost- minimizing order-quantity is called the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). This chapter builds intuition about the robustness of EOQ, which makes the model useful for management decision-making even if its inputs (parameters) are only known to be within a range of possible values. This chapter also provides intuition about choosing an inventory-management system, not just an EOQ...|$|R
