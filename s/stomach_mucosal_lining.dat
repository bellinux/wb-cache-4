5000|$|Treatment options {{have been}} controversial. Mild illness is often {{successfully}} treated with pain medication (usually NSAIDs) and supportive care. Dogs presenting with severe, systemic symptoms not responding to NSAID treatment require more intensive treatment. The Weimaraner and Irish Setter American Kennel Club (AKC) parent clubs advocate {{the use of}} immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, supplemented with antibiotics and antacids (to compensate for the decreased thickness of the <b>stomach's</b> <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining</b> {{as a result of}} the corticosteroids and to decrease the possibility of forming stomach ulcers). [...] More severe cases that are not recognized and treated early often require IV fluids, electrolytes, nutritional support, and significant nursing care to achieve successful results. AKC parent clubs have supported research into the genetic causes of HOD, and have reported fairly good success using this protocol, saving many puppies from unnecessary suffering, deformity, and death.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To study CT and MR {{findings}} in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 30 histopathologically confirmed cases of XGC. Seventeen patients underwent CECT and 13 underwent MRI. The following features were studied – wall thickness, intramural nodules, pericholecystic stranding, wall thickness, THAD, fat in gallbladder wall, cholelithiasis, infiltration, biliary dilatation, lymph nodes, complications. RESULTS: The {{majority of cases}} (22 / 30) showed discontinuous <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining.</b> Discontinuous <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining</b> was seen in all cases with wall thickness > 10 mm, 75 % of cases with wall thickness between 3 - 10 mm and none in normal wall thickness (p= 0. 03). Diffuse wall thickening was seen in 23 cases, focal thickening in 3 and polypoidal wall thickening in 2 cases. Polypoidal thickening was seen in gallbladder carcinoma. Intramural nodules were present in 87. 5 % of cases with discontinuous <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining.</b> Pericholecystic stranding was seen in 19, biliary dilatation in 12, liver infiltration in 13 and fat in 7 cases. Lymphadenopathy was seen in 1 case with gallbladder carcinoma. Four cases showed a signal drop in the intramural nodules on chemical shift MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuous <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining</b> is evident in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Diffuse wall thickening, intramural nodules, continuous or discontinuous <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining</b> and cholelithiasis may indicate XGC rather than gallbladder carcinoma. Based on correlation with pathophysiological findings, we conclude that discontinuous <b>mucosal</b> <b>lining</b> is not an unusual finding in cases of XGC. Advances in knowledge: Being aware of the radiological findings {{described in this article}} may be helpful in making preoperative radiological diagnosis of XGC. <b>Mucosal</b> <b>lining</b> may be continuous or discontinuous in XGC...|$|R

40|$|Lesion of the gastric mucosa is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} side effect of aspirin. Flavonoids with actions such as antioxidant, free radical scavenger and lipid peroxidant inhibitor can prevent mucosal lesion caused by aspirin. In this research effect of quercetin, as the most abundant flavonoid in human diet, was investigated on preventing ulcerogenic effect of aspirin or Acetyl Salisylic Acid(ASA). Eighteen male Wistar rats (220 - 330 gr) were randomly divided into 3 groups (6 in each group). In all groups consumption materials were adminstrated only once in acute form. First and second groups, as control groups, received ASA vehicle (1 ml, orally) and ASA suspension (300 mg/kg, 1 ml, orally) respectively. The third group had a pretreatment with quercetin (200 mg/kg) {{half an hour before}} consumption of 300 mg/kg ASA. After consumptiom the materials animals were kept 3 hours, after that stomach was removed and was assessed for macroscopic and microscopis <b>stomach</b> <b>mucosal</b> lesions. Our results showed that, oral adminstration of ASA (300 mg/kg) caused considerable <b>stomach</b> <b>mucosal</b> lesions (P< 0. 05) and pretreatment with quercetin decreased the lesions (P< 0. 05). Therefore quercetin can be effecttive in protecting stomach mucosa against ulcers caused by ASA. Although the mechanism of quercetin action is not known, it might be used for mucosal protection with further investigations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Toxicity of mucosa {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{concerns}} of radiotherapy (RT), when a target tumor is located near a <b>mucosal</b> <b>lined</b> organ. Energy of photon RT is transferred primarily by secondary electrons. If these secondary electrons could be removed in an internal cavity of <b>mucosal</b> <b>lined</b> organ, the mucosa will be spared without compromising the target tumor dose. The purpose of this study was to present a RT dose reduction in near target inner-surface (NTIS) of internal cavity, using Lorentz force of magnetic field. Materials and Methods: Tissue equivalent phantoms, composed with a cylinder shaped internal cavity, and adjacent a target tumor part, were developed. The phantoms were irradiated using 6 MV photon beam, with or without 0. 3 T of perpendicular magnetic field. Two experimental models were developed: single beam model (SBM) to analyze central axis dose distributions and multiple beam model (MBM) to simulate a clinical case of prostate cancer with rectum. RT dose of NTIS of internal cavity and target tumor area (TTA) were measured. Results: With magnetic field applied, bending effect of dose distribution was visualized. The depth dose distribution of SBM showed 28. 1 % dose reduction of NTIS and little difference in dose of TTA with magnetic field. In MBM, cross-sectional dose of NTIS was reduced by 33. 1 % with magnetic field, while TTA dose were the same, irrespective of magnetic field. Conclusion: RT dose of <b>mucosal</b> <b>lined</b> organ, located near treatment target, could be modulated by perpendicular magnetic field...|$|R
