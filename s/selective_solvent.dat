50|$|In all decaffeination processes, {{coffee is}} always {{decaffeinated}} in its green, unroasted state. The greatest {{challenge to the}} decaffeination process {{is to try to}} separate only the caffeine from the coffee beans while leaving the other chemicals such as sucrose, cellulose, proteins, citric acid, tartaric acid, and formic acid at their original concentrations. This is not an easy task considering coffee contains somewhere around 1,000 chemicals that contribute to the taste and aroma. Since caffeine is a polar, water-soluble substance, water is used in all forms of decaffeination. However, water alone is not the best solution for decaffeination because it is not a <b>selective</b> <b>solvent</b> and therefore removes other soluble substances, including sugars and proteins, as well as caffeine. Therefore, most decaffeination processes use a decaffeinating agent such as methylene chloride, activated charcoal, , or ethyl acetate. These agents help speed up the process and minimize the “washed-out” effects that water alone might have on the taste of decaffeinated coffee.|$|E

50|$|Hash oil is {{an extract}} that is formed when a solvent, {{commonly}} including; butane, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, hexane, or toluene, {{is used as}} to dissolve THC concentrations. The plant particulates are filtered out and then the solvent carrying the soluble resins is evaporated or purged under vacuum. The resultant oil may have a high THC content (depending on the parent material) and is used in various cannabis-based products or smoked or vaporized as a concentrate. Delta 9 THC (D9 THC) is strongly soluble in petroleum ether and less so in ethanol. Adding petroleum ether to the tincture will extract D9 THC, leaving water-soluble chemicals in the ethanol (certain cannabinoids, proteins, chlorophyll, etc.). Butane is a more <b>selective</b> <b>solvent</b> which typically carries lower amounts of undesired solubles, resulting in a more pure THC. Alcohol is less selective than butane, carrying other types of plant matter such as chlorophylls and lipids, resulting in a less pure hash oil, freezing the plant matter prior to making hash from alcohol can prevent some chlorophyll from being carried. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has also been used to extract hash, but special laboratory equipment is needed since CO2 only functions as a solvent under high pressure.|$|E
50|$|The unique {{self-assembly}} {{properties of}} star shaped polymers {{make them a}} promising field of research for use in applications such as drug delivery and multiphase processes such as separation of organic/inorganic materials. Generally, star-shaped polymers have higher critical micelle concentrations, and so lower aggregation numbers, than their analogous, similar molecular weight linear chains. The addition of functional groups to the arms of star-shaped polymers as well as <b>selective</b> <b>solvent</b> choice can affect their aggregation properties. Increasing the number of functional groups while retaining the same molecular weight decreases aggregation numbers. Miktoarm polymers {{have been shown to}} aggregate into particularly interesting supramolecular formations such as stars, segmented ribbons, and core-shell-corona micellar assemblies depending on their arms' solubility in solution, which can be affected by changes in temperature, pH, solvent, etc. These self-assembly properties have implications for solubility of the whole star polymers themselves and for other solutes in solution. For Miktoarm polymers, increasing the molecular weight of soluble chains increases the overall solubility of the star. Certain Miktoarm star-block polymers have been shown to stabilize water-organic solvent emulsions, while others have demonstrated the ability to increase the solubility of inorganic salts in organic solutions.|$|E

Morphology diagrams are constructed as functions of CP, CS 2, and/or ϵAS 2.

The mechanisms of aggregate transformation and the formation of stacked lamellar aggregates are discussed by analyzing variations of the average contact numbers of the A or B monomers with monomers and with molecules of the two types of solvent, as well as the mean square end-to-end distances of chains. It is found that the basic morphological sequence of spheres to rods to vesicles and the stacked lamellar aggregates result from competition between the interfacial energy and the chain conformational entropy.

Phase behavior and micellization kinetics of diblock copolymer surfactants in <b>selective</b> <b>solvents</b> influence many processes. We study the driving forces behind the self-assembly of a diblock copolymer AB, {{consisting of a}} solvent-philic block (B) and a solvent-phobic block (A), in <b>selective</b> <b>solvents</b> (S). We investigate this system using self-consistent field theory (SCFT), which is a coarse-grained, approximate theory with a proven track record for polymer mixtures. It discards the effects of fluctuations. Micellar transformations between spherical, cylindrical, and bilayer curvatures are tracked in the dilute regime. We determine thermodynamic and structural properties of these isolated aggregates such as the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the critical micelle temperature (CMT), the solvent penetration of the core, and the core radius of micellar morphologies {{within the context of}} SCFT. We also investigate the morphological variation from ordered phases, found in the concentrated regime, to isolated aggregates upon copolymer depletion. Depleting this blend of surfactant causes these stable structures to swell and ultimately unbind. The unbinding transition of the ordered phases is compared with the morphology transformations observed in the dilute regime. We also delineate two phase coexistence regions between ordered phases, and ordered phases and a solvent rich macrophase. Furthermore, we quantify the effective interactions between the aggregates themselves. Intriguingly, for spherical micelles, the free energy of BCC, and FCC phases can be described in terms of a single effective pair potential that depends on micellar aggregation number, however, this aggregation number changes significantly with the concentration and temperature. The kinetic barriers to association and dissociation of diblock copolymers in various <b>selective</b> <b>solvents</b> are calculated. We study the variation of these kinetic barriers for both block copolymers in small molecule solvents and block copolymers in a homopolymer matrix. The kinetic barriers are found to be very sensitive to temperature and surfactant concentration. They also become prohibitive except in a modest range of temperature near the CMT, or in sufficiently highly supersaturated or subsaturated solutions near the equilibrium CMC. The dependence of kinetic barriers upon the chain lengths and solvent quality is also studied...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the self-assembly behavior of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer, polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO), in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) /water and DMF/acetonitrile. In both cases water and acetonitrile are selective solvents for the PEO block. The degrees of polymerization of the PS and PEO blocks were 962 and 227 (PS 962 -b- PEO 227), respectively. Micelle morphologies of the block copolymer in both systems could be controlled by varying copolymer and <b>selective</b> <b>solvent</b> concentrations. With increasing the water concentration in the DMF/water or the acetonitrile concentration in the DMF/acetonitrile system, the micelle morphology observed in transmission electron microscopy changed from spheres to wormlike cylinders and then to vesicles. The morphological diagrams were constructed {{from the study of}} the micelle morphology changes in different copolymer concentrations and the critical micellization concentrations for both systems at different copolymer concentrations as determined by static light scattering experiments. In between the concentration regions of two neighboring pure micelle morphologies, mixed morphologies such as spheres with short cylinders or wormlike cylinders with vesicles could be found. Although the trend in morphological changes was identical in these two systems, there were remarkable differences in the morphological diagrams of PS 962 -b- PEO 227 with respect to the percentage of <b>selective</b> <b>solvent</b> added. This is due to the large difference between the polymer-selective solvent interaction parameters.
