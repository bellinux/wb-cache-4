25|$|It {{was known}} that ethnic Chinese people in Sarawak were pro-Allied, and so contact {{was made with}} the Ongs, the leading Chinese family in Kuching, who lived {{about a mile from}} the camp, {{to see if they could}} assist in {{providing}} parts. The first night-time attempt, by G. W. Pringle, was a failure as he could not find his way through the dense jungle to the house. A reconnoitre mission was required. To achieve this, Russell suggested to Dr Yamamoto that as the area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes (with the resultant risk of malaria, which would affect Japanese and prisoner alike), the jungle <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleared</b> and sprayed. Pringle took part on this working party and was able to plot his route. He subsequently made contact and Ong Tiang Swee, Kapitan China of Sarawak and the patriarch of the Ong family, agreed to help. Ong instructed his grandson, Kee Hui to help Pringle obtain the needed parts. This was at massive risk to the family's own safety as they too would have been executed if discovered. Their only condition was that they should be provided with the news gathered from the radio, in order to boost the morale of the Chinese community under occupation in Kuching. They provided some radio parts, the acquisition of which must have been a considerable task as all radio equipment had been confiscated by the Japanese.|$|E

2500|$|Dwelley {{strongly}} {{believed that}} a newspaper's editor should have and voice his opinion, and Dwelley's editorials often confronted local problems. Since 1929, for 40 years, Dwelley had been fighting the dust pollution of Superior Portland Cement Company. Dwelley claimed that in 1929â€”1930 of his editorship, he had to withstand pressure from executives of Superior Portland Cement who offered him [...] "help" [...] with editing the paper and insisted that his editorials <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleared</b> with the company's office prior to publication. The open confrontation about the dust pollution between Superior Portland Cement {{and the editor of}} Herald competitor in Concrete Skagit Valley News was a contributing factor in demise of this newspaper in 1916. Eventually, a community group led by Dwelley has successfully involved senator Lowell Peterson, conducted a dust emission study that proved pollution levels more than 10 times over acceptable levels, and eventually pushed for creation of Northwest Air Pollution Authority. Five days after the first meeting of the State Air Pollution Control Board, the plant operator made a decision to close down the plant completely.|$|E
2500|$|President Eisenhower's staff quickly {{selected}} Farmer as Herzog's replacement. Publicly, Farmer {{was portrayed}} as a political independent. He had few personal associations with management and his professional contacts were perceived as legal and contractual rather than ideological. But privately, Farmer was well known as a strong conservative, an avid proponent of states' rights, and an early and avid political backer of Eisenhower. By June 21, Farmer {{was reported to be}} Eisenhower's only choice as Herzog's replacement. However, Eisenhower also informed his cabinet that all agency appointments <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleared</b> with the Republican National Committee (RNC), which was known to be much more conservative on labor issues than the administration. The RNC {{went so far as to}} advocate that all Roosevelt and Truman administration appointees to the NLRB be fired, no matter how competent. Farmer's views of federal labor law were strongly conservative. Farmer thought the federal role in labor relations should be delegated to the states. [...] "...I favor as much decentralization as possible; and as much as possible should be done with the board's discretionary authority, which has some limits on it now, to cede to the states by agreement." [...] Farmer advocated wholesale re-examination of the major decision of the Herzog board, especially in those areas restricting employer freedom of speech, permitting bargaining during the contract, and giving unions preferential treatment in captive audience meetings. [...] Farmer was also a vigorous anti-communist, which further heightened his appeal as chairman. He believed that communists had infiltrated not only American labor unions but the staff of the NLRB itself (some at the highest levels of the Board), and that it was his duty to purge the NLRB of these individuals.|$|E
