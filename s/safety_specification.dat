40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the representation of <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> on the complexity of adding masking fault tolerance to programs—where, in the presence of faults, the program 1) recovers to states from where it satisfies its (safety and liveness) specification and 2) preserves its <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> during recovery. Specifically, we concentrate on two approaches for modeling the safety specifications: 1) the bad transition (BT) model, where safety is modeled as a set of bad transitions that should not be executed by the program, and 2) the bad pair (BP) model, where safety is modeled as a set of finite sequences consisting of at most two successive transitions. If the <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> is specified in the BT model, then it is known that the complexity of automatic addition of masking fault tolerance to high atomicity programs—where processes can read/write all program variables in an atomic step — is polynomial in the state space of the program. However, for the case where one uses the BP model to specify <b>safety</b> <b>specification,</b> we show that the problem of adding masking fault tolerance to high atomicity programs is NPcomplete. Therefore, we argue that automated synthesis of fault-tolerant programs is likely to be more successful if one focuses on problems where safety can be represented in the BT model.

40|$|Abstract—Scaling {{verification}} {{to large}} circuits requires {{some form of}} abstraction relative to the asserted property. We describe a safety analysis of finite-state systems that generalizes from counterexamples to the inductiveness of the <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> to inductive invariants. It thus abstracts the system’s state space relative to the property. The analysis either strengthens a <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> to be inductive or discovers a counterexample to its correctness. The analysis is easily made parallel. We provide experimental data showing how the analysis time decreases {{with the number of}} processes on several hard problems. I...|$|E

40|$|Late {{detection}} of {{new types of}} faults often results {{in the evolution of}} faulttolerance requirements while developers have already created design artifacts. Thus, the reuse of an existing design {{in the development of a}} fault-tolerant version thereof has the potential to reduce the overall development costs. Moreover, the automation of such a reuse yields a fault-tolerant design that is correct by construction, given that the existing design is correct. To facilitate such an automation, we present an approach, where we add three levels of faulttolerance, namely failsafe, nonmasking, and masking, to functional designs represented as state machines. Intuitively, failsafe fault-tolerance requires that <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> is met even in the presence of faults. In the presence of faults, nonmasking fault-tolerance guarantees recovery to states from where safety and liveness specifications are satisfied. Masking fault-tolerance stipulates that (i) recovery is provided to states from where safety and liveness specifications are met, and (ii) <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> is satisfied during such a recovery. Specifically, we present sound and complete deterministic algorithms for automated addition of (failsafe/nonmasking/masking) fault-tolerance to the functional design of concurrent programs. These polynomial-time algorithms are especially useful in model-driven development of fault-tolerant systems, where models are automatically checked and modified. We also discuss (1) the effect of distribution and <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> model on the complexity of adding fault-tolerance, and (2) the impact of the proposed algorithms on the addition of multitolerance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMost of {{the large}} scale state {{transition}} (also called discrete-event) systems are formed as parallel compositions of many small subsystems (modules). Control of modular and distributed discrete-event systems appears as an approach to handle computational complexity of synthesizing supervisory controllers for large scale systems. For both modular and distributed discrete-event systems sufficient and necessary conditions are derived for modular control synthesis to equal global control synthesis, while enforcing a <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> in an optimal way (the language of the controlled system is required to be the supremal one achievable by an admissible controller and included in a <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> language). The two cases of local (decomposable) and global (indecomposable) specifications are considered. The modular control synthesis has a much lower computational complexity than the corresponding global control synthesis for the respective sublanguages. The complexity is compared using explicit formulas...|$|E

40|$|Clickjacking is a {{powerful}} attack against modern web applications. While browser primitives like X-Frame-Options provide a rigorous defense for simple applica-tions, mashups such as social media widgets require se-cure user interaction while embedded in an untrusted web-page. Motivated by these application scenarios, the W 3 C UI <b>safety</b> <b>specification</b> proposes new browser primitives to provide a strong defense against clickjacking attacks on embedded widgets. We investigate whether these pro-posed primitives provide requisite security against click-jacking. We observe that UI security attacks such as click-jacking are fundamentally attacks on human perception. Revisiting clickjacking from a perceptual perspective, we develop five novel attacks that completely bypass the pro-posed UI <b>safety</b> <b>specification.</b> Our attacks are powerful with success rates ranging from 20 % to 99 %. However, they only scratch the surface of possible perceptual attacks on UI security. We discuss possible defenses against our perceptual attacks and find that most defenses either have an unacceptable usability cost or do not provide a com-prehensive defense. Finally, we posit {{that a number of}} attacks are possible with a more comprehensive study of human perception. ...|$|E

Input variables model both continuous and discrete control and disturbance parameters. We translate <b>safety</b> <b>specifications</b> into restrictions on the system’s reachable sets of states. Then, using analysis based on optimal control and game theory for automata and continuous dynamical systems, we derive Hamilton–Jacobi equations whose solutions describe the boundaries of reachable sets.

40|$|Contracts are an {{increasingly}} common method for coordinating exchange {{in the food}} industry. Contracts often include specifications for product attributes including food safety.

In this article, we use a principal-agent model in the context of adverse selection to examine how contracts that include traceability can be used to select against producers who cannot meet a processor's <b>safety</b> <b>specifications.</b> We find that the motivation to select against unsafe producers depends on the magnitude of the failure costs and the proportion of the failure costs allocated to producers. We also identify the conditions under which the processor selects against unsafe producers regardless of traceability. Our results are important to regulators and negotiators who want to support safe producers and deter unsafe producers. ...|$|R
