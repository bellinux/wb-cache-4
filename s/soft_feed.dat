40|$|By bone {{remodeling}} {{and changing}} of muscle volume, fish can adapt {{to changes in}} mechanical loads they are confronted with, including dietary changes such as prey hardness. This capability of a genotype to develop different phenotypes in response to varying environment is known as phenotypic plasticity. Differences in prey type being consumed might trigger such a phenotypic plasticity in fish. In European eel, two morphotypes exist: broadheads and narrowheads. Studies based on gut content have shown that broadheads consume larger and harder prey, such as fish, whereas narrowheads feed on smaller prey, such as benthic invertebrates. These studies, however, are performed on yellow eels with a minimum length of 30 cm, and only provide indirect evidence that head shape is affected by diet differences. Here, we performed a feeding experiment on glass eels that just swam up the European rivers to start feeding. These glass eels were captured and separated in three groups: one group was given hard feed requiring biting, the second group got <b>soft</b> <b>feed</b> that could be sucked in and the final group, which acted as a control group, was given a mixture of both. We found that hard feeders developed a broader general head width and postorbital region than soft feeders. This region {{is associated with the}} location of the jaw muscles, indicating that hard feeders develop larger muscles to cope with the harder prey. Hard feeders, however, also grew more slowly than soft feeders, suggesting that net energy uptake of hard feeders was lower as prey handling required more energy and time. Specimens of the control group, finally, developed intermediate head widths, implying that they are not fully adapted to feed on either hard or soft prey. In conclusion, this study provides the first direct evidence that diet influences the head shape of European eel...|$|E
40|$|The {{red drum}} (Sciaenops ocellatus) is {{important}} for recreational fishing and aquacultural production in Texas' coastal waters {{and elsewhere in the}} nearshore Gulf of Mexico and in subtemperate to subtropical areas of the western North Atlantic Ocean. I performed indoor-tank and outdoor-pond experiments, in conjunction with automa ted respirometry and ecophysiological modeling, to assess interacting effects of temperature, dissolved-oxygen concentration (DO) and feed energy density on survival, growth, metabolism, and other measures of juvenile red drum performance. The main objective was to test an energy/metabolism tradeoff hypothesis, which states that growth of fish exposed to high temperatures can be limited by available feed energy; whereas, growth of fish exposed to lower temperatures can be limited by their metabolic capacity to exploit available feed energy. Also, I examined the influence of DO on this relationship and evaluated the effects of cyclical regimes of temperature and DO on fish performance. Insights from laboratory-based feeding trials were incorporated in experiments conducted in hatchery ponds to assess effects of oxygen supplementation and dietary additives - nucleotides and prebiotics - on performance in a more natural setting. In examining these issues, various technologies were developed. These included a computer-based apparatus for autonomously inducing cyclical regimes of temperature and DO in experimental tanks {{over an extended period of}} time. Additionally, I developed a <b>soft</b> <b>feed</b> with low energy-density to simulate natural forage. Experimental results supported the principal research hypothesis: At high temperature and DO, ecophysiological performance of juvenile red drum was enhanced by feeding to satiation with a high-energy feed (15. 9 kJ/g) versus with a foragesimulating feed having lower energy density (4. 1 kJ/g). Cyclical regimes of temperature and DO - as imposed in my particular laboratory experiments -did not impart growth benefits; however, the potential for enhanced growth via an appropriate cyclical environmental regime remains intact. Results from outdoor-pond experiments were consistent with laboratory results; however, the strong positive effect of feed energy density overwhelmed potential effects of dietary additives or oxygen supplementation on growth...|$|E

40|$|The {{shells of}} many marine {{gastropods}} have ventrally directed serrations (serial projections) {{at the edge}} of the adult outer lip. These poorly studied projections arise as extensions either of external spiral cords or of interspaces between cords. This paper describes taxonomic, phylogenetic, architectural and functional aspects of serrations. Cord-associated serrations occur in cerithiids, strombids, the personid Distorsio anus, ocenebrine muricids and some cancellariids. Interspace-associated serrations are phylogenetically much more widespread, and occur in at least 16 family-level groups. The nature of serration may be taxonomically informative in some fissurellids, littorinids, strombids and costellariids, among other groups. Serrated outer lips occur only in gastropods in which the apex points more backward than upward, but the presence of serrations is not a necessary byproduct of the formation of spiral sculptural elements. In hard-bottom gastropods that do not flee from predators, pointed serrations may resist shear when the shell is clamped firmly to the substratum. The functions of serration in other gastropods are less clear, but likely involve defence against predators with <b>soft</b> <b>feeding</b> structures in some cases. © 2014 The Author 2014...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a system which breaks input speech into {{segments}} and identifies each new appearance of the same speaker with a consistent label. This task adds up to a topic detection system that makes use of key-word recognition to obtain suitable labels for an automatic indexing system project. Both the segments definition and the identification of the speaker for each segment are performed using an acoustic similarity measure. Our task is to separate and identify the different speakers who appear in a video-conference session without any prior knowledge of the speakers or their number. The first aim is to detect the time points where a speaker change takes place using a robust acoustic change detection (ACD) system. Afterwards, the regions defined by these time marks are labeled with the use of a clustering algorithm. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is the key element in the system, and is used in several ways as a measure to compare speech.

In the first technique, a novel parity check matrix for LDPC codes over GF(4) with the non-zero entries chosen to maximize the entropy is proposed, the parity check matrix {{is based on the}} binary parity check matrix used in the IEEE 802. 16 standard. The proposed code is proven to outperform the binary code used in the IEEE 802. 16 standard over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Stanford University Interim (SUI- 3) channel models. In the second technique, a high rate LDPC code is used in a concatenated coding structure as an outer code with a convolutional code as an inner code. The Convolutional codes are decode using two techniques bit-based maximum a posteriori probability (Log-MAP) decoder with its <b>soft</b> outputs <b>feed</b> into a binary LDPC decoder, and a symbol-based Log-MAP decoder with its <b>soft</b> outputs <b>feed</b> into a non-binary Galois Field LDPC decoder.

40|$|Two phenotypes {{are present}} within the European eel population: broad-heads and narrow-heads. The {{expression}} of these phenotypes {{has been linked}} to several factors, such as diet and differential growth. The exact factors causing this dimorphism, however, are still unknown. In this study, we performed a feeding experiment on glass eels from the moment they start to feed. Eels were either fed a hard diet, which required biting and spinning behavior, or a soft diet, which required suction feeding. We found that the hard feeders develop a broader head and a larger adductor mandibulae region than eels that were fed a soft diet, implying that the hard feeders are capable of larger bite forces. Next to this, soft feeders develop a sharper and narrower head, which could reduce hydrodynamic drag, allowing more rapid strikes towards their prey. Both phenotypes were found in a control group, which were given a combination of both diets. These phenotypes were, however, not as extreme as the hard or the <b>soft</b> <b>feeding</b> group, indicating that some specimens are more likely to consume hard prey and others soft prey, but that they do not selectively eat one of both diets. In conclusion, we found that diet is a major factor influencing head shape in European eel and this ability to specialize in feeding on hard or soft prey could decrease intra-specific competition in European eel populations...|$|R

Mature adults often synchronise their spawning, forming spawning towers or groups of up to 35 individuals which may persist for a week or more.
