40|$|An {{extensive}} body {{of empirical}} research evaluates corporate law {{in terms of}} its effect on <b>shareholder</b> wealth and, based on this effect, makes efficiency claims designed to influence regulatory policy. Central to these claims is the premise that the principal objective of the corporation is the maximization of <b>shareholder</b> wealth. By defining regulatory efficiency in terms of <b>shareholder</b> wealth, the literature relies on the <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm to equate <b>shareholder</b> value with firm value. This Article challenges both the positive and the normative foundations of the <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm. The Article demonstrates that existing legal doctrine does not require corporations to maximize <b>shareholder</b> wealth {{at the expense of other}} stakeholder interests. Although economic analysis offers a theoretical defense of <b>shareholder</b> primacy, its conclusions are based on strong and questionable assumptions about the market conditions in which the corporation operates. Finally, the Article explores and rejects the argument that <b>shareholder</b> primacy may be founded in existing limits on management fiduciary duties, offering an alterntive defense of those limits in terms of comparative institutional analysis. Justifying the evaluation of corporate performance in terms of <b>shareholder</b> wealth is critical to empirical claims of regulatory efficiency. The presence of other stakeholders, whose interests in the firm may be not reflected in an assessment of <b>shareholder</b> value, raises questions about efficiency analyses that do not incorporate those interests into their assessment of firm value. Alternative conceptions of firm value suggest that empirical scholars need to offer better and explicit justifications for their reliance on <b>shareholder</b> wealth and, more importantly, for their argument that <b>shareholder</b> wealth effects should dominate regulatory policy...|$|R
