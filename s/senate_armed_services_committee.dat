5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} draft law {{was scheduled}} to conclude {{at the end of}} June 1971, and the Senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the Vietnam War continued. The Nixon administration announced in February 1971 that it wanted a two-year extension to June 1973, after which the draft would end; Army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a two-year extension, after which an all-volunteer force would be in place. Skeptics such as <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> chairman John Stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a four-year extension, but the two-year proposal is what went forward in Congress. By early May 1971, Gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, halting conscription and thereby bringing U.S. involvement in the war to a rapid end.|$|E
5|$|The Army also {{conducted}} a weapons demonstration for the <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> in early 1972, {{to show off}} the Cheyenne's firepower and garner support for attack helicopter development. The first TOW missile that was fired in the demonstration failed and went into the ground. The second missile was fired and hit the target. Previously, 130 TOW missiles had been fired without failure, but the failure of the first missile was now linked to perception of the aircraft. In April 1972, the Senate published its report on CAS. The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited procurement of the Harrier for the Marine Corps. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue procurement of attack helicopters, so long as their survivability could be improved.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis evaluates {{the role of}} the House and <b>Senate</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committees,</b> the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and the Democratic Caucus in matters pertaining to strategic nuclear weapons programs. Three strategic programs are used as case studies to support this evaluation; the Trident submarine and missile, the B-l bomber, and the MX missile. By comparing each committees' funding recommendations to that approved by Congress as well as their success in blocking amendments which would affect such recommendations, it is apparent that the respective <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committees</b> dominate in strategic nuclear issues. This was found to be true when strategic nuclear programs were debated largely {{within the confines of the}} committees as well as when they reached the congressional agenda. The MX missile, however, was a significant exception as it resulted in a shift of power away from the House <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> and to the liberal arms control activists, via the forum of the Democratic Caucus. A detailed analysis of the MX case provides much useful information for strategic planners concerning the formulation of new strategic nuclear weapons programs, demonstrating the potential pitfalls and proposing ways to avoid these pitfalls; and if they can not be avoided, what could be the possible consequences.
