40|$|Maximizing {{irrigation}} efficiency is of enormous importance for irrigators in the Central Great Plains to conserve water and reduce pumping costs. High temperatures, frequently strong winds and low humidity increase the evaporation potential of water applied through sprinkler irrigation.

These systems have the potential to reduce evaporation losses as found by Schneider and Howell (1995). Schneider and Howell found that evaporation losses could be reduced by 2 - 3 % as compared to above canopy irrigation. Many producers and irrigation companies have promoted placing sprinklers within the canopy to conserve water by reducing the exposure of the irrigation water to wind. However, runoff losses can increase as the application rate exceeds the soil infiltration capacity with a reduced wetted diameter of the spray pattern within the canopy.

The velocity horizontal component increases with radial distance while the velocity vertical component decreases with radial distance. Additionally, landing angle of all droplet sizes decreases with radial distance. The kinetic energy is decomposed into vertical component and horizontal component due to the oblique angles of droplet impact on the surface soil, and this may aggravate soil erosion. Therefore the actual oblique angle of impact should be considered in actual field conditions and measures should be taken for remediation of soil erosion if necessary. ...|$|E

The change in irrigation system is resulting in reduced labour and increased irrigation efficiency and crop yield.

Many areas of Spain are characterized by strong winds, and therefore require specific design and management techniques. Such {{is the case of}} certain areas of the Ebro Valley de-pression, where yearly wind averages can exceed 3 m s− 1.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present study is {{analyzing}} the best position of a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>nozzle</b> in a tunnel cross-section in the Muskö tunnel, south of Stockholm, Sweden. Activation of the sprinklers installed along the centerline and along the sidewall is investigated through analysis of full scale experiments and by three dimensional numerical modelling. Then the tunnel velocity is analyzed by one dimensional numerical modelling for various fire locations in the Muskö tunnel. For both activating the automatic sprinklers nearby the fire and avoiding activation of the sprinklers further downstream, the automatic sprinklers are recommended to be installed along the centerline of the tunnel. It has also been found that the tunnel velocity varies significantly with the fire location. When the fire is {{on the left side of}} the tunnel, the flow velocity mostly remains in a range of 1 m/s (positive or negative) within the first 10 minutes, which helps early activation of the automatic sprinklers. When the fire is on the right side of the tunnel, the flow velocity mostly remains within a range of - 1 m/s and 1 m/s within the first 5 minutes, and the velocity mostly increases to 2 m/s at around 10 min. Therefore, the scenario for fire located on the left side is better than that for fire on the right side, especially when it is located between the middle of the right section and the right portal. As one typical case with fire on the right side, the tunnel velocity maintains at 1 m/s for the first 5 min and gradually increases to 2 m/s at 10 min. Under such conditions, the automatic sprinkler system is expected to perform well.   The research work presented in this report has been sponsored by Tunnel and Underground Safety Center (TUSC) with additional funding from STA (Trafikverket).  </p...|$|E

Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, border, or basin irrigation. About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied.

The gas phase of the reacting plume is described in the Eulerian frame while the discrete droplet phase is treated in the Lagrangian frame, with strong two-way coupling between the two phases through mass, momentum and energy exchange. Finite-rate chemistry is included and modelled by a scale similarity subgrid-scale model. The LES has six dynamically determined model constants, which minimizes constant tuning. A parametric study has been conducted by varying the initial Stokes number (St 0) or non-dimensional droplet size, mass loading ratio (MLR 0) and droplet velocity magnitude (|vd 0 |), independently. Droplets of three initial sizes (780 µm, 390 µm and 195 µm) have distinctively different dynamic interactions with the buoyant reacting plume. Increasing MLR 0 progressively from 0 to 9 increases the droplet effects, {{and in the case}} of the largest droplets used, the reaction is completely suppressed and the plume structure destroyed.

Detailed analysis of the budget equation for a non-dimensional gas temperature reveals roles played by the droplet-related terms in combustion suppression. The only “cooling” effect on gas temperature comes from the convective heat transfer between the phases, which drives droplet vaporisation, while there are three mechanisms (mechanical work done by droplet drag force, part of internal energy transfer into the gas phase due to evaporation and kinetic energy interactions between the phases) contributing to “warming” effects.

The irrigation uniformity below the canopy was estimated to be 2. 5 % greater than above the canopy, and canopy-intercepted water could account for 11 - 15 % of the total seasonal applied water. Evaluation showed that alfalfa leaf area index relies more heavily on farm water application uniformity than hay yield and crop height.

Although these far-field measurements are useful for evaluating the ultimate sprinkler performance, they are convoluted by the dispersion process and yield little useful information regarding the initial sprinkler discharge characteristics. With the development of advanced non-intrusive spray diagnostics, high fidelity initial spray measurements are possible, providing sprinkler discharge characteristics which are useful alone for nozzle development or together with analytical tools for prediction of suppression performance. In this study, a laser diagnostic technique based on Shadowgraphy was used to characterize the initial spray for actual fire <b>sprinklers</b> and <b>nozzles</b> having more basic configurations. The shadowgraphs revealed important information on the effect of nozzle geometry on sheet formation (from the injected jet) and sheet fragmentation into drops. Three breakup modes were observed depending on the injection conditions quantifie...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{familiar}} {{shape of the}} field from a bar magnet, the Sun's extended field is twisted into an arithmetic spiral by the magnetohydrodynamic influence of the solar wind. The solar wind travels outward from the Sun at a uniform rate, but an individual jet of solar wind from a particular feature on the Sun's surface rotates with the solar rotation, making a spiral pattern in space. Unlike the jet from a sprinkler, the solar wind {{is tied to the}} magnetic field by MHD effects, so that magnetic field lines are tied to the material in the jet and take on an arithmetic spiral shape.The cause of the ballerina spiral shape has sometimes been called the [...] "garden sprinkler effect" [...] or [...] "garden hose effect", because it is likened to a lawn <b>sprinkler</b> with <b>nozzle</b> that moves up and down while it spins. The stream of water represents the solar wind.|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] were {{performed in the}} Ebro Valley of Spain to {{provide the basis for}} the calibration and validation of a ballistic simulation model of sprinkler irrigation. The experiments included evaluations of isolated sprinklers and solid-sets. Two different <b>sprinklers,</b> two principal <b>nozzle</b> diameters and three operating pressures were considered in the experiments, which also covered the usual range of wind speeds in the study area. Model calibration served the objectives of predicting the Christiansen Coefficient of Uniformity (CU) and the water application pattern. The resulting standard error of CU estimation was 3. 09...|$|R
