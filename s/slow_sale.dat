2500|$|Accompanied with a line-up {{of other}} female vocalists coming {{from both sides}} of former Czechoslovakia, Tobias joined Horáček also on his next release Ohrožený druh (2008), which won the 18th Anděl's ceremony. This time around, she contributed with a Czech cover version of Tanita Tikaram's [...] "Twist in My Sobriety" [...] and [...] "Esik az eső, csendesen" [...] by Vyskočáni, sung partly in Hungarian. On November 24, Pod obojím (2008) was {{released}} through independent art company Studio DVA, involved exclusively in theatrical productions. Supported by such artist as Richard Müller, her third studio album was produced by Michal Hrubý. After its <b>slow</b> <b>sale,</b> the work was eventually certified Gold by the ČNS IFPI, reaching its peak on the local music chart at number #24. Besides, the chanteuse is more often referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Czech Chanson", becoming the successor of critically acclaimed Hana Hegerová, originally also from Slovakia. Her fourth chanson standards collection was titled Do vetra, and launched in December 2010. Apart from Lipovský-Vyskočáni both recognized as her regular tandem, for some of new lyrics also Horáček was credited.

60|$|To {{support the}} <b>slow</b> <b>sale</b> of ‘The Flora Londinensis,’ Mr. Curtis, about 1787, started ‘The Botanical Magazine,’ which {{became one of}} the popular {{periodicals}} of the day, and Dr. Smith’s and Mr. Sowerby’s ‘English Botany’ was modelled after it.|$|E
60|$|In 1841 {{the first}} series of Emerson's Essays was published, {{and three years}} later the second. The Poems were first {{collected}} in 1847, but the final version was not made until 1876. In 1847 Emerson paid his second visit to England, and delivered his lectures on Representative Men, collected and published in 1850. The books {{are said to have}} had a very <b>slow</b> <b>sale,</b> but the essays and lectures published in 1860, with the general title of The Conduct of Life, started with a sale of 2,500 copies, though that volume has never been considered by the Emersonian adept to contain most of the pure milk of the Word.|$|E

60|$|Vivian {{pulled up}} his horse as he ascended through the fine {{beechwood}} which leads {{immediately to the}} city of Frankfort from the Darmstadt road. The crowd seemed to increase every moment, but as they were all hastening the same way, his progress was not much impeded. It was Frankfort fair; and all countenances were expressive of that excitement which we always experience at great meetings of our fellow-creatures; whether the assemblies be for slaughter, pleasure, or profit, and whether or not we ourselves join in the banquet, the battle, or the fair. At {{the top of the hill}} is an old Roman tower, and from this point the flourishing city of Frankfort, with its picturesque Cathedral, its numerous villas, and beautiful gardens in the middle of the fertile valley of the Maine, burst upon Vivian's sight. On crossing the bridge over the river, the crowd became almost impassable, and it was with the greatest difficulty that Vivian steered his way through the old narrow winding streets, full of tall ancient houses, with heavy casements and notched gable ends. These structures did not, however, at the present moment, greet the traveller with their usual sombre and antique appearance: their outside walls were, in most instances, covered with pieces of broad cloth of the most showy colours, red, blue, and yellow predominating. These standards of trade were not merely used for the purpose of exhibiting the quality of the article sold in the interior, but also of informing the curious traveller the name and nation of their adventurous owners. Inscriptions in German, French, Russian, English, Italian, and even Hebrew, appeared in striking characters on each woollen specimen; and, as if these were not sufficient to attract the attention of the passenger, an active apprentice, or assistant, commented in eloquent terms on the peculiar fairness and honesty of his master. The public squares and other open spaces, and indeed every spot which was secure from the hurrying wheels of the heavy old-fashioned coaches of the Frankfort aristocracy and the spirited pawings of their sleek and long-tailed coach-horses, were covered with large and showy booths, which groaned under the accumulated treasures of all countries. French silks and French clocks rivalled Manchester cottons and Sheffield cutlery, and assisted to attract or entrap the gazer, in company with Venetian chains, Neapolitan coral, and Vienna pipe-heads: here was the booth of a great book-seller, who looked to the approaching Leipsic fair for some consolation for his <b>slow</b> <b>sale</b> and the bad taste of the people of Frankfort; and there was a dealer in Bologna sausages, who felt quite convinced that in some things the taste of the Frankfort public was by no means to be lightly spoken of. All was bustle, bargaining, and business: there were quarrels and conversation in all languages; and Vivian Grey, although he had no chance either of winning or losing money, was amused.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1891 Judge Hiram Bond and {{a younger}} brother Elmer Monroe Bond a New York City {{wholesale}} produce dealer {{were involved in a}} fruit packing business in Santa Clara, California. There had been wide price swings in the price of prunes depending on the time since last harvest. Judge Bond constructed warehouses, set up a bank Citizens Bank of Santa Clara and he bought New Park Estate formerly the property of James Pieronnet Pierce. A fruit industry association he helped found and headed California Cured Fruit Association negotiated prices which increased due to storage and <b>slow</b> <b>sale.</b> The business succeeded until a bumper crop in 1903 proved too much to store. While in Santa Clara Hiram Bond was a cofounder of the Garden City Athletic Club (a gym). He was {{also a member of the}} Saint Claire Club of San Jose, the Burlingame Country Club of Burlingame and the Pacific-Union Club in nearby San Francisco. At this time the Bonds also maintained a string of polo ponies among the Judge and his two sons playing at Coyote Point Park in San Mateo. At the time of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 Santa Clara's water towers were knocked down and the community was supplied from the Bond's reservoir. He maintained an Irish coachman Nace, a carriage and a limousine which was used by his wife after his death whose California chauffeurs license number was 226.|$|E

In addition, an acoustic version of the track was attached to her most recent studio set Ať se dobré děje, released to positive reviews on November 21, 2011. As support, promotional EP Vánoční koleda with two previously unreleased tracks, followed simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{examines}} {{the restructuring of}} state assets in markets deregulated by privatizations and investment liberalizations. We show that a net revenue maximizing government has a stronger incentive to restructure than a profit maximizing acquiring firm: A restructuring firm only takes into account how much its own profit will increase. The government internalizes that restructuring increases the sales price not only due {{to the increase in}} the acquirer's profit, but also due to a reduced profit for the non-acquirer, whose profits decrease due to its rival's restructuring. We also identify situations where a <b>slow</b> <b>sale</b> can significantly reduce the sales price because of strategic investment and product market effects. asset ownership; oligopoly; privatization; restructuring...|$|E
