50|$|In quantum computing, {{and more}} {{specifically}} in superconducting quantum computing, the phase qubit is a superconducting device based on the <b>superconductor-insulator-superconductor</b> (SIS) Josephson junction, designed to operate as a quantum bit, or qubit. The phase qubit is closely related, yet distinct from, the flux qubit and the charge qubit, which are also quantum bits implemented by superconducting devices.|$|E
50|$|The superconducting tunnel {{junction}} (STJ) — {{also known as}} a <b>superconductor-insulator-superconductor</b> {{tunnel junction}} (SIS) — is an electronic device consisting of two superconductors separated by a very thin layer of insulating material. Current passes through the junction via the process of quantum tunneling. The STJ is a type of Josephson junction, though not all the properties of the STJ are described by the Josephson effect.|$|E
50|$|The Josephson {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} of supercurrent—i.e. a current that flows indefinitely long without any voltage applied—across a device known as a Josephson junction (JJ), which consists of two superconductors coupled by a weak link. The weak link can consist of a thin insulating barrier (known as a <b>superconductor-insulator-superconductor</b> junction, or S-I-S), a short section of non-superconducting metal (S-N-S), or a physical constriction that weakens the superconductivity {{at the point of}} contact (S-s-S).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of long <b>Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor</b> Josephson tunnel junctions, a fluxon (aka Josephson vortex) is made of {{circulating}} supercurrents and has no normal core in the tunneling barrier. Supercurrents circulate just around the mathematical center of a fluxon, which is situated with the (insulating) Josephson barrier. Again, the magnetic flux created by circulating supercurrents is equal to a magnetic flux quantum [...] (or less, if the superconducting electrodes of the Josephson junction are thinner than [...] ).|$|E

50|$|The superconducting tunnel {{junction}} (STJ) {{consists of two}} pieces of superconducting material separated by a very thin (~nanometer) insulating layer. It {{is also known as}} a <b>superconductor-insulator-superconductor</b> {{tunnel junction}} (SIS), and it is a type a Josephson junction. Cooper pairs can tunnel across the insulating barrier, a phenomenon known as the Josephson effect. Quasiparticles can also tunnel across the barrier, although the quasiparticle current is suppressed for voltages less than twice the superconducting energy gap. A photon absorbed on one side of a STJ breaks Cooper pairs and creates quasiparticles. In the presence of an applied voltage across the junction, the quasiparticles tunnel across the junction, and the resulting tunneling current is proportional to the photon energy. The STJ can also be used as a heterodyne detector by exploiting the change in the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic that results from photon-assisted tunneling. STJs are the most sensitive heterodyne detectors available for the 100 GHz - 1 THz frequency range and are employed for astronomical observation at these frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|Abrikosov {{vortices}} (after Alexei Abrikosov) in superconductors {{are characterized}} by normal cores where the superconducting condensate is destroyed {{on a scale of}} the superconducting coherence length ξ (typically 5-100 nm) [...] The cores of Josephson vortices are more complex and depend on the physical nature of the barrier. In Superconductor-Normal Metal-Superconductor (SNS) Josephson junctions there exist measurable superconducting correlations induced in the N-barrier by proximity effect from the two neighbouring superconducting electrodes. Similarly to Abrikosov vortices in superconductors, Josephson vortices in SNS Josephson junctions {{are characterized by}} cores in which the correlations are suppressed by destructive quantum interference and the normal state is recovered. However, unlike Abrikosov cores, having a size ~ξ, the size of the Josephson ones is not defined by microscopic parameters only. Rather, it depends on supercurrents circulating in superconducting electrodes, applied magnetic field etc. In <b>Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor</b> (SIS) Josephson tunnel junctions the cores are not expected to have a specific spectral signature; they were not observed.|$|E
