5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, <b>sucking</b> <b>in</b> small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and <b>sucking</b> <b>in</b> the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinct}} {{shape of}} the skull shows that Deinocheirus had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs. The beak {{was similar to that}} of ducks, which indicates it may have likewise foraged in water, or browsed near the ground like some sauropods and hadrosaurs. The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison {{to the size of the}} skull, which indicates Deinocheirus had a weak bite force. The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft understorey or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in <b>sucking</b> <b>in</b> food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.|$|E

As the countdown approaches zero, Peter suddenly reveals his secret dislike of being in his children's presence, seconds before the world is expected to end. Then it is revealed that it is all an April Fools' joke, and Peter is left to attempt to win back his children's respect.|$|E
500|$|Since {{it is not}} a fast swimmer, {{the goblin}} shark may be an ambush predator. Its low-density flesh and large oily liver make it {{neutrally}} buoyant, allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection. Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic ligaments associated with the mandibular joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially [...] "catapult" [...] the jaws forward. At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) {{on the floor of the}} mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and <b>sucking</b> <b>in</b> water and prey.|$|E

500|$|As temnospondyls {{continued}} to flourish and diversify in the Late Permian (260.4 - 251.0 Mya), a major group called Stereospondyli became {{more dependent on}} life in the water. The vertebrae became weak, the limbs small, and the skull large and flat, with the eyes facing upwards. During the Triassic period, these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems, evolving {{in a range of}} both small and large forms. During the Early Triassic (251.0 - 245.0 Mya) one group of successful long-snouted fish-eaters, the trematosauroids, even adapted to a life in the sea, the only known batrachomorphs to do so {{with the exception of the}} modern crab-eating frog. Another group, the capitosauroids, included medium- and large-sized animals [...] in length, with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as Mastodonsaurus. These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators, catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and <b>sucking</b> <b>in</b> fish or other small animals.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} its unveiling, the {{painting}} received considerable press attention from photographers, cameramen, reporters, and art critics and lovers. The portrait divided critics, seen in a negative light by many. Michael Glover of The Independent [...] described it as [...] "catastrophic", and noted that it lacked context. When presented with Glover's comments on the BBC, the artist laughed them off, quipping [...] "can he draw?" [...] He noted that he believes in his work, and understands {{that there would be}} different points of view. Some critics believed that the shading below her eyes and her jawline aged her. Waldemar Januszczak of the Sunday Times described the portrait as [...] "disappointing", saying that it was [...] "pretty ordinary... He made her look older than she is and her eyes don't sparkle {{in the way that they}} do and there's something rather dour about the face." [...] Robin Simon of the Daily Mail described it as [...] "rotten" [...] and said it is fortunate that Catherine looks nothing like it in real life. Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, compared the depiction of Kate to a character in the Twilight franchise, saying, [...] "The first thing that strikes you about Middleton's visage as it looms from the sepulchral gloom of her first official portrait is the dead eyes: a vampiric, malevolent glare beneath heavy lids. Then there's the mouth: a tightly pursed, mean little lip-clench (she is, presumably, <b>sucking</b> <b>in</b> her fangs). And God knows what is going on with the washed-out cheeks: she appears to be nurturing a gobbet of gum in her lower right cheek. The hair is dull and lifeless; the glimpse of earring simply lifts her to the status of Sloaney, rather than merely proletarian, undead." ...|$|E
