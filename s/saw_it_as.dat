5|$|About a {{week before}} the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a {{photograph}} of a dress she planned to wear to the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> white with gold lace, while others <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E
5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an {{obstacle}} to a Soviet takeover of Poland. Consequently, {{over the course of}} the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, as he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
60|$|For no very {{apparent}} reason a little flush of colour crept into Jacinta's face, and Macallister, who <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> chuckled <b>as</b> {{he took out}} another sketch.|$|R
60|$|The young lady, {{who also}} <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> blushed <b>as</b> red as fire, and thereupon {{delivered}} a courtesy to poor Barnaby, with a most sweet and gracious affability.|$|R
60|$|Turnbull saw the stare of consternation in his enemy's {{face and}} swung round to share its cause. When he <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> cool <b>as</b> he was, he {{staggered}} back.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though all}} {{military}} activities ceased by 6 August 1933, exaggerated stories of atrocities {{committed by the}} Assyrians at Dirabun and the persistent anti-Christian propaganda and rumours insisted that the Christians were planning to blow bridges up and to poison drinking water in major Iraqi cities. According to some historians, the agitation against the Assyrians was also encouraged by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's Arab nationalist government, which <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a distraction to the continuous Shiite revolt {{in the southern part}} of the country.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a refuge for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|Hall {{initially}} {{sought to}} appeal to the State Council of the LCL. Although the body had no binding authority over the parliamentary caucus, which chose the leader, Hall and his followers <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity for a media victory. The motion went narrowly against Hall, but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for the conservatives.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} is currently part of Conwy County Borough. However, it historically formed an exclave of Caernarfonshire assumed by the surrounding Denbighshire in 1923; subsequent local government reorganisation <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> administered <b>as</b> part of Clwyd (1974-1996).|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} Peter {{established}} the Synod, he also issued the Spiritual Order, mentioned above. One key {{aspect of this}} edict was that it disregarded or denied the divinity {{of the church and}} <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> primarily <b>as</b> a state institution.|$|R
60|$|In {{the glare}} of the fires they saw a huge bulk topping the barrier. They saw the {{palisade}} belly and sway inward. They <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> burst <b>as</b> though built of straws, and an instant later Tantor, the elephant, thundered down upon them.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the region}} was given the name Uttaranchal by the Bharatiya Janata Party led central {{government}} and Uttar Pradesh state government when they started {{a new round of}} state reorganisation in 1998. Chosen for its allegedly less separatist connotations, the name change generated enormous controversy among many activists for a separate state who <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a political act. The name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region, even while Uttaranchal was promulgated through official usage.|$|E
5|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were {{relatively}} positive. Many critics <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a step-up in quality {{from the first}} season and praised the darker approach to storytelling. In the United States, the two-hour season premiere achieved a viewership of 4.46 million. The episode garnered a Nielsen rating of 1.5 in the 18–49 demographic, down from the season finale.|$|E
5|$|The Bororo {{people of}} Mato Grosso in central Brazil {{regarded}} the constellation as a land tortoise Geriguigui, while the Tucano {{people of the}} northwestern Amazon region <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an egret. To the Tupi people of São Luís Island in Brazil, Corvus might {{have been seen as}} a grill or barbecue—seychouioura, on which fish were grilled. The depiction could have also referred to the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} European explorers of Michigan <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> mostly <b>as</b> a {{place to}} control the fur trade. Small military forces, Jesuit missions to Native American tribes, and isolated settlements of trappers and traders accounted {{for most of the}} inhabitants of what would become Michigan.|$|R
60|$|There was {{the brute}} within twelve feet of me, {{and what is}} more, <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> me <b>as</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> and stopped, still holding the ox by the throat.|$|R

5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked a tenuous {{border between the}} American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war because they <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an {{opportunity}} to halt the expansion of the American colonies and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E
50|$|In the Second World War <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> service <b>as</b> a {{makeshift}} hospital.|$|R
60|$|Rilla {{had risen}} to take Irene's chilly finger-tips and now, as she sat down again, she saw {{something}} that temporarily stunned her. Irene <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> too, <b>as</b> she sat down, and a little amused, impertinent smile appeared on her lips and hovered there {{during the rest of}} the interview.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you're all right," [...] said Fisher, {{holding out}} his hand {{with an air of}} huge relief. [...] "I was pretty sure you wouldn't really do it; you had a fright when you <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> done, <b>as</b> was only natural. Like a bad dream come true, wasn't it?" ...|$|R
5|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} {{the family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where they bought a house. Himmler also later {{obtained}} a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. The relationship was strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|At the time, digital {{distribution}} was gaining popularity. The two <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{an opportunity to}} create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would require them to first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies. Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees. The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game Flow—a component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming PlayStation Network distribution system, and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles.|$|E

60|$|At once {{he turned}} his head. The gloomy, clouded dawn from behind the {{mountains}} showed him on the smooth waters the upper corner of the sail, a dark wet triangle of canvas waving slightly to and fro. He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> vanish, <b>as</b> if jerked under, and then struck out for the shore.|$|R
60|$|There, not thirty yards away, was the {{drawbridge}} of {{the slave}} camp, and he thought that he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> tremble, <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> was about to fall. At his side were Otter and Juanna, and towards him, his hideous face red with blood, rushed the great Portugee, sabre aloft, and screaming imprecations.|$|R
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Void was {{produced}} under Fidélité Films, with 70% {{of the budget}} invested by Wild Bunch. French co-producers included Noé's company Les Cinémas de la Zone and the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie. It received pre-sales investment from Canal+ and funding from Eurimages. Additional co-production support was provided by Essential Filmproduktion of Germany and BIM Distribuzione of Italy. The total budget was 12.38 million euro. In retrospect, Noé called Irréversible a bank robbery, a film made in order to finance Enter the Void. He also <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a helpful technical exercise.|$|E
50|$|MAP-ML {{opposed the}} Esquipulas Peace Agreement, which <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> an imperialist scheme by the United States.|$|R
50|$|The major {{second was}} {{historically}} {{considered one of}} the most dissonant intervals of the diatonic scale, although much 20th-century music <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> reimagined <b>as</b> a consonance. <b>It</b> is common in many different musical systems, including Arabic music, Turkish music and music of the Balkans, among others. It occurs in both diatonic and pentatonic scales.|$|R
60|$|As he {{came near}} the little market-place he bethought {{himself of the}} Christmas-tree candles. He {{did not intend to}} trouble himself. And yet, when he glanced in passing into the sweet-shop window, and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> bare <b>as</b> a board, the very fact that he {{probably}} could not buy the things made him hesitate, and try.|$|R
