40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis research were two-fold: (1) to evaluate performance and improvement of basic construction equipment operating skills acquired through a virtual training system, and (2) to analyze transfer of these skills between two slightly different control configurations. These objectives were achieved by {{conducting research on}} a <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Excavator</b> Personal Simulator. This simulator features two different control configurations: the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> and the backhoe loader control configurations. The configurations differ in that functions assigned to a right joystick (e. g. stick) and those assigned to a left joystick (e. g. boom) for one configuration are switched for the other. ^ Sixty participants were equally divided into four conditions which consisted of a practice and a transfer session. Two groups performed both transfer and practice sessions using the same control configuration (either the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> or the backhoe loader). The other two groups practiced with one control configuration (either the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> or the backhoe loader) and switched to the alternative control configuration (either the backhoe loader or the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator)</b> to perform the transfer session. In each session, participants performed 50 trials {{in which they were}} to complete various simple tasks, such as raising the boom. ^ The study showed that the simulator can be a valuable tool for learning basic construction equipment operating skills. Time to complete the task decreased across trials in the first session for both the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> and the backhoe loader control configurations, indicating skill acquisition and improvement in performance. Additionally, skill transfer was observed between the two different control configurations, with a cost of switching control configurations in the transfer session evident mainly in the first couple of trials. However, groups who practiced with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> control configuration showed better transfer performance than those who practiced with the backhoe loader control configuration. Although the switch in control configuration mostly affected performance of the functions that switched hands, it had a small cost on performance of the other functions. The results provided sufficient evidence to conclude that the switch in control configuration affected transfer session performance in general, even though the costs were not large. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Excavators can {{be divided}} into two categories: <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> and {{mechanical}} excavator. Due to the flexibility and mobility, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> has almost replaced the mechanical excavator. But there still exists some problems such as hydraulic leaks and high costs of manufacturing and maintaining. On the other hand, the latter one is the excavator of choice in oil sands digging and surface mining for its durability, high productivity and low ownership costs resulting from long economic operating life, but lacks flexibility due to the structural limitations. This paper introduces an innovative design of mechanical excavator with controllable mechanism based on functional analysis of the traditional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator.</b> The solving model in the form of Function-Effect-Technical Action Process-Executive Action-Mechanism (F-E-P-A-M) is used.
