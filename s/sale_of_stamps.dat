In some cases, when demand greatly exceeds supply, their commercial value on this specific market may become enormously greater than face value, even after use.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known date {{of delivery}} to postmasters of stamps of the Trans-Mississippi Issue is June 15, 1898. The assigned first day of issue was June 17. There had been considerable pre-issue publicity regarding the series, which resulted in an early rush on the initial limited supplies available at post offices. But such interest was short-lived, especially as post offices replenished their stocks, the novelty of the new stamps wore off, and speculative interest waned. [...] On December 31, 1898, the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>stamps</b> to postmasters was discontinued. Afterward, an unknown quantity of unsold stamps were destroyed.|$|E

50|$|In {{light of}} a price war, and higher prices where the stamps were sold, {{consumers}} prices were rising to cover costs - and as inflation was high, {{the value of the}} stamps was going down. On the High Street the main suppliers of Green Shield stamps became the filling stations. Aimed at company drivers, who didn't care about the cost of fuel, competing stations began to offer double, triple, quadruple and even greater multiples of stamps. As sales slowed and other retailers abandoned the scheme, Green Shield Stamp catalogue shops began to offer part stamp-redemption and part cash for the goods in their catalogue. The proportion of cash accepted was slowly increased until the goods could be purchased, outright, without the need for any stamps. With this groundwork laid, the catalogue stores, warehouses and vehicle fleet were re-branded Argos in July 1973. The company suspended <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>stamps</b> in 1983, then had a short revival in 1987 involving 2,500 shops, finally ceasing in 1991.|$|E
50|$|In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissoned {{artists and}} illustrators to create 30 stamps which were {{released}} in batches of 10 during 2009 to 2011. The choice of 30 stamps {{for the issue}} symbolises {{the fact that the}} Games take place during the 30th Olympiad. Each stamp featured an Olympic or Paralympic sport and in addition carried the London 2012 logo. The Royal Mail had initially proposed that photographs be included as well but this was abandoned as the photos would have to be of dead people as the only living person allowed to feature on stamps in the United Kingdom is the Queen. Stamps with an Olympic theme go back to the very first games in Athens in 1890 when the organisers commissioned the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>stamps</b> in order to balance the books and construct the last four venues. When London first held the Games in 1908 no stamps were commissioned. That occasion and 1912 are the only times when stamps were not issued. When London last held the Games in 1948, just four stamps were issued. On 22 July 2011, the last of the 30 stamps were released.|$|E
