5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Vesper {{travel to}} Venice. M calls Bond {{and tells him}} the money was never deposited. Realising Vesper has stolen it, Bond pursues her and her clients into a {{building}}. The building is damaged in the struggle and begins to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the Grand Canal, with Vesper trapped inside. Bond kills Vesper's clients and attempts to save her, but she refuses his attempts and drowns. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings {{his body to}} the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. Back at Radiant Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora.|$|E
5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the star's interior in just {{a small fraction of}} the star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time. The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner {{in his capacity as}} the book's illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to {{serve as the basis for}} illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.|$|E

5|$|On Earth, thorium is {{much more}} abundant: with an {{abundance}} of 8.1parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust, {{it is one of the}} most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1ppm). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the core; it is classified as a lithophile. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the elements as the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> a depression.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The Portuguese that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once they fled the country, the national economy began to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> depression.|$|E

5|$|Sibu town {{is located}} near the Rajang delta at the {{confluence}} of Rajang and Igan rivers. Peat swamp forests and alluvial plains are particularly prevalent in the Sibu Division. The Sibu town is located on a deep peat soil. This has caused problems in infrastructure development because buildings and roads will slowly <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ground after its construction completion. The location of Sibu in lowland peat swamps have subjected it to frequent floods which was about 1 to 3 times per year. Therefore, Sibu Flood Mitigation project was started to relieve the area from the floods. The highest elevation in Sibu is a peak at Bukit Aup Jubilee Park measuring 59 m above sea level.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The fate {{of these}} puffs—in particular, whether they remain {{restricted}} to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2+ waves for propagation throughout the cell—is determined {{in large part}} by MAM dynamics. Although reuptake of Ca2+ by the ER (concomitant with its release) modulates the intensity of the puffs, thus insulating mitochondria to a certain degree from high Ca2+ exposure, the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2+ puffs by acting as a <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled.

The ability of mitochondria to serve as a Ca2+ sink is a result of the electrochemical gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation, which makes tunneling of the cation an exergonic process. Normally, mild calcium influx from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix causes transient depolarization that is corrected by pumping out protons.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} occurs when, {{because of}} the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.|$|E
