5000|$|To do this, {{signaling}} equipment [...] "steals" [...] the eighth bit of each channel on every sixth frame (see Super Frame and Extended Super Frame) and replaces it with <b>signaling</b> <b>information.</b> This {{means that the}} low-order bit on every sixth sample in every DS0 carried on the T1, in either direction, is replaced by <b>signaling</b> <b>information.</b> Simple PCM-encoded voice is not very sensitive to losing these data in a few of its lower-order bits, so it doesn't cause much degradation of voice quality; however, when carrying data, the difference is significant, reducing the available usable data rate by 12.5%. With full 64 kbit/s, a voice channel has a signal-to-noise ratio of 37 decibels (dB). At 56 kbit/s, a voice channel has a {{signal to noise ratio}} of 31 dB. As only every sixth least-significant bit is robbed, the signal to noise ratio will be somewhere between 31 and 37 dB. However, since individual T1 links are not in general synchronized to one another, a DS0 passing along several concatenated, unsynchronized, T1 spans may have its lower bit stolen in more than one frame, frequently making real-world performance closer to the lower-bound than the upper bound of signal-to-noise performance.|$|E
