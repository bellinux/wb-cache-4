40|$|Supply chain {{management}} {{has seen a}} wide application since the 1990 s in satisfying diversified customer demands. To remain competitive on a global scale, manufacturing companies greatly increased the scope of their outsourcing activities. Consequently, <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> has become a highly prioritized activity with major significance to companies. Previous studies of <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> show that there are commonly accepted <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. However, there are insufficient studies on the association between the manufacturer's criteria of <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> and why it wins orders from its customers.

This study explores the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> decision-making process within Malaysian manufacturing firms. Previous studies in <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> have focused on company performance and quality management. Preceding research in this field, offers evidence that the application of information technology tools, business intelligence tools and artificial intelligence tools can be beneficial to the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> decision-making process. In particular, the study explores the presence and usage of the information technology tools, business intelligence tools and artificial intelligence tools, to support the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> decision making process in Malaysian SME manufacturing companies. Data for this research has been collected from six cases located in Malaysia, and was lead through semi-structured interviews. The findings present online global marketplaces as a supplier sourcing method, unstructured evaluation methods and <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> process. Information technology supports the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> process by the usage of mobile applications and online communication tools to increase the speed of information exchange. Business intelligence presents tools developed in Malaysia, in alignment with the needs of Malaysian SME manufacturers. Artificial intelligence tools presented no usage or presence in these cases. Finally, this study uncovers the impact of Malaysian culture on the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> process and their supporting tools. Amongst the contributions are: an understanding of the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> process in the Malaysian SME manufacturing, shedding light on the supplier evaluation process, <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> criteria and <b>supplier</b> sourcing methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a distributed system with an innovative <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> approach within a mass customization (MC) environment. The aim is to help manufacturers to identify appropriate suppliers for the components, materials and services required within the procedure of product design and manufacture. To identify the barriers for the <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> issues, current researches regarding the issues of <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> and MC have been reviewed. Based on the findings, the new <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> approach has been developed. Within the global manufacturing environment, conventional way of appraising suppliers cannot enhance manufacturers' competitiveness advantage over their rivals. It is inevitable for manufacturers to identify appropriate competitive priorities for each of their potential market segments when designing products. Selecting appropriate suppliers is a fundamental issue to fulfill manufacturers' development strategy. The approach will enhance <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> efficiency and flexibility under the MC environment, enabling manufactures to avoid or minimize risks when external conditions change. The case study is limited to selecting suppliers of two components for an ink cartridge, however, the general approach is applicable to other type of products. The whole concept of this selection system is to provide a <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> approach for MC environment by utilizing the web-based technologies to deliver a means which enables geographically dispersed functions making <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> more efficiently. Manufacturers can utilize this approach to evaluate and to find most appropriate suppliers based on various situations. The <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> approach focuses on the general <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> issues incorporating with product market position and development directions issues for MC, which provides a more dynamic and robust method to select and evaluate potential suppliers according to a range of conditions...|$|R

In contrast to conventional <b>supplier</b> <b>selection,</b> strategic <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> comprehensively considers various influencing factors, such as supplier quality and offered price, as well as company strategies, uncertain environments, and human factors. Using a detailed literature review, we investigate the employment of human preference in <b>supplier</b> <b>selection,</b> including preference representation, modeling, and computation. To achieve successful strategic <b>supplier</b> <b>selection,</b> we propose a soft decision model involving multiple stakeholders and multiple perspectives. Founded on interval and hesitant fuzzy methodology, this novel model shows significant capabilities in handling ambiguous judgments of stakeholders and unbiased value preservation of conflicting opinions. The settings of this model guarantee that the selection process strictly conforms to the diverse strategies {{of the company and}} is applicable for a flexible number of stakeholders. We also provide numerical illustrations via a case study. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform theoretical decision modeling using interval and hesitant fuzzy methodology for strategic <b>supplier</b> <b>selection.</b> In addition, the proposed research framework and systematic investigations on preference elicitation theoretically facilitate knowledge accumulation and necessarily supplement previous studies on strategic <b>supplier</b> <b>selection</b> by providing research trends.
