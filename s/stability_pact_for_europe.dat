40|$|This paper shows that, in a multi-country {{framework}} {{with government}} deficit spillovers, designing institutions that reduce {{the budget deficit}} is an optimal response from a country’s individual point of view. However, at an aggregate level this non-cooperative behavior is counterproductive. The case in which countries cooperate {{in the design of}} their fiscal institutions is also studied and compared with the former scenario. The study provides a new approach for analyzing mechanisms, such as the <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe’s</b> monetary union, recently implemented with the aim of reducing the budget deficit. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper examines, from a {{geo-economic}} {{point of}} view, the relevance <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> and Italy of the Mediterranean and the Danubian-Balkan areas. After {{the analysis of}} the most critical aspects of the initiatives involving the above regions - that is, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> South-Eastern <b>Europe</b> - the focus is posed on the main analogies and differences of the two areas from both the geopolitical and geo-economic perspectives. Some key factors are regarded to {{play a crucial role in}} the de-velopment and internationalization of both regions: good governance, anti-corruption policy, “state and institutions building”, rule of law, etc. Addition-ally, some policy evaluations are suggested aimed at enhancing the interven-tion of the international community within the two areas. An assessment follows about the role, interests and perspectives of Italy in both areas, as well as its comparative advantages with respect to the other countries of the euro zone. From this respect, Italy may accomplish an important role of “bridge” between the two sides.
