25|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that SWB {{constructs}} are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to the wish {{to be held in}} high esteem. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers are also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers. Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E

40|$|Background: Mounting {{clinical}} and experimental {{evidence suggests that}} the shift of carcinomas towards a mesenchymal phenotype is a common paradigm for both resistance to therapy and tumor recurrence. However, the mesenchymalization of carcinomas has not yet entered clinical practice as a crucial diagnostic paradigm.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Emotional {{intelligence}} {{is a relatively}} new and growing area of behavioural research, which stimulated the imagination of the general public, the commercial world and the scientific community. Only a few studies have been done on the relationship between emotional intelligence and academic performance. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship of emotional intelligence, optimism, life satisfaction and self-efficacy, as well as the validity and reliability of these measures on a sample of university students. Further objectives included conceptualising emotional intelligence, optimism, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, wellbeing and academic performance and determining the validity and reliability of the 33 -item measurement of emotional intelligence (SEIS) for a sample of potential future employees in economical sciences professions. The results obtained from this study will help organisations determine the level of emotional intelligence and well-being of their future workforce, in order to implement certain interventions to improve it. A cross-sectional survey design was used for this study. A sample of 341 students was used for this study, but only 324 of the responses could be utilised. The participants (N = 324) were students within the field of economics. 1 17 Students were from the Vanderbijlpark Campus and 207 students were from the Potchefstroom Campus. The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale, Life Orientation Test Revised, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the General Perceived Self- Efficacy Scale were administered. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the statistical data. The results obtained from the SEIS proved this measuring instrument to be valid and reliable. By using the multiple linear regression analysis approach, a six dimensional factor structure for emotional intelligence among students emerged, which supported earlier conceptions in this regard. The results showed that Interpersonal factors consisted of Positive Affect, Emotions-Others, Happy Emotions, Emotions-Own, Non-Verbal Emotions and Emotional Control. Intrapersonal factors consisted of Self-Efficacy, Life Satisfaction and Optimism. Self-efficacy, Life satisfaction, Optimism, Pessimism, Positive Affect, Emotion-Others, Happy Emotions, Emotion-Own, Non-Verbal Emotions and Emotional Control, predict 16 % of the variance in Academic Performance. Significant predictors of Academic Performance are Life Satisfaction, Optimism, Pessimism and Emotions-Others. A second order factor analysis was done on the factors of the SEIS, LOT-R, GPSES, and the SWLS. Two factors were extracted explaining 50, 95 % of the variance. These factors were called Interpersonal Factors and Intrapersonal Factors. On the Intrapersonal Factor, the following factors loaded: Emotions-Others, Happy Emotions, Emotions-Own and Non-Verbal Emotions. Self-Efficacy, Life Satisfaction and Optimism, Positive Affect and Emotional Control loaded on the Interpersonal Factor. It is evident from the above that psychological well-being consisted out of two dimensions namely Interpersonal and Intrapersonal aspects. Positive Affect is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (large effect) to Optimism and Self-Efficacy and <b>significantly</b> positive <b>related</b> (medium effect) to Emotions-Others, Happy Emotions, Emotions-Own, Non-Verbal Emotions and Emotional Control. Emotions-Others is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (medium effect) to Happy Emotions, Emotions-Own and Self-Efficacy. Happy Emotions is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (medium effect) to Emotions-Own, Non-Verbal Emotions, Emotional Control, Optimism and Self-Efficacy. Emotions-Own is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (medium effect) to Non-verbal Emotions, Emotional Control, Optimism and Self-Efficacy. Non-verbal Emotions <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (medium effect) to Emotional Control and Self-Efficacy. Emotional Control <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (large effect) to Self-Efficacy and <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> (medium effect) to Optimism and Life Satisfaction.

2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{researchers have}} generally {{agreed on a}} five-factor model of personality. The five factors are extraversion (i.e. social, outgoing), agreeableness (i.e. trusting, helpful), neuroticism (i.e. worried, anxious), openness to experience (i.e. imaginative, creative), and conscientiousness (i.e. organized, careful). [...] Nature relatedness (overall) is <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. In addition, a subscale of nature relatedness (nature relatedness-experience) is negatively related with neuroticism. These authors describe the nature relatedness person {{as someone who is}} more adventurous, easy going, and gregarious. It may also be that highly nature related people are more environmental friendly because of the positive (albeit weak) relationship with conscientiousness. Evidence suggests that people vary in their subjective sense of connectedness with nature much like any of the five factors listed above. Supportive of these results, a recent study has found that environmental engagement (protecting the environment, electricity conservation and environmental values) is related to agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Another study found that nature connectedness accounted for (mediated) the relationship between openness and pro-environmental behaviours.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has explored the inherent role personality plays {{in regard to}} parenting. However, thus far, {{there has been an}} absence of literature with respect to the relationship between the Five Factor Model OCEAN personality dimensions and perceptions of parent behavior as outlined in the parent development theory (PDT). The {{purpose of this study is}} to build upon previous research by using the PDT and the OCEAN personality trait theory. The aim is to examine how OCEAN personality domains (i. e., openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism) relate to parental views regarding the value of positive parenting characteristics (i. e., bonding, discipline, education, general welfare and protection, responsivity, sensitivity) and negative parenting characteristics. In addition, demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnicity is considered to further inform the relationship between personality and perceptions of parenting behavior. ^ Findings reveal a significant positive relationship between most OCEAN personality characteristics and parent behavior importance perceptions. Notably, agreeableness had a significant positive correlation with all positive parenting characteristics, while extraversion and neuroticism did not <b>significantly</b> <b>relate</b> to any of the parenting characteristics except when parent gender was considered. Additionally, conscientiousness and openness were <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> to all positive parenting characteristics other than discipline. Furthermore, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> with the positive parenting index, while extraversion and neuroticism did not. Neuroticism was found to <b>significantly</b> <b>relate</b> to the negativity scale, and openness significantly negatively correlated with the negativity scale. Finally, gender and ethnicity were found to moderate the relationship between the PBIQ positive parenting index and the extraversion and openness OCEAN domains. Overall, these findings indicate a significant relationship between OCEAN personality domains and the importance of perceptions of parenting behaviors. The study serves to inform future research, as well as psychological practice in both clinical and school settings, in terms of relationships between personality factors and parenting perceptions. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between wellness and emotional intelligence in order to develop a structural model of psychological well-being. The following constructs were looked at, Optimism, Sense of Coherence, Life Satisfaction, Emotional Intelligence are all seen as good indicators of Psychological well-being. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. The participants (N= 324) were students within the field of economic science. The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Life Orientation Test Revised, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Orientation to Life scale were administered. Using a principal component analysis, a six-dimension factor structure for emotional intelligence among students emerged, explaining 45, 24 % of the variance. These factors were labelled positive affect, emotions-others, happy emotions, emotions-own, nonverbal emotions and emotional control. The most significant correlations found in this study was that Sense of Coherence is <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> to Emotions Management and Life Satisfaction and <b>significantly</b> positively <b>related</b> to Emotions-Own, Happy Emotions, Positive Affect and Optimism. Sense of Coherence was negatively related to Pessimism.
