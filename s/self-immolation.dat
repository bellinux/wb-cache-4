5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the <b>self-immolation</b> was staged {{by the government to}} justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the <b>self-immolation</b> participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an undeniable}} {{connection}} between nationalism and dead bodies. According to Katherine Verdery (1999) dead bodies have enjoyed political life since {{far back in}} time. Based on nearly seven months of fieldwork among Tibetans in Dharamsala, India, this thesis concerns the political life of dead bodies in an exile context. It describes and analyzes how <b>self‐immolations</b> (the act of setting oneself ablaze), {{a new form of}} protest, in Tibet, are understood and made meaningful among exiled Tibetans in Dharamsala. Although potentially immoral as a form of violence and suicide within a Buddhist framework, this thesis shows that the <b>self‐immolations</b> are understood as a form of sacrifice and non‐violence, and that the self‐immolators have the uncontested status of heroes. Building on Michael Lambek s (2007) theory of sacrifice as a kind of beginning, I propose that the <b>self‐immolations</b> can best be understood as an attempt at substantiating a beginning of exile politics, which again carries the potential for changing the present political situation in Tibet. Moreover, I analyze this special kind of sacrifice within the anthropological framework of good and bad death, where the <b>self‐immolations</b> clearly are made to be a good form of death. My central argument is that the perceptions of the <b>self‐immolations</b> and the connected practices of commemoration are best analyzed in relation to the nationalist project in exile, which is conditioned by faith in certain values and goals. As a good death, the <b>self‐immolations</b> can be seen to reinforce the nationalist project in exile, and to ensure a continuity of the Tibetan freedom struggle and certain values...|$|R

5|$|The Tiananmen Square <b>self-immolation</b> {{incident}} {{took place}} in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. The incident is disputed; Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account of event, suggesting the self-immolations were staged by the government to discredit Falun Gong.|$|E

5|$|In Hinduism, {{suicide is}} {{generally}} frowned upon {{and is considered}} equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. Hindu Scriptures state that one who dies by suicide will {{become part of the}} spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not taken one's own life. However, Hinduism accepts a man's right to end one's life through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa. But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life. Jainism has a similar practice named Santhara. Sati, or <b>self-immolation</b> by widows, was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January, a {{clash between}} {{agitating}} students and Congress party workers in Madurai went {{out of control and}} became a riot. Rioting soon spread {{to other parts of the}} State. Police responded with lathi charges and firing on student processions. Acts of arson, looting and damage to public property became common. Railway cars and Hindi name boards at railway stations were burned down; telegraph poles were cut and railway tracks displaced. The Bhaktavatsalam Government considered the situation as a law and order problem and brought in para military forces to quell the agitation. Incensed by police action, violent mobs killed two police men. Several agitators committed suicide by <b>self-immolation</b> and by consuming poison. In two weeks of riots, around 70 people were killed (by official estimates). Some unofficial reports put the death toll as high as 500. A large number of students were arrested. The damage to property was assessed to be ten million rupees.|$|E
5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library {{to ask him about}} his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by <b>self-immolation</b> after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} occurred {{during a period}} of popular unrest by the Buddhist majority against the Roman Catholic rule of Diệm. Buddhist discontent had grown since the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, 1963. The government decided to selectively invoke a law, prohibiting the display of religious flags, by banning the use of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. One week earlier, the Vatican flag had been flown at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. The Buddhists defied the ban, flying their flags on Vesak and holding a demonstration, which was ended with government gunfire and eight deaths. The killings sparked nationwide protests by South Vietnam's Buddhist majority against the policies of Diệm's regime. The Buddhists demanded that Diệm give them religious equality, but with their demands unfulfilled, the protests increased in magnitude. The most notable of these was the <b>self-immolation</b> of Thích Quảng Đức on June 11, which was iconically photographed by the media and became a negative symbol of the Diệm régime.|$|E
5|$|After the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, {{civil unrest}} {{broke out in}} South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President Ngô Đình Diệm after defying a {{government}} ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diệm for religious equality and compensation and justice {{for the families of}} the victims. With Diệm remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The <b>self-immolation</b> of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diệm regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and became a symbol of Diệm's policies. As protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu conducted the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumours of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{especially}} the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent {{half a million}} Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. New York Times cites reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, painting over and turning street signs (on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed {{back out of the}} country after a day's wandering), defiance of various curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months, and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by <b>self-immolation</b> (such as that of Jan Palach), but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained Soviet-controlled until 1989, when the Velvet Revolution ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully, undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier. The resistance also became an iconic example of civilian-based defense, which, along with unarmed civilian peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{responded to}} the {{controversy}} of the chemicals by agreeing to formal talks with the Buddhist leaders. He appointed a three-member Interministerial Committee, which comprised Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ as chairman, Thuan and Interior Minister Bui Van Luong. Despite continuing protests, including public <b>self-immolations</b> by monks such as Thích Quảng Đức, a Joint Communique resulting from the discussions was signed in mid-June, which promised to end the Buddhist crisis.|$|R
50|$|In the event, as 1965 approached, India's new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri {{prepared}} to make Hindi paramount with effect from 26 January 1965. This led to widespread agitation, riots, <b>self-immolations</b> and suicides in Tamil Nadu. The split of Congress politicians from the South from their party stance, the resignation of two Union ministers from the South and the increasing threat to the country's unity forced Shastri to concede.|$|R
50|$|<b>Self-immolations</b> {{were used}} {{as a form of}} protest, an on 16 August, one such {{occurrence}} occurred at Từ Đàm when an elderly nun set herself alight. As the tension increased and opposition to Diệm increased, the key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August, when Ngô Đình Nhu's Special Forces raided and vandalised Buddhist pagodas and temples across the country, rounding up thousands of monks and leaving hundreds dead.|$|R
