25|$|Commercial {{production}} of bottle fermented <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> from grapes grown in England {{started in the}} 1960s, {{although there has been}} a longer history of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> made from these varieties increased. Today, there are over 100 vineyards in England producing <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> with Nyetimber, Ridgeview and Chapel Down being some of the largest producers. In 2010, Chardonnay and Pinot noir were the two most commonly planted grape varieties in English vineyards. Along with Pinot Meunier, the three varieties combined accounted for around 40% of vines planted, which appears to reflect a significant growth in interest in English <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> Other varietals used are Auxerrois, Seyval blanc, Müller-Thurgau, Reichensteiner, and Bacchus. To put that in context, the current yield for all types of English wine averages to around 2 million bottles annually.|$|R
5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{constitutes}} the first characterization of Brazilian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> {{in terms of}} their aromatic compounds. The wines were produced by a traditional method with five classical varieties recognized for the production of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> (Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling Renano) and five innovative varieties (Moscato Embrapa, Niagara, Villenave, Goethe and Manzoni Bianco) widely used in Brazil for the production of wine. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> in relation to their chemical composition and volatile compounds content. Of the phenolic compounds determined, the highest concentration was observed for tyrosol. In relation to volatile compounds, twenty-five compounds were determined. Isoamyl acetate was detected in high concentrations in all of the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> particularly Moscato Embrapa (610. 7 μg×L− 1) (odor activity value OAV= 20. 4), and the ethyl octanoate concentration was high in Villenave (976. 6 μg×L− 1) (OAV= 195. 0). High concentrations of monoterpenes, such as linalool, were observed in the Riesling Renano (209. 1 μg×L− 1) (OAV= 8. 4) and geraniol in Moscato Embrapa (128. 6 μg×L− 1) (OAV= 18. 6) wines. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were carried out using the data obtained for the volatile compounds in the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> and the separation of two groups was observed, in which the innovative varieties Moscato Embrapa, Niagara and Villenave were clearly separated from the other <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> These results indicate that the innovative varieties in Brazil can present particular and differentiated characteristics related to the volatile composition, offering an alternative for the production of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|The Brachetto {{variety is}} the most {{important}} aromatic red grape used for the production of sweet <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> in Italy. The phenolic composition and chromatic characteristics were studied in base and red sweet <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> made from this variety. The present work represents the first study on <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> manufactured with Brachetto grapes. The amount of pigments extracted in the base wine was low {{as a consequence of the}} necessity for short maceration time (48. h) and low alcohol content (3. 0. bar) at the end of the second fermentation and, therefore, the chromatic quality was independent on the winemaking methodology used, excepting for lightness and color intensity. Response surface methodology was applied to predict the effect of two independent variables, namely time and temperature of storing, on the phenolic composition and chromatic properties in both lightly and fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> So, it is possible to evaluate the development of two types of sweet <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> during their ageing in bottle and their commercial shelf-life. A central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used for this purpose. Quantitative changes were observed in the color parameters. Although the time variable strongly influenced them, the two <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> were stable enough only at low temperatures after 12. months of ageing. During the wine ageing in bottle, an increase in the formation of polymeric red pigments can be suggested taking into account the losses observed in monomeric anthocyanins. The results obtained showed that the color of fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> was more stable than that of lightly ones and, therefore, the shelf-life of the former ones could be longer...|$|R

40|$|This work {{constitutes}} the first contribution to elucidate the varietal volatile composition of {{two types of}} <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> manufactured with Brachetto grapes and its relative evolution during the shelf-life. After bottling, the volatile composition differed significantly among the typologies of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> evaluated, namely lightly ones (final bottle pressure 3. 0. bar). Free 2 -phenyl ethanol was the major aromatic compound (71 - 78 %) in Brachetto <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> but its concentration was significantly higher in fully ones. Among terpenoids, glycosylated geraniol was the predominant compound in {{the two types of}} <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> followed by nerol. These two compounds accounted for around 49 % and 67 % of bound aromatic precursors in lightly and fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> respectively. Lightly <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> showed a significant lower content of four free terpenoids (trans-pyran linalool oxide, nerol, citronellol and 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3, 7 -octadien- 2, 6 -diol) in relation to fully ones, and a significant higher content of three free volatile compounds (geraniol, cis-pyran linalool oxide and cis-furan linalool oxide). A central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied to evaluate and to predict the effect of two independent variables, time and temperature, on the varietal volatile composition and the overall olfactory attributes of both lightly and fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> during their aging in bottle. Significant quantitative changes were observed and some of them were satisfactorily predicted by the RSM approach. Values of the determination coefficient higher than 0. 800 were obtained in both lightly and fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> for free geraniol and glycosylated linalool, as well as for olfactory preferences. Significant correlations were also found among the overall olfactory judgment and some single free terpenoids correctly predicted by the mathematical model, preferentially α-terpineol and geraniol, although only the concentration of free geraniol was higher than its odor threshold. The higher presence of varietal geraniol was positively valued by the tasters...|$|R

25|$|Sparkling wines {{produced}} in the United States {{can be made in}} both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost sparkling wines, such as André, Cook's, and Tott's, often employ the latter method with more premium sparkling wines utilizing the former. The history of producing quality <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> in California {{can be traced to the}} Russian River Valley of Sonoma County where, in 1892, the Korbel brothers (emigrated from Bohemia in 1852) began producing <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> according to the méthode champenoise. The first wines produced were made from Riesling, Muscatel, Traminer and Chasselas grapes. Partly aided by the foreign influence, the overall quality of Californian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> increased with the introduction of the more traditional <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc into the production. US AVA requirements and wine laws do not regulate the sugar levels and sweetness of wine though most producers tend to follow European standards with Brut wine having less than 1.5% sugar up to Doux having more than 5%. As the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> industry in California grew, foreign investments from some of the Champagne region's most noted Champagne houses came to set up wineries in the area. These include Moët et Chandon's , Louis Roederer's Roederer Estate, and Taittinger's Domaine Carneros.|$|E
