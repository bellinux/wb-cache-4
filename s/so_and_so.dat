5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, {{they did not know}} when he would do <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> the first two episodes were initially written without him. In either case, {{the producers}} created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the story lines are based on truth. The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E

Tolls were increased, and a committee recommended improvements to the river. Nottingham Corporation invested some £450,000 on building the locks authorised by the 1906 Act, starting with Holme lock on 28 September 1921, and finishing with Hazelford lock, which was formally opened by Neville Chamberlain on 25 June 1926. A loan from Nottingham Corporation and {{a grant from the}} Unemployment Grants Committee enabled the Company to rebuild Newark Nether lock, which was opened on 12 April 1926.|$|E

[...] He also criticised Hughes' batting. [...] "Hughes needs to score the runs when they are needed most.

500|$|Although compromises to the hits-only formula {{had been}} {{permitted}} on the Lennon and Starr albums, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{comments on the}} controversial choice of tracks: [...] "But all this is down to a matter of timing and circumstance: Harrison needed to have a hits collection out in 1976, he didn't have enough big hits to fill out 13 tracks (even if he certainly had enough great album tracks to do <b>so),</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> the Fabs were brought in {{to fill in the}} cracks." [...] Erelwine adds that [...] "The result might be a little underwhelming in retrospect, but it's undeniably entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{claimed to}} have won the battle and stopped an Israeli drive on Balqa Governorate in {{intentions}} of occupying it and turning into a security buffer zone, {{which was supposed to}} serve as a punishment, due to the Jordanian support to the PLO. The Jordanians made this assumption as they saw the size of the raiding Israeli forces entering the battle. Arafat said [...] "What we have done is to make the world... realize that the Palestinian is no longer refugee number <b>so</b> <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> but the member of a people who hold the reins of their own destiny and {{are in a position to}} determine their own future". Palestinians and Arabs generally considered the battle a psychological victory over the IDF, which had been seen as 'invincible' until then, and recruitment to guerilla units soared. Fatah reported that 5,000 volunteers applied to join within 48 hours of the battle. By late March, there were nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, <b>so</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before.

They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low.

2500|$|There {{had been}} much {{discussion}} in Denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, 27 February 1846, where he openly admitted to be {{the author of the}} books because people began wondering if he was, in fact, a Christian or not. Several Journal entries from that year shed some light on what Kierkegaard hoped to achieve. This book was published under an earlier pseudonym, Johannes Climacus. On 30 March 1846 he published , under his own name. A critique of the novel Two Ages (in some translations Two Generations) written by Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that [...] "the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about <b>so</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> many uniformly make one individual". In this, Kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into [...] "the crowd" [...] which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. How can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introductory}} prose to {{the poem}} Rígsþula says that [...] "people {{say in the}} old stories" [...] that Heimdallr, described as a god among the Æsir, once fared on a journey. Heimdallr wandered along a seashore, and referred to himself as Rígr. In the poem, Rígr, who {{is described as a}} wise and powerful god, walks in the middle of roads on his way to steads, where he meets a variety of couples and dines with them, giving them advice and spending three nights at a time between them in their bed. The wives of the couples become pregnant, and from them come the various classes of humanity. Eventually a warrior home produces a promising boy, and as the boy grows older, Rígr comes out of a thicket, teaches the boy runes, gives him a name, and proclaims him to be his son. Rígr tells him to strike out and get land for himself. The boy does <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> becomes a great war leader with many estates. He marries a beautiful woman and the two have many children and are happy. One of the children eventually becomes so skilled that he is able to share in runic knowledge with Heimdallr, and so earns the title of Rígr himself. The poem continues without further mention of the god.|$|E
