40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for identifying all supported non-dominated vectors (or outcomes) in the objective space, {{as well as}} the corresponding efficient solutions in the decision space, for multi-objective integer network flow problems. Identifying the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> non-dominated vectors is of the utmost importance for obtaining a first approximation <b>of</b> the whole <b>set</b> <b>of</b> non-dominated vectors. This approximation is crucial, for example, in two-phase methods that first compute the supported non-dominated vectors and then the unsupported non-dominated ones. Our approach is based on a negative-cycle algorithm used in single objective minimum cost flow problems, applied to a sequence of parametric problems. The proposed approach uses the connectedness property <b>of</b> the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> non-dominated vectors/efficient solutions to find all integer solutions in maximal non-dominated/efficient facets.

It seems, however, that this approach to equational reasoning does not support backward reasoning or goal directed strategies. Knuth-Bendix completion is a forward chaining method, deriving new consequences from the axioms and previously derived equations, intended to produce a complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> equations and rewrite rules for the given equational specification. The proof of the theorem actually is more like a "side effect" of completion.
