It is situated {{in the center of}} the proximal row carpal bones, which lie between the ulna and radius and the hand. The lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral <b>scaphoid</b> <b>bone</b> and medial triquetral bone.|$|E
500|$|He {{completed}} {{the course in}} a time of 54' 19", and his time held for around an hour before his teammate Lieuwe Westra assumed top spot; despite being ten seconds down on Larsson at the second intermediate time point, Westra {{completed the}} final portion of the course some twenty seconds quicker, and recorded a time of 54' 09". 's Tony Martin, the world champion, was the next rider to assume the top spot, setting the first time underneath 54 minutes; he set a time of 53' 40", despite riding with a fractured <b>scaphoid</b> <b>bone</b> in his left wrist and suffering a flat tyre in the opening [...] of the stage. Fabian Cancellara of [...] improved the quickest time benchmark; he set the fastest time at each of the two intermediate time points on the stage, and having passed the rider who started three minutes before him on the road, 's Bauke Mollema, Cancellara established a time for the course of 52' 21", beating Martin's time by 1' 19".|$|E

40|$|Fracture-dislocation of the trapezio-scaphoid joint is an {{extremely}} rare injury. We report a case treated using Herbert’s compression screw technique.

He reviewed the previously described cases and reported one more. Table 1 shows the salient features of all these patients and our own. Dorso-radial dislocation of the trapezium has only once before been described (Boe 1979). The rarity of the injury can be explained on anatomical grounds.

30|$|Scapholunate {{dissociation}} is {{the loss}} of synchronous motion or normal alignment between the <b>scaphoid</b> and lunate <b>bones</b> usually from ligamentous injury [7, 8]. The mechanism of injury in scapholunate dissociation is most commonly trauma causing wrist extension, ulnar deviation and intercarpal supination [9]. Eventually scapholunate dissociation leads to misalignment of other scaphoid joints and ultimately to osteoarthritis (SLAC wrist) [8].|$|R

50|$|Scaphoid {{non-union}} fractures changes <b>scaphoid</b> <b>bone</b> shape, {{which leads}} to abnormal joint kinematics. Due to lack of stability from the distorted scaphoid, a DISI can be developed.This process is known as SNAC. As in SLAC, this will lead to degenerative osteoarthritis.|$|E
50|$|A {{scaphoid}} fracture, {{a fracture}} of the <b>scaphoid</b> <b>bone</b> {{also known as}} the carpal navicular, is {{the most common type of}} carpal bone fracture. Scaphoid fractures usually cause pain at the base of the thumb accompanied by swelling in the same area. Scaphoid fractures usually cause pain and sensitivity to palpation in the anatomic snuffbox at the base of the thumb accompanied by swelling in the same area. These are also called navicular fractures (the scaphoid also being called the carpal navicular) as navicular is the traditional name for the <b>scaphoid</b> <b>bone,</b> although this can be confused with the navicular bone in the foot. Treatment depends on the location of the fracture.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} eleven {{patients}} with {{signs and symptoms}} of carpal scaphoid injury, but with no fracture visible on X-ray, underwent bone scintigraphy of the wrists. The first 42 patients were re-X-rayed 10 days after injury: bone scanning had identified all fractures confirmed on this X-ray; there were no false negative bone scans. Sixty-seven patients (60 %) did not have increased focal uptake over the scaphoid or distal radius, and were mobilised immediately. None of these had a fracture at follow up. Twenty-nine patients with increased uptake over the scaphoid area (26 %) remained in plaster of Paris for 6 weeks. All of these had clinical signs of a <b>scaphoid</b> injury. <b>Bone</b> scanning is a practical investigation for all X-ray-negative potential scaphoid injuries, and is acceptable to patient and clinician.

Avascular necrosis of the proximal pole {{is one of the}} most important risk factors for persistent nonunion, for which the use of vascularised bone graft becomes a logical solution.
