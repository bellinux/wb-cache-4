40|$|<b>Scouring</b> (diarrhoea) <b>in</b> sheep is an {{important}} issue for the sheep meat industry. Soiled fleeces are a significant source of carcase contamination with microbes that include human pathogens and microorganisms that cause meat spoilage (Newton et al, 1978) and scouring is the major risk factor for fleece soiling (French and Morgan. 1996). However, there is little information regarding the causes of <b>scouring</b> <b>in</b> sheep at slaughter. Strongyle worm infections are a commonly implicated cause of scouring, reduced wool production, poor growth rates and reduced bodyweight with young sheep being particularly susceptible (Besier, 2004). However, there is no published data quantifying strongyle infections or <b>scouring</b> <b>in</b> sheep at abattoirs. This study aimed to investigate the extent of strongyle infections and any association with <b>scouring</b> <b>in</b> sheep at an abattoir in Western Australia...|$|R

This thesis evaluates the development of bridge pier scour via SRICOS, <b>Scour</b> <b>in</b> Cohesive Soils, a method to determine bridge pier <b>scour</b> depth <b>in</b> cohesive soils using results of the Erosion Function Apparatus (EFA) erosion tests and a hydrograph. Soil samples were collected from five Maryland sites; the EFA {{was used to measure}} their erosion rates and the SRICOS software predicted scour depths over a user-determined timespan.

Therefore, a series of laboratory tests were conducted to test simplified cases of layered and mixed sediment beds, as a basis for improving understanding of <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> complex situations.

In the layered case with fine sand as the upper layer, it was found that <b>scour</b> development <b>in</b> the underlying coarse sand was enhanced compared to <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> a uniform bed of the coarse sand.

40|$|Riffle-pool {{sequences}} play {{a crucial}} role in the fluid-sediment interactions that control bed scour, sediment transfer and deposition in rivers. Areas in rivers that experience changes in depth or width cause areas of differing flow acceleration and deceleration. Differing flow regimes strongly impact the turbulence structure and associated sediment transport processes. Past research has focused largely on the maintenance of riffle-pool sequences, specifically in the context of stage dependant velocity reversal hypotheses. However, little research has been completed on the three dimensional flow structures of these sequences and how this affects the depth of <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> pools and deposition height in riffles. Critical knowledge is lacking with respect to how these properties change or differ in straight versus meandering channels. Turbulence structure and sediment transport processes experience higher complexity in meandering reaches than straight reaches. Secondary circulations around meander bends create an asymmetrical profile that influences lateral sediment transport, thus leading to the occurrence of deep <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> pools. The primary objective of this study was to assess the turbulence structure and <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> riffle-pool sequences in both straight and meandering channel sections of the Rouge River, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The purpose was to assess the controlling factors that influence riffle height and depth of <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> pools and also how these factors differ in straight versus meandering reaches. The spatial and temporal variability of the turbulence structure and sediment transport will also be observed by comparing the responses to varying flow stages. 	This study was comprised of a field-based project using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). Sediment sorting and transport patterns were observed by using a combination of painted tracer particles, permanent bedload traps and handheld bedload samplers. Results indicated that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and momentum exchange was typically observed 5 â€“ 10 cm above the bed. Time series data indicated that the degree of curvature likely influenced secondary circulation and hence sediment transport and channel form. It was evident that riffle height and depth of <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> pools was strongly linked to channel morphology as well as micro scale bed variably...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{undermining}} of bridge foundations {{can lead}} to either costly repairs or a bridge collapse. These foundations must be designed to counter the effects of scour. Current practice {{does not allow for}} accurate estimates of <b>scour</b> <b>in</b> erodible rock. <b>Scour</b> <b>in</b> rock can be related to geotechnical and hydraulic properties. A field study of eleven bridge sites provided samples of the bedrock where the abrasive resistance of the rock was determined and hydraulic properties of the channel were calculated. Laboratory abrasion resistance values from a modified slake durability test and hydraulic variables such as stream power were compared to recent and past stream channel cross-sections. A preliminary model has been proposed wherein the degradation of the stream channel is related to the abrasive resistance of the bedrock and the area under the daily stream power. This method provides an estimate of the degradation of the stream bed due to abrasion by bedload and flood events, not necessarily local or contraction scour...|$|R
