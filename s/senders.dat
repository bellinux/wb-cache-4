5|$|Norton AntiSpam now scans e-mails for spoofed URLs {{and deals}} with any {{offending}} e-mail as spam. E-mails {{can also be}} blocked based on language, however by default the filter allows all languages. AntiSpam can sync its own list of allowed <b>senders</b> with POP3 address books. Users can train the spam filter by pointing out valid e-mail marked as spam and vice versa. Support for Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail was added in this release.|$|E
5|$|Norton AntiSpam, the renamed spam {{filtering}} feature, has {{a set of}} spam rules, which {{cannot be}} viewed or edited. Whitelists and blacklists of <b>senders</b> can be created. Users may also create their own spam definitions. AntiSpam integrates with Outlook, Outlook Express, and Eudora, allowing users to tag e-mail as spam on-the-fly. E-mail identified as spam are either quarantined by default, however the feature can be configured to delete such messages automatically. In CNET testing, AntiSpam correctly identified 94 percent of spam messages.|$|E

Forty participants each completed a <b>sender</b> and a no <b>sender</b> trial on consecutive nights by keeping a dream diary of all mentation they could recall when they awoke. The order of trials was randomised across participants. On no-sender nights a randomly selected video clip was played repeatedly from 2 : 00 until 6 : 30 am; on <b>sender</b> nights a <b>sender</b> would also watch the clip between 6 : 00 and 6 : 30 am and attempt to communicate its content.

Norton did correctly identify 90 percent of spam e-mail.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile <b>senders.</b> The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male <b>senders,</b> {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the Panel system was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type <b>senders</b> stored dialed digits on rotary selector switches. The <b>senders</b> employed translators {{to convert the}} dialed digits into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel <b>senders</b> were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster call completion.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{explored}} {{the role of}} liking in the social induction of affect.

We expected that exposure to the likeable <b>sender</b> would lead to reactions concordant with his emotional expression (assimilation), whereas exposure to the dislikeable <b>sender</b> would result in discordant reactions (contrast). The results indicated that dispositional likeability influenced the social induction of affect when the <b>sender</b> expressed positive emotions. Moreover, liking mediated {{the effects of the}} happy <b>sender’s</b> dispositional likeability on participants’ affective state.

25|$|CSP message-passing {{fundamentally}} {{involves a}} rendezvous between the {{processes involved in}} sending and receiving the message, i.e. the sender cannot transmit a message until the receiver is ready to accept it. In contrast, message-passing in actor systems is fundamentally asynchronous, i.e. message transmission and reception {{do not have to}} happen at same time, and <b>senders</b> may transmit messages before receivers are ready to accept them. These approaches may be considered duals of each other, in the sense that rendezvous-based systems can be used to construct buffered communications that behave as asynchronous messaging systems, while asynchronous systems can be used to construct rendezvous-style communications by using a message/acknowledgement protocol to synchronize <b>senders</b> and receivers.|$|E

Incentive compatibility requires the high <b>sender</b> type to use sub-optimal signals and therefore generates a cost for the high <b>sender</b> type in comparison to a full information benchmark in which the receiver knows the <b>sender's</b> type.
