50|$|<b>Slip-joint</b> {{fittings}} {{are frequently}} used in kitchen, bathroom and tub drainage systems. They include a detached (movable) slip nut and <b>slip-joint</b> washer; the washer {{is made of}} rubber or nylon. An advantage of this of fitting is that the pipe it is connecting to {{does not need to}} be cut to a precise length; the slip joint can attach within a range of the end of the inserting pipe. Many slip fittings may be tightened or loosened by hand, for easier access to residential drainpipe systems (for example, to clean out a trap or access a drain line past a trap).|$|E
5000|$|In 1933, Chief Engineer Howard Manning {{developed}} the tongue-and-groove, <b>slip-joint</b> pliers {{for which the}} company is known. In 1934, a patent for this design was granted, and in 1949, a trademark for the name [...] "Channellock" [...] was granted, with a first-use date of May 1, 1932.|$|E
50|$|Channellock is an American {{company that}} {{produces}} hand tools. It {{is best known}} for its pliers—the company manufactures more than 140 types of pliers—particularly its eponymous style of tongue-and-groove, <b>slip-joint</b> pliers. Its pliers have distinctive sky-blue handle grips (see photo); the company has been using the same trademarked shade of blue since 1956.|$|E
40|$|If {{the idea}} of an {{obstacle}} is broadly interpreted every object which is {{in the way of a}} vehicle can be regarded as an obstacle. According to this definition all road users are also obstacles. In this literature study only exclusive fixed objects along the highway, such as lighting poles and columns for fly overs are considered. All of these have a useful function, but can produce danger for the road users by their position and design. It is established that the presence of obstacles on road shoulders increases the number and severity of collisions with obstacles. A literature review has been carried out on the behaviour in collisions of fixed objects which are on road shoulders. In principle research is focussed on the creation of a safe road shoulder by (1) the construction of safety fences, (2) the protection of the other obstacles by so called obstacle safety devices, (3) the construction of break-aways and base <b>slip-joints,</b> and (4) making the road shoulder free of obstacles. In a second part of the paper tables and figures are presented. See also B 1466...|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Bahco {{started to}} develop and {{manufacture}} ergonomic hand tools. The first products that were developed according to ergonomic principles were the screwdrivers (1983), the adjustable wrenches (1984), wood chisels (1985) and <b>slip-joint</b> pliers (1986). In 1996, the Bahco ERGOTM concept was presented and scientifically approved {{as a way of}} preventing repetitive strain injuries and to increase productivity. All Bahco tools that carry the ERGOTM trade mark have undergone a scientific 11-point development program with regard to ergonomics and function.|$|E
50|$|Tongue-and-groove pliers—also {{known as}} water pump pliers, {{adjustable}} pliers, groove-joint pliers, arc-joint pliers, Multi-Grips, tap or pipe spanners, gland pliers and Channellocks—are {{a type of}} <b>slip-joint</b> pliers. They have serrated jaws generally set 45 to 60 degrees from the handles. The lower jaw can be moved {{to a number of}} positions by sliding along a tracking section under the upper jaw. An advantage of this design is that the pliers can adjust to a number of sizes without the distance in the handle growing wider. These pliers often have long handles—commonly 9.5 to 12 inches long—for increased leverage.|$|E
40|$|Eccentricity of a {{specific}} <b>slip-joint</b> design separating two cantilevered, telescoping tubes did not create any self-excited lateral vibrations {{that had not been}} observed previously for a concentric slip joint. In fact, the eccentricity made instabilities less likely to occur, but only marginally. Most important, design rules previously established to avoid instabilities for the concentric slip joint remain valid for the eccentric slip joint...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A post-failure {{investigation}} of a highway embankment constructed over organic and sensitive subsoils was made {{with a series of}} field vane tests. The results indicated that the embankment was quite stable, and, therefore, the reliabilities of both the Φ = 0 slip-circle analysis and the field vane results seemed to be highly questionable. Undisturbed samples taken from an area unaffected by the embankment failure were used to determine the undrained shear strength of these subsoils. The results of both the laboratory vane and unconfined compression tests were appreciably below the results of the field vane tests, but they were not low enough to completely explain the instability of the embankment. It was concluded that a progressive failure of the highly sensitive organic silty clay was partly responsible for the inaccuracy of the Φ = 0 slip-circle stability analysis. However, the major error resulted from the inaccuracies of the field vane results. The effect of the rate of rotation of the laboratory vane upon the undrained shear strength was found to be insignificant. Since the vane basically determines the shear strength developed on the vertical plane, the difference between the shear strength developed on the horizontal plane and vertical plane was studied. Finally, the method of evaluating rod-friction was investigated. It was found that the use of the "dummy" rod for the evaluation of the frictional resistance developed on the field vane's torque rod was inaccurate. This fact was demonstrated by the comparison of original field vane test results with results obtained from a modified <b>slip-joint</b> field vane, capable of directly measuring the rod-friction. It was concluded that a modified <b>slip-joint</b> field vane accurately measured the in situ undrained shear strength. The fact that silty clays found at the highway embankment site were sensitive was not indicated by either the original field vane or the modified <b>slip-joint</b> field vane. The actual sensitivity of these subsoils was determined by both the laboratory vane and the liquidity index of the soils. It was concluded that the in situ sensitivity could not be obtained by the modified <b>slip-joint</b> field vane. The one point that the entire investigation indicated was that before the field vane test results can be intelligently used, additional information about the subsoils is required...|$|E
40|$|Parameters and {{operating}} conditions (a stability map) were determined {{for which a}} specific <b>slip-joint</b> design did not cause self-excited lateral vibration of the two cantilevered, telescoping tubes forming the joint. The joint design featured a localized annular constriction. Flowrate, modal damping, tube engagement length, and eccentric positioning were among the parameters tested. Interestingly, all self-excited vibrations could be avoided by following a simple design rule: place constrictions only at the downstream end of the annular region between the tubes. Also, overall modal damping decreased with increased flowrate, at least initially, for upstream constrictions while the damping increased for downstream constrictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{relativistic}} conservation law {{involving the}} center of energy is reviewed and illustrated using simple examples from classical electromagnetic theory. It is emphasized that this conservation law {{is parallel to the}} conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, and energy, in arising from the generators of the Poincare group for electromagnetic theory; yet this relativistic law reflecting the continuous flow of energy goes virtually unmentioned in the text books. The illustrations here present situations both where external forces are present and are absent. The cases of a parallel plate capacitor, a flattened <b>slip-joint</b> solenoid, and two interacting charges are included. Comment: 22 page...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results from}} a {{statistical}} analysis algorithm for objectively comparing toolmarks via data files obtained using optical profilometry data are described. The algorithm employed has successfully been used to compare striated marks produced by screwdrivers. In this study, quasi-striated marks produced by the cutting surfaces of <b>slip-joint</b> pliers were examined. Marks were made by cutting both copper and lead wire. Data files were obtained using an optical profilometer that uses focus variation to determine surface roughness. Early efforts using the comparative algorithm yielded inconclusive results when the comparison parameters used {{were the same as}} those employed successfully for screw-driver marks. Further experiments showed that the algorithm could successfully be used to separate known matches from non-matches by changing the comparison parameters. Results are presented from the analysis of the copper wires...|$|E
30|$|Similarly to casing material, casing {{connections}} have {{to withstand}} high thermally induced loads. Due to extremely high thermally induced cyclic stresses, {{it is believed}} that both conventional API buttress and premium casing couplings will experience failure in wells investigating supercritical resources. Extensive research is currently being carried out within the frameworks of GeoWell and DEEPEGS project focused on the development of flexible couplings for high-enthalpy geothermal wells (Kaldal et al. 2016). This new solution will allow for axial movement of casing strings (as bends are not possible in a vertical wellbore) to avoid coupling rupture due to periods of heating (thermal expansion) and cooling (high tensile forces due to contraction of steel) during maintenance work and should avoid generating stresses above yield strength of the casing material and reducing likelihood of casing collapse. During running casing, couplings will be in open mode. While heating up, the casing material will expand allowing for each coupling to expand freely downwards via a <b>slip-joint</b> and closing the system before reaching the expected temperatures, with enough residual axial force to seal the connection.|$|E
40|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{have a high}} potential {{to be part of}} a decentralized renewable energy system. Though costs are high and profitability is still low. This paper offers developers ideas on how to enhance product and processes. For several years now the small wind industry has been expected to reach a tipping point with an increase in sales volume and a drop in production costs. This assumption is being analyzed in this paper and further saving potentials in small wind turbine production costs are outlined. Based on small wind market reports in several countries a global market analysis for small {{wind turbines}} in the range of 1 kW to 5 kW has been performed. From the findings a relevant set of manufacturers have been selected to study manufacturing methods and development trends. The learning curve model was applied to three manufacturers. The global market segment has a size of 22 000 small wind turbines annually with China, the United States and Great Britain as leadin g countries. The sales of market leaders can be estimated to be between 1000 and 2000 units a year. The tower is found to be the part with the major saving potentials. Measures to lower production and installation cost include centrifugal casted, segmented fiberglass towers and <b>slip-joint</b> techniques to connect the tower segments. In the midterm the learning curve model predicts a price level for a grid-connected small wind turbine with a 3. 5 m diameter rotor of 4000 EUR...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1993 {{court case}} of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the {{subjective}} nature of toolmark comparison {{has been questioned}} by attorneys and law enforcement agencies alike. This {{has led to an}} increased drive to establish objective comparison techniques with known error rates, much like those that DNA analysis is able to provide. This push has created research in which the 3 -D surface profile of two different marks are characterized and the marks 2 ̆ 7 cross-sections are run through a comparative statistical algorithm to acquire a value that is intended to indicate the likelihood of a match between the marks. The aforementioned algorithm has been developed and extensively tested through comparison of evenly striated marks made by screwdrivers. However, this algorithm has yet to be applied to quasi-striated marks such as those made by the shear edge of <b>slip-joint</b> pliers. The results of this algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s application to the surface of copper wire will be presented. Objective mark comparison also extends to comparison of toolmarks made by firearms. In an effort to create objective comparisons, microstamping of firing pins and breech faces has been introduced. This process involves placing unique alphanumeric identifiers surrounded by a radial code on the surface of firing pins, which transfer to the cartridge 2 ̆ 7 s primer upon firing. Three different guns equipped with microstamped firing pins were used to fire 3000 cartridges. These cartridges are evaluated based on the clarity of their alphanumeric transfers and the clarity of the radial code surrounding the alphanumerics...|$|E
