Because of its secret printing, problems arose which affected the layout and design. In particular, because of a shortage of type, the document was printed in two halves, printing first the top then the bottom on the same pieces of paper. The typesetters were Willie O'Brien, Michael Molloy and Christopher Brady. They lacked a sufficient supply of type in {{the same size and}} font, and as a result the some parts of the document use es from a different font, which are smaller and do not quite match.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the new pellet {{injection}} system for refuelling the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak with cubic H_ 2 or D_ 2 pellets having alternative side lengths of 1. 5, 1. 75 and 2. 0 mm and optional Ne doping. The system delivers series of about one hundred pellets at a maximum repetition {{rate of more than}} 40 Hz. The pellets are accelerated by means of a centrifuge with an optimized straight acceleration arm. This configuration minimizes the compulsive force acting on the pellet during the acceleration process. Since this also minimizes stresses inside the pellet, high velocities - a maximum of 1211 m/s being achieved - are possible without destroying the hydrogen cubes. A special pellet feed-in technique based on a static <b>stop</b> <b>cylinder</b> interrupting the acceleration path successfully reduced the horizontal scattering angle to values of less than #+-# 4 degrees. Thus, a high efficiency - with more than 90 % of the pellets arriving within the acceptance angle - was achieved without using a guide tube. The whole system was found to work very reliably and reproducibly during the whole test operation period, covering about 10 " 5 pellet shots. The new centrifuge, now integrated into the ASDEX Upgrade setup, {{has proved to be a}} reliable unit even for long operation periods thus affording the possibility of quasicontinuous particle refuelling throughout a plasma discharge in ASDEX Upgrade.

25|$|Freezing: In cold {{conditions}} the cooling effect of gas expanding through a valve orifice may cool either {{first or second}} stage sufficiently to cause ice to form. External icing may lock up the spring and exposed moving parts of first or second stage, and freezing of moisture in the air may cause icing on internal surfaces. Either may cause the moving parts of the affected stage to jam open or closed. If the valve freezes closed, it will usually defrost quite rapidly and start working again, and may freeze open soon after. Freezing open {{is more of a}} problem, as the valve will then free-flow and cool further in a positive feedback loop, which can normally only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve and waiting for the ice to thaw. If not <b>stopped,</b> the <b>cylinder</b> will rapidly be emptied.|$|R

50|$|Fanning is a {{revolver}} shooting technique {{in which one}} hand holds the trigger and the other hits the hammer repeatedly. This turns the cylinder and hits the firing pin, in that order, allowing for 'semi-automatic fire' of single-action revolvers.

When performed very quickly, {{it can be very}} damaging to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stop</b> mechanism. This technique is used extensively in fast draw competitions, which generally use special lightweight aluminum or titanium blank-firing cylinders, rather than the steel cylinders normally found on single-action revolvers.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the quality of}} Leeds records improved. Leeds records were issued under the rare [...] "Century" [...] label, the [...] "Sir Henri" [...] label, the [...] "Imperial" [...] label, and many others. None of these labels {{credited}} Leeds as the manufacturer, likely as Leeds was usually in court for infringing some patent, trademark, etc. In 1905, Leeds was rumored to have begun plans for returning to producing cylinders, sending Edison investigators scattering about. Leeds made its last known cylinders in 1903, in brown wax. Columbia made molded brown waxes at this time and introduced black waxes in 1903. This <b>stopped</b> Leeds <b>cylinder</b> production. If Leeds really did resume cylinder production in 1905, the cylinders {{would have to have}} been molded black waxes or they would not have survived on the market if they were brown. Columbia stopped brown wax molding in 1904, thus eliminating any niche competition for Leeds brown waxes. No supposed Leeds cylinders from ca. 1905 survive, nor do any Leeds cylinder catalogs.|$|R
30|$|The {{change of}} the {{oscillation}} amplitudes is shown in Fig.  9 c, {{as a function of}} the oscillation period. The peak amplitudes, shown with circular markers, are almost the same for aluminum and nylon, and have a linear relationship with the oscillation period. Contrarily, the amplitudes at 200  s, which are shown with cross markers, are considerably different for the two materials. Whereas aluminum cylinder kept almost the same amplitude, the amplitude was damped for the nylon cylinder. Especially when the period, as well as the amplitude, were small, the nylon <b>cylinder</b> <b>stopped</b> the oscillation due to overheating. The results indicate that the self-induced oscillation can continue for long time when the material of cylinder is highly heat-conductive.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the application of unsteady finite volume methods to the numerical calculation of aeroacoustic problems. Some discussion is made of how the acoustic analogy of Lighthill has led to a separation between the calculation of acoustic source, or flow, and the subsequent sound field. It is pointed out that for transonic flow this separation is not necessarily useful. The example problem of an impulsively started cylinder is given for speed of Mach. 1 and. 5. In the Mach. 5 case a strong shock is followed as it develops. A further example of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stopping</b> impulsively is given as well. MacCormack's explicit predictor-corrector method is used for all the examples...|$|R
5000|$|A {{development}} from the pepperbox {{is the so-called}} [...] "transitional" [...] revolver. This weapon uses the same action but with one single barrel attached {{to the front of}} a cut-down pepperbox cylinder. A transitional revolver is defined as a revolver (with barrel and cylinder) that does not have a cylinder-stop, an early example being the Collier flintlock revolver of 1819.It retained the pepperbox's caplock action but still had many deficiencies. The lack of an effective <b>cylinder</b> <b>stop</b> allowed a charge to be fired when the cylinder wasn’t aligned with the barrel, resulting in an erratic shot possibly damaging the gun and even injuring the firer. While the shortened cylinder made loading easier the barrel was attached to the cylinder pin; over time this weakened the gun, decreasing its accuracy. In addition it lacked partitions between its nipples, risking similar chain-fires to the earlier pepperbox. This was exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} bar-hammers common on pepperboxes and transitional revolvers usually provided a weak blow, which meant that extra-sensitive percussion caps were needed to ensure that the gun would fire, further increasing the risk of a chain-fire. Although later models were fitted with a shield to protect the user from cap fragments there was still a risk of being maimed or killed as a multiple discharge could cause the gun to explode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{rheological}} behavior of semisolid aluminium alloy (A 356) slurry is investigated {{by using a}} concentric cylinder viscometer under high cooling rate (30 to 50 °C/min) and high shear rate (650 to 1500 s- 1) conditions. Two different series of experiments are carried out. In all of these experiments, the pellets of A 356 alloy are poured into the outer cylinder where they melt completely by resistance heating. When the inner cylinder is placed concentrically, the molten metal resides in the annular space between the cylinders. As the inner cylinder rotates, the alloy is sheared continuously during cooling from a temperature of 630 °C, and a slurry forms. In the first series of experiments, for different cooling rates, shearing continues under a constant shear rate until rotation of the inner <b>cylinder</b> <b>stops.</b> During experiments, {{the temperature of the}} slurry is measured continuously using a K-type thermocouple, from which the solid fraction is calculated. In the second series of experiments, the molten alloy is cooled and sheared continuously at different shear rates for a given cooling rate. The apparent viscosity of the slurry is calculated by measuring the torque applied to the inner cylinder and its rotational speed. The results show that the slurry viscosity increases with increasing fraction of solid and increasing cooling rate, and it decreases with increasing shear rate. At high values of shear and cooling rates, the viscosity varies gradually up to a solid fraction of about 0. 5...|$|R
5000|$|... 1981's biggest {{news was}} the {{introduction}} of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in3 V8-6-4 engine. Developed by the Eaton Corporation - with design elements that had been tested for over 500000 mi - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete <b>stop,</b> 6 <b>cylinders</b> during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The [...] Buick V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering {{in the spring of}} 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply {{get in and out of}} the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The V6 option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 Cadillac Brougham models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or [...] "max" [...] settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).|$|R
