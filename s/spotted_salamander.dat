5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a <b>spotted</b> <b>salamander,</b> water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Bush is {{also home}} to 30 of the 44 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), and <b>spotted</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area.

60|$|As I drew a still fresher soil {{about the}} rows with my hoe, I {{disturbed}} {{the ashes of}} unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under these heavens, and their small implements of war and hunting {{were brought to the}} light of this modern day. They lay mingled with other natural stones, some of which bore the marks of having been burned by Indian fires, and some by the sun, and also bits of pottery and glass brought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil. When my hoe tinkled against the stones, that music echoed to the woods and the sky, and was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and immeasurable crop. It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I that hoed beans; and I remembered with as much pity as pride, if I remembered at all, my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios. The nighthawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoons--for I sometimes made a day of it--like a mote in the eye, or in heaven's eye, falling from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent, torn at last to very rags and tatters, and yet a seamless cope remained; small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the ground on bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills, where few have found them; graceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond, as leaves are raised by the wind to float in the heavens; such kindredship is in nature. The hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and surveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the elemental unfledged pinions of the sea. Or sometimes I watched a pair of hen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and descending, approaching, and leaving one another, {{as if they were the}} embodiment of my own thoughts. Or I was attracted by the passage of wild pigeons from this wood to that, with a slight quivering winnowing sound and carrier haste; or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned up a sluggish portentous and outlandish <b>spotted</b> <b>salamander,</b> a trace of Egypt and the Nile, yet our contemporary. When I paused to lean on my hoe, these sounds and sights I heard and saw anywhere in the row, a part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers.|$|E

50|$|Adults {{spend most}} of their time in their burrows or under logs, as is the case with most mole {{salamanders}}. Juvenile marbled salamanders hatch early compared to most salamanders and gain a size advantage by feeding and growing for several months before the Jefferson <b>salamanders</b> and <b>spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> hatch later in the spring. Larvae typically mature as quickly as two months in the southern part of their range, but take up to six months to mature in the northern part.Marbled salamanders, like other members of this genus, are reported to have relatively long life spans, 8-10 years or more.|$|R
50|$|Small-mouth {{salamanders}} are nocturnal, often subterranean, preferring moist habitats near permanent {{bodies of}} water. Breeding {{occurs in the}} spring, with groups of salamanders congregating near the water. Females can lay up to 700 eggs, which they attach in small clumps of up to 30 eggs at a time, to rocks or vegetation under the water. Their diets include insects, slugs, and earthworms. Larvae hatch at 0.5 in (13 mm); they metamorphisize in May to June at about 1.6 in (40 mm). When disturbed, the small-mouth salamander raises its tail and waves it back and forth. Being shy and sensitive, it shares breeding pools with larger <b>spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> and marbled salamanders.|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{linkages}} {{can help}} maintain connectivity of animal populations in developed landscapes. However, {{the lack of}} empirical data on the width of lateral movements (i. e., the zigzagging of individuals as they move from one point to point another) makes determining the width of such linkages challenging. We used radiotracking data from wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and <b>spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma maculatum) in a managed forest in Maine (U. S. A.) to characterize movement patterns of populations and thus inform planning for the width of wildlife corridors. For each individual, we calculated the polar coordinates of all locations, estimated the vector sum of the polar coordinates, and measured the distance from each location to the vector sum. By fitting a Gaussian distribution over a histogram of these distances, we created a population-level probability density function and estimated the 50 th and 95 th percentiles to determine the width of lateral movement as individuals progressed from the pond to upland habitat. For <b>spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> 50 % of lateral movements were â‰¤ 13 m wide and 95 % of movements were â‰¤ 39 m wide. For wood frogs, 50 % of lateral movements were â‰¤ 17 m wide and 95 % of movements were â‰¤ 51 m wide. For both species, those individuals that traveled the farthest from the pond also displayed the greatest lateral movement. Our results serve {{as a foundation for}} spatially explicit conservation planning for pond-breeding amphibians in areas undergoing development. Our technique can also be applied to movement data from other taxa to aid in designing habitat linkages...|$|R
