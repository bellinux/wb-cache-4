40|$|Abstract — <b>Step</b> <b>by</b> <b>step</b> <b>operations</b> <b>by</b> {{which we}} make a group of objects in which {{attributes}} of all the objects are nearly similar, known as clustering. So, a cluster {{is a collection of}} objects that acquire nearly same attribute values. The property of an object in a cluster is similar to other objects in same cluster but different with objects of other clusters. Clustering is used in wide range of applications like pattern recognition, image processing, data analysis, machine learning etc. Nowadays, more attention has been put on categorical data rather than numerical data. Where, the range of numerical attributes organizes in a class like small, medium, high, and so on. There is wide range of algorithm that used to make clusters of given categorical data. Our approach is to enhance the working on wellknown clustering algorithm k-modes to improve accuracy of algorithm. We proposed a new approach named “High Accuracy Clustering Algorithm for Categorical datasets”. Index Terms — clustering, k-mode Algorithm, categorical data, data mining. I...|$|R
40|$|Descriptive {{geometry}} is {{the science}} that studies the geometric shapes of space using their models. Unlike analytic geometry and differential geometry, which use symbolic languages, descriptive geometry uses a visual language {{and this is}} the reason why it is an essential tool in engineering projects, as well as in architectural and design projects. Up until only a few years ago, descriptive geometry was carried out exclusively hand drawing on paper, in two dimensions; nowadays it uses the computer, too, which offers the possibility to draw in space and with a much better accuracy of representation. This book proposes the ancient science of Monge in a renewed form: besides the methods codified by the tradition, we will deal with the methods that nowadays are used in the digital modelling applications, namely the mathematical representation and the polygonal representation. These same methods are then applied to the constructions and to the problems typical to descriptive geometry. The reader will be guided towards the solution through procedures that itemize, <b>step</b> <b>by</b> <b>step,</b> the <b>operations</b> to be carried out and, in many cases, the commands to be used...|$|R
40|$|Constructive {{heuristics}} for shop scheduling {{problems are}} {{often based on}} priority (or dispatching) rules. However, recent work has demonstrated that insertion algorithms that <b>step</b> <b>by</b> <b>step</b> insert <b>operations</b> or jobs into partial schedules usually clearly outperform priority rules. In this paper, we consider various job shop scheduling problems with setup times. For each job a specific technological route and a release data are given. Moreover, the jobs are partitioned into groups. A sequence independent setup time S_r_j is required on machine j when a job of the r-th group is processed after a job of another group. We consider differrent types of job availability, namely item and batch availability. As objective function we use both regular and nonregular criteria. For such problems we apply insertion techniques combined with beam search. Especially we consider different insertion orders of the operations or jobs. A refined variant of the insertion algorithm is presented, where several operations are inserted in parallel. The proposed variants have been tested on a large collection of test problems and compared with other constructive algorithms based on priority rules. (orig.)

40|$|A phenomenological {{approach}} is proposed to identify some effects occurring within {{the structure of}} the microswitch conceived for radio frequency application. This microsystem is operated via a nonlinear electromechanical action imposed by the applied voltage. Unfortunately, it can be affected by residual stress, due to the microfabrication process, therefore axial and flexural behaviors are strongly coupled. This coupling increases the actuation voltage required to achieve the so-called ‘‘pull-in'' condition. Moreover, temperature may strongly affect strain and stress distributions, respectively. Environmental temperature, internal dissipation of material, thermo-elastic and Joule effects play different roles on the microswitch flexural isplacement. Sometimes buckling phenomenon evenly occurs. Literature show that all those issues make difficult an effective computation of ‘‘pull-in'' and ‘‘pull-out'' voltages for evenly distinguishing the origin of some failures detected in operation. Analysis, numerical methods and experiments are applied to an industrial test case to investigate <b>step</b> <b>by</b> <b>step</b> the RF-microswitch <b>operation.</b> Multiple electro-hermomechanical coupling is first modeled to have a preliminary and comprehensive description of the microswitch behavior and of its reliability. ‘‘Pull-in'' and ‘‘pull-out'' tests are then performed to validate the proposed models and to find suitable criteria to design the RF-MEM...|$|R
5000|$|A major time {{constraint}} was doffing, {{or changing}} the spindles. Three hundred or more spindles {{had to be}} removed, and replaced. The machine had to be stopped while the doffers, who were often very young boys, did this task. The ring frame was idle until it was completed. [...] Harold Partington (1906 - 1994) of Chadderton, England, patented a 'Means for Doffing Ring Frames' in September 1953 (US Patent 2,653,440). The machine removed full bobbins from the ring frame spindles, and placed empty bobbins onto the spindles in their place; eight spindles at a time. It was traversable along {{the front of the}} ring frame <b>step</b> <b>by</b> <b>step</b> through successive <b>operations,</b> and thereby reduced the period of stoppage of the ring frame as well as reducing the labour required for removing all the filled bobbins on a frame and replacing them with empty bobbins. The Partington autodoffer was developed with assistance from Platt Brothers (Oldham) and worked perfectly in ideal conditions: flat horizontal floor and ring frame parallel to the floor and standing vertically. Sadly, these conditions were unobtainable in most Lancashire cotton mills at the time and so the autodoffer did not go into production. The Partington autodoffer was unique and the only one to work properly as an add-on to a ring frame. A more modern mechanical doffer system fitted {{as an integral part of}} the ring frame, reduced the doffing time to 30-35 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 An {{automated}} radiochemical {{flow analysis}} (ARFA) system was developed which integrates chemical and radiochemical techniques into one system {{through the use}} of a microcomputer. The operator, through the microcomputer, controls valves and pumps to transfer sample and reagent solutions to counting loops, ion exchange columns and holdup reservoirs. A Ge(Li) detector monitors the radioactivity of samples delivered to counting loops or of species retained on ion exchange resins. The microcomputer controls the acquisition of gross count and pH information and signals a minicomputer-multichannel analyzer to acquire a gamma ray spectrum. Computer control of solution handling allows count rates to be reduced through alternate counting geometries, dilution, sample holdup, preconcentration and separation of interferences with ion exchange resins. Extensive software was developed to allow the user to operate the ARFA system in three basic modes: 1) dedicated for on line monitoring of reactor coolant water, 2) interactive with <b>step</b> <b>by</b> <b>step</b> control of <b>operations</b> <b>by</b> the operator and 3) automatic sequence execution based on job stream programming, The versatility of the ARFA system is demonstrated with four applications: 1) automated on line monitoring of simulated reactor coolant water, 2) analysis of non-radioactive chemical samples, 3) analysis of low level radioactive samples and 4) studies of trace metal humic acid interactions. In the first application five count rate reduction methods were used to extend the dynamic range of counting up to six orders of magnitude. For the second application trace metals present in tap and river water samples were concentrated on Chelex- 100 ion exchange resin, stripped with acid, activated and counted. Zn, Cu, Mn, Br and K were determined at nn/mL concentrations and 0 y, Eu, and U were detemined at sub no/m 1 concentrations. In the third application of the ARFA system, species in reactor coolant water at the OSU TRIGA reactor were concentrated and counted directly on an ion exchange column, decreasing analysis time by a factor of 2 - 5 while increasing the peak to Compton ratio by approximately a factor of twenty compared to initial counting loop measurements. In the final application, test solutions of Mn²⁺, Eu³⁺, In³⁺, Dy³⁺ tracers and humic acid were passed through a Chelex- 100 resin. The retention behavior of the metal tracers was used to follow the kinetics of the metal complexation...|$|R
