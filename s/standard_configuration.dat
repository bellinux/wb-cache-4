5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The <b>standard</b> <b>configuration</b> of each set was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Airbus top sales {{executive}} {{and chief operating}} officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant, the A380-900, with more seating space than the A380-800. This would have a seating capacity for 650 passengers in <b>standard</b> <b>configuration,</b> and approximately 900 passengers in an economy-only configuration. Airlines that had expressed an interest in the −900 included Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Kingfisher Airlines, and leasing company ILFC. In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development was postponed, until production of the A380-800 stabilises.|$|E

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the <b>standard</b> <b>configuration,</b> the cockpit is {{provided}} with a generous suite of avionics and equipment. It features an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, lightning detection, dual Garmin GNS 530 navigation/communication systems, Bose headsets, dual transponders, dual compasses, and full cockpit instrumentation for both positions. Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the cargo payload. The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hardware}} revision, the Lisa 2, {{was released}} in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US. It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives {{in favor of a}} single 400k Sony microfloppy. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512k RAM. The Lisa 2/5 consisted of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5MB or 10MB hard drive. In 1984, {{at the same time the}} Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first Snow White design language features. The Lisa 2/10 featured a 10MB internal hard drive (but no external parallel port) and a <b>standard</b> <b>configuration</b> of 1MB of RAM.|$|E

500|$|No.1 Long Range Flight was a {{temporary}} Royal Australian Air Force unit formed {{to participate in}} the 1953 London-to-Christchurch air race (also known as the Christchurch Centenary air race).

Following extensive training, two Canberras departed for the UK in mid-September. The race began on 9 October, and one of the flight's aircraft placed second, with a total flying time of 22hours and 29minutes. The other aircraft was forced out of the race when one of its tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island to refuel, but completed its flight to Christchurch after being repaired.
