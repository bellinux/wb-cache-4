Urquiza suggested to Grenfell that they <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> kill the resulting prisoners of war, but Grenfell refused to harm any of them. Instead, Oribe's Argentine soldiers were incorporated into the army of Urquiza, and the Uruguayans into Garzon's.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E

The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E

5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's first {{tenure in}} the Senate {{came to a}} {{conclusion}} in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power {{as commander in chief}} to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of brigadier general. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate {{and in the absence of}} most Southern legislators, the Homestead Bill was finally enacted. Along with legislation for land-grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad, the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.|$|E

Ironically, Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed {{before the beginning of}} the war, even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject. The note also expressed Biddle's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations, there <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders.|$|E

The sheriff, having contacted the air base, was informed that he <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> allow the jet to run out of fuel, which occurred an hour and forty-five minutes later without further incident. A recovery crew from McClellan Air Force Base arrived on the scene and began to dismantle the aircraft, removing its wings for transport aboard a railroad flat car. The damage to the aircraft was minimal; indeed, one officer on the recovery crew is reported to have stated that if there were any less damage he would have simply flown the aircraft out of the field.|$|E

More than that, Beneš persuaded the French and the British to draw a frontier line that gave Czechoslovakia most of the territory of Teschen, the vital railroad and all the important coal fields. With this frontier, 139,000 Poles were to be left in Czech territory, whereas only 2,000 Czechs were left on the Polish side".|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} double album similar to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (1969). The first half {{was made up of}} the album as released, while the second was to be divided between personal projects and live-in-studio versions of older Van der Graaf Generator songs such as [...] "Killer" [...] and [...] "Octopus". Evans contributed an avant-garde piece, [...] "Angle of Incidents" [...] which featured drums being recorded backwards and the sound of a fluorescent lighting tube being dropped down the studio's stairs. Jackson recorded [...] "Ponker's Theme'", a short jazz piece, and a longer piece, [...] "Archimedes Agnostic", with Latin lyrics written by Hammill. Charisma ultimately felt that the group <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> release a single album, and vetoed the live and solo recordings.|$|E
500|$|Other {{cabinet members}} became resentful of Seward, {{who seemed to}} be always present when they {{discussed}} their departments' concerns with Lincoln, yet they were never allowed to be there when the two men discussed foreign affairs. Seward announced when cabinet meetings would be; his colleagues eventually persuaded Lincoln to set a regular date and time for those sessions. Seward's position on the Emancipation Proclamation when Lincoln read it to his cabinet in July 1862 is uncertain; Secretary of War Edwin Stanton wrote at the time that Seward opposed it in principle, feeling the slaves <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> be freed as Union armies advanced. [...] Two later accounts indicate that Seward felt the time was not yet to issue it, and Lincoln did wait until after the bloody stalemate at Antietam that ended Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion into the North to issue it. In the interim, Seward cautiously investigated how foreign powers might react to such a proclamation, and learned it would make them less likely to interfere in the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Friedman was {{initially}} {{unable to find}} academic employment, so in 1935 he followed his friend W. Allen Wallis to Washington, D.C., where Franklin D.

At this stage, Friedman {{said that he and}} his wife [...] "regarded the job-creation programs such as the WPA, CCC, and PWA appropriate responses to the critical situation," [...] but not [...] "the price- and wage-fixing measures of the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration." [...] Foreshadowing his later ideas, he believed price controls interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued. Indeed, Friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the New Deal was [...] "the wrong cure for the wrong disease," [...] arguing that the money supply <b>should</b> <b>simply</b> have been expanded, instead of contracted. Later, Friedman and his colleague Anna Schwartz wrote A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960, which argued that the Great Depression was caused by a severe monetary contraction due to banking crises and poor policy on the part of the Federal Reserve.|$|E
