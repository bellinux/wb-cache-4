5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed {{it as if it were}} Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's <b>softball</b> <b>team</b> outside of work.|$|E
5|$|Born in Houston, Bates {{attended}} the University of Texas and, in his freshman season, won the 1983 College World Series {{as a part}} of the Texas Longhorns baseball team. For the next two seasons, Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team, a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America. Drafted by Milwaukee in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft, he rose through the Brewers' farm system and teams that he played for won multiple minor league titles. He subsequently made his MLB debut in 1989, after Milwaukee starting second baseman became injured. A trade sent Bates to Cincinnati in 1990, where the Reds used him as a pinch runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason. Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series, Bates reached base on a pinch hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored the winning run in Game 2, as the Reds ultimately swept the Athletics, four games to none. Following the World Series championship, Bates spent two years in minor league baseball, one for the Reds and one for the Chicago Cubs, and last played exhibition baseball in 1995. After retirement, he worked as an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry in Houston and coached his daughter's <b>softball</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
