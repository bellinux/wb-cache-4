40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a low-cost power manager with controller for a 3 -phase AC induction motor, {{with a wide range}} of industrial applications. The prototype drive design and development was made using the generic <b>standard</b> on <b>printed</b> board <b>design</b> IPC 2221. Power manager consists of two stages. First is control stage, which includes an induction motor control-specific micro-controller. Second is power stage, with IGBTs as switching elements. This design is part of a wider project whose main objective is to advance a methodology to assist the quality improvement of academia-developed electronic prototypes. It is expected that these prototypes will be aligned with industrial standards, facilitating the industry-university connection regarding technological collaboration in the automation and control domain...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{ubiquitous}} and salient nature of environmental print, {{it has the}} potential to scaffold emergent literacy in young children. This randomised control study evaluated the effects of using environmental <b>print</b> compared to <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> (the same labels in manuscript form) in an 8 -week intervention (30 min per week) to foster 3 - to 4 -year-old's (N = 73) emergent literacy skills and print motivation. At the end of the intervention, the environmental print group outperformed a no intervention control group on letter sound knowledge, letter writing, environmental <b>print</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> reading, print concepts, and print motivation, even after controlling for receptive language abilities. Most of these gains were sustained 2 months later. The environmental print group also outperformed the <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> group on print motivation and environmental print reading at post-test, and on print motivation, environmental <b>print</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> reading, and letter writing at 2 -month follow-up. Environmental print may be more effective than <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> in enhancing print motivation and aspects of emergent literacy in young children due to its contextual nature.

40|$|There is {{a limited}} {{understanding}} {{of the effects of}} practice on reading efficiency and comfort when students with low vision read <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices. This descriptive study used a multiple baseline single-subject design to examine effects of practice on the reading rate, accuracy, duration and visual fatigue of three high school students with visual impairments when they read <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with newly prescribed optical devices (reading spectacles). The study also examined differences between measures of reading efficiency and comfort when students read large print without optical devices and when they read <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices. Baseline data were collected prior to intervention. Intervention consisted of daily practice sessions reading novels in <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with individually prescribed optical devices for a maximum of thirty-eight minutes. Measures of reading efficiency and comfort were graphed daily during baseline and intervention. Oral reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension were probed during intervention and maintenance. A positive relationship between practice and oral reading rate was demonstrated for three students and a positive relationship for silent reading rate for two students. No relationship was demonstrated between practice and duration nor between practice and fatigue. One student maintained oral reading rate three weeks after cessation of practice sessions. There were no advantages for reading large <b>print</b> over reading <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices for two of the students on measures of reading rate, accuracy, or duration; one student demonstrated no differences between reading media while the other demonstrated faster reading rates with <b>standard</b> <b>print.</b> One student demonstrated no differences in accuracy, but faster rates and longer duration with large print. Although students reported the same symptoms of visual fatigue with both media, they demonstrated more frequent occurrences of fatigue when reading <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices. All expressed preference for reading <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with reading spectacles. Reasons included portability, availability of materials, and social implications. There were two additional findings not related to the purposes of this study. Although all students were proficient readers, their oral and silent reading rates were almost equivalent. Individual patterns of miscues appeared to reflect students' visual field losses...|$|R
