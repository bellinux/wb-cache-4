40|$|IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE LOOKED FOR SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODY IN 80 HEALTHY CONTROLPERSONS AND 471 PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM VARIOUS LIVER AND OTHER DISEASES.

ANTIBODY TITLES 1 : 80 OR HIGHER WERE FOUND IN CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS, CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS, PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS, VARIOUS OTHER HEPATIC DISEASES AND ACUTE VIRUS HEPATITIS. 4. IN CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS THE <b>SMOOTH</b> <b>MUSCLE</b> <b>ANTIBODIES</b> WERE FOUND IN 83, 3 PER CENT OF THE CASES EXAMINED. THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH TITLES I. E.

40|$|Summary. -Cryostat {{sections}} and established in vitro cultures of dimethylnitrosamine(DMN) -induced renal mesenchymal tumours and monolayer cultures of transformed kidney cells derived from rats {{treated with a}} carcinogenic dose of DMN were examined by indirect immunofluorescence with human serum containing <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibody.</b> Eight mesenchymal tumours examined showed filamentous cytoplasmic staining of spindle cells infiltrating between renal tubules, whilst in normal kidneys interstitial cells were only weakly positive. In established in vitro cultures from 6 mesenchymal tumours, different patterns of staining were observed in morphologically different cell forms, ranging from fine filamentous staining in giant cells to diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence in small bipolar cells, and cell outline staining in polygonal cells. In addition, filamentous staining of microvillous projections and nucleolar staining were observed in some tumour cells. Monolayer cultures of transformed kidney cells showed strong staining of coarse, randomly-orientated cytoplasmic filaments, whilst fibroblasts cultured from normal rat kidney demonstrated an ordered array of fine, parallel filaments. Specificity of the immunofluorescent staining reaction was established by failure to obtain staining with normal serum, with <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibody</b> serum neutralized by homogenates of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> or extracts containing actin derived from <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle.</b> These results indicate {{that there is an}} apparent increase of actin-like contractile microfilaments in transformed cells and in renal mesenchymal tumours.

40|$|Background: Anti {{liver kidney}} microsome {{antibodies}} (LKM- 1) have been recently incorporated {{to the study}} and classification of chronic autoimmune hepatitis (HC-A 1). The presence of anti LKM- 1 antibodies and essential cryoglobulinemia is frequent in virus C associated chronic hepatitis (HC-VC). Aim: To study the frequency of anti LKM- 1 antibodies and cryoglobulin levels in patients with HC-AI, HC-VC and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Patients and methods: Forty two patients were studied. Nineteen adult women with classic HC-AI with positive antinuclear or anti <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Five patients of less than 20 years old with HC-AI and negative antinuclear and anti <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Ten adult women with cryptogenic cirrhosis, 4 women and 4 men with HC-VC. Serum samples were obtained at 37 °C. Antinuclear, anti smooth muscle and anti LKM- 1 antibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence using Hep- 2 cells and rat tissue slices as substrates. Cryoglobulins were determined by the traditional method and cryocrit. Results: All studied patients were anti LKM- 1 negative. All had significant circulating cryoglobulin levels. Conclusions: In this sample of patients with HC-AI or HC-VC, anti LKM- 1 antibodies were not detected but all had cryoglobulinemi...|$|E

Counterimmunoelectrophoresis was also used to detect antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens. <b>Smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibodies</b> with the V pattern or antinuclear antibodies, mainly of the speckled type, or anti-IMF, occurred in 35 cases, being widely distributed in all groups. Such an autoantibody response resembles the "viral" autoimmunity described in various infectious diseases and in particular that of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis. Autoantibodies may be of some prognostic relevance, as the prevalence of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibodies</b> V increased as the disease progressed (asymptomatic carriers 20 %, those with PGL 29 %, those with ARC 47 %, and those with AIDS 63 %.

40|$|Background Up to now, few {{data are}} {{available}} regarding the clinical characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome. The {{study was to investigate}} and analyze the prevalent and clinical features of Chinese patients with this disease. Methods Clinical data on patients diagnosed as autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome in our hospital from January 2001 to December 2006 were collected and analyzed. Results Overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis accounted for 10. 33 % of patients with autoimmune liver diseases during the past six years. For these patients with overlap syndrome, xanthochromia, lethargy and anorexia were the predominant complaints; a low incidence (14 / 146) of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity and a high incidence (37 / 89) of isolated IgM elevation were the main serological characteristics. Conclusions Overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis was not rare in Chinese patients with clinical manifests of autoimmune liver diseases. Overlap of the diseases should not be disregarded when isolated IgM elevation was exhibited, and <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibody</b> might have little diagnostic significance in the overlap syndrome.

40|$|In the {{diagnostic}} routine for tissue antibodies, using indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of human thyrotoxic thyroid, rat stomach and kidney, ninety-six out of 48, 388 sera showed a marginal staining of the membrane region of thyroid epithelial cells {{but no other}} reaction. Twenty-six of these sera were from patients with acute Yersinia enterocolitica serotype 3 infection but without signs of thyroid disease. Fifty of sixty-three sera with agglutinins against Y. enterocolitica serotype 3 and {{three out of four}} sera with agglutinins against Y. enterocolitica serotype 9 also showed this reaction on thyroid sections. It was due to antibodies, mostly of the IgG class, occurring in low titre, which react with intracytoplasmic antigens in thyroid, as staining of live thyroid epithelial cells was negative. The pattern of immunofluorescence on thyroid sections caused by these antibodies could not be distinguished from that caused by <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibodies</b> by appearance only. However, <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>antibodies</b> react also on other tissue sections and extracts of contractile proteins which absorb out these, did not change the reaction on thyroid of Y. enterocolitica sera. Absorption with sonicated Y. enterocolitica 3 and 9 antigens, but not with heat-killed whole bacteria, extinguished the reaction on thyroid. This indicates the presence of a cross-reactivity between antigens in these bacteria, different from the O antigen, and antigens in thyroid epithelial cells.
