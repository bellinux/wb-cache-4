50|$|In finance, a {{high-yield bond}} (non-{{investment}}-grade bond, <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bond,</b> or junk bond) is a bond that is rated below investment grade. These bonds {{have a higher}} risk of default or other adverse credit events, but typically pay higher yields than better quality bonds in order to make them attractive to investors. Sometimes the company can provide new bonds as a part of yield which can only be redeemed after its expiry or maturity.|$|E
40|$|This article {{shows that}} a sizable {{component}} of emerging market sovereign yield spreads is due to factors other than default risk, such as liquidity. The author estimates the non-default component of the yield spreads as the basis between the actual credit default swap (CDS) premium and the hypothetical CDS premium implied by emerging market bond yields. On average, the basis is large and positive for speculative-grade bonds and slightly negative for investment-grade bonds. The large positive basis for speculative-grade bonds supports the existence of speculation in the CDS market when the underlying's credit quality is bad. The author studies the effects of bond liquidity, liquidity in the CDS market, equity market performance, and macroeconomic variables on the non-default component of the emerging market yield spreads. The results show that bond liquidity has a significant and {{positive effect on the}} CDS–bond basis of investment-grade bonds. The results suggest that the liquid bonds of investment-grade bonds are more expensive relative to the prices implied their CDS premiums. However, the results are somewhat mixed and even contrary for the <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bond</b> sample. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} {{speculative}} bonds is affected {{to a higher}} degree than investment grade bonds {{by the possibility of}} default. For example, in a recession interest rates may drop, and the drop in interest rates tends to increase the value of investment grade bonds; however, a recession tends to increase the possibility of default in <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
40|$|Corporate bond spreads {{worldwide}} have widened markedly {{since the}} beginning of the credit crisis in 2007. This article examines default and liquidity risk [...] the main components of the corporate bond spread [...] for Canadian firms that issue bonds in the U. S. market, focusing in particular on their evolution during the credit crisis. They find that, during this period, the liquidity component increased more for <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds</b> than it did for investment-grade bonds, consistent with a "flight-to-quality" phenomenon. An important implication of their results for policy-makers seeking to address problems in credit markets is that the liquidity risk in corporate spreads for investment and speculative bonds behaves differently than the default risk, especially during crisis episodes. ...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{and other}} analysts look {{for signs of}} the economy’s current and future {{performance}} in many places, including the bond market. One recent signal from that market that may prove useful involves the spread in the yields between junk bonds and other long-term debt instruments. For example, the Merrill Lynch junk bond index has reached its highest level since the last recession, while investment-grade bond yields remain fairly low by historical standards. Junk <b>bonds,</b> or <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds,</b> are rated below Baa by Moody’s (and below BBB by Standard and Poor’s), the minimum rating for investment-grade bonds. Junk bonds also are called high-yield bonds because they carry significantly higher interest rates to compensat...|$|R
40|$|The SEC {{implemented}} Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) in 2000. Reg FD requires {{firms to}} release material information to everyone simultaneously, thereby reducing information asymmetry between favoured stock analysts and others. Bond rating agencies were exempt from Reg FD {{in order to}} continue receiving the private firm information necessary for accurate credit default assessments. The exemption, if valuable to the bond market, should have resulted in an increase in the relative importance of bond rating changes on bond yield premia when Reg FD was implemented. In the first empirical study on the impact of Reg FD on the bond markets, we explore this hypothesis by measuring bond yield premia reactions to bond rating changes around the implementation of Reg FD. For downgrades, we find the impact of Reg FD is related to firm size. The smallest firms experienced a significantly weaker bond yield premia response. The evidence for the relevance of Reg FD for upgrades is weak. Contrary to concerns from the Bond Market Association, it appears Reg FD lessened the impact of downgrades on the smallest firms, and did not affect <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds</b> or bonds with higher debt levels...|$|R
40|$|I {{propose a}} bond-specific, {{time-varying}} friction measure of round-trip liquidity costs. The measure is robust to outliers in daily bond returns and {{accounts for the}} idiosyncratic information behind bond trading decisions. Using transactions from January 2004 to December 2010, I find that liquidity costs display a strong correlation with credit conditions and peaked during the sub-prime crisis. The proposed measure also captures a smaller spike in liquidity costs for <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds</b> during the Ford/GM crisis of 2005. High-frequency measures of volatility alone explain about 50 % of the variation of yield spreads. After controlling for equity volatility, liquidity costs still explain a substantial fraction {{of the variation in}} the yield spreads of highly rated bonds. The properties of the proposed model are valuable in dealing with the credit risk puzzle, which pertains mainly to the investment-grade universe...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} wealth effect of {{shareholder}} activism on bond returns, {{as well as}} the extent to which wealth is transferred from bondholders to shareholders, which we refer to as the wealth-transfer effect. Our activist dataset includes both hedge funds and other large shareholders. Our bond dataset covers both investment-grade and <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds,</b> and extends beyond the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis period. We find that activists’ demands cause a significant decline in bond returns, and affect long-term bonds the most. There exists a strong association between the bond price declines and dividend increases following the activists’ demands, with dividends acting as a proxy for the transfer of wealth from bondholders to shareholders. The wealth transfer affects long-term and lower rated bonds more significantly. We find an inverse association between these bond returns and stock returns at firms targeted by activists...|$|R
40|$|What {{explains}} the wide swings in the default rate on high yield bonds in recent years? Differences in credit quality {{from year to}} year account for much of the observed variation in default rates, but economic conditions and the “age ” of bonds have also played a role. The market for high yield or <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds</b> 1 has grown from $ 30 billion of outstanding bonds in 1980 to nearly $ 250 billion today. Over this period, the market has evolved from a collection of “fallen angels”—bonds that have lost their investment-grade rating—into an established capital market for raising funds. Although the high yield market is now mature, its behavior during business cycle downturns is not well understood. During the severe recessions of 1980 - 82, when the market was in its infancy, few issuers of speculative bonds defaulted on their obligations to creditors. By contrast, in the mild recession of 1990 - 91, the defaul...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the nondefault component of corporate bond yield spreads and examine {{its relationship with}} bond liquidity. We measure bond liquidity using intraday transactions data and {{estimate the}} default component using the term structure of credit default swaps (CDS) spreads. With swap rate as the risk free rate, the estimated nondefault component is generally moderate but statistically significant for AA-, A-, and BBB-rated bonds and increasing in this order. With Treasury rate as the risk free rate, the estimated nondefault component is the largest in basis points for BBB-rated bonds but, as a fraction of yield spreads, {{it is the largest}} for AAA-rated bonds. Controlling for the unobservable firm heterogeneity, we find a positive and significant relationship between the nondefault component and illiquidity for investment-grade bonds but no significant relationship for <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds.</b> We also find that the nondefault component comoves with indicators for macroeconomic conditions.

40|$|Herein {{we explore}} whether {{macroeconomic}} announcements are a driving {{factor in the}} trading activity of US corporate bond market. Prior studies have documented a strong response of bond returns and interest rates to surprises in macroeconomic data in the US Treasury and Treasury futures markets. Studies have also documented that trading activity changes sharply, based on informational impulses provided by the release of economic data. We examine how daily and intraday measures of trading activity are impacted by surprises in macro data. Our main findings are that the thinly-traded market for corporate bonds is largely unaffected by surprises in individual economic reports and {{that the market is}} dominated by day-of-week and time-of-day affects. Out of a group of four widely-followed macroeconomic announcements, we find none of the announcements drive activity for investment grade bonds and that only surprises in the Producer Price Index contemporaneously affect <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds.</b> We do however, find a large and significant decrease in activity on Monday and Friday.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of out-of-sample forecasting perform-ance over a span of different parameters of l in the dynamic Nelson–Siegel three-factor AR(1) model. First, we fi nd that the ad hoc selection of l is not optimal. Second, we fi nd a substantial difference in factor dynamics between investment-grade and <b>speculative-grade</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> from 1994 : 12 to 2006 : 4. Third, we suggest that the three-factor model is suffi cient to explain the main variations of corporate yield changes. Finally, the parsimonious Nelson–Siegel three-factor AR(1) model remains competitive in the out-of-sample forecasting of corporate yields.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{exposure}} of the US corporate bond returns to liquidity shocks of stocks and Treasury bonds over the period 1973 - 2007 in a regime - switching model. In one regime, liquidity shocks have mostly insignificant effects on bond prices, whereas in another regime, a rise in illiquidity produces significant but conflicting effects: Prices of investment-grade bonds rise while prices of <b>speculative-grade</b> (junk) <b>bonds</b> fall substantially (relative to the market). Relating the probability of these regimes to macroeconomic conditions {{we find that the}} second regime can be predicted by economic conditions that are characterized as “stress. ” These effects, which are robust to controlling for other systematic risks (term and default), suggest the existence of time-varying liquidity risk of corporate bond returns conditional on episodes of flight to liquidity. Our model can predict the out-of-sample bond returns for the stress years 2008 - 2009. We find a similar pattern for stocks classified by high or low book-to-market ratio, where again, liquidity shocks play a special role in periods characterized by adverse economic conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Similar to equity {{mutual funds}} that {{practice}} window dressing by holding winning funds {{at the time of}} disclosure, many industry experts have speculated that bond mutual funds also practice window dressing by holding higher quality bonds during the time of disclosure. Despite such speculation, no direct test of window dressing behavior in bond mutual funds has been conducted. This paper attempts to fill that void. We examine portfolio credit quality holding and daily return patterns in a large sample of bond mutual funds and document evidence of window dressing. Using portfolio credit quality holdings data, we find that bond funds on average hold significantly more government bonds during disclosure than nondisclosure, presumably to present a safer portfolio to shareholders. We also detect a clientele of bond funds that increase positions in <b>speculative-grade</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> at disclosure, most likely in an attempt to advertise higher yields. Multiple index market models estimated with daily returns data corroborate these findings. We detect differences in factor loadings around disclosure periods that indicate systematic tilting of the portfolio toward one sector of the bond market and away from another. Consistent with our findings with portfolio holdings data, the market models indicate one clientele of funds that tilts toward government bonds and another that tilts toward corporate bonds...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 15 May 2012 Examining Board: Professor Elena Carletti, European University Institute (Supervisor); Professor Árpád Ábrahám, European University Institute; Professor Franklin Allen, University of Pennsylvania; Professor Jun Qian, Boston College. Since {{corporate}} investment {{is a key}} driver for economic growth, {{it is very important}} to find out what are the drivers of the cost of financing for private firms. In particular, this thesis studies the determinants of spreads of bonds issued by advanced and emerging market borrowers and the determinants of foreign-currency corporate credit ratings. Chapter 1 demonstrates that the impact of debt market illiquidity on corporate bond spreads is exacerbated with a higher proportion of short-term debt. This effect is present in both investmentgrade and <b>speculative-grade</b> <b>bonds</b> and is smaller in banks as they may have the support of a lender of last resort during periods of market illiquidity. The paper’s major finding is consistent with the predictions of structural credit risk models that argue that a higher proportion of short-term debt increases the firm’s exposure to debt market illiquidity through a ‘rollover risk’ channel. Although credit rating agencies have gradually moved away from a policy of never rating a corporation above the sovereign (the ‘sovereign ceiling’), it appears that sovereign credit ratings remain a significant determinant of corporate credit ratings. Chapter 2 examines this link using credit rating data for advanced and emerging economies over the period of 1995 to 2009. The results are consistent with a sovereign ceiling ‘lite’ policy or ceiling that is not an absolute constraint, but a limitation that tends to decrease corporate ratings when these ratings are above the sovereign rating. Finally, chapter 3 investigates the impact of capital account restrictions on spreads of corporate bonds issued in international markets by developed and emerging market borrowers. The main finding is that capital account restrictions on inflows significantly increase corporate bond spreads. A second main finding is that capital account restrictions on inflows matter a great deal more during times of financial distress.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of three {{corporate}} events on corporate bond prices in the U. S. Specifically, the first empirical essay examines whether bond prices exhibit delayed reactions to earnings announcements. The second essay examines whether bond prices react to equity analysts’ recommendation revisions and the third essay examines whether bond prices react to unexpected dividend changes. The results from the first essay show that the bond price reactions to earnings news are asymmetric, with greater reactions following negative earnings surprises than following positive earnings surprises. This {{is consistent with the}} Black–Scholes (1973) bond pricing model. Bond price reactions are also reported to be affected by bond risk. Because issuers of riskier bonds are more likely to face default, earnings news is reported to be more pertinent to the value of riskier bonds. The second essay reports similar asymmetric bond price reactions. The bond price reactions appear to be directed more towards recommendation downgrades than towards upgrades. In addition, riskier bonds tend to exhibit stronger reactions to recommendation revisions than safer bonds do. The third essay documents significant and negative bond price reactions to dividend cuts and the significant reactions of <b>speculative-grade</b> (riskier) <b>bonds</b> to dividend changes. The bond price changes are {{in the same direction as}} the dividend changes are, which supports the dividend information content hypothesis rather than the wealth expropriation hypothesis, which would predict opposite bond price reactions...|$|R
