6000|$|... 13. We {{have seen}} or heard of many {{extraordinary}} young men, who never ripened, or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary. When we see their air and mien, when we hear them speak of society, or books, or religion, we admire their superiority; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant, who is sent to work revolutions. But they enter an active profession, and the forming Colossus[358] shrinks to the common size of man. The magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always make the Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they put their horses of the sun to plow in its furrow. They found no example and no companion, and their heart fainted. What then? The lesson they gave in their first aspirations, is yet true; and a better valor and a purer truth shall one day organize their belief. Or why should a woman liken herself to any historical woman, and think, because Sappho,[359] or Sévigné,[360] or De Staël,[361] or the cloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation, do not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis,[362] none can,--certainly not she. Why not? <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> and unattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed. Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her way, accept the hint of each new experience, search, in turn, all the objects that solicit her eye, that she may learn {{the power and the}} charm of her new-born being which is the kindling of a new dawn in the recesses of space. The fair girl, who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of influences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and lofty, inspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness. The silent heart encourages her; O friend, never strike sail to a fear! Come into port greatly, or sail with God the seas. Not in vain you live, for every passing eye is cheered and refined by the vision.|$|E
6000|$|But as {{respects the}} frivolity of the proof adduced, {{there was nothing}} to choose between Catholic and Protestant. Out of civil and canon law a net was woven through whose meshes there was no escape, and into it the victims were driven by popular clamor. Suspicion of {{witchcraft}} was justified by general report, by the ill-looks of the suspected, by being silent when accused, by her mother's having been a witch, by flight, by exclaiming when arrested, I am lost! by a habit of using imprecations, by the evidence of two witnesses, by the accusation of a man on his death-bed, by a habit of being away from home at night, by fifty other things equally grave. Anybody might be an accuser,--a personal enemy, an infamous person, a child, parent, brother, or sister. Once accused, the culprit was not to be allowed to touch the ground on the way to prison, was not to be left alone there lest she have interviews with the Devil and get from him the means of being insensible under torture, was to be stripped and shaved in order to prevent her concealing some charm, or to facilitate the finding of witch-marks. Her right thumb tied to her left great-toe, and vice versa, she was thrown into the water. If she floated, she was a witch; if she sank and was drowned, she was lucky. This trial, as old as the days of Pliny the Elder, was gone out of fashion, the author of De Lamiis assures us, in his day, everywhere but in Westphalia. [...] "On halfproof or strong presumption," [...] says Bodin, the judge may proceed to torture. If the witch did not shed tears under the rack, it was almost conclusive of guilt. On this topic of torture he grows eloquent. The rack does very well, but to thrust splinters between the nails and flesh of hands and feet [...] "is the most excellent gehenna of all, and practised in Turkey." [...] That of Florence, where they seat the criminal in a hanging chair so contrived that if he drop asleep it overturns and leaves him hanging by a rope which wrenches his arms backwards, is perhaps even better, [...] "for the limbs are not broken, and without trouble or labor one gets out the truth." [...] It is well in carrying the accused to the chamber of torture to cause some in the next room to shriek fearfully as if on the rack, that they may be terrified into confession. It is proper to tell them that their accomplices have confessed and accused them ("though they have done no such thing") that they may do the same out of revenge. The judge may also with a good conscience lie to the prisoner and tell her that if she admit her guilt, she may be pardoned. This is Bodin's opinion, but Walburger, writing a century later, concludes that the judge may go to any extent citra mendacium, this side of lying. He may tell the witch that he will be favorable, meaning to the Commonwealth; that he will see that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> house built for her, that is, a wooden one to burn her in; that her confession will be most useful in saving her life, to wit, her life eternal. There seems little difference between the German's white lies and the Frenchman's black ones. As to punishment, Bodin is fierce for burning. Though a Protestant, he quotes with evident satisfaction a decision of the magistrates that one [...] "who had eaten flesh on a Friday should be burned alive unless he repented, and if he repented, yet he was hanged out of compassion." [...] A child under twelve who will not confess meeting with the Devil should be put to death if convicted of the fact, though Bodin allows that Satan made no express compact with those who had not arrived at puberty. This he learned from the examination of Jeanne Harvillier, who deposed, [...] "that, though her mother dedicated her to Satan so soon as she was born, yet she was not married to him, nor did he demand that, or her renunciation of God, till she had attained the age of twelve." ...|$|E

6000|$|At {{a quarter}} to seven, or a little later, Colonel Ponsonby called [...] with a {{communication}} from her Majesty. “Any news?” I said. “A [...] great deal,” he replied; and informed me as follows. Mr. Disraeli [...] {{had been with the}} Queen; did not see the means of carrying on the [...] government by the agency of his party under present circumstances; [...] did not ask for the dissolution of parliament (this was understood [...] to mean did not offer to become minister on condition of being [...] permitted to dissolve); did not say that his renunciation of the [...] task was final; recommended that the Queen should call for my [...] advice. Upon this the Queen sent Colonel Ponsonby, and he said, [...] “She considers this as sending for you anew.” I replied that I did [...] not regard the Queen’s reference of this intelligence to me, as [...] her calling upon me anew to undertake the work of government; that [...] none of my obligations to the sovereign were cancelled or impaired [...] by the resignation tendered and accepted; that I was still the [...] minister for the purpose of rendering any service she might be [...] pleased to call for in the matter on which she is engaged, exactly [...] as before, until <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> minister, when my official [...] obligations will come to an end. That I felt there was great [...] inconvenience and danger of misapprehension out of doors in [...] proceeding over-rapidly with a matter of such gravity, and that [...] each step in it required to be well measured and ascertained [...] before proceeding to consider of the next following step. That I [...] had great difficulty in gathering any precise idea of Mr. [...] Disraeli’s account of what he could not do, and what he either [...] could or did not say that he could not. That as this account was [...] to present to me the state of facts on which I was commanded to [...] advise, it was quite necessary for me to have an accurate idea of [...] it, in order that I might do justice to her Majesty’s commands. I [...] would therefore humbly suggest that Mr. Disraeli might with great [...] propriety be requested to put his reply into writing. That I [...] presumed I might receive this reply, if it were her Majesty’s [...] pleasure to make it known to me, at some not late hour to-morrow, [...] when I would at once place myself in a condition to tender my [...] humble advice. This is an account of what Colonel Ponsonby might [...] fairly consider as my answer to her Majesty’s communication. I [...] enlarged the conversation, however, by observing that the division [...] which overthrew us was a party division. It bore the express [...] authentic symbol of its character in having party tellers on the [...] opposition {{as well as on the}} government side; that we were aware [...] of the great, even more than ordinary, efforts of Colonel Taylor, [...] with Mr. Disraeli’s countenance, to bring members to London and to [...] the House; that all this seemed to impose great obligations on the [...] opposition; and if so, that it would be the duty of the leader of [...] the opposition to use every exertion of consultation with his [...] friends and otherwise before declining the task, or in any manner [...] advising the Queen to look elsewhere. To Colonel Ponsonby indeed, [...] I observed that I thought Mr. Disraeli was endeavouring, by at [...] once throwing back on me an offer which it was impossible for me [...] at the time and under the circumstances to accept, to get up a [...] case of absolute necessity founded upon this refusal of mine, and [...] thus, becoming the indispensable man and party, to have in his [...] hands a lever wherewith to overcome the reluctance and resistance [...] of his friends, who would not be able to deny that the Queen must [...] have a government.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have been}} so tosticated about since my last, that I could not go on in my journal manner, though my {{shoulder}} {{is a great deal}} better; however, I feel constant pain in it, but I think it diminishes, and I have cut off some slices from my flannel. I have lodged here near a fortnight, partly for the air and exercise, partly to be near the Court, where dinners are to be found. I generally get a lift in a coach to town, and in the evening I walk back. On Saturday I dined with the Duchess of Ormond at her lodge near Sheen, and thought to get a boat back as usual. I walked by the bank to Cue (Kew), but no boat, then to Mortlake, but no boat, and it was nine o'clock. At last a little sculler called, full of nasty people. I made him set me down at Hammersmith, so walked two miles to this place, and got here by eleven. Last night I had another such difficulty. I was in the City till past ten at night; it rained hard, but no coach to be had. It gave over a little, and I walked all the way here, and got home by twelve. I love these shabby difficulties when they are over; but I hate them, because they arise from not having a thousand pound a year. I had your N.30 about three days ago, which I will now answer. And first, I did not relapse, but found(2) I came out before I ought; and so, and so, as I have told you in some of my last. The first coming abroad made people think I was quite recovered, and I had no more messages afterwards. Well, but John Bull is not writ by the person you imagine, as hope!(3) It is too good for another to own. Had it been Grub Street, I would have let people think as they please; and I think that's right: is not it now? so flap ee hand, and make wry mouth oo-self, sauci doxi. Now comes DD. Why sollah, I did write in a fortnight my 47th; and if it did not come in due time, can I help wind and weather? am I a Laplander? am I a witch? can I work miracles? can I make easterly winds? Now I am against Dr. Smith. I drink little water with my wine, yet I believe he is right. Yet Dr. Cockburn told me a little wine would not hurt me; but it is so hot and dry, and water is so dangerous. The worst thing here is my evenings at Lord Masham's, where Lord Treasurer comes, and we sit till after twelve. But it is convenient I should be among them for a while as much as possible. I need not tell oo why. But I hope that will be at an end in a month or two, one way or other, and I am resolved it shall. But I can't go to Tunbridge, or anywhere else out of the way, in this juncture. So Ppt designs for Templeoag (what a name is that!). Whereabouts is that place? I hope not very far from Dublin. Higgins is here, roaring that all is wrong in Ireland, and would have me get him an audience of Lord Treasurer to tell him so; but I will have nothing to do in it, no, not I, faith. We have had no thunder till last night, and till then we were dead for want of rain; but there fell a great deal: no field looked green. I reckon the Queen will go to Windsor in three or four weeks: and if the Secretary takes a house there, I shall be sometimes with him. But how affectedly Ppt talks of my being here all the summer; which I do not intend: nor to stay one minute longer in England than becomes the circumstances I am in. I wish you would go soon into the country, and take a good deal of it; and where better than Trim? Joe will be your humble servant, Parvisol your slave, and Raymond at your command, for he piques himself on good manners. I have seen Dilly's wife--and I have seen once or twice old Bradley(4) here. He is very well, very old, and very wise: I believe I must go see his wife, when I have leisure. I should be glad to see Goody Stoyte and her husband; pray give them my humble service, and to Catherine, and to Mrs. Walls--I am not the least bit in love with Mrs. Walls--I suppose the cares of the husband increase with the fruitfulness of the wife. I am grad at halt(5) to hear of Ppt's good health: pray let her finish it by drinking waters. I hope DD had her bill, and has her money. Remember to write a due time before ME money is wanted, and be good galls, dood dallars, I mean, and no crying dallars. I heard somebody coming upstairs, and forgot I was in the country; and I was afraid of a visitor: that is one advantage of being here, that I am not teased with solicitors. Molt, the chemist, is my acquaintance. My service to Dr. Smith. I sent the question to him about Sir Walter Raleigh's cordial, and the answer he returned is in these words: [...] "It is directly after Mr. Boyle's receipt." [...] That commission is performed; if he wants any of it, Molt shall use him fairly. I suppose Smith is one of your physicians. So, now your letter is fully and impartially answered; not as rascals answer me: I believe, if I writ an essay upon a straw, I should have a shoal of answerers: but no matter for that; you see I can answer without making any reflections, as becomes men of learning. Well, but now for the peace: why, we expect it daily; but the French have the staff in their own hands, and we trust to their honesty. I wish it were otherwise. Things are now in the way of being soon in the extremes of well or ill. I hope and believe the first. Lord Wharton is gone out of town in a rage, and curses himself and friends for ruining themselves in defending Lord Marlborough and Godolphin, and taking Nottingham into their favour. He swears he will meddle no more during this reign; a pretty speech at sixty-six, and the Queen is near twenty years younger, and now in very good health; for you must know her health is fixed by a certain reason, that she has done with braces (I must use the expression), and nothing ill is happened to her since; so <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> lease of her life. Read the Letter to a Whig Lord.(6) Do you ever read? Why don't you say so? I mean does DD read to Ppt? Do you walk? I think Ppt should walk to(7) DD; as DD reads to Ppt, for Ppt oo must know is a good walker; but not so good as Pdfr. I intend to dine to-day with Mr. Lewis, but it threatens rain; and I shall be too late to get a lift; and I must write to the Bishop of Clogher. 'Tis now ten in the morning; and this is all writ at a heat. Farewell deelest... deelest MD, MD, MD, MD, MD, FW, FW, FW, ME, ME, ME, Lele, ME, Lele, ME, Lele, ME, Lele, Lele, Lele, ME.|$|E
