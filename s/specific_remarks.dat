The announcement was made on August 9, 2001, that both the soundtrack and the film would be postponed three weeks, respectively from August 21 to September 11, and from August 31 to September 21. When asked regarding the motives behind the delay, Nancy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Music Group Worldwide, addressed Carey's personal and physical condition:Mariah is looking forward to being able to participate in both her album and movie projects and we are hopeful that this new soundtrack release date will allow her to do so. She has been making great recovery progress, and continues to grow stronger every day. Virgin Music Worldwide continues to give its absolute commitment and support to Mariah on every level.When discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed the terrorist attacks of September 11.

Also, it investigated {{if there is}} a relationship between students' perceptions about verbal irony and their length of stay in the US. The research also included ascertaining what structure both Japanese and American students seem to prefer when they make ironic or sarcastic comments. The subjects were 23 Japanese graduate and undergraduate students and 20 American undergraduate students who had studied or were currently studying at Ball State University. The survey consisted of two different components. Survey 1 was designed to measure the relationship between nationality and perception of each situationally-based ironic or sarcastic comment, and between length of stay and each comment. Survey 2 measured the relationship between items (specific structures) and nationality, and between items and gender. The results of survey 1 found a correlation between nationality and the perceptions of some of the ironic or sarcastic remarks and situations.

40|$|Background: Blepharoplasty of {{the upper}} eyelids {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} performed procedures in aesthetic plastic surgery. However, the rationale for muscle resection along with skin is uncertain. Methods: A PubMed search was performed using the following keywords: 'blepharoplasty' and 'muscle' as well as 'blepharoplasty' and ` orbicularis'. This yielded 419 different hits. All abstracts from English, Dutch, German or French papers were scanned for potential relevance; of which 59 papers were retrieved. The papers were considered to be relevant for our review if they described their technique for upper blepharoplasty and if they mentioned whether or not they resected orbicularis oculi muscle. Papers describing blepharoplasty combined with other surgical interventions were not included unless <b>specific</b> <b>remarks</b> about the blepharoplasty and the role of orbicularis resection were made. Studies describing a surgical technique specifically designed to create an epicanthal fold in Asians were excluded as well. Results: In total, 55 papers were included for review. Various reasons for muscle resection are described; most authors resect muscle without providing a reason to do so. In more recent literature, a trend towards muscle preservation is observed. Conclusions: A lack of consensus about what is to be done with the orbicularis oculi muscle in upper lid blepharoplasty is demonstrated. This amounts to a shortcoming, especially in training young plastic surgeons. Therefore, an algorithm is proposed. (C) 2009 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

40|$|Purpose: Increasing medicolegal litigations, {{claims and}} {{compensation}} have forced doctors {{to make some}} defensive changes in their practice. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the prevalence of defensive practice among psychiatrists in Middle Eastern countries along with examining the relationship of defensiveness with seniority and previous medicolegal experiences. Methods: A questionnaire with thirteen questions was shared among 215 psychiatrists practicing in Middle Eastern countries. The collected data were analysed statistically using SPSS version 21. Results: Ninety-two valid responses were received and analysed, out of which sixty-two of them were from Saudi Arabia. An overall 30 % (n = 28 / 92) of the psychiatrists have taken a defensive action in their practice in the past one month. Nearly 28 % (n = 26 / 92) of them approved unwanted patient admission, 30 % (n = 28 / 92) kept the patient on a higher observation. Both these defensive actions are less prevalent among the senior psychiatrists. While 24 % (n = 22 / 92) and 30 % (n = 28 / 92) of psychiatrists had written <b>specific</b> <b>remarks</b> such as “not suicidal” and dictated letters more than necessary for managing patient's illness, respectively, and this behaviour was more prevalent among senior psychiatrists. Conclusion: An overall 30 % (n = 28 / 92) of the psychiatrists have taken a defensive action in their practice over the past one month. Knowledge and experience of previous medicolegal issues were important factors influencing the defensive practice. The propensity of junior psychiatrists to practice defensively may be attributed to decreased confidence. More systematic problem-based training, proper guidelines for practice insurance and more clarity and transparency in the investigation and handling of medicolegal issues may help reduce the defensive practice and improve better patient care...|$|E
40|$|Aggregating the {{knowledge}} of many people is a powerful tool, especially {{if you know how}} to aggregate the private information efficiently. 2 Otherwise, if a firm does not use its employees ’ private information efficiently, the information will be lost, and the firm will not have it available for its decision processes. Every employee, when contributing information to an organization’s information pool, faces the risk of getting into trouble because some other employee might be offended and could react harshly. Economically speaking, an employee has to bear various kinds of costs if he chooses to say something. These costs can effectively silence the employee. For example: I raised a concern about some policies and I was told to shut up and that I was becoming a trouble maker.

40|$|This {{report is}} to {{complement}} the original Fleischner Society recommendations for incidentally detected solid nodules by proposing a set of recommendations specifically aimed at subsolid nodules. The development of a standardized approach to the interpretation and management of subsolid nodules remains critically important given that peripheral adenocarcinomas represent {{the most common type}} of lung cancer, with evidence of increasing frequency. Following an initial consideration of appropriate terminology to describe subsolid nodules and a brief review of the new classification system for peripheral lung adenocarcinomas sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS), six specific recommendations were made, three with regard to solitary subsolid nodules and three with regard to multiple subsolid nodules.

The recommendations are the result of careful review of the literature now available regarding subsolid nodules. Given the complexity of these lesions, the current recommendations are more varied than the original Fleischner Society guidelines for solid nodules. It cannot be overemphasized that these guidelines must be interpreted in light of an individual's clinical history. Given the frequency with which subsolid nodules are encountered in daily clinical practice, and notwithstanding continuing controversy on many of these issues, it is anticipated that further refinements and modifications to these recommendations will be forthcoming as information continues to emerge from ongoing research...|$|R
