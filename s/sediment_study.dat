Despite adequate availability of surface water, several water resources projects have not been yielding expected output primarily due to sedimentation problems, which were underestimated at design stage {{in most of the}} cases. Sediment production in Nepalese watersheds has generally been acknowledged to be {{the highest in the world}} and little reliable data of actual sediment production is available. Attempts were made to study the sedimentation processes in the Kulekhani Reservoir, Nepal and efforts were made to find appropriate sediment management options to keep Kulekhani Reservoir Sustainable.

40|$|Background: UniFrac is a {{well-known}} tool for comparing microbial communities and assessing {{statistically significant differences between}} communities. In this paper we identify a discrepancy in the UniFrac methodology that causes semantically equivalent inputs to produce different outputs in tests of statistical significance. Results: The phylogenetic trees that are input into UniFrac may or may not contain abundance counts. An isomorphic transform can be defined that will convert trees between these two formats without altering the semantic meaning of the trees. UniFrac produces different outputs for these equivalent forms of the same input tree. This is illustrated using metagenomics data from a lake <b>sediment</b> <b>study.</b> Conclusions: Results from the UniFrac tool can vary greatly for the same input depending on the arbitrary choice of input format. Practitioners should be aware of this issue and use the tool with caution to ensure consistency and validity in their analyses.

40|$|Over {{the last}} half century the study of rockshelter and cave sediments has evolved from {{straightforward}} descriptive analysis to sophisticated examination on several scales—from field observations to bulk laboratory analyses to microscopic examination. Still an integrated theory to guide the interpretation of these analyses does not exist, {{in part because of the}} idiosyncratic nature of individual caves and rockshelters. This paper reviews studies that couple field observations with laboratory analyses including particle size, pebble morphology, chemical, and mineralogical studies to provide, first, the necessary basic description of the sediments and, second, an interpretation of the environment of sedimentation. These studies can lead to an understanding of site-formation processes during human occupation, and eventually to a reconstruction of local and, in some cases, regional paleoclimates. Furthermore, <b>sediment</b> <b>study</b> is essential for intrasite correlation, independent of artifact, faunal, floral, and radiometric techniques.

The mean percentage reduction of glucose uptake rates ranged from 37 to 58 in the water samples exposed to crude oil and from 14 to 36 in the sediment samples. Substrate uptake kinetic studies indicated that the observed reductions by microbial populations exposed to crude oil were caused by metabolic inhibition.

Data on samples collected in Cook Inlet suggested that areas where pelagic microorganisms are most probably chronically exposed to crude oil are also the areas where the effects of crude oil on glucose uptake are the lowest.

The effect mechanisms of peat extraction on {{water quality and}} aquatic ecology of the receiving surface waters are well known, but the impacts are often difficult to differentiate from those of forest management. A pairwise temporal <b>sediment</b> <b>study</b> was conducted on two adjacent lakes in Central Finland to study whether the unique effects of peat extraction can be detected {{in an area of}} intensive forest drainage. Both lakes are affected by forestry, but the reference lake has no history of peat extraction in its watershed. The deepest parts of the lakes were cored through the lacustrine sediments, and the recent carbon and dry matter sedimentation rates were compared to their site-specific reference values. Recent changes in benthic macroinvertebrates (chironomids) and diatom algae were studied to assess the ecological effects of these practices in the lakes. No significant differences in recent increases in carbon accumulation were found between the peat extraction-impacted lake and the reference lake. The pairwise comparison allowed identification of a regional pattern of impacts that is closely related to the history of land use, particularly forestry, in the region. The approach also allowed identification of the transient signs of peat extraction in the chemical and chironomid records of the impacted lake.
