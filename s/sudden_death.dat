40|$|End-stage {{renal disease}} {{patients}} experience a {{high incidence of}} <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death.</b> We performed a 5 -year prospective study in 230 end-stage renal disease patients, aiming to determine the role of echocardiography and the additional value of serum biomarkers in predicting <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death.</b> During follow-up, 24 % of all deaths were attributed to <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death.</b> In the multivariable Cox regression analysis considering clinical, biochemical, dialysis, and echocardiographic parameters, left ventricular systolic dysfunction emerged as the most significant predictor of <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death,</b> followed by a high systolic and a low diastolic blood pressure. An ejection fraction cutoff ≤ 48. 0 % is associated with a specificity of 78. 6 % and a sensitivity of 57. 7 % in predicting <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death.</b> In biomarker-based multivariable Cox regression analysis, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide displays an independent association with <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death</b> and is more significantly associated with <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death</b> than cardiac troponin T. In the combined echocardiography and biomarker-based multivariable Cox regression model, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide loses significance to left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas cardiac troponin T retains a significant association with <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death</b> independent of echocardiographic parameters. In conclusion, systolic dysfunction is the most significant predictor of <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death</b> followed by a high systolic and a low diastolic blood pressure. Our data suggest additional value in measuring cardiac troponin T for <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death</b> risk stratification. N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide may be used in place of echocardiography to identify patients at risk of <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death</b> but had no added value over echocardiography in predicting <b>sudden</b> cardiac <b>death.</b> © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Compiling an extensive database of <b>sudden</b> <b>deaths</b> of 270 directors in the U.

For our control sample of inside or gray directors, we find that stock prices do not react in any significant way to these events. This difference in abnormal returns following the <b>sudden</b> <b>deaths</b> of independent, gray and inside directors is statistically and economically significant. Positions in board, experience, age, and educational backgrounds are the main determinants of the negative abnormal returns. Consistent with the value of independent directors, we find that stock prices react less negatively when the independent director has long tenure or is a senior board member. Overall, our results demonstrate that independent directors provide a service valued by shareholders...|$|R
