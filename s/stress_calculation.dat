Several areas of application exist that mainly {{differ in the}} power of the lasers that are used, and in the results of the scanning process. Low laser power is used when the scanned surface doesn't have to be influenced, e.g. when it only has to be digitised. Confocal or 3D laser scanning are methods to get information about the scanned surface.

40|$|AbstractThree {{dimensional}} <b>stress</b> <b>calculation</b> {{of competitive}} swimwear using anisotropic hyperelastic model considering stress softening {{was investigated in}} this paper. An anisotropic hyperelastic model considering stress softening of swimwear fabrics was introduced in order to reproduce the mechanical characteristics of swimwear fabrics on the analysis. The cyclic tensile loading test was carried out to evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the swimwear fabrics. From the test results, the mechanical characteristics of swimwear fabrics show strong-anisotropy and the stiffness of the fabrics shows hardening along {{with the increase of}} stretch. Also, the test results show reduction of stiffness which depended on the maximum deformation previously reached {{in the history of the}} swimwear fabrics. From the test results, material parameters of the anisotropic hyperelastic model and the stress softening model were approximated. The theoretical calculations were in good agreements with experimental data. In addition, the pressure measurement tests were conducted to measure the pressure of swimwear tightening the cylinder. The theoretical pressure calculated by the proposed model showed similar trend of pressure measurement tests. Finally, 3 -dimentional <b>stress</b> <b>calculation</b> of swimwear was conducted using the anisotropic hyperelastic model considering stress softening.

30|$|We {{developed}} an inversion technique to determine in situ stresses for elliptical boreholes of arbitrary trajectory.

The method has been demonstrated by {{a case study in}} the Appalachian Basin, USA. The calculated horizontal stresses are in reasonable agreement with the reported regional stress study of the area, although there are no field measurement data of the studied well for direct calibration.

50|$|Since {{wind tunnel}} {{tests showed that}} a 16 sides {{transverse}} section had about the same drag as a circular one, both R100 and R101 used {{a smaller number of}} longitudinal girders than previous airships in order to simplify <b>stress</b> <b>calculations.</b> Even so, the calculations for the transverse frames required hand computation that took two or three months to produce a solution for each frame. The thoroughness of the <b>stressing</b> <b>calculations</b> was a consequence of new Air Ministry criteria for the strengths required of airships, formulated in response to the catastrophic structural failure of R38 in 1921. However, fewer longitudinal girders resulted in larger unsupported panels of fabric in the envelope. Flight trials were to prove that the R100's covering was barely adequate. The envelope of R101 was also unsatisfactory, and a failure in its cover was possibly a cause of its crash.|$|R

40|$|Kawa 1 LEDFAA is a {{computer}} program {{which is based on}} layered elastic analysis (LEA) and fullscale test data. It {{has been a part of}} the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Advisory Circular AC 150 / 5320 - 16 since 1995. However, one of the limitations of LEDFAA for rigid pavements is the lack of a direct slab edge <b>stress</b> <b>calculation.</b> Slab interior stress is calculated first, then converted into edge stress using transformation functions developed for specific aircraft. The FAA has been working on replacing the indirect slab edge <b>stress</b> <b>calculation</b> in LEDFAA with a direct slab edge <b>stress</b> <b>calculation</b> using a three-dimensional finite element method (3 D-FEM). Requirements of the new procedure are that it run on any personal computer, be user-friendly, and be applicable to any gear configuration. The FAA plans to produce a 3 D-FEM based design procedure as a new design standard for release in FY 2006. A finite element model of the pavement structure was developed and run with a general-purpose 3 D-FEM program (NIKE 3 D) available in the public domain. NIKE 3 D and its associated preprocessor program INGRID were originally developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA. Both programs have been recompiled as dynamic-link libraries and incorporated into LEDFAA. Currently, the project has moved to the stage of implementation of the new modified design procedures incorporating the 3 D-FEM model. This paper presents the structure of the new FAA program for pavement thickness design. Example results from the program are presented and compared with results from the existing FAA design procedures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presented}} analysis of Bending stress and Contact stress of Involute spur gear teeth in meshing. There are {{several kinds of}} stresses present in loaded and rotating gear teeth. Bending stress and contact stress (Hertz <b>stress)</b> <b>calculation</b> is the basic of stress analysis. It is difficult to get correct answer on gear tooth stress by implying fundamental stress equation, such as Lewis formula for bending stress and Hertz equation for contact stress. The detailed gear stressing is the key of this paper. The design of an effective and reliable gearing system is include its ability to withstand RBS (Root Bending Stress) and SCS (Surface Contact Stress). Various research methods such as Theoretical, Numerical and Experimental have been done throughout the years. We primarily prefer Theoretical and Numerical methods because Experimental testing can be expensive. So many researchers have utilized FEM to predict RBS and SCS. In this study we use a 3 D model of gear and finite element analysis to conduct RBS and SCS calculation for mating involute spur gears. A pair of involute spur gear without tooth modification and transmission error is define in a CAD system (CATIA V 5 and AUTODESK INVENTOR etc.) and FEA is done by using finite element software ANSYS. Obtained FEA results is comparable with theoretical and AGMA standard. It is found that Lewis formula and Hertz equation is used for quick <b>stress</b> <b>calculation</b> for gear, where as the AGMA standards and FEM is used for detailed gear <b>stress</b> <b>calculation</b> {{for a pair of}} involute spur gear...|$|E
