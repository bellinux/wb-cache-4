40|$|By {{the model}} {{experiment}} it was ascertained {{that it was}} possible to bring forth a thrusting-force through the movements of the scale-plates opening slowly and shutting quickly; but it seems that no examination has been done yet on the living fishes. This time, using carps, we made a few microscopic samples of sliced skins, to study the structure of scale-plates-cusps and to confirm the opening and shutting possibilities of the <b>scale</b> <b>plates.</b> Using 16 mm camera, we filmed the surface of the fish-body (the series of <b>scale</b> <b>plates)</b> and visualized the flowing on its surface by the hydrogen-bubble method, and examined the thrusting-occurrence-possibility from the biological and physical points of view. In case of carps, the results obtained are as in the following： (1) Considering from the results obtained in the biological study it seemed that the scale-plates-cusps were not in independent and separated states, but were restricted by the tissues around the <b>scale</b> <b>plates,</b> therefore it was assumed that no wiggling of the fish-body caused the opening and shutting of the <b>scale</b> <b>plates.</b> (2) Considering from the results obtained in the physical study, it was ascertained that there was a series of slipping of <b>scale</b> <b>plates</b> along the fish-body-axis at the time when the fish was swimming. In case of the swimming fish with the body-length of 35 cm, apart from the swimming speed, the value of the slipping of <b>scale</b> <b>plates</b> was noted to be constant (at the mean value 0. 9 mm) from the midship of the fish body to the back-end of the dorsalfin. By visualization, it was ascertained that the flowing on the fish-body-surface showed a sort of laminar flow but, owing to the visualization limit of the hydrogen-bubble method, it was almost impossible to confirm the flowing state upon the fish-body-surface under the high speed flowing. (3) In the experiment in which some amount of ink was dropped on the surface of the <b>scale</b> <b>plates</b> of the fish anesthetized on the dish, at the back-side of the scale-plate there was some attachment of blue-ink noted, both in the resting and in the wiggling states of the fish, which was in contradiction with the biologycal result described above. Therefore, it was assumed that concerning the possibility of thrusting-force-occurrence, further physical and biological studies of the epidermis would be necessary...|$|R

40|$|Wiggle-motion {{of a fish}} causes {{an opening}} to be made between the scales in the {{direction}} of body-breadth. Irrespective of the small breadth of the opening, if the scale-rising on the body-surface is slow on the convex-side of the wiggle, returning quickly to the former state on the concave-side of it, the occurrence of thrusting is assumed. This thrusting is supposed to decrease the swimming-resistance of fish in cooperation with the effect of the progressive-wave of the <b>scale</b> <b>plates,</b> running from forward to backward.

First, a geometric scale factor and a dynamic pressure scale factor are defined to relate the stiffness, load and deformation of the equivalent plate to the aircraft wing. A procedure using an optimization technique is presented to create <b>scaled</b> equivalent <b>plate</b> models from the full scale aircraft wing using geometric and dynamic pressure scale factors. The scaled models are constructed by matching the stiffness of the <b>scaled</b> equivalent <b>plate</b> with the <b>scaled</b> aircraft wing stiffness.

Homografts elicited an immune response, which {{was measured by}} determining median survival times and inflammatory reactions under various conditions.

The duration and intensity of the host's inflammatory reaction were {{closely associated with the}} rapidity of donor tissue destruction. The duration of the first inflammatory phase was dependent upon the rapidity of soft tissue destruction, while the second inflammatory phase was associated with slow digestion of the acellular <b>scale</b> <b>plate.</b> Both soft tissue and <b>scale</b> <b>plate</b> digestion showed the second-set phenomenon.

40|$|AbstractMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key enzymes in the {{turnover}} of extracellular matrix in health, disease, development and regeneration. We have studied zebrafish scale regeneration {{to ascertain the}} role of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in these processes. Scales were plucked {{from the surface of}} anaesthetised adult male zebrafish, and the scales that regenerated in the scale pocket were recovered at various time points after plucking. Analyses consisted of (i) mmp- 9 in situ hybridisation; (ii) MMP- 9 +TRAcP double-staining; (iii) qRT-PCR for mmp- 2 and mmp- 9; (iv) zymography for gelatinolytic activity and (v) a hydroxyproline assay. We found that mmp- 9 positive cells were confined to the episquamal side of the scales. Ontogenetic scales had irregular clusters of mono- and multinucleated mmp- 9 expressing cells along their lateral margins and radii. During regeneration, mmp- 9 positive cells were seen on the <b>scale</b> <b>plate,</b> but not along the lateral margins. Double staining for TRAcP and MMP- 9 revealed the osteoclastic nature of these cells. During early scale regeneration, mmp- 2 and mmp- 9 transcripts increased in abundance in the scale, enzymatic MMP activity increased and collagen degradation was detected by means of hydroxyproline measurements. Near the end of regeneration, all of these parameters returned to the basal values seen in ontogenetic scales. These findings suggest that MMPs {{play an important role in}} remodelling of the <b>scale</b> <b>plate</b> during regeneration, and that this function resides in mononucleated and multinucleated osteoclasts which co-express TRAcP and mmp- 9.

40|$|Precipitation of {{amorphous}} silica (SiO 2) in geothermal power plants, although a common factor limiting {{the efficiency of}} geothermal energy production, is poorly understood and no universally applicable mitigation strategy to prevent or reduce precipitation is available. This is primarily {{due to the lack}} of understanding of the precipitation mechanism of {{amorphous silica}} in geothermal systems. In the present study data are presented about microstructures and compositions of precipitates formed on <b>scaling</b> <b>plates</b> inserted at five different locations in the pipelines at the Hellisheiði power station (SW-Iceland). Precipitates on these plates formed over 6 to 8 weeks of immersion in hot (120 or 60 ºC), fast-flowing and silica-supersaturated geothermal fluids (∼ 800 ppm of SiO 2). Although the composition of the precipitates is fairly homogeneous, with silica being the dominant component and Fe sulfides as a less common phase, the microstructures of the precipitates are highly variable and dependent on the location within the geothermal pipelines. The silica precipitates have grown through aggregation and precipitation of silica particles that precipitated homogeneously in the geothermal fluid. Five main factors were identified that may control the precipitation of silica: (1) temperature, (2) fluid composition, (3) fluid-flow regime, (4) distance along the flow path, and (5) immersion time. On all <b>scaling</b> <b>plates,</b> a corrosion layer was found underlying the silica precipitates indicating that, once formed, the presence of a silica layer probably protects the steel pipe surface against further corrosion.
