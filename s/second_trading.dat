50|$|The crash started {{overnight}} in Asia as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 6%. However, {{the most widely}} watched Asian market, Japan's Nikkei 225, only fell 2% on the day. The losses spread to the European markets where London's FTSE 100 Index fell 98.90 points, or just about 2%, to 4,871.30. The Frankfurt DAX index fell sharply as well. The U.S. markets were widely expected to open lower for the day. The Dow, NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500 all declined for the entire session. At 2:36 pm, when the Dow fell 350 points, the Dow hit its first trading curb halt which lasted 30 minutes. After then, stocks continued their immense slide, eventually hitting the <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> curb at 550 points and trading has ended at 3:35 pm. The <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> curb usually halts trading for one hour, but since there were only 25 {{minutes left in the}} session, the New York Stock Exchange had just decided to end trading early. However, Nasdaq trading continued until 4:00 p.m.|$|E
5000|$|The scheme {{has been}} divided {{into a number}} of [...] "trading periods". The first ETS trading period lasted three years, from January 2005 to December 2007.

50|$|In 1834, New York Methodist {{minister}} Jason Lee {{came to the}} Oregon Country as {{the first}} of these missionaries, to establish the first American settlement and to convert the native population. The party was called the Wyeth-Lee Party as Lee had contracted with Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, who was going on his <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> expedition, to accompany him. The party set out on April 28, 1834 traveling independently from the American Fur Company's caravan headed for the same destination. Lee built a mission school for Indians in the Willamette Valley at the site of present-day Salem, Oregon. The school evolved from a mission school to a secondary school called the Oregon Institute, eventually becoming Willamette University, the oldest university on the West Coast.|$|E
50|$|In 1829, {{brothers}} Peter and James Godfroy {{established a}} trading post on this site, {{which was then}} called Notawasepe, to trade with the local Potawatomi. Their father, Col.

The Godfroys owned a <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> post at Coldwater; their agent there was James's brother-in-law, Patrick Marantette. In 1833, Marantette replaced Mouton at Notawasepe. However, that same year the Treaty of Chicago was signed, which took {{most of the land}} owned by the local band of Potawatomi. Although some land was left to them, the US government was encouraging Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi River, and the writing was on the wall.|$|E

50|$|In 1793, these {{problems}} culminated in {{an order from}} the Spanish Governor General Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, in which all trade between settlers and tribes was to cease. Hector also ordered a military expedition against the Osage and other tribes. However, Hector was persuaded toward peace by an Osage delegation led by Chouteau to New Orleans {{in the spring of}} 1794. To convince Hector of peace, Chouteau promised a military fort built among the Osage at his own expense. In return, Chouteau was given a six-year monopoly on trade along the Osage River. After its construction in 1795, Fort Carondelet, although acting as a military base, was in practice a trading post for the Chouteau family. The fort also served as home to Chouteau's nephews, who gained valuable experience as traders. Through contacts at this post, Chouteau also negotiated construction of a <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> post among the Osage, located on the Verdigris River in eastern Kansas from 1795 to 1797.|$|E
5000|$|In 1834 Wyeth {{outfitted}} a new expedition, {{with plans}} for establishing fur-trading posts, a salmon fishery, a colony, and other developments. Included in the company were two noted naturalists, Professor Thomas Nuttall (1786-1859) of Harvard University, and John Kirk Townsend, plus the missionary Jason Lee. Wyeth's party headed to the rendezvous held on the Hams Fork, near by what is now Granger, Wyoming, with 13,000 pounds of goods and reached there on the 19th of June. William Sublette had {{become aware of the}} contract between Wyeth and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and forced the company to forfeit the contract. Continuing west with Thomas McKay, a stepson of McLoughlin, Wyeth quickly founded Fort Hall (July 1834) in southeastern Idaho. The Methodists were guided by McKay to Fort Nez Percés, but by the time Wyeth reached there he had left back east, leaving the missionaries with Pambrun. Following the Columbia River Wyeth's <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> station Fort William was built on Wapato Island at present-day Portland, Oregon. Upon seeing the deserted Multnomah villages caused from recent disease epidemics, Wyeth noted that [...] "providence has made room for me and with doing them Natives more injury than I should if I had made room for myself viz Killing them off." ...|$|E
50|$|Reports of {{securities}} trading in Hong Kong {{date back to}} the mid-19th century. However, the first formal market, the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong, was not established until 1891. The Association was renamed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1914.A second exchange, the Hong Kong Stockbrokers' Association was incorporated in 1921. The two exchanges merged to form the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1947 and re-establish the stock market after the Second World War.Rapid growth of the Hong Kong economy led to the establishment of three other exchanges - the Far East Exchange in 1969; the Kam Ngan Stock Exchange in 1971; and the Kowloon Stock Exchange in 1972.Pressure to strengthen market regulation and to unify the four exchanges led to the incorporation of SEHK, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1980. The four exchanges ceased business on 27 March 1986 and the new exchange commenced trading through a computer-assisted system on 2 April 1986. Prior to the completion of the merger with HKFE in March 2000, the unified stock exchange had 570 participant organisations.Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited was incorporated in 1989. It created CCASS, the central clearing and settlement system, which started operating in 1992 and became the central counterparty for all CCASS participants.The clearing operation is based on the immobilisation of share certificates in a central depository. Share settlement is on a continuous net settlement basis by electronic book entry to participants' stock accounts in CCASS. Transactions between CCASS participants are settled on T+2, the <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> day following the transaction.The company also offers nominee service.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies {{a unique}} buyback method {{allowing}} firms to reacquire their own shares {{on a separate}} trading line where only the firm is allowed to buy shares. This temporary trading platform is opened concurrently with the original trading line on the stock exchange. This share repurchase method is called the <b>Second</b> <b>Trading</b> Line and has been extensively used by Swiss companies since 1997. This type of repurchase is unique for two reasons. First, unlike open market programs, the repurchasing company does not trade {{under the cover of}} anonymity. Second, all transactions made by the repurchasing firm are publicly available in real time to every market participant. This is a case of instantaneous disclosure which contrasts sharply with other markets characterized by delayed or no disclosure. Using actual repurchase data from all buybacks implemented through <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> lines, we document that the daily repurchase decision is statistically associated with short-term price changes and the release of firm-specific news. We also find that repurchases on the <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> line have a beneficial impact on the liquidity of repurchasing firms (i. e., higher trading volumes, smaller bid-ask spreads, and thicker total depths). Exchanges and regulators may consider the <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> line an attractive share reacquisition mechanism because of its transparenc...|$|E

40|$|The EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{that covers}} {{emitters}} from {{industry and the}} energy sector representing 40 percent of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions is the biggest implementation worldwide of a cap-and-trade scheme. The EU ETS has been the core instrument of European climate policy since its start in 2005. Based on a database comprising more than 10, 000 installations in 26 EU countries, this paper provides a thorough analysis {{of the performance of}} the EU ETS in the period 2005 to 2010. In the first part, we analyse allocation patterns – i. e., the stringency of allocation caps and distribution issues – on EU country and sector level comparing the results of the EU ETS pilot phase and {{the first three years of}} the Kyoto phase. In the second part of the paper, we assess trading flows of European Allowance Units (EUAs) between EU countries comparing the results for the first and <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> period. Furthermore, we analyse the use of credits from flexible mechanisms – Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from CDM projects and Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) from JI projects – that installations may surrender since the beginning of the <b>second</b> <b>trading</b> period on country level. ...|$|E
