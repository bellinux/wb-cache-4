Those without tickets {{gathered}} at City Hall {{to watch the}} game's progress as charted on two large scoreboards. Before {{the start of the}} game, New York Supreme Court judge Robert F. Wagner, then a candidate for the United States Senate, threw out the ceremonial first pitch and took his position in the VIP box next to New York City mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Landis and former {{heavyweight champion of the world}} Jack Dempsey were also in attendance. Southpaw Bill Sherdel started for the Cardinals, having posted a 16–12 record with 235 innings pitched in the regular season. The Yankees started Pennock, the team's only 20-game winner that season.

5000|$|When {{the match}} ended, people said the <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> [...] "disturbing and {{traumatic}} absolute silence", {{except for the}} euphoria and celebration of the Uruguayan players and delegation.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the years}} empty {{spots in the}} <b>stadium</b> <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> seats. Together with some other changes in the stadium the number of seats {{increased}} to the current 26,800.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the event}} which gathers more people {{and on a}} regular basis is the 'Superclasico' basketballQuilmes-Peñarol, where the <b>stadium</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> fans and {{supporters}} and sometimes even sold out completely. On that day, you have big security operation to prevent violence between the two factions.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{made and}} {{inspired}} from a kudu horn, the vuvuzela {{was used to}} summon distant villagers to attend community gatherings. The vuvuzela is most used at football matches in South Africa, {{and it has become}} a symbol of South African football as the <b>stadiums</b> <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> its sound. The intensity of the sound caught the attention of the global football community during the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in anticipation of South Africa hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup.|$|R
50|$|In December 2007 it was {{the first}} time after the 1999 Kosovo War that the <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> 30,000 people, for a concert by the American rapper 50 Cent.|$|E
50|$|Big matches (especially those against rival club Beitar Jerusalem) {{can attract}} large crowds but {{toward the end}} of the 2005-06 season when the club was set to be relegated, the {{attendance}} at matches declined dramatically. The peak of fan attendance was the Israel State Cup final when Ramat Gan <b>Stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> Arabs from Israel who had all come to support the club.|$|E
50|$|Record {{attendance}} was noted at 8 April 1984, when the <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> about 45,000 spectators, while the official capacity {{at that time}} was only 40 000. The opponent was Widzew Łódź and match ended with 1-0 Lech’s victory. A few years later, Municipal Stadium was equipped with an electronic scoreboard, which was placed behind the sector number 8. For many years, there had not been any modernization work besides installing new plastic chairs in the early 90s.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1938 and {{had a long history}} of hockey games. The {{greatest}} event was the match against Düsseldorfer EG in the 1990s when the DEG was still the biggest player in German hockey. The <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> then <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> over 10,500 people.|$|R
50|$|Authors {{have cited}} defense {{arguments}} in the O. J. Simpson murder trial {{as an example of}} this fallacy regarding {{the context in which the}} accused had been brought to court: crime scene blood matched Simpson's with characteristics shared by 1 in 400 people. The defense argued that a football <b>stadium</b> could <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> Angelenos matching the sample and that the figure of 1 in 400 was useless.|$|R
5000|$|The Nature segment showcased the Australian outback, {{wildlife}} and flora. It began with various fire performers (jugglers, breathers) {{moving across the}} stadium floor, symbolising the advance of a bushfire. In the aftermath, performers representing the flora stir as the land is replenished with water and life. The <b>stadium</b> floor <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> performers dressed in costumes representing various flowers including Australia's distinctive wild flowers such as the Golden Wattle (Australia's national flower), the Waratah (State flower of N.S.W), the Sturt's Desert Pea, Water Lilies and Eucalypt flowers. The fauna, which were represented by 7 large paintings by Jeffrey Sammuels, were then revealed, depicting the indigenous animal life in Australia. The dream like music heard during this sequence was composed and conducted by Australian composer, Chong Lim. The flowers once more were illuminated before {{moving out of the}} stadium.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{establishment}} of J. League in 1992, the team had used tracked Urawa Komaba Stadium as its home stadium. Due to the increasing popularity of the matches, Saitama City, owner of the stadium, expanded the seat capacity some times. The team used Ōmiya Park Soccer Stadium until the works were complete. In spite of the poor performance of the team, the <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> faithful supporters, drawing an average audience of twenty thousand people.|$|E
50|$|On 1 September 1974, the Seventh Asian Games were officially opened. The list of {{the guests}} included— Shah of Iran Mohammad-Reza Pahlavi, then Prime Minister of Iran Amir Abbas Hoveida, cabinet members of Iranian Government, President of Israel Ephraim Katzir, President of South Korea Park Chung-hee, King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej, {{diplomatic}} corps and representatives of participating Asian NOCs.

5000|$|Houston {{traveled}} to Goodwin Stadium in Tempe, Arizona {{for the next}} game on their schedule which was {{a meeting with the}} Arizona State Sun Devils of the Border Conference. The Sun Devils were coached by first-year head coach Clyde Smith. Smith came to Arizona State from Indiana, where he had coached since 1948. Arizona State's record {{at this point in the}} season was 3-1, as they had lost to San Jose State two games prior. [...] This was another first meeting for the Cougars, and Goodwin <b>Stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a sold-out crowd of 15,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of Munster's support was demonstrated during Munster's 2006 and 2008 Heineken Cup final wins. News reports detailed the lengths that fans {{were willing to}} go to secure tickets to the game, with some Munster fans travelling to Biarritz to buy up the French allocation of tickets. On the day of the game the Millennium <b>Stadium</b> in Cardiff <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a capacity crowd of 74,500. Of those numbers it is estimated that somewhere between 55,000 and 65,000 were Munster fans with the remainder being neutrals and Biarritz supporters. The Millennium <b>Stadium</b> <b>was</b> intended to be a neutral venue but commentators on the day remarked that it could hardly be counted as such. In North America there is an official supporters club called Munster Rugby USA.|$|R
5000|$|Tiger <b>Stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> to {{capacity}} <b>with</b> 68,000 fans packing the stands. As expected, {{the game was}} a defensive struggle. The Rebels scored a field goal in the first quarter, and {{spent the rest of}} the game relying on defense and trying to pin the Tigers deep in their own territory. They punted on early downs and gambled on LSU making mistakes on offense. The gambles paid off, as the Tigers fumbled four times in the game. An interception by Cannon early in the fourth quarter caused Ole Miss coach Johnny Vaught to abandon the offensive game completely. He had his quarterback and punter, Jake Gibbs, punt on first downs. [...] "They kept punting the ball, sticking us back in a hole," [...] Cannon recalled, [...] "and I thought, 'If I can get my hands on this one, I'm going to take it back.'" ...|$|R

In the 1960s, the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory was constructed in a tunnel 15 meters underneath Upper Alumni Fields. For many years, a cider track was located on Upper Alumni Fields {{to the east of}} Lynah Rink, but the 151900 sq ft Bartels Hall field house designed by Gwathmey & Siegel (1990), and the Friedman Wrestling Center (2002) were built on the site of that track. A replacement track and field complex, named for Robert J. Kane and William E. Simon was built on the east end of Upper Alumni Fields in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 April (25 March {{according}} to the Julian calendar then in use in Greece), the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened; it was Easter Monday for both the Western and Eastern Christian Churches and the anniversary of Greece's independence. The Panathenaic <b>Stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> an estimated 80,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece, his wife Olga, and their sons.

5000|$|The {{historical}} for Cypriot football match {{meant that}} the unification of Cyprus football was now a reality. It was the first match between a right-wing and a left-wing club in Cyprus. The match was scheduled to start at 3.25 pm. The stands of the stadium were overwhelmed with people and at 2:15 pm was already full. The <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> 5,200 fans of both teams. The entrance was set at one shilling. Total earnings had amounted to 260 pounds, {{a significant amount of}} that era. Anorthosis won 3-1 with goals from Panos Siailo (49' and 70') and Loizo Chatziloizou (64'). Nea Salamina had temporarily equalized with Antonis Vrachimis [...] "Tzioumpis".|$|E
50|$|After, another {{plethora of}} youngsters from ASPIRE, sprinted around the stadium in a sheer energy and joyfulness chasing the {{official}} mascot {{of the games}} - Orry the Arabian oryx. Qatar {{always wanted to be}} on the sports map again and this performance done by the youngsters created an emphasis on youth to comprehend that Qatar wants to be the sports capital of the Middle East. However, this was just a small portion of this described as magnificent and wonderful opening ceremony. The <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> spectators from all around the Asian continent also some of their heads-of-state in attendance to support their country. An array of lights lit the stadium with multi-coloured lights.|$|E
50|$|In May 1946 CVB {{celebrated its}} 25 years of {{existence}} {{with an international}} tournament on Curaçao. Visiting teams were Aruba, Surinam, Atlético Junior from Colombia and Feyenoord from the Netherlands. Curaçao won all their matches and the last match against the famous Dutch team Feyenoord attracted {{a large number of}} spectators. Curaçao won 4-0. In July 1946 the national selection of Curaçao travelled to the Netherlands to reinforce the bond between Curaçao and the Netherlands. During their three months’ stay the Curaçao selection played 9 matches against Dutch teams of which the 3-3 draw against Feyenoord, one of the big Dutch teams, is vividly remembered. The <b>stadium</b> in Rotterdam <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> over 37.000 spectators, almost as much as the inhabitants of Curaçao at the time! The young Curaçao goalkeeper Ergilio Hato made a lasting impression with his great athletic abilities and amazing jumping power.|$|R
40|$|In November 2005, a man {{was convicted}} in New York City for a thirty-two-year-old rape. The {{circumstances}} were quite unusual, even for cold cases. The original 1974 trial had ended in a hung jury, and the defendant had jumped bail before his scheduled re-trial. He was apprehended in 2004 in Georgia on another charge, and a background check disclosed the open New York warrant. The crucial difference between the 1974 and 2005 trials was DNA evidence recovered from the underpants which the victim wore {{on the day of}} the crime, 2 ̆ 2 found stuffed in the files in the Manhattan district attorney 2 ̆ 7 s cold case unit. 2 ̆ 2 Unimaginable a generation ago, DNA evidence now virtually guarantees a conviction in a sex offense case. DNA forensic procedures have attained the courtroom air of flawlessness, often referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 mystical spell 2 ̆ 2 of DNA. DNA is heroic truth. It is the forensic equivalent of divine intervention, with its Herculean capacity to free the falsely convicted and-just as importantly-to demonstrate that no malefactor can escape justice, no matter how long it takes. In her closing argument in the 2005 rape case, the Assistant District Attorney told the jury that the DNA profile recovered from the victim 2 ̆ 7 s underwear and that of the defendant were 2 ̆ 2 identical in every way. 2 ̆ 2 Then she clinched her point: 2 ̆ 2 Yankee <b>Stadium</b> could <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> 50, 000 people once a day for 54, 000 years and there would not be another person who would match [the rapist 2 ̆ 7 s] profile. 2 ̆ 2 The prosecutor stressed to the jury that, by contrast to the 2 ̆ 2 total domination 2 ̆ 2 by the assailant during the brutal attack, now it was the victim 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 turn to hold the power-her turn, because DNA works. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|The stadium was {{put into}} {{operation}} in 1971, it was named the guards stadium or Hetman Białystok stadium. Initially, the stadium contained 15,000 seats. After two years of modernizing the bleachers the capacity contained approximately 30,000 seats. In the late '80s when Jagiellonia, {{for the first time}} in history entered the first league, the <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> 20-30,000 people per game. In the '90s the stadium fell to disrepair as the team fell back to the second, third and fourth leagues. The situation changed at the beginning of the 21st century with the improvement of the sporting and financial condition of Jagiellonia. In 2005, with the money received from promotions the stadium was upgraded with 6,000 new chairs.|$|E
5000|$|One of the game's most iconic plays was one {{known as}} the [...] "hit heard 'round the world," [...] when Bills linebacker Mike Stratton laid a {{particularly}} hard hit on Chargers running back Keith Lincoln that broke a rib and forced {{him out of the}} game midway through the first quarter. Lincoln had over 330 yards of offense in the previous year's title game and had already rushed for 47 yards, caught a pass for 11 yards, and kicked an extra point (as the reserve placekicker) in the first 6½ minutes. Without Lincoln and Alworth, the San Diego offensive attack was severely hindered. War Memorial <b>Stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a sellout attendance of 40,242.|$|E

50|$|The <b>stadium</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> 28,000 Newcastle fans, {{while no}} more than a dozen Londoners had made the trip, with Palace {{themselves}} believing only two or three of their own supporters were in the crowd. It was a cold and wet January day, with a light breeze, and the Newcastle fans gave the Palace team a good reception, rather than the hostile one they might have been expecting. When the game got under way Newcastle started off somewhat complacently. Their passes were going astray and they allowed Palace to impose themselves. Before long the Southern league side were in control. Dickie Roberts, playing on the wing for Palace, was too much for Newcastle's Scottish international defender Andy McCombie, and whilst his crosses were mostly coming to nothing, they were starting to unsettle the crowd. The opening twenty minutes were largely chance free, but then Roberts turned McCombie once again and had the ball in the net, only for the goal to be disallowed controversially as off-side.|$|E
