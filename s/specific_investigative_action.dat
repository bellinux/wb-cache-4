These are actions that are usually entrenched in some of the fundamental rights of citizens and are applied when other identifying actions are not or may not be effective in terms of generating new evidence. Also, the paper aims to present the differences between the classic actions of identification which is much lower degree of violation of the right to privacy and the inclusion of <b>specific</b> <b>investigative</b> <b>actions</b> of surveillance and technical recording of telecommunication where there is a high degree of restriction of the right to privacy of the suspect or other persons.

30|$|General {{pattern of}} actions between novices and experts, {{specifically}} {{if the number}} of investigative, information seeking, and total number also, was investigated. Complex novices performed more <b>investigative</b> <b>actions</b> (M[*]=[*] 12.86, SD[*]=[*] 4.85) than simple novices (M[*]=[*] 7.46, SD[*]=[*] 2.70). In contrast, complex experts performed less <b>investigative</b> <b>actions</b> than simple experts (M[*]=[*] 13.60, SD[*]=[*] 7.20 and M[*]=[*] 16.00, SD[*]=[*] 8.19, respectively). Overall, we observed that experts performed more <b>investigative</b> <b>actions</b> than novices (M[*]=[*] 14.50, SD[*]=[*] 7.09 and M[*]=[*] 9.35, SD[*]=[*] 4.36, respectively). For information seeking actions, complex novices performed slightly fewer actions than simple novices (M[*]=[*] 7.29, SD[*]=[*] 4.42 and M[*]=[*] 8.31, SD[*]=[*] 9.60, respectively). Complex experts on average performed over twice as many information seeking actions as simple experts (M[*]=[*] 22.20, SD[*]=[*] 16.72 and M[*]=[*] 9.00, SD[*]=[*] 9.64, respectively), and the simple experts performed slightly more information seeking actions than either of the novice groups. Experts overall sought more information than novices (M[*]=[*] 17.25, SD[*]=[*] 15.27 and M[*]=[*] 7.95, SD[*]=[*] 8.04, respectively).|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop an}} in vivo {{dosimetry}} based <b>investigative</b> <b>action</b> level relevant for a corrective protocol for HDR brachytherapy boost treatment. Methods and materials The dose delivered to points within the urethra and rectum {{was measured using}} TLD in vivo dosimetry in 56 patients. Comparisons between the urethral and rectal measurements and TPS calculations showed differences, which {{are related to the}} relative position of the implant and TLD trains, and allowed shifts of implant position relative to the prostate to be estimated. Results and conclusions Analysis of rectal dose measurements is consistent with implant movement, which was previously only identified with the urethral data. Shift corrected doses were compared with results from the TPS. Comparison of peak doses to the urethra and rectum has been assessed against the proposed corrective protocol to limit overdosing these critical structures. An initial investigative level of 20 % difference between measured and TPS peak dose was established, which corresponds to 1 / 3 of patients which was practical for the caseload. These patients were assessed resulting in corrective action being applied for one patient. Multiple triggering for selective <b>investigative</b> <b>action</b> is outlined.

30|$|Within {{the first}} count {{regression}} model, {{performance on the}} SEB survey was examined to determine if it significantly predicted {{the total number of}} actions. SEB was entered into the model in two different ways to see which one was more appropriate for the final model. First, each of the four SEB domains was entered as four separate variables; second, the SEB total average score was entered as one variable. Keeping everything else the same, both models were fitted and the count regression model with the total average SEB (model deviance: 98.5481, AICC: 268.6583), fitted better than the same model with four separate variables for SEB survey performance (model deviance: 97.5033, AICC: 289.4212). The same relationship existed between the models when predicting the <b>investigative</b> number of <b>actions</b> and information seeking number of actions. Thus, for all three of the Poisson count regression models, the total average SEB was used as a predictor. Total number of actions and information seeking number of actions were significantly predicted by SEB survey performance (χ 2 [*]=[*] 27.87, p[*]<[*]. 0001 and χ 2 [*]=[*] 42.66, p[*]<[*]. 0001), respectively. However, the total number of <b>investigative</b> <b>actions</b> was not significantly predicted by SEB performance. Finally, the relationship between expert verb score and actions performed in SCI within the three Poisson count regression models discussed above was examined. Expert verb score significantly predicted the total number of actions (χ 2 [*]=[*] 12.36, p[*]=[*]. 0004) and number of <b>investigative</b> <b>actions</b> (χ 2 [*]=[*] 14.03, p[*]=[*]. 0002), but it did not contribute significantly in predicting the number of information seeking actions.|$|R
