40|$|Abstract—The {{significant}} {{growth of}} Internet traffic and increase of routing tables require solutions to address Internet scalability and resiliency. A possible direction {{is to move}} away from the flat legacy Internet routing to hierarchical routing, <b>separating</b> <b>edge</b> networks from transit networks. In this paper, we study the extended traffic engineering capabilities arising in a transit-edge separated Internet routing, focusing on those multi-homed edge networks (e. g., Cloud/content providers) that aim at increasing their Internet resiliency experience. We model using game theory the interaction between distant independent edge networks exchanging large traffic volumes, with the goal of seeking efficient edge-to-edge load-balanced routing solutions. The proposed traffic engineering framework relies on a noncooperative potential game, built upon locator and path ranking costs, that indicates efficient equilibrium solution for the edge-toedge load-balancing coordination problem. Simulations on real instances show that in comparison to BGP and LISP we can achieve significantly higher resiliency and stability 1. I...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the size}} and {{dynamics}} of the global routing table have increased rapidly along {{with an increase in}} the number of edge networks. The relation between edge network quantity and routing table size/dynamics reveals a major limitation in the current architecture; there is a conflict between provider-based address aggregation and edge networks ’ need for multihoming. Two basic directions towards resolving this conflict have surfaced in the networking community. The first direction, which we dub separation, calls for <b>separating</b> <b>edge</b> networks from the transit core, and engineering a control and management layer in between. The other direction, which we dub elimination, calls for edge networks to adopt multiple provider-assigned addresses to enable provider-based address aggregation. In this paper, we argue that separation is a more promising approach to scaling the global routing system than elimination, and can potentially be leveraged to bring other architectural improvements to today’s Internet that an elimination approach cannot. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the class of 2 -dimensional Artin groups with connected, large type, triangle-free defining graphs (type CLTTF). We classify these groups up to isomorphism, and describe a generating set for the automorphism group of each such Artin group. In the case where the defining graph has no <b>separating</b> <b>edge</b> or vertex we show that the Artin group is not abstractly commensurable to any other CLTTF Artin group. If, moreover, the defining graph satisfies a further `vertex rigidity' condition, then the abstract commensurator group of the Artin group is isomorphic to its automorphism group and generated by inner automorphisms, graph automorphisms (induced from automorphisms of the defining graph), and the involution which maps each standard generator to its inverse. We observe that the techniques used here to study automorphisms carry over easily to the Coxeter group situation. We thus obtain a classification of the CLTTF type Coxeter groups up to isomorphism and a description of their automorphism groups analogous to that given for the Artin groups.

At finite magnetic field the backscattering length is increased up to the micron-scale and the quantum point contacts are connected adiabatically.

The absence of backscattering is explained in terms of selective population of spatially <b>separated</b> <b>edge</b> channels. Evidence is provided by regular Aharonov−Bohm-type conductance oscillations in transverse magnetic fields, in agreement with magnetoconductance calculations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{significant}} {{growth in}} the global Internet traffic and routing table size requires solutions to address Internet scalability and resiliency. A number of proposals have considered {{moving away from the}} flat legacy Internet routing to a two-level hierarchical routing, <b>separating</b> <b>edge</b> networks from transit carrier networks. In this paper, we study the extended inter-domain traffic engineering capabilities arising in a transit-edge separated Internet routing, focusing on those multi-homed edge networks (e. g., small ISPs, content providers, large corporations) that aim at increasing their Internet resiliency experience. We model using game theory the interaction between distant independent edge networks exchanging large traffic volumes, with the goal of seeking efficient edge-to-edge load-balancing routing solutions. The proposed traffic engineering framework relies on a non-cooperative potential game, built upon path prepending- and path diversity- dependent costs, that indicates efficient equilibrium solution for the edge-to-edge load-balancing coordination problem. Simulations on real instances show that, in comparison with the alternative multipath BGP and normal LISP, we can achieve significantly higher resiliency and stability. In particular, our simulation for an illustrating case shows four-times more stable multipath routing solutions with a five-times larger path diversity...|$|E
40|$|In the 2 -reachability {{problem we}} are given a {{directed}} graph G and we wish {{to determine if there}} are two (edge or vertex) disjoint paths from u to v, for a given pair of vertices u and v. In this paper, we present an algorithm that computes 2 -reachability information for all pairs of vertices in O(n^ω n) time, where n is the number of vertices and ω is the matrix multiplication exponent. Hence, we show that the running time of all-pairs 2 -reachability is only within a factor of transitive closure. Moreover, our algorithm produces a witness (i. e., a <b>separating</b> <b>edge</b> or a separating vertex) for all pair of vertices where 2 -reachability does not hold. By processing these witnesses, we can compute all the edge- and vertex-dominator trees of G in O(n^ 2) additional time, which in turn enables us to answer various connectivity queries in O(1) time. For instance, we can test in constant time if there is a path from u to v avoiding an edge e, for any pair of query vertices u and v, and any query edge e, or if there is a path from u to v avoiding a vertex w, for any query vertices u, v, and w.

Let ∆ denote a simplicial graph with vertex set V (∆) and edge set E(∆) ⊂ V (∆) × V (∆). Suppose also that every edge e = {s,t} ∈ E(∆) (between vertices s,t) carries a label me = mst ∈ N≥ 2. Given such a labelled graph we define the group G(∆) by the presentation G(∆) = 〈 V (∆) | ststs · · · } { {} mst = tstst · · · } { {} mst for all {s,t} ∈ E(∆) 〉. This group G(∆) {{is known as the}} Artin group associated to the defining graph 1 ∆. Adding the relations s 2 = 1 for each s ∈ V (∆) yields a presentation of the associated Coxeter group W(∆) of type ∆. We denote ρ ∆ : G(∆) → W(∆) the canonical quotient map obtained by this addition of relations. The following observations are true for all Artin groups and were proved in [14]. If T is a full subgraph of ∆ then the subgroup of G(∆) generated by the vertices of T is canonically isomorphic 1 Our notion of defining graph differs from the frequently used “Coxeter graph ” where, by contrast, the absence of an edge between s and t indicates a commuting relation (mst = 2) and the label mst = ∞ is used to designate the absence of a relation between s and t...|$|E

Since the system has edges, the eigenvalue problem is supplied by the boundary conditions (BC) aimed in preventing the leakage of matter away across the edges. In the case of spinless electrons the Dirichlet and Neumann BC are considered. The Dirichlet BC result in the existence of charge carrying edge states. For the Neumann BC each <b>separate</b> <b>edge</b> comprises two counterflow sub-currents which precisely cancel out each other provided the system is populated by electrons up to certain Fermi level. Cancelation of electric current is a good starting point for developing the spin-effects. In this scope we reconsider the problem for a spinning electron with Rashba coupling. The Neumann BC are replaced by Robin BC. Again, the two counterflow electric sub-currents cancel out each other for a <b>separate</b> <b>edge,</b> while the spin current survives thus modeling what is known as pure spin current [...] spin flow without charge flow.

Let $G$ be a directed graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices. We present a collection of $O(n) $-space data structures that, after $O(m+n) $-time preprocessing can accomplish the following tasks: $(i) $ Report in $O(n) $ worst-case time all the strongly connected components obtained after deleting a single edge (resp., a single vertex) in $G$. $(ii) $ Compute {{the total number of}} strongly connected components obtained after deleting a single edge (resp., vertex) in total worst-case $O(n) $ time for all edges (resp., for all vertices). $(iii) $ Compute the size of the largest and of the smallest strongly connected components obtained after deleting a single edge (resp., vertex) in total worst-case $O(n) $ time for all edges (resp., for all vertices). All our bounds are tight. After the same $O(m+n) $-time preprocessing, we can also build an $O(n) $-space data structure that can answer in asymptotically optimal time the following basic $ 2 $-edge and $ 2 $-vertex connectivity queries on directed graphs: $(i) $ Test whether an edge or a vertex separates two query vertices in $O(1) $ worst-case time. $(ii) $ Report all edges or all vertices that separate two query vertices in optimal worst-case time.

Here, we use scanning gate microscopy to demonstrate the presence of QH Coulomb islands, and reveal the spatial structure of transport inside a QH interferometer. Locations of electron islands are found by modulating the tunnelling between edge states and confined electron orbits. Tuning the magnetic field, we unveil a continuous evolution of active electron islands.
