30|$|Learning <b>SLAM</b> {{is a new}} {{topic that}} gained {{attention}} recently due {{to the development of}} deep learning. We think it is different from geometric metric <b>SLAM</b> and topological <b>SLAM</b> by a single category. Learning <b>SLAM</b> can obtain camera pose and 3 D map but needs a prior dataset to train the network. The performance of learning <b>SLAM</b> depends on the used dataset greatly and it has low generalization ability. Therefore, learning <b>SLAM</b> is not as flexible as geometric metric <b>SLAM</b> and the geometric map obtained outside the used dataset is not as accurate as geometric metric <b>SLAM</b> most of the time. However, simultaneously, learning <b>SLAM</b> has a 3 D map other than 2 D graph representations.|$|R

At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and <b>slammed</b> Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on.

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th.

40|$|Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (<b>SLAM)</b> is {{the process}} of {{simultaneously}} building a map and localizing in it, and can be used for autonomous navigation. <b>SLAM</b> deals with estimation of vehicle states and landmarks. Most <b>SLAM</b> algorithms are based on extended Kalman filters (EKFs). However, the use of EKF for <b>SLAM</b> is not the best choice, as it works only for `mild' nonlinear environments owing to the assumption of first order Taylor series approximations of process and observation models. A few researchers has also proposed the use of other estimation techniques like particle filters, unscented Kalman filters (UKFs), etc for <b>SLAM.</b> In this paper, we propose the use of a cubature Kalman filter (CKF) for the estimation of the <b>SLAM</b> augmented state vector.
