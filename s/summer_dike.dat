40|$|On {{the role}} of soil seed bank and {{dispersal}} in restoration of salt-marsh vegetation Plans {{have been made to}} restore salt-marsh communities in 1000 ha of present summerpolders in the area of Noard-Fryslân Bûtendyks. The effects of breaching the <b>summer</b> <b>dike</b> at three places of a polder of 135 ha will be monitored as a pilot study before working at a larger scale in the future. The present vegetation in the summer polders features plants of fresh, fertilized communities as a result of intensive agricultural exploitation. The restoration cannot rely on the soil seed bank of halophytic plant species as a record of that previously existing salt-marsh community. Hence, restoration will depend on the dispersal of diaspores of halophytic plant species from a nearby source area info the target area. Such diaspores have indeed been deposited {{at the foot of the}} <b>summer</b> <b>dike</b> during storm events. The occurrence of seeds in the driftline suggests that salt-marsh species may float into the summer polder. The breaching of the dike in summer 2001 will enable to monitor the development of the restoration of salt-marsh plant communities from the very beginning...|$|E
40|$|The hydrodynamics of {{estuaries}} {{are forced}} by the tides from the open sea and the river runoff from the catchment area. The hinterland is often low-lying and densely populated and must therefore be protected by dikes. Anthropogenic climate change poses new challenges to the coastal protection. However, changes in the geometry of the estuaries can have equally severe impacts on the deformation of a storm surge wave form when it propagates through the estuary. This affects the peak water levels and hence the design water levels. This contribution focuses {{on the influence of}} retention areas or forelands seaside of the main dike lines, which are protected by summer dikes against the less severe but more frequently occurring storm surges. This is shown at the example of a retention area in the Weser estuary, which has historically been the cite of a soccer stadium and thus hosts high values which stand in sharp contrast against the low safety level against flooding. The investigation is conducted with a 3 D hydrodynamic numerical model which has previously been validated for the simulation of storm surges. The results show that even very small changes in the geometry of the estuary can have effects on design levels. This is even the case when they only regard the <b>summer</b> <b>dike</b> crests heights around retention areas and not their volume. Another important finding is that the geometry changes may have their maximum impacts quite far away from the specific river reach in which they are carried out. The results underline that for designing safe and reliable storm surge infrastructure, storm events should be studied in high resolution models which are able to resolve even small scale features such as <b>summer</b> <b>dike</b> lines...|$|E
40|$|In 1993 and 1995 the Netherlands {{were started}} by two flood waves. They {{did not cause}} much damage in the floodplains, but they made clear {{that it should not}} be taken for granted that the Netherlands are {{protected}} for floodings. Therefore in 1996 the policy 'Ruimte voor de rivier' came to effect. In this policy measures are sought to protect the Netherlands during flood waves. One of the measures is the lowering of the hydraulic roughness in the floodplains, so the fall is decreased. The hydraulic roughness of the dikes in the floodplains can be decreased, for example by letting water flow through the dikes (through culverts). These dikes are elevations, which connect the <b>summer</b> <b>dike</b> and the winter dike, they lay perpendicular to the current. The problem of many measures is the uncertainty of the effect during a flood wave, this applies for this measure as well. It is important to know how much the water level lowers if culverts are used in the dikes in the floodplains. After this effect is studied, the measure can be applied in the floodplains. The objective is to get insight in the flow of water around a dike with a culvert. Three questions are posed: - What is the effect of the use of culverts in dikes in the floodplain? - Is the fall caused by the construction as a whole equal to the addition of the separate fall caused by the current through the culvert and the current over the crest? - Is there a relation between (hcrest/hculvert) and (ucrest/uculvert) or (qcrest/qculvert) ? The first step is literature research for the hydraulic roughness of dikes and the occurrence and efficiency of culverts. These were found and the constructions can occur in different flow regimes: free flow and fully submerged flow. Each regime has different discharge coefficients. To get more insight in the effect of the measure, with the WAQUA-model of Rijkswaterstaat (a 2 D-flowmodel) the removal of two dikes in the floodplain is simulated in the project area, the Beuningse Waard near Nijmegen. During a flooding the water level decreased 0, 0085 meter. This small lowering is caused by situation in the floodplain; present obstacles have a negative influence on the effect of the measure. The complete removal of the two dikes is a useful measure for 'Ruimte voor de rivier' due to low costs. The use of culverts in the dikes in the floodplain is not useful; the effect decreases and the costs increase. Subsequently fall and flow are measured for different scale models in a flume in the fluid mechanics laboratory. Constructions with different culvert heights are used to determine the discharge coefficients. The scale models had a slope of 1 : 3 and a fixed crest height, 0, 20 meters above the bottom. The bottom of the model is removed in steps of 0, 05 meters, to simulate the effect of a culvert. The experiments are per unit of width. With the results of the experiments the research questions can be answered: - The use of culverts in dikes in the floodplain has effect. With a constant discharge this effect decreased when the water level downstream increases. For all flow regimes the effect of the measure can be calculated. - The addition of the fall of the separate currents is allowed. - The relation between flow through the culvert and over the crest is: 1, 2 uculvert = ucrestCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Territory {{protection}} against flood water inundation {{and creation of}} polder systems are carried out {{with the help of}} protection dikes. One of the main requirements to the composition of polder systems in flood plains is a location of border dikes beyond meander belt in order to avoid their erosion when meander development occurs. Meander belt width can be determined {{on the basis of the}} analysis of multi-year land surveying pertaining top river-bed building and in the case when such data is not available this parameter is calculated in accordance with the Snishchenko formula. While banking-up a river bed a flooded area is decreasing and, consequently, water level in inter-dike space and rate of flood water are significantly increasing. For this reason it is necessary to locate dikes at a such distance from a river bed which will not cause rather high increase in water level and flow velocity in the inter-dike space. Methodology for hydraulic calculation of river regulation has been developed in order to substantiate design parameters for levee systems, creation of favourable hydraulic regime in these systems and provision of sustainability for dikes. Its main elements are calculations of pass-through capacity of the leveed channel and rise of water level in inter-dike space, and distance between dikes and their crest level. Peculiar feature of the proposed calculated formulae is an interaction consideration of channel and inundated flows. Their mass-exchanging process results in slowing-down of the channel flow and acceleration of the inundated flow. This occurrence is taken into account and coefficients of kinematic efficiency are introduced to the elements of water flow rate in the river channel and flood plain, respectively. The adduced dependencies for determination of a dike crest level (consequently their height) take into consideration a rise of water level in inter-dike space for two types of polder systems: non-inundable (winter) dikes with maximum spring flood rate and inundable (<b>summer)</b> <b>dikes</b> with summer-autumn flood rates. The proposed calculated formulae can be recommended for application at design organizations. </p...|$|R
50|$|The Dyke Mountain Annex is a {{historic}} house at 319 Dyke Mountain Road in Sebago, Maine. This 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built sometime between 1906 and 1908 by Grace L. Dike, proprietor of the Dyke Mountain Hotel, a popular summer resort in the hills west of Sebago Lake. It is the only surviving element of the hostelry, the rest of which was destroyed by fire in 1927. This structure originally housed only sleeping and common lounge spaces, but was modified after the fire to have a kitchen, and continued to be operated as a <b>summer</b> hostel by <b>Dike</b> until her death in 1937.

40|$|Hydraulic {{structures}} {{are present in}} the designs of different Room for the River projects in the Netherlands. Examples are longitudinal weirs, groins, <b>summer</b> <b>dikes</b> and weirs in the inlet of a side channel. Morphological simulations with Delft 3 D are frequently carried out to investigate the effect of such projects on for example hindrance for shipping and dredging costs. It is important that also the physical processes around hydraulic {{structures are}} correctly modeled in these situations. At the upstream slope of a hydraulic structure, the larger depth-averaged velocity causes an increased sediment transport capacity and increased actual bed shear stresses. The latter is reinforced by a change of the velocity distribution over the vertical with respect to uniform flow. Opposite, the gravity component along the slope results in a higher critical bed shear stress than in flat bottom conditions. At steep slopes, (partial) bed-load transport blockage could occur. Delft 3 D is meant to model flow phenomena of which the horizontal length and time scales are significantly larger than the vertical scales. Near hydraulic structures, this is generally not the case. These structures are parameterized as weirs in a depth-averaged Delft 3 D model in engineering practice. The only effect of these weirs is an additional energy loss in the momentum equation. The parameterization aims at representing the influence of the weirs on the flow at larger scales. The local flow around the structures (including turbulence, vertical velocity components and actual shear stresses) is not correctly modeled. Moreover, there is no direct influence of the weir on sediment transport (like increased critical shear stresses and bed-load transport blockage). This inaccurate way of modeling could result in errors in the prediction of the morphological effects of hydraulic structures. The objectives of this study are: (1) Assessing the performance of the current way of Delft 3 D modeling of sediment transport around hydraulic structures in three-dimensional flows. (2) Making recommendations on the modeling of sediment transport around hydraulic structures in hydraulic engineering practice. The performance of Delft 3 D has been judged by comparing the results with the results of the numerical model FLUENT. FLUENT is an advanced flow modeling system, in which sediment transport can be studied by analyzing the trajectories of discrete particles. Firstly, some laboratory experiments describing flow and transport over structures have been modeled. In this way, the performance of both models has been investigated and mutually compared. The results of FLUENT gave confidence to use FLUENT as an instrument to judge the performance of Delft 3 D in modeling three-dimensional flow and transport over hydraulic structures. A three-dimensional flow situation has been designed, which resembles the flow over a longitudinal weir. In Delft 3 D, all bed-load transport and suspended-load transport that reaches the weir also passes the weir. In FLUENT, this is not the case. Suspended-load transport is distributed between the main channel and the zone behind the weir in the same ratio as the discharge. The distribution of bed-load transport strongly depends on the particle diameter. This difference shows that the parameterization of weirs in depth-averaged Delft 3 D models gives significant errors in the prediction of sediment transport over hydraulic structures, especially when bed-load transport is dominant. The transport magnitude can be reduced by increasing the bed level points near the weir to crest level. In this schematization, nearly all bed-load transport is blocked and suspended-load transport is reduced. A weir without increased bed level points overestimates the sediment transport over the structure. When the bed level points are increased until crest level of the weir, the sediment transport over the weir is underestimated. The sediment transport over the weir can be tuned by an increased bed level somewhere between zero and crest level. The distribution of sediment between the main channel (index 1) and the area behind the weir (index 2) can be described with a relation S 2 /S 1 = C*Q 2 /Q 1 : The value of C as given by Delft 3 D can be judged with the following rules of thumb: (1) Suspended-load transport is distributed between the main channel and the zone behind the weir in the same ratio as the discharge, so C = 1. (2) For bed-load transport in three-dimensional situations with clearly oblique flow over the weir, the coefficient C can be related to the excess shear stress at the upstream slope, in which the actual and critical Shields parameter are adjusted for slope effects. (3) In situations where the flow is directed almost perpendicular to the crest of the structure, the conclusions of Lauchlan (2001) are recommended. Nearly all mobile sediment is transported over the structure in these situations. The coefficient C in Delft 3 D can be influenced by giving the bed level points near the weir the right height.
