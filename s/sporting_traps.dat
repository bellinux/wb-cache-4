50|$|Over And Under: (sometimes {{shortened}} to OAU or O/U) As {{its name}} indicates this gun has two barrels aligned horizontally and stacked vertically. There is usually one trigger however some models have two. Within this type {{there are three}} sub-groups of specification: <b>trap,</b> skeet, and <b>sporting.</b> <b>Trap</b> guns are generally heavier and longer barreled (normally 30 or 32 in) with tight choking and designed to shoot slightly above the point of aim. Skeet guns are usually lighter and faster handling with barrel length from 26 to 28 in and with fairly open chokes. Sporting models most often come with an interchangeable choke facility and barrel lengths of 28 in, 30 in, and 32 in according to preference.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} prior to 1969, {{wildlife}} was essentially defined, {{in the practice of}} governmental bodies, as those species hunted for <b>sport,</b> <b>trapped</b> for furs, controlled to accomplish human objectives, or of particular aesthetic value. Governmental management of these species was based on funding obtained from or supported largely by clearly identified constituencies. Universities evolved specialized programs in wildlife biology and management to produce the knowledge and trained professionals to meet these needs. Many such programs were oriented to training in zoology which emphasized the animal and populations while paying less attention to habitat. As a result, most wildlife research was focused on a few species, and was directed to their taxonomy, population level and dynamics, life history, behavior, distribution, and food habits. Comparatively little effort was spent on defining habitat requirements of even these select species. And, little attention was given to the study, welfare, and management of other species...|$|R

The use of off-road vehicles (ORVs) is restricted to specific routes and permits are required to use ORVs in the preserve.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{the sport}} was worldwide. It {{was for the}} leisure class and was held at resort {{locations}} such as Monaco and Havana. Popular magazines covered the sport—for example, Field & Stream and Sports Illustrated. But, over time, the sport has fallen out of widespread favor due to costs, alternative shooting <b>sports</b> such as <b>trap,</b> skeet, and <b>sporting</b> clays, and of course, animal rights activism over a blood sport.|$|R
50|$|Super Sporting clays {{is a type}} of shotgun sport {{shooting}} {{similar to}} <b>sporting</b> clays, FITASC, <b>trap</b> and skeet. There are typically 3 traps (target throwers) at each station. The targets are usually attempted as 3 singles, and then a report of the a/b, b/c, a/c targets or true pairs or combinations of those. There is a menu card at each shooting station which lists the targets to be shot in the order they should be shot in.|$|R
5000|$|Fédération Internationale de Tir aux Armes Sportives de Chasse (FITASC) {{is a type}} of shotgun sport {{shooting}} {{similar to}} <b>sporting</b> clays, <b>trap</b> and skeet. It involves strategically placed clay target throwers (called traps) set to simulate live game birds/animals- teal, rabbits, pheasant etc. Shooters on each layout or [...] "parcour", shoot in turn at various combinations of single and double clay birds. Each station or [...] "peg" [...] on a parcour will have a menu card that lets the shooter know the sequence of clay birds he or she will be shooting at (i.e. which trap the clay bird will be coming from). The shooters will be presented with 4 or 5 two-shot singles which they will rotate through and then two pair. In Old Style FITASC there are three pegs on each parcour, with 25 shots to a parcour.|$|R
5000|$|Five Stand {{is a type}} of shotgun sport {{shooting}} {{similar to}} <b>sporting</b> clays, <b>trap</b> and skeet. There are five stations, or stands and six to eighteen strategically placed clay target throwers(called traps). Shooters shoot in turn at various combinations of clay birds. Each station will have a menu card that lets the shooter know the sequence of clay birds he or she will be shooting at (i.e. which trap the clay bird will be coming from). The shooter is presented with 5 targets at each station, first a single bird followed by two pairs. Pairs can be either [...] "report pairs," [...] in which the second bird will be launched after the shooter fires at the first; or [...] "true pairs" [...] when both birds launch at the same time. After shooting at the 5 birds on the menu at that station, the shooter proceeds to the next stand, where they find a new menu of 5 targets.|$|R
40|$|Our {{intention}} in {{this paper}} is to shortly address some of the basic categories that determine the paradigm of sport culture as we know it. We do believe that by understanding these basic categories the changes of prevailing sport paradigm, which is without any shame revealing all the pathologies of modern man, can be made. The call for active reflection and indirect careful intervention into sport is loud enough to recognize the stormy times that the presence has put in front of sport. Such active reflection demands from us to travel into the field which was for long time neglected by sport theoreticians, and only a couple of mochicans has shown courage to step beyond usual. Above all, as long as <b>sport</b> is <b>trapped</b> by quasi-academics, politics, economics and other ideologists nothing much will happen. Therefore we are calling upon those who value human being above the sport, learner above the curriculum, and are setting liveliness of life before depressing statistics. We are calling upon those who care for the child within and the children in front of us...|$|R
50|$|Aniakchak National Monument was proclaimed on December 1, 1978, by Carter {{using his}} {{authority}} under the Antiquities Act. The monument covered 380000 acre, excluding {{the area between}} the caldera and the coast.. In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was finally passed, establishing the unit as a national monument surrounded by a larger national preserve that extended to the coast {{on the south side}} of the peninsula. The monument allows subsistence hunting by local residents in most areas and the preserve allows both subsistence and sport hunting. <b>Sport</b> hunting and <b>trapping</b> are therefore only permitted in Aniakchak National Preserve. The most common species hunted include moose and brown bear.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sport</b> {{hunting and}} <b>trapping</b> are also {{allowed in the}} preserve. To hunt and trap, you must have all {{required}} licenses and permits and follow all other state regulations. The National Park Service and the State of Alaska cooperatively manage the wildlife resources of the preserve. Campers and hunters {{should be aware that}} brown bears are common in the preserve and be prepared to avoid conflicts with them. Typically hunted species in the preserve include black bears, mountain goats, wolves, wolverines, snowshoe hare, ptarmigans, waterfowls and a number of furbearers. There is one big game hunting guide authorized through concession contracts to operate within Glacier Bay National Preserve. Three lodges and one outfitter can provide transportation and services for fishing and hunting small game and waterfowl.|$|R
