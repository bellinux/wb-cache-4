5|$|The 1987 White Paper {{was seen}} by many as an attempt to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had been damaged by New Zealand's <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} {{controversy}} for its official <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1962, the {{recently}} re-convened Léopoldville Parliament, under Cyrille Adoula, agreed {{to modify the}} Constitution and gave South Kasai official provincial status. In April 1962, UN troops were ordered to occupy South Kasai as part of U Thant's new aggressive <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> secession following Hammarskjöld's death.

Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a preventive war against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. possessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.|$|E

5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the {{military}} committee needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian officer corps. The collapse of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left the officer corps in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, the officer corps was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's regime and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Obama took {{a public}} <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> plans by the {{government}} of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.

2500|$|Unomásuno is a Mexican tabloid-style {{newspaper}} {{based in}} Mexico City. Its name originated {{from the idea}} that the contributions of a reporter and the participation of the readers were meant to be one. In Spanish, [...] "one plus one" [...] is spelled in three words, uno más uno; by putting them together as Unomásuno, the founders were unifying both concepts. It was formed on November 14, 1977, by Manuel Becerra Acosta, a journalist who worked for the newspaper Excélsior. Excélsior, known for its critical <b>stances</b> <b>against</b> the Mexican government, was headed by Julio Scherer García throughout the 1960s and '70s. The Excélsior team that he hired was made up of independent and critically minded reporters. Its publications appealed to Mexican readers due to its independent viewpoints and its critical <b>stances</b> <b>against</b> government officials. The government was particularly concerned with Excélsiors publications of the mass murder of student protestors by the Mexican Army in 1968. To halt the critical <b>stances</b> <b>against</b> the government, the administration of Mexican President Luis Echeverría (1970–1976) channelled money to the newspaper's employees to stage a coup against Scherer García. Excélsiors staff was already divided internally and was going through financial problems due to poor management. On July 8, 1976, at least 250 staff members walked out of the Excélsior offices in Mexico City, the majority of them permanently.|$|R

5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been {{strained}} since the appointment in 1932 of Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach (Prime Minister). The Anglo-Irish Trade War, {{sparked by the}} withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to remove the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. Chamberlain as Chancellor had taken a hard-line <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> concessions to the Irish, but he was persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions, and sought a settlement with Ireland.|$|E
5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he {{did not agree with}} all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E

50|$|Initially, Cantwell had two challengers {{from within}} the Democratic primary, both of them taking strong <b>stances</b> <b>against</b> the Iraq war that brought {{attention}} to Cantwell's votes for the Iraq Resolution and against a timeline for withdrawal: Mark Wilson and Hong Tran.

5|$|Diefenbaker was {{repeatedly}} {{a candidate for}} the PC leadership. He gained that party position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the Tories to their first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a snap election and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his Cabinet, as well as the first aboriginal member of the Senate. During his six years as Prime Minister, his government obtained passage of the Canadian Bill of Rights and granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In foreign policy, his <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government's downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered {{for his role in the}} 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Gitera {{visited the}} king at his palace in Nyanza. Although Gitera had {{considerable}} {{respect for the}} monarchy, Rudahigwa treated him contemptuously; {{at one point he}} grabbed Gitera's throat, calling him and his followers inyangarwanda (haters of Rwanda). This humiliation prompted the MSM, APROSOMA and the pro-Hutu Catholic publications to take a firmer <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> the monarchy. Kinyamateka published a detailed report of Rudahigwa's treatment of Gitera, refuting his semi-divine image and accusing him of pro-Tutsi racism. The magazine also published stories citing the origin myths of the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, calling the king's policies inconsistent with them. The articles did not immediately challenge the king's authority over the Hutu peasants, but their exposure of Rudahigwa's outburst led to a permanent schism between him, the Hutu counter-elite and Belgian authorities. In 1958 the Belgian colonial ministry tried to strip Rudahigwa of his power, reducing him to a figurehead, but his popularity with the regional chiefs and the Tutsi (who feared the growing Hutu movement) sparked a series of strikes and protests.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had promised a more hawkish <b>stance</b> <b>against</b> communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of psychological warfare by the CIA. Árbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. From 1954 onwards Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War. 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.|$|E
