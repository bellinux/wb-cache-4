Since the imaging device resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility on the part of the Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire.

Brian had illicitly stayed with his father, though Delilah had kept this from her superiors, and both Brian and Ned had disappeared without a trace. The teenage girls are reported missing. Henry later discovers a radio and clipboard with transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked out and finds the clipboard and radio gone. Henry proceeds to break into a government research area, discovering <b>surveillance</b> <b>equipment</b> and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's lives and conversations.

The team allow him to work undercover in Parkmount, posing as a labourer at the local university, where he quickly gains Rachid's trust. Beforehand however, Khaldun removes all the <b>surveillance</b> <b>equipment</b> on him.

The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the Royal School of Needlework further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist <b>surveillance</b> <b>equipment.</b> Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed {{through one of the}} embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist.

They can improve the functional statuses of elderly patients with severe congestive diseases. The GPU-based home-care surveillance system is effective and has a major impact on health expenditure than traditional <b>surveillance</b> <b>equipments.</b> In this work, we propose a spike sorting technique as a specific case for the GPU-based home surveillance system. Spike sorting is the procedure of classifying spikes corresponding to the firing neurons. In neuroscience research, spike sorting is adopted to analyze neural activities, brain functions and sensation. It is also a key component in cortically-controlled neuroprosthetics for patients. In order to efficiently distinguish different neural spike activities, a robust spike sorting algorithm is required for above applications. To improve accuracy, multi-channel spike sorting is necessary. In addition, real-time monitoring for a homecare system is required. Therefore, we exploit a CUDA implementation using GPU for acceleration. Index Terms — Spike sorting, home-care surveillance system, CUD...|$|R

40|$|PANEL SUMMARY With {{experts from}} the {{multimedia}} research communities, this panel explores the impacts of new technology on possible future directions of research on multimedia retrieval. Recent advances in technology, such as various sensors {{and all kinds of}} cameras ranging from installed on personal phones to <b>surveillance</b> <b>equipments,</b> have contributed to the acceleration of the accumulation of various multimedia data. In addition, advances in technology in storage, networking, and web designs have made these data easily accessible. However, increasingly fast and extensive applications of these technologies in science, industry, education, entertainment, and art have also created new needs for more sophisticated tools for more efficient searching and browsing of multimedia data. We are, therefore, facing a challenge: on the one hand, the traditional retrieval techniques must now be updated into more advanced search and browsing tools that can impact users in the real-world, and on the other hand, we find ourselves, once again, in the position to envision and to provide innovative approaches in the management and the retrieval of these fastgrowing data of massive quantities. This panel discusses new research issues and problems on the topics of content analysis, user interaction, content description and indexing, and evaluation for the purpose of developing nextgeneration tools of ever more advanced applications in multimedia search and browsing...|$|R

25|$|The use of <b>surveillance</b> <b>equipment</b> {{and whether}} covert {{recording}} {{amounts to a}} search {{has been a significant}} issue for New Zealand courts. In Tararo v R (2010) the Supreme Court held that an undercover police officer video recording a drug transaction was not a search due to the low expectation of privacy. Covert surveillance of public areas will generally not be search due to the low expectation of privacy. In contrast, surveillance of private property will likely be a search due to the high privacy interests. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 now provides clear statutory guidance for when covert police surveillance can lawfully occur.|$|E
