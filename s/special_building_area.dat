40|$|Six hundred eighty-two (682) {{containers}} of soil were generated at Mound Plant between April 1 and October 31, 1990 {{as a result}} of the excavation of soils containing plutonium- 238 at two ongoing Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Program sites; these areas are known as Area 14, the waste transfer system (WTS) hillside, and Area 17, the <b>Special</b> Metallurgical (SM) <b>Building</b> <b>Area.</b> The soils from these areas are part of the Mound Plant waste stream number AMDM- 000000010, Contaminated Soil, and are proposed for shipment to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) for disposal as low-level radioactive waste. These {{containers of}} soil are currently in storage at Mound Plant. The purpose of this sampling and analysis was to demonstrate that the D&D soils comply with the waste acceptance requirements of the NTS, as presented In Nevada Test Site Defense Waste Acceptance Criteria, Certification, and Transfer Requirements (DOE 1988). The sealed waste packages, constructed of wood or metal, are currently being stored In Building 31 and at other locations throughout the Mound Plant.

40|$|Parking {{is one of}} the {{important}} elements of urban transportation, such, it has various long and short-term impacts on individuals, societies, and transportation systems. It affects to the transportation mode selection. People tend to drive private car when the representative parking area is available. This research is focused at the determination of the parameters that affect the use of parking area. The parameters are expected to be useful in estimating the parking area demand of the hospital class B in Semarang. There are six major parameters describing the parking slot, i. e. : accumulation, parking volume, total spaces available (capacity), parking turnover, peak time, duration of occupancy and occupancy. Three hospitals are selected as object of the study; there are RS Telogorejo, RS Elisabeth and RS dr Kariadi. The survey is carried out by direct investigation and questionnaire. Statistical analysis by using linear regression, logarithmic, quadratic, and exponential, indicated that the amount of bed used has a very high correlation with the parking demand. The next highest correlation is observed between medical specialist and parking demand. The average duration in RS Telogorejo is 15 – 30 minutes, RS Elisabeth is 30 minutes – 2 hours, and RS dr Kariadi is 15 – 30 minutes for car. For motorcycle, the average duration in RS Telogorejo is 30 minutes – 1 hour, RS Elisabeth is 30 minutes – 2 hours, and RS dr Kariadi is above 4 hours. From the study, {{it was found that the}} ratio between parking demand for vehicle and the number of bed being used is 0. 89, meanwhile the ratio between parking demand for motorcycle and the number of bed being used is 1. 29.

At a meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada on October, 26, 1990, DOE Nevada Operations Office (DOE-NV) and NTS representatives requested that the Mound Plant D&D soils proposed for shipment to NTS be sampled for Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) constituents. On December 14, 1990, DOE-NV also requested that additional analyses be performed on the soils from one of the soils boxes for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), particle size distribution, and free liquids. The purpose of this plan is to document the proposed sampling and analyses of the packages of D&D soils produced prior to October 31, 1990.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} notable buildings {{from the}} start of the 17 th century to the first half of the 20 th century with respect to technical characteristics and their present condition, and studies their state of stress and pathology. There is an initial historic reference to the architectural evolution of buildings, followed by a recording of the large historic <b>buildings</b> in the <b>area</b> and their classification in categories according to function (houses, schools, industrial and <b>special</b> <b>buildings),</b> the geographical <b>area</b> and the method of construction. The paper describes the damage buildings have suffered, and researches the causes for this damage alongside with intervention methods and techniques applied for their restoration. The finite element method is used to inspect the state of stress while simulation methods are examined on typical buildings under the afore mentioned categories using spatial models, and taking into consideration their morphological and mechanical characteristics; the analysis results and their existing condition and pathology are correlated. Also, the contribution of horizontal beams, floors and the roof is examined according to various assumptions as to the buildings’ performance and strength. The centralized recording of technical characteristics of buildings and the analysis results lead to the creation of a substantial extensive database, through which it is possible to examine the influence of the shape and composition of the load-bearing structure of buildings in their state of stress. Comparative diagrams and graphic rendering of the structure analysis results are included, using multinomial or other types of functions and variables related to their geometric and mechanical characteristics, in order to achieve the qualitative and quantitative state of stress of historic buildings of a similar style. The conclusions emerging from the research pertain to evaluation of existing condition, pathology and strength of a large number of historic buildings constructed in Central Greece during the last four centuries. Beyond their contribution to the creation of files on existing historic structures, the thesis results provide an application utility since they can be taken into consideration during compilation of regulations regarding control and interventions on their load-bearing structure. ...|$|R
