Production designer Nathan Crowley, who designed the Tumbler for Batman Begins, designed six models (built by special effects supervisor Chris Corbould) {{for use in the}} film's production, because of necessary crash scenes and possible accidents. Crowley built a prototype in Nolan's garage, before six months of safety tests were conducted. The Batpod is steered by shoulder instead of hand, and the rider's arms are protected by <b>sleeve-like</b> shields. The bike has 508-millimeter (20-inch) front and rear tires, and is made to appear as if it is armed with grappling hooks, cannons, and machine guns. The engines are located in the hubs of the wheels, which are set 3feet (1067mm) apart {{on either side of the}} tank. The rider lies belly down on the tank, which can move up and down to dodge any incoming gunfire that Batman may encounter. Stuntman Jean-Pierre Goy doubled for Christian Bale during the riding sequences in The Dark Knight. The Batpod was highly unstable for riding, and Goy was the only stuntman who could manage to balance the bike, even commenting that he had to [...] "nearly un-learn how to ride a motorcycle" [...] to manage riding the Batpod. Bale did insist on doing shots on the Batpod himself, but was prohibited by the team fearing his safety.|$|E

50|$|Even {{with the}} use of peelable hinges and care to {{minimize}} the moisture used, the hinge will leave a visible disturbance in the gum of an unused stamp. While this was formerly a matter of indifference, since about the middle of the 20th century many collectors have come to prefer “unhinged stamps” showing no trace of hinging. In some cases, the price differential is 2-to-1 or more, resulting in the quip that the “gum {{on the back of a}} stamp is the most valuable substance in the world”. Collectors preferring unhinged stamps typically use pocket-like or <b>sleeve-like</b> hingeless mount. Nevertheless, stamp hinges remain popular as a mounting method.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hymen {{morphology}} has a medico-legal importance. In view of {{the lack}} of national norms, establishing the hymen morphology of Saudi newborn infants is essential. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 4 months, the genitalia of 345 full-term female newborn infants were examined to determine the shape of the hymen. A previously described labia traction technique was used to classify the hymen morphology into annular, <b>sleeve-like,</b> fimbriated, crescentric, and other types. RESULTS: The hymen was present in all 345 female newborn infants examined. A total of 207 (60 &#x 0025;) were of the annular type, 76 (22 &#x 0025;) were <b>sleeve-like,</b> 43 (12. 5 &#x 0025;) fimbriated, 17 (4. 9 &#x 0025;) crescentric, and 2 (0. 6 &#x 0025;) of other types. CONCLUSION: The most common hymen morphology in Saudi newborn girls was annular, followed by <b>sleeve-like,</b> fimbriated, and crescentric. This study may be the first to define normal configuration of the hymen in this community...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} two lines suture (total and seromuscular) after partial {{gastrectomy}} in normal and overweight rats. METHODS: Forty Wistar rats were distributed in two groups. Group A received normal diet; group B, normal diet and supplementation with saccharose in the water. When group B progressed to a statistically greater weight than the animals of group A, the experiment (<b>sleeve-like</b> gastrectomy) was conducted with gastrorraphy in two sutures lines (total and seromuscular). The animals were distributed into two subgroups of 10. A 1 and A 2 subgroups were sacrificed at 7 and 14 days postoperatively as well as B 1 and B 2. Mortality, morbidity, complications attributed to the gastric suture, biochemical dosages, Lee index, macroscopy, weight of retroperitoneal and gonadal fat, optical microscopy with hematoxylin-eosin and picrosirius-red, were the evaluation parameters. RESULTS: The overweight group achieved statistically greater weight after 16 weeks in induced obesity; there was no mortality or complications with clinical consequences attributable to morbidity. The overweight group had statistically greater weight of gonadal and retroperitoneal fat. The difference was observed in urea, albumin, total cholesterol and indirect bilirubin. CONCLUSION: There was no outcome difference between the overweight and non-overweight group in two suture lines in gastrorrhaphy after <b>sleeve-like</b> gastrectomy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we record {{a case in}} which {{occurred}} the uncommon association of necrotic softening in {{the lower half of the}} spinal cord and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis of perivenous type.

The perivenous encephalomyelitis showed the long <b>sleeve-like</b> areas of demyelination around small veins commonly seen in post-vaccinal or post-exanthematous encephalomyelitis.

30|$|IE on {{indwelling}} central venous catheters or implantable devices (pace-makers, internal cardioverters-defibrillators) is uncommon due to {{the lack}} of the hemodynamic factors usually involved in IE pathogenesis (flow turbulence, high pressure gradients) [77], but is getting more frequent as a consequence of development and increased use of invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In an ICU septic patient with no other clear infective focus it should thus be considered, especially if evidence of pulmonary septic embolism exists [78] (Fig.  9 e, f, Video 14 ESM). Besides searching for vegetations on the catheter, from superior vena cava to its implantation on the myocardium, the ECHO exam should seek carefully for IE-associated localizations on right heart valves [77 – 81]. Visualizing vegetations on implantable devices (mass or <b>sleeve-like)</b> may be difficult, due to artifacts coming from the device itself. Small fibrin strands may represent a difficult differential diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Non-omologous end joining (NHEJ) is {{the primary}} pathway for {{repairing}} DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. Such breaks are formed, for example, during gene-segment rearrangements in the adaptive immune system or by cancer therapeutic agents. Although the core components of the NHEJ machinery are known, it has remained difficult to assess the specific roles of these components and the dynamics of bringing and holding the fragments of broken DNA together. The structurally similar XRCC 4 and XLF proteins are proposed to assemble as highly dynamic filaments at (or near) DSBs. Here we show, using dual-and quadruple-trap optical tweezers combined with fluorescence microscopy, how human XRCC 4, XLF and XRCC 4 -XLF complexes interact with DNA in real time. We find that XLF stimulates the binding of XRCC 4 to DNA, forming heteromeric complexes that diffuse swiftly along the DNA. Moreover, we find that XRCC 4 -XLF complexes robustly bridge two independent DNA molecules and that these bridges are able to slide along the DNA. These observations suggest that XRCC 4 -XLF complexes form mobile <b>sleeve-like</b> structures around DNA that can reconnect the broken ends very rapidly and hold them together. Understanding the dynamics and regulation of this mechanism will lead to clarification of how NHEJ proteins are involved in generating chromosomal translocations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the distribution and structure  of ventral tributaries leading into the inferior vena cava where right-sided paraaortic lymphadenectomy is performed. The study examined   21 retroperitoneal specimens by graphic reconstruction, statistical evaluation, and histological examination of ventral tributaries (VTs). Seventy VTs were identified. The average number per specimen was 3. 33. There were 20, 40, and 40 % of VTs found in Levels I, II, and III, respectively. During the preparation, we observed an unusual arrangement of the IVC wall, into which VTs were led through a preformed <b>sleeve-like</b> channel and anchored near the lumen. This finding is a key mechanism that explains the ease with which VTs are extracted during surgery. Due to the lack of uniformity concerning the moniker for VTs in the literature, and due to the typical anatomical position and distribution of VTs within retroperitoneum, we propose that these veins should be called venae retroperitoneales anteriores. The second aim of the study was to gain a thorough knowledge of the topography and distribution of until now officially unnamed minute direct branches from abdominal aorta, stemming from its ventral and lateral aspects, supplying surrounding tissue, and to comprise it to the existing studies.

40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is the most}} common compression neuropathy, yet the cause of the compression is in most cases idiopathic. The most common clinical finding associated with the nerve compression is non-inflammatory fibrosis of the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) which surrounds the flexor tendons in the carpal canal. The normal SSCT has a multi-layer gliding mechanism, reminiscent of a series of sleeves around the tendon, with each successive sleeve being connected to its neighbors with fine collagenous fibers. We have conducted a series of experiments which have outlined the pathology, kinematics and material properties of the SSCT in normal individuals and in individuals with CTS, and have identified specific features within the SSCT of individuals with CTS that suggest that injury to the SSCT {{may play a role in}} the etiology of CTS. Specifically, we have identified evidence of a shearing injury of the SSCT, with fibrosis, and obliteration o! f the gliding, <b>sleeve-like</b> mechanism, being greatest close to the tendon, and with a tendency of greater degrees of fibrosis being observed in more severe cases of CTS. This fibrosis may be associated with tethering of the SSCT to the underlying tendon, which may increase the work of finger movement in patients with CTS, and impair differential finger movement. Based on these observations, we propose a vicious cycle of SSCT injury and repair as a working hypothesis of the etiology of CTS, and have developed a rabbit model to test this hypothesis in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{extrinsic}} eye {{muscles of}} the killifish (F. heteroclitus) were fixed in OSO 4 (pH 7. 6) and subsequently dehydrated, embedded, and sectioned for electron microscopy. The fine structures of neuromuscular junctions and of sarcoplasmic reticulum were then observed. The neuromuscular junction consists of the apposition of axolemma (60 to 70 Å) and sarcolemma (90 to 100 Å), with an intervening cleft space of 200 to 300 Å, forming a synaptolemma 400 to 500 Å thick. The terminal axons contain synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, and agranular reticulum. The subsynaptic sarcolemma lacks the infolding arrangement characteristic of neuromuscular junctions from other vertebrate skeletal muscle, making them more nearly like that of insect neuromuscular junctions. A comparison between the folded and non-folded subsynaptic membrane types is made and {{discussed in terms of}} comparative rates of acetylcholine diffusion from the synaptic cleft and resistances of the clefts and subsynaptic membranes. The sarcoplasmic reticulum consists of segmentally arranged, membrane-limited vesicles and tubular and cisternal elements which surround individual myofibrils in a <b>sleeve-like</b> arrangement. Triadic differentiation occurs at or near the A-I junction. Unit sleeves span the A and I bands alternately and consist of closed terminal cisternae interconnected across the A and I bands by tubular cisternae. The thickness of the sarcoplasmic membranes increases from 30 to 40 Å in intertriadic regions to 50 to 70 Å at the triads. The location of the triads is compared with previously described striated muscle from Ambystoma larval myotomes, cardiac and sartorius {{muscles of the}} albino rat, mouse limb muscle, chameleon lizard muscle, and insect muscle, with reference to their possible role in intracellular impulse conduction...|$|E
40|$|Innate {{immunity}} in vertebrates plays {{a fundamental}} role in pathogen recognition and subsequent {{activation of the}} adaptive immune response, which is characterized by a highly diverse, somatically generated repertoire of antigen receptors. The interplay between adaptive and innate immunity orchestrates the defensive responses against a variety of invaders such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites (Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997 a). Invertebrates, including insects, lack an adaptive immune system but utilize innate immunity for their defence. The successful evolution of insects as the most species-rich group of terrestrial animals testifies to the efficiency and flexibility of innate immunity in dealing with a diverse array of pathogens. In insects, the peritrophic membrane (PM) of the midgut, the cuticle of the exoskeleton and the lining of the tracheal respiratory system constitute physical barriers against invaders. The PM is a <b>sleeve-like</b> extracellular layer surrounding the food bolus and is composed of chitin, proteins and proteoglycans (Wang and Granados, 2001). Ingested ookinetes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium must penetrate the midgut wall of the Anopheles mosquito vector to develop further into oocysts on the haemocoel basal side of the midgut epithelium (Fig. · 1). This process is facilitated by the secretion of chitinases that disrupt the PM chitin (Huber et al., 1991; Langer et al., 2000). Midgut invasion was completely blocked when mosquitoes were fed on infected blood containing the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin (Shahabuddin et al., 1993). Similarly, knockout of the Plasmodium falciparum chitinase gene induced a marked {{reduction in the number of}} developing oocysts in the midguts of Anopheles freeborni mosquitoes (Tsai et al., 2001). Microorganisms that successfully overcome any of these physical barriers encounter an array of host innate immune responses within the underlying epithelia or systemically in internal immune tissues such as haemocytes (insect blood cells) and the fat body (liver analogue), whic...|$|E

40|$|Background: Themedial {{collateral}} ligament provides valgus {{stability to}} the elbow. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to describe the pathoanatomy of acute traumaticmedial collateral ligament ruptures and to report the rationale and results of direct repair. Methods: Between 1996 and 2006, eleven athletes presented with acute rupture of the medial collateral ligament of the elbow and no history of dislocation. Three patients had received steroid injections for the treatment of medial epicondylitis, but none had a history of medial elbow insufficiency. All patients demonstrated gross valgus instability on clinical examination and medial joint space widening on valgus stress radiographs. Complete avulsion of the medial collateral ligament from its humeral origin was documented with magnetic resonance imaging in all patients. Operative findings uniformly demonstrated avulsion of the flexor-pronator muscles with distal retraction. The underlying medial collateral ligament was avulsed in a <b>sleeve-like</b> fashion from the denuded medial epicondyle. The ligament was directly reattached to its footprint. The avulsed flexor-pronator tendon was repaired to the residual tendon with use of inter-rupted figure-of-eight nonabsorbable sutures. All patients were followed for a minimum of sixteen months with serial clinical examinations, radiographs, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Results: Full active range of motion was achieved in ten patients; the remaining patient had a 20 flexion contracture. Three patients had acute ulnar nerve palsies at the time of the injury, and all three recovered complete motor and sensory function by six months after the injury. Nine of the eleven patients returned to competitive college athletics between four and six months. The mean DASH score at the time of the most recent follow-up was 6. Conclusions: Direct repair of an acute traumatic medial collateral ligament avulsion of the elbow reliably restores valgus stability, even in throwing athletes.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe vervet monkey, Chlorocebus aethiops, an Old World monkey, {{has been}} {{often used in}} {{biomedical}} research programs (toxicological studies and fertility) because of the inaccessibility of relevant human tissues. Data from nonhuman primates have been a vital component of advances {{in areas such as}} infertility, contraception, and other reproductive processes because of the phylogenetic closeness of the primates to humans. The aims and objectives of the study were 1) to describe the gross morphology, histology and ultrastructure of the male reproductive system, 2) to describe and compare the processes of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis of the vervet monkey to humans and other nonhuman primates, and 3) to evaluate the vervet monkey as a possible experimental model for future human reproductive studies. Twenty-nine adult male vervet monkeys, aged between 5 and 11 years, were used. Gross morphological features of different organs of the reproductive tract were recorded. Light and electron microscopic techniques, and methacrylate sections were used on selected tissues of the reproductive tract. The results showed that the vervet monkey has a male reproductive system similar to many non-human primates studied and man. The epididymis was distinctively subdivided into the caput, corpus, and the caudal regions. No significant differences were observed on the epithelial height of these three regions. Four cell types, apical, principal, and basal cells, and the intraepithelial lymphocytes were observed. The basal cell distribution showed significant differences among three regions of the epididymis (P ≤ 0. 01). There were numerous phagocytic vesicles found in three regions of the epididymis. The Sertoli cells showed perforated <b>sleeve-like</b> processes which encased elongated and mature spermatids ready for spermiation. The nuclei of the Sertoli cells were found to be multilobed (4 to 5) compared to the less lobular nuclei of the human Sertoli cells (2 to 3). The Leydig cells showed typical features of steroidogenic cells with abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum, numerous large mitochondria, and few rough endoplasmic reticulum. It was concluded that the gross morphology and structure of the reproductive tract of the vervet monkey has many similarities to humans and other mammals. Secondly, the organization of spermatogenesis is similar to that found in humans, and is commonly known as a helical arrangement. The results further suggest that the vervet monkey could be regarded as suitable model for human male reproductive studie...|$|E
40|$|Microtubules (MTs) are {{essential}} {{components of the}} eukaryotic cytoskeleton. They form by the polymerization of tubulin into cylindrical polymers composed of protofilaments. MTs {{are involved in a}} diverse array of cellular functions due to their dynamic instability, which is modulated by many factors in vivo and in vitro. Agents that modulate MT dynamics include MT associated proteins (MAPs) and naturally occurring compounds known as MT stabilizing agents (MSAs). A number of MSAs have demonstrated or predicted potential as anticancer agents, but a detailed structural basis for their mechanism of action is still lacking. We have used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the structural basis of action of zampanolide, a taxane-binding site (TBS) MSA, as well as several proteins known to stabilize MTs, with main focus on tau. We have obtained a high-resolution (4. 2 Å) cryo-EM reconstruction of microtubules stabilized by zampanolide and have compared it to Taxol, which binds to the same pocket on β-tubulin. We find that each TBS MSA has distinct structural effects on the microtubule (MT) lattice. Binding of Taxol or zampanolide both induce MT heterogeneity, but each affects the longitudinal interface differently. Tau is the prominent neuronal MAP and it has been implicated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Tau is known to bind and stabilize MTs in the axons but its binding mode and stabilizing mechanism are not well understood. Our study shows that tau binds exclusively to the external surface of MTs along protofilaments and that it remains in an extended confirmation. In addition, in the presence of kinesin, full length tau (FL-tau) dissociates from MTs allowing kinesin binding. Surprisingly, sub-stoichiometric amounts of tau result in the formation of GDP-tubulin double rings that disappear upon increasing the amounts of tau added to MTs. FL-tau and minimal 2 -R or 4 -R tau constructs result in the formation of <b>sleeve-like</b> structures around MTs, suggesting that tau binds to tubulin dimers as well as to fully polymerized MTs. Thus, we hypothesize that tau functions by oligomerizing tubulin dimers leading to a compacted MT lattice that could reinforce the interactions across the longitudinal MT interface. Furthermore, we identified amino acids on the surface of tubulin that could interact with tau. Tau binds to MTs near the C-terminus, and the sequestering of the acidic C-terminus of tubulin could contribute to the stability of MTs in the presence of tau...|$|E
