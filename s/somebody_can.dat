People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that <b>somebody</b> <b>can</b> go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

[...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people ask me about 'You Really Got Me.' So maybe <b>somebody</b> <b>can</b> correct Wikipedia so people won't keep asking me." ...|$|E
500|$|Section 2 {{covers the}} actual {{prohibition}} of publishing [...] "obscene material". Section 2(1) {{creates a new}} offence, [...] "publishing an obscene article", which replaces the common law misdemeanour of [...] "obscene libel" [...] which was previously the crime. <b>Somebody</b> <b>can</b> be found guilty of this regardless of if it was done for profit or not. Where the article is a film, {{the consent of the}} Director of Public Prosecutions is required before a prosecution can commence. Section 2(4) states that, where an article is obscene, no other common law charges should be brought, and it should instead be dealt with through the 1959 Act, intended to limit prosecutions to those crimes found in this Act. Section 2(5) creates a defence of [...] "innocent dissemination"; if the publisher can prove that they did not anticipate any obscenity problems, and did not examine the article in question for such issues, they cannot be convicted.|$|E

Messier further stated in The Globe and Mail that “the university insisted on cremation before giving up the body “because we didn’t want another freak show in Willow Bunch or anywhere else.” ...|$|E

60|$|One thing I doubt not {{but will}} seem very strange in this doctrine, which is, that from {{what has been}} said it will follow, that each {{abstract}} idea, with a name to it, makes a distinct species.
