50|$|Early on, <b>softened</b> <b>water</b> {{produced}} by technologies like zeolite softening or cold lime softening was {{a precursor to}} modern UPW treatment. From there, the term “deionized” water was the next advancement as synthetic IX resins were invented in 1935 and then became commercialized in the 1940s. The earliest “deionized” water systems relied on IX treatment to produce “high-purity” as determined by resistivity or conductivity measurements. After commercial RO membranes emerged in the 1960s, then RO use with IX treatment eventually became common. EDI was commercialized in the 1980s and this technology has now become commonly associated with UPW treatment.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Water in 70 {{percent of}} the cities in the United States is hard enough that {{softening}} is either required or recommended. It is estimated that approximately 30 percent of all homes in the United States use water softeners. Water softeners, the cation exchange types suited for residential use, exchange sodium for the calcium and magnesium in water. The increase in sodium levels in the <b>softened</b> <b>water</b> caused by cation exchange softening is a direct function of the hardness level of the untreated water. For people who use groundwater, which has a relatively high level of naturally occurring sodium, magnesium and calcium, the additional sodium from cation exchange water softeners may create health hazards for the general population and could adversely affect those who are sensitive to salt or on low sodium diets. To prevent potential health hazards for the general population, no consumption of <b>softened</b> <b>water</b> by cation exchange water softeners should be recommended.

40|$|Silica, SiO 2, is {{typically}} found in well water supplies. Most of the silica found in well waters {{is a result}} of dissolving silica-containing rock. Silica content in brackish water is generally in the range of 20 to 60 ppm. In Salbukh water treatment plant, silica concentration of raw water is about 30 ppm. High concentration of silica causes membrane fouling in the reverse osmosis units. During lime softening process calcium and magnesium are precipitated. Calcium is deposited as calcium carbonate while magnesium is deposited as magnesium hydroxide. Upon precipitation, magnesium hydroxide forms larger floc that more readily adsorbs or entraps silica particles in the water. So silica will be removed with the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide in the lime softening by adsorption on the magnesium precipitates.
