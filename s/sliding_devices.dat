40|$|In {{the present}} paper the dynamic {{nonlinear}} analysis for a 3 D base isolated structure is illustrated. A base isolated reinforced concrete building is designed and verified according to the European seismic codes such that the superstructure remains almost completely elastic and the nonlinear elements are localized only in the base isolation system. Nonlinear hysteretic models have been adopted to reproduce the cyclic behavior of the isolators. Two different base isolation systems are considered and their performances are compared for evaluating the behaviour of a base isolated building, highly irregular in plan, in presence of a seismic excitation defined with recorded accelerograms which characterize the bi-directional ground motions. The isolation system has been realized with a combination in parallel of elastomeric bearings and <b>sliding</b> <b>devices.</b> In the first analyzed isolation system we have used the High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRB) {{and in the second}} analyzed isolation system we have used the Lead Rubber Bearings (LRB).

40|$|Surgery {{for early}} onset {{scoliosis}} (EOS) often requires instrumentation which enables the pediatric patientâ€™s spine to grow. The drawback of growing rods (Ellipse Technologies, USA) is {{the requirement of}} periodical extension (at least twice a year). In contrast, in growth- guidance <b>sliding</b> <b>devices</b> such as the Shilla (Medtronic, USA) or LSZ- 4 D (Conmet, Russia) the extension procedure is not necessary since only one or few fixtures are locked whilst other fixtures {{make it possible for}} rods to slide allowing growth of the spine. However, due to the absence of fusion in <b>sliding</b> <b>devices</b> increased rate of fractures of rods is possible. Additionally, movement of rods against fixtures may result in the generation of wear debris. Among traditional metallic materials used for such instrumentation titanium alloys are the most biocompatible and are widely used as fixtures material, while Nitinol, an alloy with Shape memory effect, is a promising material for rods due to having potential for more gradual and sustained correction associated with its shape memory effect and potentially reducing adjacent segment degeneration due to its super-elastic properties. The aim of this thesis was to investigate complications associated with implantation of growth-guidance sliding LSZ- 4 D in pediatric patients and to investigate the use of Nitinol and titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) for this application. Analysis of retrieved components of LSZ growth-guidance sliding device (LSZ- 4 D) made from titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) implanted in paediatric patients together with associated tissues showed metallosis which in some cases {{led to the development of}} complications including seromas and fistula formation. These complications occurred in 5 out of the 25 patients investigated. Another 4 patients encountered fatigue fracture of rods. The volume wear rate measured for the retrieved components of LSZ- 4 D was found to be 12. 5 mm 3 per year. In these 25 patients with implanted LSZ- 4 D devices there was a statistically significant increase in titanium and vanadium ions in the whole blood. With a view to replacing titanium alloy rods with Nitinol an investigation on the fatigue behaviour of Nitinol revealed that creating a microstructure which increased deformation due to a martensitic phase transformation improved high strain amplitude fatigue resistance of Nitinol, whereas precipitation of nanosize Ni-rich particles and decreasing of Ti 4 Ni 2 ox inclusions resulted in an increase in low strain fatigue resistance. The wear behaviour of Nitinol in comparison to titanium alloy was also investigated and showed that the wear resistance of Nitinol tested against titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) in the simulated body environment is approximately 100 fold greater compared to titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) and is similar to that of CoCr alloy. Nevertheless, Nitinol - Ti 6 Al 4 V combination still generates high volumetric wear associated with debris release from the Ti 6 Al 4 V component. Coating and treating the surface with TiN (titanium nitride), DLC (diamond like carbon) coatings and ion implantation of nitrogen ions in some instances reduced the wear. The deposition of a TiN coating only on the titanium component in a Nitinol - Ti 6 Al 4 V combination significantly improved the wear performance and this was associated with the protection of titanium component whereas the application of DLC improved the wear performance of both titanium and Nitinol. [on implantation or deposition of TiN or DLC coatings on both counterparts was found to be less effective. The current study indicates the importance and potential of reducing the reliance on titanium alloy by using Nitinol for patients with scoliosis and especially in those cases where relative moment of the fixtures is required, such as in growing patients...|$|E

40|$|When {{stationary}} observers view an optic-flow pattern, visually induced self-motion perception (vection) and a form {{of motion}} sickness known as simulator sickness (SS), can result. Previous results suggest that an expanding flow pattern leads to more SS than a contracting pattern. Sensory conflict, a possible cause of SS, may be more salient when an expanding optic-flow pattern is viewed. An experiment was conducted to test if a more salient sensory conflict accompanying expanding flow patterns might inhibit vection.

Vection onset and magnitude were measured for 30 s with a computer-interfaced <b>slide</b> <b>device.</b> Vection onset was significantly faster, and vection magnitude stronger, when a contracting pattern was viewed. We propose that our extensive experience with forward self-motion may form a neural expectancy (exposure-history) about the sensory inputs which typically accompany expanding flow.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} accuracy, precision, and smallest detectable {{difference for}} a three-dimensional (3 D) video motion analysis system specifically configured for measuring small and slow displacements within a small measurement volume (0 7 x 0 5 x 0 3 m). Design: Repeated measurements with random sequence of conditions. Setting: Rehabilitation research laboratory. Intervention: A reference <b>sliding</b> <b>device</b> {{was used to}} control cyclic displacements of two reflective markers over 5 calibrated ranges (l, 3, 10, 30, and 60 mm). Nine cycles were performed for each of 9 conditions (3 directions x 3 zones). Four cameras recorded all trials on tapes, which were digitized with a Kinemetrix system. Main Outcome Measures: Change in distance of the moving markers relative to a third static marker was averaged over 50 frames per trial. Mean error, mean absolute error, and intertrial and intratrial standard deviations (SDs) were calculated for each zone and direction. Results: For 810 trials, mean error and absolute error were, respectively, 034 mm and 094 mm. The mean intertrial and intratrial SDs and 99 % confidence interval were. 047 mm (CI = Â± 121 mm) and 030 mm (CI = Â±. 077 mm). The corresponding smallest detectable differences were. 171 mm and 109 mm. Conclusion: Motion analysis configured for registration within small volumes allows measurement of minuscule displacements with great accuracy and may therefore be suitable for many applications in rehabilitation research other than gait analysis.

40|$|Many {{structures}} {{representative of}} the typical construction of the seventies were designed based on codes without adequately considering the seismic design, thus probably lacking structural safety when compared with structures designed according to new codes. Such structures are very likely to require retrofit interventions that should be thoroughly assessed {{both in terms of}} the technical feasibility and economical viability, bearing in mind the huge number of existing structures in such conditions.

The paper first addresses the experimental setup, specially designed to perform biaxial bending with axial load using two horizontal and orthogonal actuators and one vertical actuator (the later with a <b>slide</b> <b>device</b> to allow topdisplacements of the column) and proceeds with the presentation of the test campaign on several RC columns presently underway at the Laboratory of Earthquake and Structural Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of theUniversity of Porto.
