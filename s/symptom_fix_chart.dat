Background: Small-screen devices containing both accelerometers and magnetometers support the development of spatially aware handheld maps. These can be designed so that symbols representing targets in the external world appear in a perspective view determined by the orientation of the device. Method: A panoramic display was used to simulate a marine environment. The task involved matching targets in the scene to symbols on simulated chart displays. In Experiment 1, a spatially aware handheld chart display was compared to a <b>fixed</b> track-up <b>chart</b> display. In Experiment 2, a gaze monitoring system was added and the distance between the chart display and the scene viewpoint was varied. Results: All respondents were faster with the handheld device.
