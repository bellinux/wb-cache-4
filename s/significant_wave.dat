5|$|Hurricane Dean {{intensified}} {{through the}} night of August19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled eye. At 0100UTC August20, the storm passed 120mi (190km) {{to the south of}} Sea Buoy42056, which recorded a <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height of 36ft (11m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high heat content, and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160mph (260km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210mi (335km) from its first landfall.|$|E
5|$|At 0930UTC on August17, {{the center}} of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia. The {{northern}} eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island's capital of Fort-de-France reported 13in (33cm) of rainfall. By this time the eyewall had closed, forming a distinct eye, and {{in an environment of}} low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly. Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category3 hurricane by the evening of August17. Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles. That evening, another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category4 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on August18, Dean reached Category5 intensity {{for the first time with}} 165mph (270km/h) winds. The storm's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size. At 0800UTC August18, Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height (average size of the largest 33% of waves) of 33ft (10m). On August18, Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall, indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category4 hurricane. That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow, and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation. Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August19 with some trochiodal wobbles.|$|E

25|$|In oceanography, rogue {{waves are}} more {{precisely}} defined as waves whose height {{is more than}} twice the <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height (Hs or SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record. Therefore, rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found on the water; they are, rather, unusually large waves for a given sea state. Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, in {{a second}} <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> of murals in the alley, Ray Patlan spearheaded the PLACA project to install murals {{throughout}} the alley featuring the common theme of a celebration of indigenous Central American cultures and a protest of US intervention in Central America. Topics of the murals included the Nicaraguan revolution, Óscar Romero, and the Guatemalan civil war. This culminated in the addition of twenty-seven murals {{during the summer of}} 1985, funded in part by a grant of $2,500 from the Zellerbach Foundation. This art project proved influential, inspiring the La Lucha Continua Art Park/La Lucha Mural Park in New York City the following year.|$|E

Though, immigration from the Dominican Republic to the Philadelphia region is increasing, most Dominicans moving to Philadelphia actually come from New York City and other nearby areas. The vast majority of Dominicans live scattered in Lower Northeast and eastern North Philadelphia especially north of Erie Avenue, sharing neighborhoods with the city's larger Puerto Rican population.
