5|$|Looking {{to build}} on the success of his 2014 season, Hughes went into the 2015 season as the Twins ace. Hughes had lost {{velocity}} in his fastball, dropping from 93MPH to 92MPH. His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen. Despite going 11-9, his ERA was 4.40 and he <b>served</b> <b>up</b> 29 home runs in only 155.1 innings.|$|E
5|$|Shakshuka, a North-African (Tunisian) dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, is a {{national}} favorite, especially in the winter. It is traditionally <b>served</b> <b>up</b> in a cast iron pan with bread to mop up the sauce. Some variations of the dish are cooked with liberal use of ingredients such as eggplant, chili peppers, hot paprika, spinach, feta cheese or safed cheese.|$|E

5|$|The early 1990s also <b>served</b> <b>up</b> {{a series}} of {{difficult}} experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton {{was having an affair}} with Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on World News Tonight, Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{development}} and improvement of the London Underground, meant that Victoria could not compete as a cross-London service. GNR trains stopped running on 1 October 1907, with Midland ones following on June the next year. The GWR ceased to use the station for scheduled services on 21 March 1915, partly due to World War I {{in addition to the}} new Underground lines. Victoria was used as the main station for drafted soldiers, and those returning from action in the war. By the middle of the war, the station served twelve trains a day running between Victoria and Folkestone, with additional trains serving Dover. The station was regularly served with a voluntary buffet for departing soldiers, who <b>served</b> <b>up</b> to 4,000 men a day. Victoria itself did not suffer significant damage during the war, but a section of Grosvenor Bridge was destroyed after an anti-aircraft shell struck a gas main underneath it.|$|E

25|$|In {{front of}} a full house at Beckenham, Mohammad Akram of the visiting Surrey Lions <b>served</b> <b>up</b> a rare maiden in Twenty20 cricket as Kent Spitfires were tied down to 140 for 8 off their twenty overs, despite Martin van Jaarsveld scoring a fifty. James Benning then made batting easy for Surrey, scoring ten fours and two sixes in a {{crackling}} 66. Surrey eventually won comparatively easily, having four overs left when they reached 141 for 3.|$|E
25|$|At Northampton, Andy Caddick <b>served</b> <b>up</b> {{an unusually}} {{economical}} spell, taking two for 12 in three overs despite two wides. That helped tie the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks down to 95 for 6 in 12 overs in the rain-shortened game, and with Graeme Smith and Keith Parsons at the crease and the score 55 for 1, things looked bright for Somerset Sabres. Two wickets from Jason Brown helped put the odds for a Northamptonshire win down, but Somerset prevailed, Parsons hitting the winning {{runs on the}} last ball as Somerset finished on 97 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking {{runs off}} the {{occasional}} bad balls that were <b>served</b> <b>up</b> by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, and before anyone noticed, they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were {{well on the}} way to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came in to bowl his first over. The ball was hurled down the pitch, and swung enough to deceive the Australian batsmen – Flintoff got Langer and Ponting out in the same over, and Australia were struggling again, the score on 48 for 2.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the match}} got on, Jones and Harmison {{putting on the}} {{pressure}} and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after {{he had failed to}} score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones <b>served</b> <b>up</b> a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 {{at the end of the}} tenth over. However, that was as good as it got for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but it mattered little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried to put himself on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then <b>served</b> <b>up</b> a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff was very good, however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of Martyn, Vaughan brought back Jones – realising that Australia were reluctant to hit runs and thus allowing Jones to get through his overs without causing as much damage as he did early on. In fact, he and Harmison {{were part of a}} remarkable streak – they <b>served</b> <b>up</b> 28 successive dot-balls to Symonds and Michael Clarke (who bowed under to the pressure and was hit on the pad, out lbw for a 19-ball two). However, Michael Hussey – facing his first ball at 93 for 5 after 25 overs – took control of Jones, and when Harmison was taken off, Australia were let off the hook.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire's scoring rate was, again, slow, {{and their}} second innings yielded 278 runs in nearly nine hours – {{though it was}} also {{frequently}} interrupted by rain. Panesar took the first five wickets, and despite partnerships of 50 for the seventh and eight wicket, Brown ended Yorkshire's innings with five of his own. The two spinners bowled 96.5 overs {{out of a total}} of 109.5 overs <b>served</b> <b>up</b> by Northamptonshire bowlers in the second innings, and ended with uncannily similar second-innings bowling analyses: Brown 50.5–14–95–5, Panesar 46–15–96–5. Brown and Panesar also split the 20 wickets equally between them – the second time in the history of the first-class game that this feat had occurred, and the first in 100 years.|$|E

25|$|The Angels {{returned}} the favor in Game 3 with a walk-off win of their own. Vladimir Guerrero hit a huge game tying two-run homer off Andy Pettitte with two {{out in the}} bottom of the 6th, and Jeff Mathis laced a game-winning RBI double {{in the bottom of}} the 11th to win the game for the Angels, 5-4. This came after a controversial decision from manager Joe Girardi to lift David Robertson for Alfredo Aceves with two out and no one on in the 11th. Aceves <b>served</b> <b>up</b> a single to Howie Kendrick, followed by the Mathis double. Four solo home runs accounted for the Yankees' scoring, hit by Derek Jeter, Rodriguez, Johnny Damon and Jorge Posada.|$|E
25|$|The first match saw two Slam champions between Li Na and Samantha Stosur, {{with the}} winner {{advancing}} to the semifinals. Samantha Stosur <b>served</b> <b>up</b> a barrage of kick serves and blasted some ferocious forehands to completely confound Li Na in 66 minutes, 6–1, 6–0, improving to 6–0 in the pair's head-to-head series and dealing the Chinese her most lopsided loss on the WTA in almost {{three and a half}} years. Their sixth meeting at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships on Friday was by far their quickest, as Stosur hit far more winners (15 to 4) and was cleaner on the unforced errors (22 to 32) and basically dominated every department, losing her serve from 30-0 up in the fifth game of the match but otherwise winning every game en route to her easiest victory since Dubai in February.|$|E
25|$|The numbers {{involved}} in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives <b>served</b> <b>up</b> refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime. With so much money on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire {{never managed}} to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a {{relatively}} easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis <b>served</b> <b>up</b> some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. It did nt matter much – Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked them off to book Hampshire's place in the C Trophy final.|$|E
25|$|The seafood safari episode {{saw many}} firsts for the Great BBQ Challenge. The first dessert to be cooked {{entirely on the}} BBQ, the first entree and the first tears of the series. Restaurateur Fenton shocked the judges with his {{signature}} dish, the great Aussie pavlova with boozy summer fruits. Darwin cook Lisette <b>served</b> <b>up</b> antipasto and Perth IT professional Laz had all the right flavours with his stir fry vegetables and lamb chops. During the screen test Fenton's explosive nature impressed Mark and Julia while Laz came out on top with his clear delivery and knowledge base. The final challenge was to cook up a seafood feast. Laz's cook in the bag technique came under criticism from Ben as he didn't clean the flat plate between courses and mixed his meal with the charred remains of the previous dish. Fenton's Moreton Bay bugs prepared with Asian flavours, secured the win from the judges and moved him to tears and into the semi finals.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking {{runs off}} the {{occasional}} bad balls that were <b>served</b> <b>up</b> by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, {{and by the}} twelfth over they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were {{well on the way}} to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came and bowled the over of the series. He failed to make the hat-trick he was on from the last innings, but with his second ball he bowled Langer with a leg cutter. His third delivery was narrowly turned down for lbw, the fourth found Ponting's edge but failed to carry to slip, an lbw appeal on the fifth was also turned down, but his sixth which Ponting left outside the offstump was a no ball, so there was a seventh and final delivery, another leg cutter and Ponting was out caught behind. Including the previous innings, Flintoff had taken four wickets in nine balls. But more importantly, Australia had been reduced from 47/0 to 48/2.|$|E
