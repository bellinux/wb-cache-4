5|$|On 24 July 1837, Rajendra's {{youngest}} son, Devendra Bikram Shah, {{an infant}} of six months, died <b>suddenly.</b> <b>It</b> {{was at once}} rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his party. On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed. Under torture, Ekdev confessed, and thus confirmed a widely circulated rumor, that he was directed by Bhimsen to poison not just Devendra, but King Girvan as well.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Doggett {{wakes up}} and discovers that he now has a third eye {{in the middle of}} his forehead. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>it</b> vanishes. At the FBI building, he talks to Skinner, hoping for reassurance. He expresses his fear that, despite Tipet being in a coma, Tipet may still be able to enter into his dreams. Skinner, however, dismisses his {{concerns}} and sends him home. While leaving, Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet, ordering him to kill Scully. Suddenly, Doggett finds himself in front of Scully. Rather than kill his partner, he turns the axe upon himself. Doggett is immediately awakened from his dark reverie and finds himself in his bedroom, with Scully standing over his bed. He begins to thank her for saving his life, but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} {{requests for}} design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for £2,675,000, and Rio de Janeiros keel was laid {{for the fourth}} time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again; by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>it</b> seemed that Rio de Janeiro would be outclassed upon completion. Making matters worse, a European depression {{after the end of the}} Second Balkan War in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the Brazilian rubber monopoly to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5 percent between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6 percent, respectively. The Brazilian Navy later claimed that selling Rio de Janeiro was a tactical decision, so they could have two divisions of battleships: two with 12-inch guns (the Minas Geraes class), and two with 15-inch guns.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} the wizard's voice was astounding. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>it</b> became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves stopped their ears.|$|E
25|$|<b>Suddenly,</b> <b>it</b> was her {{regime that}} was in trouble. She could not {{comprehend}} how Nwe's small band of men could have defeated the Pegu army. But she also realized from the open bickering between Zeik-Bye and Maru {{that she was in}} no position to organize another attack. She ordered an immediate upgrade of Pegu's moats and fortified walls. Zeik-Bye meanwhile kept Nwe apprised of the developments. By then, her authority was too weak. When Nwe and his small army appeared outside Pegu's walls on 10 December 1383, she could do nothing other than hunker down inside the city walls.|$|E
25|$|The high {{loss of life}} {{caused by}} the {{earthquake}} {{can be attributed to}} the time it struck and how <b>suddenly</b> <b>it</b> struck, as well as to the quality and nature of building construction in China. The earthquake lacked the foreshocks that sometimes come with earthquakes of this magnitude. It also struck at just before 4a.m., when most people were asleep and unprepared. Tangshan itself was thought to be in a region with a relatively low risk of earthquakes. Very few buildings had been built to withstand an earthquake, and the city lies on unstable alluvial soil. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} railroad strikes {{was also one of}} the most successful. In 1885, the Knights of Labor led railroad workers to victory against Jay Gould and his entire Southwestern Railway system. In early 1886, the Knights were trying to coordinate 1,400 strikes involving over 600,000 workers spread over much of the country. The tempo had doubled over 1885, and involved peaceful as well as violent confrontations in many sectors, such as railroads, street railroads, coal mining, and the McCormick Reaper Factory in Chicago, with demands usually focused on the eight hour day. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>it</b> all collapsed, largely because the Knights were unable to handle so much on their plate at once, and because they took a smashing blow in the aftermath of the Haymarket Riot in May 1886 in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have {{a good view of the}} landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>it</b> becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.|$|E
25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was worried about him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma wants to talk to Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and <b>suddenly,</b> <b>it</b> appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the past films, the future of the {{franchise}} was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and <b>suddenly</b> <b>it</b> all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because you shoot out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because <b>suddenly</b> <b>it</b> was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never going to be doing this again.|$|E
500|$|When the {{political}} solution failed (see [...] "PDPA base" [...] section), the Afghan {{government and the}} Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily. The change from a political to a military solution did not come <b>suddenly.</b> <b>It</b> began in January 1981, as Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and decorated one general and thirteen colonels. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of arms duty was extended and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June 1981, Assadullah Sarwari lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, replaced by Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, a former tank commander and Minister of Communications, Major General Mohammad Rafi was madeMinister of Defence and Mohammad Najibullah appointed KHAD Chairman.|$|E
500|$|Common {{marginal}} gingivitis {{in response}} to subgingival plaque is usually a painless condition. However, an acute form of gingivitis/periodontitis, termed acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), can develop, often <b>suddenly.</b> <b>It</b> is associated with severe periodontal pain, bleeding gums, [...] "punched out" [...] ulceration, loss of the interdental papillae, and possibly also halitosis (bad breath) and a bad taste. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress, and immunosuppression. This condition is not contagious, but multiple cases may simultaneously occur in populations who share the same risk factors (such as students in a dormitory {{during a period of}} examination). ANUG is treated over several visits, first with debridement of the necrotic gingiva, homecare with hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, analgesics and, when the pain has subsided sufficiently, cleaning below the gumline, both professionally and at home. Antibiotics are not indicated in ANUG management unless there is underlying systemic disease.|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{view the}} scene in which Cagney pushes a {{grapefruit}} into Mae Clarke's face {{as one of the}} most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a late addition, and who thought of the idea is a matter of debate. Producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference, director William Wellman claimed that the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face. Cagney himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman's idea, saying, [...] "I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit. I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea <b>suddenly.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't even written into the script.".|$|E
500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and <b>suddenly</b> <b>it</b> seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Massimo, {{reviewing}} the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote {{that as a}} musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but [...] "that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work." [...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and <b>suddenly</b> <b>it</b> doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open your show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E
