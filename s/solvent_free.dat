40|$|The {{behavior}} of solvents {{under conditions of}} rapid cooling is investigated. It is demonstrated that certain coal solvents form glasses on quenching at 60 K/min whereas others form crystals. In swollen coals, most <b>free</b> <b>solvents</b> tend to go into glassy states. An important exception is pyridine. The formation of glasses by <b>free</b> <b>solvents</b> has two effects on differential scattering calorimetry results.

It is concluded that investigations of phase transitions in swollen coals should preferably be performed at the ''gel'' point, with no <b>free</b> <b>solvent</b> present.

40|$|The maleinisation of LDPE {{in various}} {{aromatic}} solvents {{in the presence}} of radical initiators was studied. A strong influence of the solvent on the reaction was observed and attributed mainly to the presence of benzylic hydrogens in the solvent molecule. It was confirmed that, during the polymer maleinisation, the benzylic hydrogens take part in the reaction with MA. The pure xylene isomers were investigated as solvents and the MA content in the polymer was found to depend on the kind of isomer employed as a solvent in the order: o-xylene < m-xylene < p-xylene. Under these conditions, most of the reacted MA is linked with the solvent molecules. Using <b>solvents</b> <b>free</b> of benzylic hydrogens (t-butylbenzene or o-dichlorobenzene) all the reacted MA is linked with the polymer.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Thermodynamic {{compensation}} in {{the interaction}} of quinoline antimalarials with haematin in 40 % (v/v) aqueous OMSO has been compared with that in pure aqueous solution. The data indicate {{that the degree of}} desolvation and loss of conformational freedom is identical in both systems. The nature of interactions between quinoline drugs and haematin was investigated spectroscopically in organic and mixed <b>solvents.</b> <b>Free</b> energies of association of chloroquine, quinine and quinidine with haematin are largely insensitive to the increasing concentration of NaCI 0. This demonstrates that electrostatic interactions play a minor role in the overall stability of these complexes under these conditions. Increasing concentration of OM SO weakens association of chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinine, quinidine and 9 -epiquinine with haematin. These effects suggest that the interactions are hydrophobic. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that free energy of association with haematin weakens as a function of decreasing solvent polarity in organic <b>solvents.</b> However, <b>free</b> energies of association are weaker in mixed aqueous solvents than in pure organic solvents. This indicates that dispersion and electrostatic interactions are relatively stronger in a non-aqueous environment. A new assay has been developed for measuring inhibition of,ß-haematin formation using 5 % (v/v) aqueous pyridine solution. This pyridine solution forms a low complex with haematin in aqueous solution but not with,ß-haematin. Formation of ß-haematin is brought about in 4. 5 M acetate, pH 4. 5 at 60 °C. The assay is rapid (60 min incubation) and requires no centrifugation or expensive radioactive material. This assay is compatible with high throughput screening and analysis can be done by visual inspection of,ß- haematin inhibitors. The IC⁵⁰ values obtained were compared with those reported in other assays for 13 compounds investigated. There was generally a good correlation between the pyridine assay and other assays. Used qualitatively, the method was also employed for screening 48 compounds for,ß-haematin inhibition.

Dihydropyrimidinones are used in medications such as calcium channel blockers, and HIVgp-120-CD4 inhibitors. It also {{has been used as a}} tranquilizer. Magnesium bromide in combination with CH2Cl2 catalyzes a reaction that causes specific symmetry and chiral centers through hydrogenation of olefins. Magnesium bromide when bonded to other functional groups has shown more practical uses other than catalyzing reactions. When bonded to an ethyl group it is used for regiospecific analysis of triglycerols. Magnesium bromide hexahydrate is being worked with to be used as a flame retardant. It was found that if 0.125 mol/L of magnesium bromide hexahydrate was added to a cotton material it acted as a flame retardant. Magnesium bromide was used to synthesize the first stable magnesium silylenoid. A silylenoid is a compound that contains R2SiMX (M is metal and R is an organic moiety). Traditionally only lithium, potassium, and sodium could be used. The magnesium silylenoid is synthesized through the addition of magnesium bromide to lithium lithium methyl bromosilylenoid. The magnesium atom replaces the lithium in the complex and has a bromide attached to it. This complex is stable at room temperature.|$|E

Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing rebar. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as terrazzo flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.Epoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds [...] Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil).

The purpose of this thesis was to collect isocyanates in air with impinger-filter samplers and <b>solvent</b> <b>free</b> samplers. Furthermore the isocyanates were to be analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The <b>solvent</b> <b>free</b> sampler consists of a polypropylene tube and filter holder fitted with glass fiber filters impregnated with derivatization reagent, coupled with a pump. The impinger-filter sampler was made out of an impinger flask, containing a derivatization solution, coupled in series with a filter holder and a pump. Di-n-butylamine was used as derivatization reagent in both samplers to stabilize the reactive isocyanates and to enable mass spectrometric detection. The <b>solvent</b> <b>free</b> sampler is highly advantageous because of its user friendliness during field measurements, as opposed to the impinger-filter method. An exposure chamber, equipped with two interior fans to ensure good circulation, was used to generate an atmosphere containing isocyanates. Analyzing the isocyanate-DBA derivates with LC-MS/MS worked very well and the method made it possible to detect isocyanate levels below 1 ng/mL. During quantification of isocyanates a standard curve with concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/mL was used. Detection of isocyanate levels as low as one fifth of the limit value of some isocyanates was found to be possible, which would indicate that the methods are sensitive. Even though the <b>solvent</b> <b>free</b> sampler worked, the impinger-filter sampler was found to be more effective in collecting isocyanates. The coefficient of variation calculated from concentrations of isocyanates from the <b>solvent</b> <b>free</b> sampler varied between 0 - 35 %.
