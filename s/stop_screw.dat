5000|$|The {{earliest}} sealed tuners, {{as early}} as 1972 (e.g. DR-9, DR-11) had a 6-sided cast body and no brand name (11:1 ratio,) while there were others later on that more resembled Schaller (<b>stop</b> <b>screw</b> to the inside, Schaller style buttons.) or Grover tuners (<b>stop</b> <b>screw</b> below but without the familiar crescent knob.) Few of these sealed tuners were branded at all, while others in later years show [...] "Sigma" [...] stamped on their backs.|$|E
50|$|By {{pushing the}} hand lever of a manual turret forward, the tool is moved via the turret's slide toward the {{workpiece}} {{being held by}} the chuck, soon making contact and cutting or forming the part. On the return stroke, the tool is retracted and then indexed to the next tool held in the turret. In this way, a sequence of operations can be performed on a part without switching tools with each operation. That is, different tools can be shifted into position without the need to unscrew one and screw in another. Each tool can be set for a different length of travel by a <b>stop</b> <b>screw</b> located at the far right of the turret.|$|E

50|$|She next sighted {{an enemy}} {{transport}} and four destroyers off Balikpapan on 26 January. Sturgeon fired a spread from her forward tubes {{which resulted in}} a large explosion on the transport, and her <b>screws</b> <b>stopped</b> turning. No post-war record of a sinking could be found, but the transport was believed damaged. Three days later, she made two hits on a tanker.|$|R
50|$|Like the CW Sling, the Ching sling uses three sling sockets. Unlike the CW Sling, the Ching sling {{consists}} of a main strap, which {{is attached to the}} forearm and buttstock sockets like a normal carry sling, and a short strap. A clockwise half twist in the sling at the fore-end socket allows the strap to lie flat against the arm when shooting. A <b>stop</b> button <b>screws</b> onto the main strap about two-thirds back from the front loop. The short strap attaches to the middle socket and to an oval ring that slides freely along the main strap between the forearm sling loop and the button. The unfinished side faces the muzzle.|$|R
50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or dowel pin is used. The button <b>stop</b> is <b>screwed</b> to the housing, while the dowel pin keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a dowel pin that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|R
30|$|Major {{blood loss}} and {{associated}} coagulopathy {{are one of}} the major risk factors for severe complications and deaths in patients undergoing surgery for neuromuscular scoliosis [21]. Therefore, one of the major clinical advantages of pedicle screw constructs over hybrid or Luque–Galveston instrumentation seems to be limited blood loss. Passing a sublaminar wire or hook into the epidural space may start epidural venous bleeding, which can be difficult stop and can restart at every level of instrumentation. In contrast, the pedicle screw is an implant, which, when optimally placed, does not violate the spinal canal. If bleeding starts from the cancellous bone of the vertebral body, it usually <b>stops</b> after <b>screw</b> insertion. Additionally, while pedicle screws may sometimes take a longer time to insert than hybrid anchors, many anterior approaches were also avoided.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 June, Whale sighted the masts of a {{seaplane}} tender, and tracked {{and closed}} the target. The submarine launched four torpedoes, scoring three hits. The target's <b>screws</b> <b>stopped</b> instantly, and powerful, rumbling explosions came from the target. However, the tender must have managed to limp to port since postwar study of Japanese records did not confirm a kill. An escort was [...] "running wild" [...] toward Whale, so she went deep and eluded her pursuer.|$|R
2500|$|On 9 September, she fired three bow tubes at a Kaidai-class {{submarine}} off Surigao Strait.

60|$|I was {{too much}} taken by {{surprise}} {{to think of the}} proper cause of the report. I don't even know what I made of it. I was obsessed, I suppose, by that perpetual dread of the modern aeronaut, a flash between engine and balloon. Yet obviously I wasn't wrapped in flames. I ought to have realised instantly it wasn't that. I did, at any rate, whatever other impressions there were, release the winding of the outer net and let the balloon expand again, and that no doubt did something to break my fall. I don't remember doing that. Indeed, all I do remember is the giddy effect upon the landscape of falling swiftly upon it down a flat spiral, the hurried rush of fields and trees and cottages on my left shoulder and the overhung feeling as if the whole apparatus was pressing down the top of my head. I didn't stop or attempt to <b>stop</b> the <b>screw.</b> That was going on, swish, swish, swish all the time.|$|R
5000|$|Following a month {{there for}} refit and training, Threadfin {{embarked}} upon her second war patrol on 14 March. She initially joined a coordinated attack group composed of herself, and submarines [...] and [...] During her five-day tour with that wolf pack, Threadfin made two attacks on enemy shipping. On {{the afternoon of}} 28 March, she came across two Japanese destroyer escort-type warships and apparently dispatched one with a single hit from a spread of six torpedoes. The stricken warship's <b>screws</b> <b>stopped</b> while her colleague's depth charge attack deprived Threadfin of definite knowledge of the ultimate result. That evening, the submarine tangled with a convoy composed of two small trawlers and four luggers. During the ensuing surface gun engagement, the submarine inflicted serious damage {{on two of the}} luggers, moderate damage on the trawlers, and minor damage on the remaining pair of luggers. Though disconcerting, the Japanese return fire proved ineffectual.|$|R
5000|$|Carefully {{maneuvering}} into position, Thornback fired {{one shot}} from her stern tubes at 04:29 and soon heard a small explosion which <b>stopped</b> the enemy's <b>screws.</b> Almost immediately the submariners picked up new sounds—two more escorts, [...] "pinging" [...] and coming aggressively closer. After sizing {{up the new}} attackers, Thornback {{felt that they were}} too small to use a torpedo on—besides, a Japanese floatplane had begun circling the area. A rowboat with a few Japanese sailors amidst a pile of flotsam testified {{to the fact that the}} first ship was no longer there. Satisfied that their quarry had been sunk, the submarine cleared the area. One of the other escorts gave up the chase and picked up survivors of her sunken sister. [...] "All antisubmarine vessels have closed the beach," [...] Thornback’s commander later recorded, [...] "and seem to be pinging away at the rocks." ...|$|R
40|$|Candy sprays are {{a type of}} confectionary sold in pump sprays {{and sprayed}} {{directly}} into the mouth. To achieve a particularly sour taste, candy sprays typically have a high citric acid content. The BfR has assessed the health risks potentially arising from the consumption of such products. The BfR notably regards candy sprays as problematic which are high in citric acid. High citric acid contents can, for example, lead to irritations of the mucous membrane in the mouth and may cause breathing difficulties and damage to teeth. Additionally, the BfR is critical {{of the use of}} such products as a spray, because candy sprays may – either inadvertently or deliberately – be inhaled or sprayed into the eyes. Another potential misuse of is the removal of the spray head for the purpose of drinking the product. The effects of the citric acid on the skin, mucosa, eyes and enamel depend on the acid’s concentration, the pH value of the product, as well as duration and frequency of use. However, {{on the basis of the}} available data, no citric acid content can be defined up to which the acid is safe to use. Given the misuses to be expected and against the background that children are the main user group, the BfR therefore rates the products as an unsafe food overall. In the view of the BfR, options for improving consumer protection include: labelling of products with additional warnings, equipping the packaging with a mechanism that <b>stops</b> consumers <b>screwing</b> or twisting off the spray head, and limiting the content of citric acid approximately to the level contained in lemon juice (i. e. a maximum of 7 %) ...|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1942 Daimler {{had also been}} working on an {{upgraded}} D-series engine that could run on either C2 or C3 fuel. The first of these, which appeared in late 1944, were a small series of DB 605DM, followed by the main production series, the DB 605DB/DC. These engines were fitted with an adjustable <b>screw</b> <b>stop</b> which allowed the use of either B4 fuel with MW-50, or C-3 fuel without MW-50, {{in which case the}} engine was designated DB 605DB, or the use of C-3 fuel with MW-50, in which case the engine was given the -DC suffix instead. In its DB-suffix form the engine generated 1,800 PS (1,775 hp) for take-off at 1.8 ata, while the DC was capable of 2,000 PS (1,973 hp) at 1.98 ata. If MW-50 was not available for use with the B4 fuel the throttle was limited to 1.45 ata for the entire flight. Thus, this series was ideally suited to catering for the chaotic fuel supply situation prevalent during the last months of the Third Reich. These engines were mainly used in the Bf 109G-10 and K-4 series.|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for tapping and screw insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be <b>stopped</b> before the <b>screw</b> head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during tapping and screw insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during tapping and screw insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the stripping torque...|$|R
40|$|Mobile polyethilenic beating was {{introduced}} in the design of knee prostheses in the early 80 s with the aim to join motion, surface congruity and low contact stress. Based on the successful results achieved after over 20 years experience, mobile bearing knee prostheses are now widely used all over the world. Genesis® Mobile Bearing Knee is characterized by a flat and polished tibial plateau (CoCr alloy) with an anterior plug working as a stop for a poly bearing able to multidirectional motion. Additionally, the bearing motion can be restricted by using a <b>screw</b> <b>stopping</b> translation: in this condition the bearing becomes able of rotation only. The aim of this paper was to assess short-term results of a group of mobile knee prostheses obtained with conventional technique and mini-invasive technique. Methods. At the Orthopaedic Department of Genoa University from October 2003 to June 2004 we implanted 51 Genesis® Mobile Bearing knee prostheses in 51 patients (mean age 67. 8 years), because of arthritis in all the cases. In 30 patients we performed a less invasive surgical approach (midvastus) with respect of the quadriceps tendon and without patella dislocation (9 cases: conventional incision and set of instruments: 21 cases: short medial incision - 7 / 10 cm - and dedicated set of instruments). Results. The midvastus approach have improved patellar tracking: only 3 / 30 patients (1 %) need lateral release. All the 51 patients have been evaluated with a follow up ranging from 19 months to 11 months, with the aim to evaluate the clinical impact of both mobile bearing and less invasive surgical approach. Clinical results (Knee Society Score System) can be resumed as follows: excellent in 26 cases (51 %), good in 16 cases (31 %), fair in 6 cases (12 %) and bad in 3 cases (6 %). All the patients, especially those in which a less invasive approach had been used, have shown a faster recovery and a wider range of motion, reasonably related to the above mentioned improved patellar tracking. One patient has shown a limited range of motion and 3 patients have complained about spread mild pain and swelling: however, these results are scantily significant because of the too short follow up. Two patients, in which the bearing motion was restricted by the screw, have complained about postero-lateral pain during flexion, due to impingement with the popliteus tendon: this could be a real problem, caused by either the shape of the bearing (too high posterior edge) and the restricted translation. Conclusion. Even if in our experience there is a very short follow-up, the results obtained have been encouraging at least at very short term as to a rapid recovery and a wider range of motion; however, it should be underlined that these results become overlapping at middle-term...|$|R
