40|$|This thesis reports {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} three-dimensional (3 D) unsteady cross flow over two <b>ship</b> <b>sections</b> located side-by-side. The <b>ship</b> <b>sections</b> have different breadth and draft conditions which represent typical situations in a ship-to-ship marine operation in a cross current. The mean flow field, vortex formation and hydrodynamic forces {{acting on the}} two <b>ship</b> <b>sections</b> are predicted by using CFD methods. The capacity of LES turbulence models for calculating such complex flow is studied. In order to do that, the numerical models were tested on several benchmark cases. When the ship is under cross flow, the hull behaves as a bluff body more than a slender structure. Before calculating the cross flow of two <b>ship</b> <b>sections</b> which has highly complex geometry and flow conditions, flow around more simple bluff body geometries are calculated and the result are compared with measurements...|$|R

40|$|The master {{thesis is}} a {{parallel}} {{development of a}} Maritime Manufacturing Robotics project. The aim of the thesis {{is to find out}} how to make it easier and convenient for robotic welding in <b>ship</b> <b>section</b> production by improving ship structures. The objective is to design a work process and evaluation method to be followed to do structure optimization work for robotic welding. Robotic welding system for shipbuilding industry is analysed from three aspects: ship structure, welding robot and welding technology. Focused on structure improvements for robotic welding, a structure optimization process and evaluation methods to evaluate the results are designed. <b>Ship</b> <b>sections</b> which contain a superstructure section, a double bottom section and a bow section are chosen to make three scenarios. The structure optimization process and evaluation methods are applied in these scenarios.

5000|$|The Mitsui Line was {{originally}} the shipping {{department of the}} trading company Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. Mitsui Bussan was established in 1876 and obtained exclusive rights to export and market the coal mined at the state-run Miike mines. It chartered boats and transported coal on its own account. In 1878 it bought a steamship, and in 1888 it bought the mines. Mitsui Bussan became an industrial carrier and the <b>shipping</b> <b>section</b> was established in 1898. The section expanded to become the Shipping Department and moved to Kobe in 1904. The company then owned 9 ships aggregating , and {{on the eve of}} World War I the fleet totalled 15 ships with , increasing to 30 ships totalling [...] in 1919. The third general manager, Teijiro Kawamura, expanded the business of the department during World War I; in 1914 it began a tramp service carrying the company's own cargo and that of other companies. In 1917 it constructed a shipyard and set up the shipbuilding department and in 1920 it opened a semi-liner service from Dalian via Kobe to Seattle, whereby a liner service operated on outbound voyages but on the return voyage, owing to insufficient cargo at Seattle, ships had to stop and collect cargo at other ports.|$|E

50|$|Weeroona {{became part}} of the United States Army {{permanent}} local fleet under the Southwest Pacific Area command's supply organization, United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA), and was used extensively serving as a quarters ship for American maritime personnel. As part of the Small <b>Ships</b> <b>Section</b> the vessel was given the local fleet number S-195 and perhaps also as CSQ-1. Weeroona was used as a quarters ship by Australian personnel under contract to the U.S. Army's Small <b>Ships</b> <b>Section</b> in Sydney and New Guinea. The ship was also used by U.S. Army Signal Corps personnel, some of whom were setting up small ships as communications ships, as barracks and dubbed CSQ for communications ship quarters. Weeroona was towed from New Guinea to the Philippines to support Allied forces there at Leyte Gulf and eventually serving as a barracks and convalescent ship in Manila until towed back to Sydney where she lingered in the harbor until broken up in 1951.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alternative}} of resupply by sea {{was equally}} problematic. Before the war, coastal traders approached {{the north coast}} of New Guinea from Rabaul, {{on the island of}} New Britain. This route was denied by the Japanese occupation of the island. The coastal passage from Milne Bay was treacherous and lacked an identified safe sea route. An assortment of small vessels were operated by the Small <b>Ships</b> <b>Section</b> of the US Army Services of Supply (USASOS). The vessels were [...] "schooners, motorships, motor launches, cabin cruisers, ketches, trawlers, barges, and miscellaneous vessels, most of which were ancient and rusty." [...] They were leased or requisitioned by the US Army and largely crewed by Australians under contract with USASOS. Initially, these vessels faced a constant threat of attack by Japanese planes. This situation eased as the Allies began to achieve air dominance near the end of 1942. The Small <b>Ships</b> <b>Section</b> was operating vessels up to 500 tons but most were significantly smaller than this.|$|R
