50|$|According to Moser, M. A., since 1990s the Smart Communities {{movement}} {{took shape}} {{as a strategy}} to broaden the base of users involved in IT. Members of these Communities are people that share their interest and work in a partnership with govern and other institutional organizations to push the use of IT {{to improve the quality}} of daily life as a consequence of different worsening in daily actions. Eger, J. M. said that a <b>smart</b> <b>community</b> makes a conscious and agreed-upon decision to deploy technology as a catalyst to solving its social and business needs. It is very important to understand that this use of IT and the consequent improvement could be more demanding without the institutional help; indeed institutional involvement is essential to the success of <b>smart</b> <b>community</b> initiatives. Again Moser, M. A. explained that “building and planning a <b>smart</b> <b>community</b> seeks for smart growth”; a smart growth is essential what the partnership between citizen and institutional organizations try to do that is a reaction to worsening trends in daily things, like for instance traffic congestion, school overcrowding and air pollution. However it is important noticed that technological propagation is not an end in itself, but only a means to reinventing cities for a new economy and society. To sum up, it could possible to assert that any Smart City initiatives necessitate the governance support for their success.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Via {{embracing}} {{the idea that}} who directly experiences a problem is keener to develop more innovative solutions, local governments have started to engage smart communities in the innovation of public services' delivery. Even if the meaning of "smart community" generally refers to the community participation in the innovation of public services for urban living, local governments have predominantly stimulated the participation of their citizens. But innovative ideas can potentially spring out also from the insiders. This paper aims to find the managerial and technological issues that public managers have to consider when planning an internal <b>smart</b> <b>community</b> initiative. Methodology - For this purpose, the authors analyse the case study of the Municipality of Turin that developed a participatory <b>smart</b> <b>community</b> project, named Innova.

Data {{is from a}} RCUK-funded project called <b>Smart</b> <b>Communities,</b> see more detail: [URL] There are 462 cases and around 260 variables. There is one data file (SPSS) and the survey instrument. Project description: <b>Smart</b> <b>Communities</b> was a {{three and a half}} year – largely demand-side or ‘behaviour change’ – community energy project (January 2011 to June 2014). The project drew on the principles of action research, and took place in Kingston upon Thames. The main action phase of the project was from May 2011 to May 2013. In broad terms, the <b>Smart</b> <b>Communities</b> findings support the contemporary policy focus on demand-side action, community energy, and energy consumption feedback. At the same time, the project highlights the long term and challenging nature of these strategies, and the implications of this for funding. The findings emphasise: the complexity and household-specific nature of energy know-how (ideas about ways to reduce energy consumption and the know-how to put these ideas into practice); the lack of energy know-how among householders as a key constraint on change; and, practical ways in which more widespread know-how might be developed. With particular reference to the smart meter roll-out, the project highlights a number of ways in which householder engagement with energy consumption feedback can be enhanced and prolonged (in particular, through ongoing communications that prompt action, offer advice and create a ‘sense of being part of something’). The project also emphasises the benefits of action on energy within a primary school, {{and the ways in which}} this prompts engagement with energy in the home...|$|R

An online A/C energy management algorithm is developed, based on Lyapunov optimization, that considers both the A/C energy consumption and the thermal comfort level of consumers.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Smart</b> <b>community</b> leverages {{information}} and com-munications technology {{to improve the}} quality of life in terms of education, health care, and government services. In <b>smart</b> <b>community,</b> residents manage their home appliances to coop-erate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for <b>smart</b> <b>community</b> to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.
