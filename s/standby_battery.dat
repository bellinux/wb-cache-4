5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the 2007 revision of IEEE Std 937 - 2000 – IEEE Recommended Practice for Installation and Maintenance of Lead-Acid Batteries for Photovoltaic (PV) Systems, and its purpose. It discusses some of the basic differences between photovoltaic-system battery requirements and those of traditional stationary <b>standby</b> <b>battery</b> systems. Of particular interest to the audience is how a battery’s application and environment affect the recommended practices. Photovoltaic (PV) installations differ from industrial standby installations—such as telecommunications, uninterruptible power supplies, and utilities—in several key areas, including charge and discharge rates, depth of discharge, state of charge, and application temperature. Despite using the same lead-acid battery types, such conditions require changes in how the batteries should be installed and maintained. IEEE Std 937 can assist in maximizing battery life for those with atypical industrial applications that may have some of the same characteristics as a pure PV installation...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a modular, {{flexible}} and extensible distributed CAN-based battery management system is examined in this thesis. The advent of next generation networks has placed an increasing demand for greater reliability from telecommunication power systems. A crucial component of the power system is the <b>standby</b> <b>battery</b> network. Battery networks are typically monitored by battery management systems. Existing management systems {{are more concerned with}} process level control methodology rather than system level organisation of the network architecture. Moreover, most existing systems are based on proprietary communication protocols. The proposed management solution addresses these local area network limitations, as well as the distribution of intelligence at the process level, integration between the local and wide area networks and transparency between the process and user levels. The local network organisation is based on generic network nodes which perform management, monitoring and control activities through specialised hardware interfaces. Remote connectivity to the local network is facilitated through applet-servlet communication over the Internet. A modular design has been applied to the implementation of the node software to allow easy expandability of node functionality. The local battery network has been naturally and logically partitioned and a distributed data organisation has been adopted to facilitate transparency of data transfer from the process-level to the user-level via a well-defined communication channel. The system design is based on isolated concurrent processes that ensure system stability and successfully integrate the local control network with the wide network. A messaging system for the local CAN network has been formulated based on transmission of command, data and status messages related to battery management functionality. Performance analysis of the local network and the node organisation has shown the substantial capacity of the proposed system for handling the battery management application. The designed battery network simulation model allows the performance evaluation of various battery application scenarios. The simulation model focuses on the generic components within the management system and encapsulates the primary features of the network organisation. The Extend simulation package has been used {{in the design of the}} model. The key criteria of the simulation model organisation and model block design are well defined. Limitations of the simulation package have also been identified...|$|E

50|$|The grid {{developed}} by Faure was of pure lead with connecting rods of lead at right angles. In contrast, present-day grids are structured for improved mechanical strength and improved current flow. In addition to different grid patterns (ideally, all {{points on the}} plate are equidistant from the power conductor), modern-day processes also apply one or two thin fibre-glass mats over the grid to distribute the weight more evenly. And while Faure had used pure lead for his grids, within a year (1881) these had been superseded by lead-antimony (8-12%) alloys to give the structures additional rigidity. However, high-antimony grids have higher hydrogen evolution (which also accelerates as the battery ages), and thus greater outgassing and higher maintenance costs. These issues were identified by U. B. Thomas and W. E. Haring at Bell Labs in the 1930s and {{eventually led to the}} development of lead-calcium grid alloys in 1935 for <b>standby</b> power <b>batteries</b> on the U.S. telephone network. Related research {{led to the development of}} lead-selenium grid alloys in Europe a few years later. Both lead-calcium and lead-selenium grid alloys still add antimony, albeit in much smaller quantities than the older high-antimony grids: lead-calcium grids have 4-6% antimony while lead-selenium grids have 1-2%. These metallurgical improvements give the grid more strength, which allows it carry more weight, i.e. more active material, and so the plates can be thicker, which in turn contributes to battery lifespan since there is more material available to shed before the battery becomes unusable. High-antimony alloy grids are still used in batteries intended for frequent cycling, e.g. in motor-starting applications where frequent expansion/contraction of the plates needs to be compensated for, but where outgassing is not significant since charge currents remain low. Since the 1950s, batteries designed for infrequent cycling applications (e.g., <b>standby</b> power <b>batteries)</b> increasingly have lead-calcium or lead-selenium alloy grids since these have less hydrogen evolution and thus lower maintenance overhead. Lead-calcium alloy grids are cheaper to manufacture (the cells thus have lower up-front costs), and have a lower self-discharge rate, and lower watering requirements, but have slightly poorer conductivity, are mechanically weaker (and thus require more antimony to compensate), and are strongly subject to corrosion (and thus a shorter lifespan) than cells with lead-selenium alloy grids.|$|R

50|$|A pragmatic {{effort was}} {{launched}} to improve IS-54 that eventually added an extra channel to the IS-54 hybrid design. Unlike IS-54, IS-136 utilizes {{time division multiplexing}} for both voice and control channel transmissions.

IS-136 systems needed to support millions of AMPS phones, {{most of which were}} designed and manufactured before IS-54 and IS-136 were considered. IS-136 added a number of features to the original IS-54 specification, including text messaging, circuit switched data (CSD), and an improved compression protocol. IS-136 TDMA traffic channels use π/4-DQPSK modulation at a 24.3-kilobaud channel rate and gives an effective 48.6 kbit/s data rate across the six time slots comprising one frame in the 30 kHz channel.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} VRLA battery behavioural prediction {{models for}} extracting reserve time, {{state of health}} (SOH) and reserve life knowledge. A model for simulating battery discharge behaviour is also described. The research is focussed primarily on the <b>standby</b> VRLA <b>battery</b> such as that commonly employed by the telecommunications industry. Two approaches {{have been developed for}} extracting reserve time knowledge. The first utilises a discharge voltage versus reserve charge characteristic. This characteristic robust against modest variations in operating conditions and is reasonably robust against deterioration in battery SOH. To cater for different battery types an adaptive approach has been developed which also allows more accurate reserve time estimations for batteries with deteriorated SOH. It has been determined that reserve charge and therefore reserve time can be estimated to an accuracy of within ± 10 % after approximately 10 % into a discharge. The second approach utilises a unified characteristic, which enables the direct estimation of reserve time. It has the advantage over the approach based on the voltage versus reserve charge characteristic that it is not battery type specific. It is also more tolerant to changes in battery SOH. This comes at the disadvantage of greater initial estimation error, although the error reduces significantly throughout the discharge. This approach is less capable of dealing with stepped discharge rates or the discharging of partially charged batteries compared to the model based on the voltage versus SOC characteristic. Both approaches {{can also be used to}} obtain estimates of capacity, the primary battery SOH indicator. In addition battery SOH knowledge can be obtained from the coup de fouet region. This region is influenced by battery operating conditions as well as battery SOH. Various techniques for extracting SOH knowledge from the coup de fouet region are described. By incorporating the coup de fouet SOH estimation approach with the previous approaches, along with circumstantial knowledge obtained by monitoring (voltage, current and temperature) base parameters, reserve operational life can be estimated, The combination of approaches also enables the construction of a battery discharge simulation model...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) power systems, {{like other}} {{electrical}} systems, {{may be subject}} to unexpected ground faults. Installed PV systems always have invisible elements other than those indicated by their electrical schematics. Stray inductance, capacitance and resistance are distributed throughout the system. Leakage currents associated with the PV modules, the interconnected array, wires, surge protection devices and conduit add up and can become large enough to look like a ground-fault. PV systems are frequently connected to other sources of power or energy storage such as <b>batteries,</b> <b>standby</b> generators, and the utility grid. This complex arrangement of distributed power and energy sources, distributed impedance and proximity to other sources of power requires sensing of ground faults and proper reaction by the ground-fault protection devices. The different dc grounding requirements (country to country) often add more confusion to the situation. This paper discusses the ground-fault issues associated with both the dc and ac side of PV systems and presents test results and operational impacts of backfeeding commercially available ac ground-fault protection devices under various modes of operation. Further, the measured effects of backfeeding the tripped ground-fault devices for periods of time comparable to anti-islanding allowances for utility interconnection of PV inverters in the United States are reported...|$|R
