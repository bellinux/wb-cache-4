50|$|The Leipzig Freight Ring (Leipziger Güterring) is {{a network}} of {{railways}} in Saxony and consists of several individual lines. As a bypass for freight trains in the Leipzig railway node, it links all approach lines and thus enables the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight operations.|$|R
50|$|In January 1924, {{an extra}} pair of tracks, {{including}} a flying junction, opened between North Melbourne and Kensington, enabling the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and goods {{traffic in the}} busy section. Further works were carried out in 1929, when the double track Albion - Jacana freight line was opened, permitting freight trains to avoid the line via Essendon. Automatic Block Signalling was extended to Broadmeadows in November 1965.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, in 1910 {{there were}} {{plans for a}} {{complete}} rebuild of the station. The initial plans called for an entrance hall crowned by a dome and with a natural stone frontage, {{which would have been}} 90 metres wide and 8 metres deep. However, with planning almost complete, construction was delayed [...] "until further notice" [...] by the outbreak of the First World War. The necessary preparatory work for the new construction, the complete <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and luggage movements, was still completed.|$|R
50|$|A {{mixed train}} is a train that hauls both {{passenger}} and freight cars or wagons. In {{the early days}} of railways they were quite common, but by the 20th century they were largely confined to branch lines with little traffic. Because mixed trains involve the shunting of goods wagons at stations along the way, they provide passengers with a very slow service, and have largely disappeared today. Their use is also at variance with the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and goods services into different subsidiaries by most modern railway administrations.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} of Prussia bought the MHE in December 1879 and thus acquired the Berlin-Lehrte railway {{and it became}} part of the Prussian state railways. From 1884 the operations in Berlin of the Lehrte Railway were united structurally and operationally more and more with the nearby Hamburg Railway. This was accompanied by the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight transport in Berlin with the building of the relief line between Wustermark and Nauen, the construction and refurbishment of the Spandau station and the opening of the Wustermark marshalling yard completed before the First World War.|$|R
50|$|From {{the opening}} of the Lyttelton tunnel, {{passenger}} services were provided on mixed trains which initially ran six times daily. It was not until 5 November 1872 that the mixed services ceased and a new timetable scheduled 5 daily passenger trains, increasing to seven daily services on 9 February 1876. These services were popular with school pupils travelling from Lyttelton to classes in Christchurch, and with workers travelling from Woolston and Heathcote to jobs in Lyttelton. It was found that the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and goods traffic led to a reduction in operational costs, with savings made in fuel and wear-and-tear on machinery.|$|R
50|$|In 1858, the Bonn-Koblenz {{section of}} the West Rhine Railway was completed. The {{location}} of the Koblenz station presented difficulties. Two sites have been seriously discussed. One was on the north bank of the Moselle River {{and the other was}} in the Moselweiser Feld. A decree of the Prince Regent William in April 1858 finally led to the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> station and freight yard. Thus the Rhenish station was built near the current City Centre Station and the Rhenish freight yard was built outside the city limits of Koblenz on the north bank of the Moselle below the Kaiser Franz fortress, where the current Koblenz-Lützel station is located.|$|R
30|$|After {{a change}} in the central {{government}} in 2002 a new “Hungarian Transport Policy” document was created with a planning period from the year 2003 till 2015 [13]. The Transport Policy of 2003 did not bring fundamental changes in the focus of the future developments, but it was created by paying attention to the new White Paper of the EU from 2001 [14]. Its main results were time-based vignette-pricing on the national motorway network according to vehicle categories. It also accelerated motorway constructions (from 5 to 10 to 25 – 30  km per year) by involving PPP contracts. Furthermore, the EU-conform <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the railway incumbent company to a network Railway Company and the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and cargo provider companies were also a result besides the privatization of the inland waterway shipping company (MAHART), Budapest Airport, and finally the national flag carrier airline company, MALÉV.|$|R
40|$|The freight-transport {{industry}} has made enormous {{progress in the}} development and application of logistics techniques that has transformed its operation, giving raise to impressive productivity gains and improved responsiveness to its consumers. While the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight traffic is a relatively new concept in historic terms, recent approaches point out that most freight-logistics techniques are transferable to the passenger-transport industry. In this sense, passenger logistics can be understood as the application of logistics techniques in urban contexts to the passenger-transport industry. The design of an urban logistic network integrates decisions about the emplacement, number and capacities of the facilities that will be located, the flows between them, demand patterns and cost structures that will validate the profitability of the process. This strategic decision settles conditions and constraints of latter tactical and operative decisions. In addition, different criteria are involved during the whole process so, in general terms, it is essential an exhaustive analysis, from the mathematical point of view, of the decision problem. The optimization models resulting from this analysis require techniques and mathematical algorithms in constant development and evolution. Such methods demand more and more a higher number of interrelated elements due to the increas...|$|R

[...] The principal objective was to boost the passenger module {{to the point of}} highest dynamic pressure at transonic velocity and conduct a flight test of the in-flight abort system. Due to subsequent buffet and forces that impact the propulsion module after the high-velocity <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>passenger</b> capsule that are outside the design region of the PM, NS2 was not expected to survive and land, and if it did, Blue had stated that NS2 would be retired and become a museum item.In the event, the flight test was successful.

50|$|The {{original}} design {{is said to}} be compliant with security standards at the time of opening. However, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. government began to require <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> uninspected arrival <b>passengers.</b> The airport initially used a system of chairs, moving sidewalks, retractable belts and security/police staffing to usher arriving passengers from the gate to the immigration hall without coming into physical contact with departing passengers. In recent years, semi-permanent movable walls separate much of the length of the terminal building into two halves, decreasing the need for human staffing and those lighter objects previously in use.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increase}} in costs, the Dumbarton Rail Corridor now faced a significant funding shortfall, since no new funds had been identified since the passage of Regional Measure 2 in 2004. In 2007, two more alternatives were studied for the DRC. Both called for the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> freight and <b>passenger</b> traffic. Alternative 1 looked at a rehabilitated low-level single-track Dumbarton Rail Bridge, while Alternative 2 proposed a new high-level (fixed) double-track rail bridge. Based on projected ridership, a blend of both alternatives was proposed, retaining the low-level single-track drawbridge as marine traffic was expected to remain light.|$|R
5000|$|A truck bypass is a roadway that {{provides}} physical <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> trucks from <b>passenger</b> vehicles at a freeway interchange {{in order to}} eliminate weaving between passenger cars traveling at higher speeds and trucks traveling at lower speeds. [...] Typically a truck bypass exits the main freeway some distance before the interchange {{it is intended to}} bypass; trucks are usually required to use the bypass, while passenger cars may choose between the bypass and the main traffic lanes. A truck bypass may {{take the form of a}} dedicated roadway (as in the Newhall Pass Interchange) or a collector/distributor road (as in the El Toro Y). The bypass allows vehicles traveling on it to exit the interchange in the same possible directions as the main line of traffic, and then merges with the respective freeway at some point past the interchange.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, GO Transit built {{a bridge}} at the Snider diamond, {{which is the}} {{junction}} between the Barrie Line and Canadian National's primary east-west freight line, the York Subdivision. Since CN controlled both corridors, the passage <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> trains over the diamond was often delayed by freight trains passing through the intersection. Constructing the bridge and associated trackage resulted in a grade <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the two lines, eliminating such delays. Construction of the bridge began in February 2006, and the bridge was opened in December 2006. The entire project was completed in June 2007.|$|R
40|$|While most {{motorways}} in Queensland {{are divided}} {{with at least}} two lanes in each direction, a few motorways have been constructed as two lane, two way roads. These "half motorways" have been designed and constructed with the intent of eventual duplication to divided carriageways. This type of roadway is similar to a two lane, two way highway constructed to a high standard. Motorways are critical elements of urban freight networks. There is a growing need from the freight industry to allow multi-combination vehicles to use a larger network of urban roads. This raises concerns regarding the psychological impacts on drivers of surrounding vehicles, and their behaviour around the MCVs. Lennie and Bunker (2004) studied some behavioural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> car drivers surrounding MCVs on a four lane, divided motorway. However, drivers are expected to behave differently while opposing each other on an undivided two lane, two way motorway or highway. That study was extended here to examine driver behaviour on the Port of Brisbane Motorway, which is a "half motorway". Specifically, the following were examined: Lateral position distribution for passenger cars, semi-trailers and B-doubles (23 m or longer); and lateral <b>separation</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> cars from heavy vehicles and other passenger cars. The study showed that a maximum 7 s time gap between opposing vehicles influenced drivers’ positioning of their vehicles. It was shown that the lateral positions of cars, utility vehicles, and semi-trailers are statistically different when opposed than when unopposed; whereas, the lateral positions of B-doubles were not. This indicates that B-double drivers did not tend to move laterally when opposed by oncoming traffic. On average, passenger car drivers did not position their vehicles appreciably differently when opposed by semi-trailers and B-doubles than other passenger cars, and there was no appreciable difference in passenger car drivers’ positions when faced by oncoming semi-trailers than B-doubles. Average and 95 th percentile envelopes were provided to indicate position in the lane of unopposed and opposed vehicles on this type of roadway section. The off-side edge of the 95 th percentile passenger car straddled the edge line, while both the 95 th percentile semi-trailer and B-double occupied part of the wide, sealed shoulder. The semi-trailer wandered further onto the shoulder. The vehicle envelopes are useful to understand the impacts of heavy vehicles on driver behaviour, and can also inform road design and pavement asset management...|$|R
