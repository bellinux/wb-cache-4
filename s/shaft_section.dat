40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method combining {{the processes of}} straightening and thermal treatment. Technological processes with axial strain were considered, for the case of heated material and without its heating. The essence of the process {{in the case of}} heated material consisted in the fact that if under tension all longitudinal forces in the first approximation are uniform - the same strains are generated. The presented technological approach, aimed at reducing the curvature of axial-symmetrical parts, is acceptable as the process of rough, preliminary machining, in the case of shafts with the ratio L/D≤ 100 (L – shaft length, d – shaft diameter) and without a tendency of strengthening. To improve the accuracy and stability of geometric form of low-rigidity parts, a method was developed that combines the processes of straightening and heat treatment. The method consists in that axial strain – tension, is applied to the shaft during heating, and during cooling the product is fixed in a fixture, the cooling rate of the shaft being several-fold greater than that of the fixture. A device is presented for the realisation of the method of controlling the process of plastic deformation of low-rigidity shafts.

The first - a derivative {{of the six}} component wind tunnel balance - senses the forces and moments on the rotating device through a weakened <b>shaft</b> <b>section</b> instrumented {{with a series of}} strain gauges. This "rotating balance" was designed to directly measure the steady and unsteady hydrodynamic loads on an inducer, thereby defining both the amplitude and frequency content associated with operating in various cavitation modes. The second device - a high frequency response pressure transducer surface mounted on a rotating component - was merely an extension of existing technology for application in water. MSFC has recently completed experimental evaluations of both the rotating balance and surface-mount transducers in a water test loop. The measurement bandwidth of the rotating balance was severely limited by the relative flexibility of the device itself, resulting in an unexpectedly low structural bending mode and invalidating the higher frequency response data. Despite these limitations, measurements confirmed that the integrated loads on the four-bladed inducer respond to both cavitation intensity and cavitation phenomena. Likewise, the surface-mount pressure transducers were subjected to a range of temperatures and flow conditions in a non-rotating environment to record bias shifts and transfer functions between the transducers and a reference device.

40|$|Abstract One of the {{challenges}} facing the designers of aeroengine drive shafts is to transmit higher torques {{while at the same}} time reducing the overall diameter of the engine in order to reduce drag. The resulting high performance drive shafts are smaller, lighter and have thinner walls and it is essential that the factors affecting instability are known and understood. Torque is the principal load carried by these shafts and most of the analytical methods for predicting torsional stability are either analytical or semi-empirical and tend not to cover the relevant range of geometries of interest here in terms of shaft geometry. Also, they give only limited information about the failure mode involved. A finite element analysis (FEA) approach has been developed to address this need and this paper presents results for plain shaft sections subjected to torque loading. Geometries leading to elastic buckling and plastic collapse are identified, along with appropriate formulae for calculating the torque capacity.

Serum analytes measured at baseline included SHBG, estradiol, PTH, creatinine, albumin, vitamin D metabolites, and glutamate- and gamma-carboxyglutamate-osteocalcin (OC). A linear mixed model was used to model associations with predictor variables, including testing whether the predictors significantly modified the effect of aging. RESULTS: Aging was associated with increasing PD and d-lat, and higher baseline SHBG significantly modified this effect, in the case of PD, increasing the rates of change at the narrow neck region by 19 % for SHBG level 2 sd higher than population mean (P = 0. 026). Higher baseline creatinine was independently associated with faster increases in PD and d-lat with aging (P < 0. 041). Z declined faster with aging if baseline PTH was higher, and higher albumin had a contrary effect. Z was positively associated with free estradiol and inversely associated with SHBG and glutamate-OC. CONCLUSION: These results show large effects of SHBG on the regulation of proximal femur expansion and bending resistance, probably acting as a surrogate for low bioavailable estrogen. Potentially important effects for fracture resistance in old age were also revealed for PTH, markers related to renal function and the nutritional markers albumin and undercarboxylated OC...|$|E

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} and demonstrated a measurement device for sensing and resolving the hydrodynamic loads on fluid machinery. The device - a derivative of the six-component {{wind tunnel balance}} - senses the forces and moments on the rotating device through a weakened <b>shaft</b> <b>section</b> instrumented {{with a series of}} strain gauges. This rotating balance was designed to directly measure the steady and unsteady hydrodynamic loads on an inducer, thereby defining the amplitude and frequency content associated with operating in various cavitation modes. The rotating balance was calibrated statically using a dead-weight load system in order to generate the 6 x 12 calibration matrix later used to convert measured voltages to engineering units. Structural modeling suggested that the rotating assembly first bending mode would be significantly reduced with the balance s inclusion. This reduction in structural stiffness was later confirmed experimentally with a hammer-impact test. This effect, coupled with the relatively large damping associated with the rotating balance waterproofing material, limited the device s bandwidth to approximately 50 Hertz Other pre-test validations included sensing the test article rotating assembly built-in imbalance for two configurations and directly measuring the assembly mass and buoyancy while submerged under water. Both tests matched predictions and confirmed the device s sensitivity while stationary and rotating. The rotating balance was then demonstrated in a water test of a full-scale Space Shuttle Main Engine high-pressure liquid oxygen pump inducer. Experimental data was collected a scaled operating conditions at three flow coefficients across a range of cavitation numbers for the single inducer geometry and radial clearance. Two distinct cavitation modes were observed symmetric tip vortex cavitation and alternate-blade cavitation. Although previous experimental tests on the same inducer demonstrated two additional cavitation modes at lower inlet pressures, these conditions proved unreachable with the rotating balance installed due to the intense dynamic environment. The sensed radial load was less influenced by flow coefficient than by cavitation number or cavitation mode although the flow coefficient range was relatively narrow. Transition from symmetric tip vortex to alternate-blade cavitation corresponded to changes in both radial load magnitude and radial load orientation relative to the inducer. Sensed moments indicated that the effective load center moved downstream during this change in cavitation mode. An occurrence of "higher+rdex cavitation" was also detected in both the stationary pressures and the rotating balance data although the frequency of the phenomena was well above the reliable bandwidth of the rotating balance. In summary the experimental tests proved both the concept and device s capability despite the limitations and confirmed that hydrodynamically-induced forces and moments develop in response to the unbalanced pressure field, which is, in turn, a product of the cavitation environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) can prevent disuse (underloaded) -induced cortical bone loss as well as add extra bone to underloaded bones. Thirteen-month-old retired female Sprague-Dawley breeders served as controls or were subjected to simultaneous right hindlimb immobilization by bandaging and daily subcutaneous doses of 0, 1, 3, or 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d for two and six weeks. Histomorphometric analyses were performed on double-fluorescent labeled undecalcified tibial <b>shaft</b> <b>sections</b> (proximal to the tibiofibular junction). Disuse-induced cortical bone loss occurred by enlarging the marrow cavity and increasing intracortical porosity. PGE 2 treatment of disuse shafts further increased intracortical porosity above that in disuse alone controls. This bone loss was counteracted by enhancement of periosteal and corticoendosteal bone formation. Stimulation of periosteal and corticoendosteal bone formation slightly enlarged the total tissue (cross-sectional) area and inhibited marrow cavity enlargement. These PGE 2 -induced activities netted the same percentage of cortical bone with a different distribution than the beginning and age related controls. These findings indicate the PGE 2 -induced increase in bone formation compensated for the disuse and PGE 2 -induced bone loss, and thus prevented immobilization induced bone loss...|$|R
2500|$|The Imperial sceptre was {{manufactured}} {{during the}} reign of Catherine the Great, and comprised [...] "a burnished <b>shaft</b> of three <b>sections</b> containing eight rings of brilliant-cut diamonds", topped by the Orlov Diamond which was itself surmounted by a double-headed eagle with the coat of arms of Russia at its center.|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} {{motor shaft}} {{of an air}} cooler {{was sent to the}} laboratory to analyse the cause of failure. Investigation revealed that the shaft has failed by fatigue. Multiple fatigue cracks have originated at the fillet of the change of section and progressed over about 90 % of the <b>shaft</b> cross <b>section</b> before giving way to torsional overload failure. The fatigue crack initiation appears to be due to stress concentrations arising from the sharp edges of the undercut at the fillet of the change of section. The problem appears to have further aggravated due to superimposed bending stresses on the shaft...|$|R
