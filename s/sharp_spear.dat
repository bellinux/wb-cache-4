60|$|Beneath her yawned a {{wonderful}} deep canyon, rugged and rocky with but few pines {{on the north}} slope, thick with dark green timber on the south slope. Yellow and gray crags, like turreted castles, stood {{up out of the}} sloping forest on the side opposite her. The trees were all <b>sharp,</b> <b>spear</b> pointed. Patches of light green aspens showed strikingly against the dense black. The great slope beneath Ellen was serrated with narrow, deep gorges, almost canyons in themselves. Shadows alternated with clear bright spaces. The mile-wide mouth of the canyon opened upon the Basin, down into a world of wild timbered ranges and ravines, valleys and hills, that rolled and tumbled in dark-green waves to the Sierra Anchas.|$|E
60|$|Goaded to frenzy the cat {{presently}} {{determined to}} come up after this disturber of his peace; but when he essayed to leap to the branch that held Tarzan he found the <b>sharp</b> <b>spear</b> point always in his face, and each time as he dropped back he was prodded viciously in some tender part; but at length, rage having conquered his better judgment, he leaped up the rough bole to the very branch upon which Tarzan stood. Now the two faced each other upon even footing and Sheeta saw a quick revenge and a supper all in one. The hairless ape-thing with the tiny fangs and the puny talons would be helpless before him.|$|E

5000|$|Last, the Shaolin Monks {{performed}} {{their group}} effort. They combined Kung Fu, acrobatics, weaponry, and music {{to create a}} unique dance experience.

60|$|He {{read the}} letter for the third time, and a gentle {{perspiration}} began to form on his forehead. This was awful. The presumable jubilation of Katie, the penniless ripper of the Savoy, when he should present himself to her a free man, did not enter into the mental picture that was unfolding before him. She was too remote. Between him and her lay the fearsome figure of Sir Thomas, rampant, filling the entire horizon. Nor is this to be wondered at. There was probably a brief space during which Perseus, concentrating his gaze upon the monster, did not see Andromeda; and a knight of the Middle Ages, jousting in the Gentlemen's Singles for a smile from his lady, rarely allowed the thought of that smile to occupy his whole mind {{at the moment when}} his boiler-plated antagonist was descending upon him {{in the wake of a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>spear.</b>|$|E
60|$|The grave {{was close}} to the {{outskirts}} of the village, and, on one side, the jungle came up to within a few yards of it. The spot was surrounded by a strong and high bamboo fence, except at one point where a narrow but very conspicuous opening had been left. Here a <b>sharp</b> <b>spear</b> was so arranged beside the opening that it could be shot across it at a point corresponding with the height of a tiger's heart from the ground--as well, at least, as that point could be estimated by men who were pretty familiar with tigers. The motive power to propel this spear was derived from a green bamboo, so strong that it required several powerful men to bend it {{in the form of a}} bow. A species of trigger was arranged to let the bent bow fly, and a piece of fine cord passed from this across the opening about breast-high for a tiger. The intention was that the animal, in entering the enclosure, should become its own executioner-- should commit unintentional suicide, if we may so put it.|$|E
60|$|Although this {{tremendous}} army consisted of rock-colored Nomes, all squat and fat, they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel, inlaid with beautiful gems. Upon his brow each wore a brilliant electric light, and they bore <b>sharp</b> <b>spears</b> and swords and battle-axes of solid bronze. It was evident they were perfectly trained, for {{they stood in}} straight rows, rank after rank, with their weapons held erect and true, as if awaiting but the word of command to level them upon their foes.|$|R
5000|$|Professor David Christian {{argued that}} the recent past is only {{understandable}} {{in terms of the}} [...] "whole 14-billion-year span of time itself." [...] Big History seeks to retell the [...] "human story" [...] in light of scientific advances by such methods as radiocarbon dating and genetic analysis. In some instances, it uses mathematical modeling to explore interactions between long-term trends in sociological systems, and it has led to the coining of the term cliodynamics by Peter Turchin of the University of Connecticut to describe how mathematical models might explain events such as the growth of empires, social discontent, and the collapse of nations. It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view. While conventional history might see an invention such as <b>sharper</b> <b>spear</b> points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see <b>sharper</b> <b>spear</b> points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case. It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang. For example, one pattern is that [...] "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the asteroid impact wiping out the dinosaurs.|$|R
5000|$|The chagudax was an {{important}} component of the Unangan sea kayaker's hunting and battle uniform. [...] The sight of a fleet of Aleut men, fully dressed in battle uniform with their chagudax and the decks of their sea kayaks bristling with razor <b>sharp</b> <b>spears</b> with which they were deadly accurate at long distances, struck fear into the hearts of enemies and excitement into the hearts of Aleut women.

60|$|Leaving Numa tied to {{the tree}} Tarzan entered the tunnel and removed the {{barricade}} from the opposite end, after which {{he returned to the}} gulch and strode straight for the tree. Numa lay in his path and as Tarzan approached growled menacingly. The ape-man cuffed him aside and unfastened the rope from the tree. Then ensued a half-hour of stubbornly fought battle while Tarzan endeavored to drive Numa through the tunnel ahead of him and Numa persistently refused to be driven. At last, however, by dint of the unrestricted use of his spear point, the ape-man succeeded in forcing the lion to move ahead of him and eventually guided him into the passageway. Once inside, the problem became simpler since Tarzan followed closely in the rear with his <b>sharp</b> <b>spear</b> point, an unremitting incentive to forward movement {{on the part of the}} lion. If Numa hesitated he was prodded. If he backed up the result was extremely painful and so, being a wise lion who was learning rapidly, he decided to keep on going and at the end of the tunnel, emerging into the outer world, he sensed freedom, raised his head and tail and started off at a run.|$|E
60|$|He {{came on a}} great boar {{lying in}} a tangled thicket of boughs and bracken, a dark place where the sun never shone, nor could the rain pierce through. Then {{the noise of the}} men's shouts and the barking of the dogs awakened the boar, and up he sprang, bristling all over his back, and with fire shining from his eyes. In rushed Ulysses first of all, with his spear raised to strike, but the boar was too quick for him, and ran in, and drove his sharp tusk sideways, ripping up the thigh of Ulysses. But the boar's tusk missed the bone, and Ulysses sent his <b>sharp</b> <b>spear</b> into the beast's right shoulder, and the spear went clean through, and the boar fell dead, with a loud cry. The uncles of Ulysses bound up his wound carefully, and sang a magical song over it, as the French {{soldiers}} wanted to do to Joan of Arc when the arrow pierced her shoulder at the siege of Orleans. Then the blood ceased to flow, and soon Ulysses was quite healed of his wound. They thought that he would be a good warrior, and gave him splendid presents, and when he went home again he told all that had happened to his father and mother, and his nurse, Eurycleia. But there was always a long white mark or scar above his left knee, and about that scar we shall hear again, many years afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] he said, {{addressing}} Eveline, [...] "you {{have heard}} from the venerable Abbess in what unhappy position I have been placed since yesterday by the rigour of the Archbishop--perhaps I should rather say by his just though severe interpretation of my engagement in the Crusade. I cannot doubt that all this has been stated with accurate truth by the venerable lady; but as I must no longer call her my friend, let me fear whether she has done me justice in her commentary upon the unhappy necessity which must presently compel me to leave my country, and with my country to forego--at best to postpone--the fairest hopes which man ever entertained. The venerable lady hath upbraided me, that being myself the cause that the execution of yesterday's contract is postponed, I would fain keep it suspended over your head for an indefinite term of years. No one resigns willingly such rights as yesterday gave me; and, let me speak a boastful word, sooner than yield them up to man of woman born, I would hold a fair field against all comers, with grinded sword and <b>sharp</b> <b>spear,</b> from sunrise to sunset, for three days' space. But what I would retain {{at the price of}} a thousand lives, I am willing to renounce if it would cost you a single sigh. If, therefore, you think you cannot remain happy as the betrothed of De Lacy, you may command my assistance to have the contract annulled, and make some more fortunate man happy." ...|$|E
5000|$|There is also {{a belief}} that the sport became popular due to the horse-mounted {{soldiers}} charging enemy camps {{at the crack of dawn}} removing the pegs which held the tents in place, with the tips of their <b>sharp</b> <b>spears.</b> The Vice President of the Mudgeeraba Troop, Australia Arthur Domain, who is also training his officers for tent pegging explains that tent pegging is actually a sport, [...] "It came about from the Pakistani and Indian armies when they had time on their hands up on the borders; to break the boredom, they invented the sport we now call tent pegging. In the early days they used the wooden pegs that they used to drive in the ground to hold the tents up; and then the other forms of the sport evolved from that. It just gives the riders good hand-eye coordination and makes them better horsemen. But most equestrian sports authorities are of the opinion that tent-pegging originated in these areas since ancient times in the battlefields as a tactic used by the horsed cavalry against elephant mounted troops. The soldiers discovered that the best way to make the elephants ineffective was to attack them on their toe nails with <b>sharp</b> <b>spears</b> from the back of a galloping horse. In order to perfect this technique, the cavalry started the practice of tent-pegging which eventually turned into the modern sport.|$|R
60|$|There was {{not much}} to be seen {{when they reached the}} deck. Clammy fog enveloped the boat, but Jimmy could see that {{the surface of the water}} was covered by a glassy film. He knew that heavy ice is {{generally}} opaque and white, but this was transparent, with rimy streaks on it that ran to and fro in irregular patterns. As the tide drove it up the channel, it splintered at the bows, throwing up <b>sharp</b> <b>spears</b> that rasped along the waterline. Still, it did not seem capable of doing much damage, and Jimmy was surprised at Moran’s anxious look.|$|R
60|$|That {{they must}} {{pay the price}} of one life for every attempt to take his had its effect upon them and they were longer now in {{initiating}} a new rush and when they did so it was more skillfully ordered than those that had preceded it, for they scattered into three bands which, partially surrounding him, came simultaneously toward him from different directions, and though he emptied his pistol with good effect, they reached him at last. They seemed to know that his ammunition was exhausted, for they circled close about him now with the evident intention of taking him alive, since they might easily have riddled him with their <b>sharp</b> <b>spears</b> with perfect safety to themselves.|$|R
60|$|This idea, even {{by reason}} of its reason, narrowed {{into a sort of}} <b>sharp</b> <b>spear,</b> of which the spear blade was Newman. It did forget many of the other forces that were {{fighting}} on its side. But the movement could boast, first and last, many men who had this eager dogmatic quality: Keble, who spoilt a poem in order to recognise a doctrine; Faber, who told the rich, almost with taunts, that God sent the poor as eagles to strip them; Froude, who with Newman announced his return in the arrogant motto of Achilles. But the greater part of all this happened before what is properly our period; and in that period Newman, and perhaps Newman alone, is the expression and summary of the whole school. It was certainly in the Victorian Age, and after his passage to Rome, that Newman claimed his complete right to be in any book on modern English literature. This is no place for estimating his theology: but one point about it does clearly emerge. Whatever else is right, the theory that Newman went over to Rome to find peace and an end of argument, is quite unquestionably wrong. He had far more quarrels after he had gone over to Rome. But, though he had far more quarrels, he had far fewer compromises: and he was of that temper which is tortured more by compromise than by quarrel. He was a man at once of abnormal energy and abnormal sensibility: nobody without that combination could have written the Apologia. If he sometimes seemed to skin his enemies alive, it was because he himself lacked a skin. In this sense his Apologia is a triumph far beyond the ephemeral charge on which it was founded; in this sense he does indeed (to use his own expression) vanquish not his accuser but his judges. Many men would shrink from recording all their cold fits and hesitations and prolonged inconsistencies: I am sure it was the breath of life to Newman to confess them, now that he had done with them for ever. His Lectures on the Present Position of English Catholics, practically preached against a raging mob, rise not only higher but happier, as his instant unpopularity increases. There is something grander than humour, there is fun, in the very first lecture about the British Constitution as explained to a meeting of Russians. But always his triumphs are the triumphs of a highly sensitive man: a man must feel insults before he can so insultingly and splendidly avenge them. He is a naked man, who carries a naked sword. The quality of his literary style is so successful that it succeeds in escaping definition. The quality of his logic is that of a long but passionate patience, which waits until he has fixed all corners of an iron trap. But the quality of his moral comment on the age remains what I have said: a protest of the rationality of religion as against the increasing irrationality of mere Victorian comfort and compromise. So far as the present purpose is concerned, his protest died with him: he left few imitators and (it may easily be conceived) no successful imitators. The suggestion of him lingers on in the exquisite Elizabethan perversity of Coventry Patmore; and has later flamed out from the shy volcano of Francis Thompson. Otherwise (as we shall see in the parallel case of Ruskin's Socialism) he has no followers in his own age: but very many in ours.|$|E
