He also showed him great kindness when a cold which had seized him assumed the serious form of consumption, and sent him to Torquay; but as the disease made rapid progress, an irresistible longing seized Gray to return to Merkland, where he arrived in January 1861, and died on the 3rd of December following, having the day before had the gratification of seeing a printed <b>specimen</b> <b>copy</b> of his poem The Luggie, published eventually by the exertions of Sydney Dobell.

40|$|Abstract Importance Small cell carcinoma/neuroendocrine {{prostate}} cancer (NePC) is a lethal, poorly understood {{prostate cancer}} (PCa) subtype. Controversy exists {{about the origin}} of NePC in this setting. Objective To molecularly profile archived biopsy specimens from a case of early-onset PCa that rapidly progressed to NePC to identify drivers of the aggressive course and mechanisms of NePC origin and progression. Design, setting, and participants A 47 -year-old patient presented with metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 9). After a 6 -month response to androgen deprivation therapy, the patient developed jaundice and liver biopsy revealed exclusively NePC. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) -isolated DNA was performed from the diagnostic prostate biopsy and the liver biopsy at progression. Intervention Androgen deprivation therapy for adenocarcinoma followed by multiagent chemotherapy for NePC. Main outcomes and measures Identification of the mutational landscape in primary adenocarcinoma and NePC liver metastasis. Whether the NePC arose independently or was derived from the primary adenocarcinoma was considered based on mutational profiles. Results A deleterious somatic SMAD 4 L 535 fs variant was present in both prostate and liver specimens; however, a TP 53 R 282 W mutation was exclusively enriched in the liver <b>specimen.</b> <b>Copy</b> number analysis identified concordant, low-level alterations in both specimens, with focal MYCL amplification and homozygous PTEN, RB 1, and MAP 2 K 4 losses identified exclusively in the NePC specimen.

40|$|PURPOSE: The immune {{checkpoint}} of the programmed death 1 /programmed death ligand 1 (PD- 1 /PD-L 1) pathway {{is believed}} {{to play an important}} role in evasion of host antitumor immune surveillance in various malignancies; however, little is known about its role in thymic carcinoma. This study investigated PD- 1 /PD-L 1 expression and its association with clinicopathologic features, the expression of immune-related proteins in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and patient prognosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PD-L 1 and PD- 1 expression was evaluated by IHC in 25 thymic carcinoma tissue <b>specimens.</b> <b>Copy</b> number alterations of the PD-L 1 gene in 11 cases were assessed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with normal subjects, 3 thymic carcinoma patients showed an increase in PD-L 1 copy number, whereas 8 did not. PD-L 1 was significantly overexpressed in cases with copy number gain as compared with normal cases. High PD-L 1 expression was associated with higher disease-free and overall survival rates as compared to cases with low expression. Prognostic analysis revealed low PD-L 1 expression and high number of PD- 1 (+) TILs as significant predictors of poor survival, together with Masaoka-Koga stage IVa/IVb disease and incomplete resection. In the quantitative analysis of TILs, PD-L 1 expression correlated proportionally with the number of infiltrating CTLs. CONCLUSIONS: Here, for the first time, we report that PD-L 1 and PD- 1 expression might be useful prognostic predictors in thymic carcinoma. Further studies are expected to substantiate the prognostic value of PD-L 1 and PD- 1 expression, and the potential efficacy of targeting the PD- 1 /PD-L 1 pathway in thymic carcinoma via immunotherapy.

40|$|An archaeological {{survey and}} a geoarchaeological {{investigation}} of four segments of new water line in west-central Sutton County, Texas {{was performed on}} March 30, 2009 and April 2 - 5, 2009 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) and Charles D. Frederick (consulting geoarchaeologist) for the City of Sonora under Antiquities Permit 5202. The archival research indicated that several prehistoric sites have been recorded in the vicinity. One of the three segments (Area 4) had been examined by a professional archaeologist in 1970 and 1971 prior to construction of Interstate Highway 10. Since the proposed route of the water line in Area 4 passes within seventy-five feet of the Sutton County Cemetery, this area was evaluated {{in order to determine}} if scraping for unmarked graves would be necessary. In the segment adjacent to the cemetery, the new line will replace an existing line and will occupy the same footprint. Following a consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), it was decided that monitoring during the installation of the trench in this area would be required. At Area 2, a sparse scatter of one scraper, two flakes, two chert fragments, and fire-cracked rock was found on the surface. In addition, two pieces of burned limestone were observed within the A horizon of Backhoe Trench 2. Shovel tests were excavated {{in the vicinity of the}} backhoe trench, but no cultural materials were observed. Although the burned rock and the flake scatter may represent human activity in the project area, it was decided that the cultural materials were too few in number and too scattered to warrant assigning a site number.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to create and test an in vitro model of {{intracranial}} arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) that simulates the geometry of human vasculature and allows realistic testing of devices used in endovascular therapy. METHODS: The models were derived from corrosion casts of the main cervicocranial ar-teries and veins obtained from two nonfixed human <b>specimens.</b> Wax <b>copies</b> of the casts were produced and combined to create complex models simulating various types of intracranial AVFs. Wax assemblies were embedded with liquid silicone solidified into transparent blocks containing, after wax evacuation, hollow reproductions of the original vascular trees. The mod-els were connected to a pulsatile pump and their compatibility with various imaging techniques and endovascular treatment materials was evaluated. RESULTS: The models were compatible with digital subtraction angiography, CT, MR im-aging, and transcranial Doppler sonography. They provided a realistic endovascular environ-ment for the simulation of interventional neuroradiologic procedures.

40|$|A {{molecular}} assay for {{the detection}} of herpes simplex virus (HSV), including a novel, nonradioactive hybridization technique, was evaluated with a total of 123 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. After DNA extraction, specific HSV DNA sequences were amplified with digoxigenin-labeled primers derived from the DNA polymerase gene-coding region from HSV. Amplified products were detected by the Enzymun-Test DNA detection assay (Boehringer, Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany), which uses biotinylated probes. Amplification with nonlabeled primers and then Southern blotting and nonradioactive detection of hybrids by the digoxigenin technique was the reference system. The sensitivities of the molecular assays were determined with 10 -fold dilutions of plasmid pS 4 with the SalI restriction fragment of the DNA polymerase gene obtained from the HSV type 1 strain Angelotti. The Enzymun assay was able to detect all of the 16 positive samples, giving 100 % agreement with the Southern blot hybridization results.

40|$|Ph. D., Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Oesophageal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) has a high prevalence in the Asiatic belt and areas of Africa. In South Africa (SA), the incidence of this cancer in the Eastern Cape {{is one of the}} highest in the world. The molecular carcinogenesis of this disease remains unresolved. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology provides a high resolution technique to determine DNA copy number imbalances across the whole genome. DNA copy number changes can affect oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, contributing to carcinogenesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} map common chromosomal break points previously identified in five SA OSCC cell lines by multi colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and to characterise copy number changes in these cell lines and OSCC patient’s specimens using SNP array technology.

40|$|A single-step TaqMan® RT-qPCR was {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV- 1), an important pathogen of cattle worldwide. The assay was based on conserved 5 ’UTR sequences of Italian BVDV- 1 isolates. In order to establish a diagnostic protocol which simplifies sample collection and processing, the assay was tested on a variety of biological specimens collected from persistently infected calves. The samples analyzed included PBMCs, plasma, dry blood, ear notch and hair bulb. Time and costs required for the analysis of each type of specimen were compared. The RT-qPCR, whose lower limit of detection was 100 copies of viral RNA (1 TCID 50), correctly identified all PI animals, irrespective of the type of <b>specimen.</b> The highest <b>copy</b> numbers were obtained from the RNAs extracted from PBMCs, ear notches and hair bulbs.

40|$|Results of {{genotyping}} {{with true}} high-throughput capability for MNSs antigens are underrepresented, {{probably because of}} technical issues, due to {{the high level of}} nucleotide sequence homology of the paralogous genes GYPA, GYPB and GYPE. Eight MNSs-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in 5800 serologically M/N and S/s pre-typed Swiss blood donors and 50 individuals of known or presumptive black African ethnicity. Comparison of serotype with genotype delivered concordance rates of 99 · 70 % and 99 · 90 % and accuracy of genotyping alone of 99 · 88 % and 99 · 95 %, for M/N and S/s, respectively. The area under the curve of peak signals was measured in intron 1 of the two highly homologous genes GYPB and GYPE and allowed for gene copy number variation estimates in all individuals investigated.

40|$|Objective: Viral {{infections are}} {{associated}} with both mild and severe exacerbations of asthma and may therefore be associated with asthma death. As such we hypothesized {{that it might be}} possible to detect rhinovirus (RV), the virus most frequently implicated in acute asthma, in lung tissue from patients who died from asthma. Methodology: We studied archival, wax-embedded lung tissue obtained postmortem from: (i) patients who died from asthma (n = 12), (ii) asthma patients with non-asthma-related death (n = 3), and (iii) non-asthmatic individuals who died from unrelated causes (n = 3). A validated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect RV. To confirm RNA preservation, RT-PCR was used to detect expression of the constitutive gene adenine-phosphoribosyl-transferase (APRT). Sensitivity of the assay was assessed using wax-embedded RV-infected cells. Results: Sensitivity of RT-PCR for RV in wax-embedded sections was similar to previous studies (approximately 100 viral <b>copies).</b> <b>Specimens</b> used for study were predominantly of alveolar and small airway origin (< 2 mm). All tissues examined were negative for the presence of RV mRNA and positive for APRT mRNA. Conclusions: RV infection of the lower airway may be an uncommon cause of fatal asthma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Loss of {{phosphatase}} and tensin homologue (PTEN) function {{evaluated by}} loss of PTEN protein expression on immunohistochemistry (IHC) {{has been reported}} as both prognostic in metastatic colorectal cancer and predictive of response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies although results remain uncertain. Difficulties in the methodological assessment of PTEN {{are likely to be}} a major contributor to recent conflicting results. METHODS: We assessed loss of PTEN function in 51 colorectal cancer <b>specimens</b> using Taqman® <b>copy</b> number variation (CNV) and IHC. Two blinded pathologists performed independent IHC assessment on each specimen and inter-observer variability of IHC assessment and concordance of IHC versus Taqman® CNV was assessed. RESULTS: Concordance between pathologists (PTEN loss vs no loss) on IHC assessment was 37 / 51 (73 %). In specimens with concordant IHC assessment, concordance between IHC and Taqman® copy number in PTEN loss assessment was 25 / 37 (68 %). CONCLUSION: Assessment PTEN loss in colorectal cancer is limited by the inter-observer variability of IHC, and discordance of CNV with loss of protein expression. An understanding of the genetic mechanisms of PTEN loss and implementation of improved and standardized methodologies of PTEN assessment are required to clarify the role of PTEN as a biomarker in colorectal cancer.

Thus, breast stroma specimens from 112 women undergoing reductive mammoplasty (n 7), prophylactic mastectomy (n 6), or mastectomy for a breast disease (n 99) were frozen in optimal cutting temperaturemedium.

When compared with previously generated AI data from 77 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) stroma specimens, 42 %ofwhich harbored at least one detectable AI event, the frequency of AI in the FFPE specimens (4. 62 %) was significantly higher (P < 0. 001) than that found in frozen specimens (0. 45 %). This comparison of AI between FFPE and research-grade specimens suggests that past reports of AI in breast stroma reflect artifact in the archival specimens caused by formalin-fixation, paraffin-embedding and tissue storage. Furthermore, SNP data were generated from a subset of 86 stromal specimens using SNP arrays and copy number alterations were identified using Partek Genomics Suite. For 95 % of the <b>specimens,</b> no detectable <b>copy</b> number alterations were found and the 11 changes that were detected were small and not shared between specimens. These data, therefore, support a model in which the tumor microenvironment is genetically stable. Mol Cancer Res; 1 – 6. 2012 AACR...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anal {{carcinoma}} {{is thought}} to be driven by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection through interrupting function of cell regulatory proteins such as p 53 and pRb. John Cunningham virus (JCV) expresses a T-antigen that causes malignant transformation through development of aneuploidy and interaction with some of the same regulatory proteins as HPV. JCV T-antigen is present in brain, gastric, and colon malignancies, but has not been evaluated in anal cancers. The authors examined a cohort of anal cancers for JCV T-antigen and correlated this with clinicopathologic data. METHODS: Archived anal carcinomas were analyzed for JCV T-antigen expression. DNA from tumor and normal tissue was sequenced for JCV with viral copies determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. HPV and microsatellite instability (MSI) status was correlated with JCV T-antigen expression. RESULTS: Of 21 cases of anal cancer (mean age 49 years, 38 % female), 12 (57 %) were in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive individuals. All 21 cancers expressed JCV T-antigen, including 9 HPV-negative <b>specimens.</b> More JCV <b>copies</b> were present in cancer versus surrounding normal tissue (mean 32. 54 copies/μg DNA vs 2. 98 copies/μg DNA, P =. 0267). There was no correlation between disease stage and viral copies, nor between viral copies and HIV-positive or -negative status (28. 7 vs 36. 34 copies/μg DNA, respectively, P =. 7804). In subset analysis, no association was found between JCV T-antigen expression and HPV or MSI status. CONCLUSIONS: Anal carcinomas uniformly express JCV T-antigen and contain more viral copies compared with surrounding normal tissue. JCV and its T-antigen oncogenic protein, presumably through interruption of cell regulatory proteins, {{may play a role in}} anal cancer pathogenesis.
