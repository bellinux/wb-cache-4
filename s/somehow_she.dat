5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for E4's official website described Mercedes saying [...] "She's no angel but the Village {{would be far}} less entertaining without our Mercedes. This glamorous McQueen can't seem to keep herself out of trouble – {{more often than not}} due to her tendency to hop into bed with those she shouldn't!" [...] They later said Mercedes is invincible, as [...] "no matter evils she perpetrates, <b>somehow</b> <b>she</b> still manages to come out smelling of roses". Hollyoaks international broadcaster BBC America has described Mercedes stating: [...] "Cocky, confident, and mean with a right hook, Mercedes McQueen isn't afraid of anyone, especially not a man. She knows what effects her assets have on the opposite sex, and she always gets what she wants". What's on TV described her as the [...] "man-eater of the McQueen clan" [...] who will not [...] "take any nonsense" [...] and is not [...] "shy {{when it comes to a}} scrap!" [...] Digital Spy described Mercedes as [...] "known for her fiery temper and sharp tongue". Mercedes has also been described as [...] "mouthy", a [...] "minx", a [...] "bitchy maneater", [...] "feisty", [...] "troubled", [...] "gorgeous", a [...] "sultry siren" [...] and [...] "spirited" [...] by various media sources.|$|E
500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [...] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost." [...] The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: [...] "You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “The Cocteau Twins {{are still}} the best by far at the 4AD {{ethereal}} dreamscape, thanks largely to the extraordinary voice of Liz Fraser. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she's</b> found a voice that falls completely outside 'Rock' or 'Pop'.”- Simon Reynolds, New Statesman, 1987 ...|$|R
60|$|The head is motionless, but {{it expresses}} <b>somehow</b> that <b>she</b> does.|$|R

2500|$|In a {{whirlwind}} of activity, Kent books them on a ship to Europe for their honeymoon which is leaving shortly. On the trans-Atlantic crossing, and upon their arrival on the continent, Kent showers Norma with gifts and fine living. [...] <b>Somehow,</b> <b>she</b> still {{finds a way to}} feel unwanted by him. While she wishes that he would spend more time with her, rather than money on her, he also has a business he still has to run. When they travel to Paris, they run into an old acquaintance of Norma's, Lawrence Marchmont, who instantly understands a meal ticket when he sees one. As Kent is distracted by his business dealings, he begins to woo the lonely Norma. She at first resists his advances, but eventually succumbs to Marchmont's attentions, and the two run off together.|$|E
2500|$|... "River" [...] is an {{instrumental}} track, of which Nicky suggested its title {{as the music}} made him think of one when he heard it. He knew Enya had the final decision over song titles if she preferred another, but she liked his title and went with it. Nicky spoke about Enya's style of composing for song: [...] "There are five synths Midi'd but then she plays chords over these random arpeggiators with notes popping in and out where you don't expect them. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> makes that work". [...] "The Longships" [...] makes reference to the longship war boats used by the Vikings, who first invaded Ireland in AD 795 and settled in Dublin by AD 841. [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'óige", translated from Gaelic as [...] "The Brighter Days of My Youth", is about the reminiscence of the days during Enya's childhood, and receives a dedication in Gaelic to her grandparents.|$|E
60|$|ANN. Yes; but <b>somehow</b> <b>she</b> gets {{it without}} coaxing--without {{having to make}} people sentimental about her.|$|E
500|$|Ling Woo's {{character}} {{has been described}} as the antithesis of Ally McBeal's. [...] For example, Woo is portrayed as evil, McBeal as good; Woo growls, McBeal purrs. At the same time, Woo's verbal assaults present a fantasy of authority that appeals to even McBeal. [...] "She's my hero", says McBeal, [...] "she's vicious, I disagree with almost everything she says, she treats me like dirt, and <b>somehow</b> <b>she's</b> my hero." ...|$|R
50|$|Some time later, she {{was seen}} with her powers <b>somehow</b> restored. <b>She</b> made a further {{appearance}} with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.|$|R
50|$|Heather Lofton (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is {{nine years}} old. She {{comes from a}} very rich family, but <b>somehow</b> <b>she's</b> not so lucky; in fact, her {{stepmother}} can't stand her. Heather is forced to escape away from home, searching for her real mother. The woman Heather has been put {{in the care of}} charges a private investigator in order to find her. But in the process, Heather's rotten stepmother frames him, and he becomes wanted for kidnapping her.|$|R
60|$|<b>Somehow,</b> <b>she</b> was {{inclined}} to agree with her brother in his opinion of the prairie man.|$|E
60|$|Louise gave a long, {{fluttering}} sigh. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>she</b> {{felt that}} she could rely upon this promise.|$|E
60|$|She {{gazed at}} him uncertainly a moment and the little man smiled reassuringly. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>she</b> felt {{inclined}} to trust him.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled at}} me a little curiously. All the time I felt <b>somehow</b> that <b>she</b> was taking very careful note of my answers.|$|R

5000|$|This episode {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of Spike and Buffy's sexual relationship, which would very likely never have happened if she did not truly believe Spike when he says she [...] "came back wrong" [...] (if <b>she's</b> <b>somehow</b> wrong, then <b>she</b> can allow herself to do wrong things).|$|R
60|$|But <b>somehow</b> <b>she</b> {{would not}} go back into dreamland, would persist in {{remaining}} in New York, a living, breathing woman.|$|E
60|$|Evelyn started. It was not Grahame, but Walthew, in whom Blanca was interested. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> had {{not thought}} of that.|$|E
60|$|And Paul {{hated her}} because, <b>somehow,</b> <b>she</b> spoilt his ease and naturalness. And he writhed {{himself with a}} feeling of humiliation.|$|E
50|$|Titania survives this <b>somehow,</b> as <b>she</b> {{encounters}} X-Factor Investigations and {{is later}} {{seen at the}} Raft, commenting along with other female inmates on the prowess of the new warden Luke Cage.|$|R
60|$|Her {{purchases}} here {{showed a}} little more restraint. Nevertheless, everything she chose {{was the best of}} its sort. When she came out, her appetite seemed <b>somehow</b> whetted. <b>She</b> walked along the street almost listlessly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> showed <b>somehow</b> that <b>she</b> wouldn't flinch. [...] "You weren't asked {{till after}} he had made sure I'd come. We've become, you and I," [...] she smiled, [...] "one of the couples who are invited together." ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>somehow</b> <b>she</b> knew he {{had come}} down this evening because he was lonely and unhappy, and {{instinct}} had made him turn to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Carroll, [...] "there's {{the other}} explanation. It's {{simply that the}} girl's life hasn't {{affected}} her. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> has kept fresh and wholesome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Flora is {{my great}} reliance," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Rivers. [...] "Her aunt, Lady Leonora, is very kind, but <b>somehow</b> <b>she</b> {{does not seem}} to suit with Meta." ...|$|E
60|$|She irritated Lane. Stirred him <b>somehow,</b> yet <b>she</b> seemed wholesome, full {{of quick}} response. She was daring, sophisticated, provocative. Therefore Lane {{retorted}} in brief, blunt speech {{what he thought}} {{of the majority of the}} girls present.|$|R
5000|$|Janet Maslin, {{writing in}} Rolling Stone, stated [...] "Boys in the Trees is Carly Simon's most serene {{accomplishment}} to date, but its moods vary dramatically enough {{to indicate that}} peace of mind comes at a high price." [...] When praising the single [...] "You Belong to Me", Maslin went on to write, [...] "It's a number that {{could easily have been}} belted out or growled à la [...] "You're So Vain", but this time Simon prefers to sound more like a cat who's been dining on canary. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>she's</b> a lot more compelling using a gently chiding tone than she is striking a come-hither-or-else pose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{only knew}} of this cousin, Miss Macy. I {{heard of her}} when she was visiting some friends in Menlo Park last year. Rather an {{attractive}} girl. They say Colonel Johnson, of Sacramento, took quite a fancy to her--it would have been a good match, I dare say, for he is very rich--but the thing fell through in some way. Then, they say, SHE wanted to marry that Spaniard, young Pico, of the Amador Ranche; but his family wouldn't hear of it. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>she's</b> deuced unlucky. I suppose she'll make a mess of it with Captain Greyson she was out riding with this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{came close}} to him, looking up with {{pleading}} eyes. <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> could not {{bear the thought of}} his going back into the terrible jungle alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, there's {{the other}} explanation. It's {{simply that the}} girl's life hasn't {{affected}} her. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>she</b> has kept fresh and wholesome. I think that's the correct view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To open a restaurant!" [...] <b>Somehow</b> <b>she</b> {{was unable}} to imagine him as the {{proprietor}} of a restaurant. [...] "But isn't it rather a bad time?" [...] she gasped.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} stopped, {{not able to}} believe his ears, but {{supposed}} that pain had made the princess cross, as it sometimes does. However, he guessed <b>somehow</b> that <b>she</b> wised to be left alone, so he only said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, wait!" [...] {{cried the}} girl. [...] "What are you doing---- You don't know. There is {{something}} I must tell you--that {{will make you}} hate me----" [...] She struggled to begin <b>somehow,</b> but <b>she</b> did not know where.|$|R
6000|$|She {{could not}} leave Uncle George, who was raving wildly, {{and yet it was}} {{necessary}} to obtain assistance <b>somehow.</b> Suddenly <b>she</b> remembered the distress signal. She must hoist it. How fortunate that Uncle George had once shown her how! ...|$|R
