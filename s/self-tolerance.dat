25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell <b>self-tolerance</b> without necessarily requiring loss of T cell <b>self-tolerance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} has many defense {{mechanisms}} against pathogens, {{one of which}} is humoral immunity. This defence mechanism produces antibodies (large glycoproteins) in response to an immune stimulus. Many cells of the immune system are required for this process, including lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells) and antigen presenting cells. These cells coordinate an immune response upon the detection of foreign proteins (antigens), producing antibodies that bind to these antigens. In normal physiology, lymphocytes that recognise human proteins (autoantigens) either undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) or become non-functional. This <b>self-tolerance</b> means that lymphocytes should not incite an immune response against human cellular antigens. Sometimes, however, this process malfunctions and antibodies are produced against human antigens, which may lead to autoimmune disease.|$|E

It was mostly in the way of explaining to him how she was unworthy of his friendship that the story was told, and she fancied telling it without being scandalized at violating the conventions that should have kept her from even dreaming of such a thing. It was all exalted to a plane where there was no question of fit or unfit in doing it, but only the occasion; and he would never hear of the unworthiness which she wished to ascribe to herself. Sometimes he mournfully left her when she persisted, left her forever, and sometimes he refused, and retained with her in a sublime kindness, a noble amity, lofty and serene, which did not seek to become anything else. In this case she would break from her reveries with self-accusing cries, under her breath, of [...] "Silly, silly! Oh, how disgusting!" [...] and if at that moment Breckon were really coming up to sit by her, she would blush to her hair, and wish to run away, and failing the force for this, would sit cold and blank to his civilities, and have to be skilfully and gradually talked back to self-respect and <b>self-tolerance.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{balance between}} {{effective}} defense and <b>self-tolerance</b> {{is important to}} the functioning of NK cells. It is thought that NK cell <b>self-tolerance</b> is regulated by the educational process of receptor expression described above, although the exact mechanism is not known. The “at least one” hypothesis is an attractive, though not yet fully substantiated, hypothesis that tries to explain the way in which <b>self-tolerance</b> is regulated in the education process. This hypothesis posits that the NK cell repertoire is regulated so that at least one inhibitory receptor (either of the IgSF or CTLR superfamily) is present on every NK cell, which would ensure <b>self-tolerance.</b> Effective defense requires an opposing pattern of receptor expression. The co-expression of many MHC-specific receptors by NK cells is disfavored, likely because cells that co-express receptors are less able to attack virally infected or transformed cells that have down-regulated or lost one MHC molecule compared to NK cells that co-express receptors to a lesser degree. Minimization of co-expression, therefore, is important for mounting an effective defense by maximizing the sensitivity of response.|$|E

50|$|Activating receptors {{have lower}} {{affinity}} for their ligands than do inhibitory receptors.

This difference, which is also present in Ly49, the murine homolog to KIR, tips the balance towards <b>self-tolerance.</b>|$|E
50|$|NK cells express many cell-surface receptors {{that can}} be activating, inhibitory, adhesion, cytokine, or chemotactic.

50|$|Inhibitory receptors {{recognize}} self-MHC class I molecules {{on target}} self cells, causing the activation of signaling pathways that stop the cytolytic function of NK cells.

If an individual sufferer does not go through this transformation, he or she is left with two unstable narcissistic defenses. Libbey says these defenses are: self-damning, deflated states designed to appease and hold on to self-objects, and narcissistic conceit, which is designed to project the defective self experiences onto self-objects. Both of these defensive styles require a continuation of dependence on the self-object.
