5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower</b> in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is {{in the collection of}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

40|$|This article evaluates ‘simulation’ as a {{contributing}} factor in architectural design. While computers enhance simulation, {{they have yet to}} transform the art of architecture. A partial explanation is found at the extremes of design processes: Gaudí’s Sagrada Família Cathedral of Barcelona is an empiricist’s culminating achievement [...] faith expressed in stone. By contrast, SOM’s <b>Sear’s</b> <b>Tower</b> of Chicago is the modernist monument to rational process [...] (financial) faith engineered in steel and glass. Gaudí employed an understanding of the heritage of stone and masonry to fashion his design while SOM used precise relationships of mathematics and steel. However, the designs in both the <b>Sear’s</b> <b>Tower</b> and Sagrada Família are restricted by the solutions inherent in the methods. In contrast, student designs often have no inherent approach to building. While the solution may appear to be evident, the method must often be invented; this is potentially more costly and complex than the design itself. This issue is not new to computers, but its hyper [...] reality is potentially more complex and disruptive. In evaluating the role of computer simulation in architectural design, this article employs two methods: 1.) Exoskeletal design: A limited collection of connected plates is formed and designed through warping, bending and forming. Reference architect Buckminster Fuller. 2.) Endoskeletal design: Curtain wall construction is taken to its minimalist extreme, using pure structure and membrane. Reference artist Christo...|$|R

25|$|The company {{became known}} {{as the leader of the}} {{furniture}} industry in the late 1960s due to the volume of its sales. Steelcase expanded into new markets during the 1970s, including Asia, Europe, and North Africa.

TrizecHahn also owned the Willis Tower (<b>Sears</b> <b>Tower</b> at the time) in Chicago approximately at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Ward's catalog soon was copied {{by other}} enterprising merchants, most notably Richard Warren Sears, who mailed his first general catalog in 1896. Others entered the field, and by 1971 catalog sales of major U.S. firms {{exceeded}} more than $250 million in postal revenue. Although today the <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower</b> in Chicago is the United States's tallest building, {{there was a}} time when Montgomery Ward's headquarters was similarly distinguished. The Montgomery Ward Tower, on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Madison Street in Chicago, reigned as a major tourist attraction in the early-1900s.|$|E

The catalog also entered the language, particularly of rural dwellers, as a euphemism for toilet paper. From 1908 to 1940, the catalog even included ready-to-assemble kit houses. Novelists and story writers often portrayed the importance of the catalog in the emotional lives of rural folk.|$|R
25|$|Two years later, {{the city}} hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, which {{featured}} physical confrontations {{both inside and}} outside the convention hall, with anti-war protesters, journalists and bystanders being beaten by police. Major construction projects, including the <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower</b> (now known as the Willis Tower, which in 1974 became the world's tallest building), University of Illinois at Chicago, McCormick Place, and O'Hare International Airport, were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure. In 1979, Jane Byrne, the city's first female mayor, was elected. She helped reduce crime in the Cabrini-Green housing project and led Chicago's school system out of a financial crisis.|$|E
25|$|Some of the United States' tallest towers {{are located}} in Chicago; Willis Tower (formerly <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower)</b> is the second tallest {{building}} in the Western Hemisphere after One World Trade Center, and Trump International Hotel and Tower is the third tallest in the country.

Many other architects have left their impression on the Chicago skyline such as Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, Charles B. Atwood, John Root, and Helmut Jahn.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the Discover Card was introduced, Sears was the largest {{retailer}} in the United States. It had purchased the Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage organization and Coldwell, Banker & Company (real estate) in 1981 {{as an attempt to}} add financial services to its portfolio of customer services. Ray Kennedy, Sr, father of country singer Ray Kennedy and the credit manager for Sears, conceived the card. Together with the Discover Card (and its issuing bank, the Greenwood Trust Company, owned by Sears), this was named the Sears Financial Network. Early Discover Cards bore a small embossed symbol representing the <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower,</b> then the company's headquarters.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Sears</b> Merchandise Building <b>Tower</b> is a fourteen-story structure, with a {{limestone}} {{base and}} brick walls.

It housed water tanks for firefighting on the upper levels, as well as offices and secretarial training facilities. It also housed the early broadcast facilities for WLS-AM. In 2015, it was refurbished and reopened {{to the public as}} the [...] "John D. and Alexandra C. Nichols Tower".

25|$|The Merchandise Mart, once {{first on}} the list of largest {{buildings}} in the world, currently listed as 44th-largest (as of September 9, 2013), had its own zipcode until 2008, and stands near the junction of the North and South branches of the Chicago River. Presently, the four tallest buildings in the city are Willis Tower (formerly the <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower,</b> also a building with its own zip code), Trump International Hotel and Tower, the Aon Center (previously the Standard Oil Building), and the John Hancock Center.

25|$|Officials {{also noted}} that the CN Tower has an {{excellent}} safety record, although there was an electrical fire in the antennae on August 16, 2017 — the tower's first fire. Moreover, other supertall structures built between 1967 and 1976 — such as the Willis Tower (formerly the <b>Sears</b> <b>Tower),</b> the World Trade Center (until its destruction on September 11, 2001), the Fernsehturm Berlin, the Aon Center, the John Hancock Center, and First Canadian Place — also have excellent safety records, which suggests that the Ostankino Tower accident was a rare safety failure, and that the likelihood of similar events occurring at other supertall structures is extremely low.|$|E
