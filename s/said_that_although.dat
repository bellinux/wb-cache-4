5|$|As {{the series}} wound down, Telefe {{considered}} a theatrical version for the 2013 summer season. It {{would have been}} similar to a 2010 version by the producers of Valientes, but the cast had other commitments. Telefe then asked series creator Sebastian Ortega to make a film. Negotiations were confirmed by producer Pablo Culell, who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Underground produces television series it can also produce stage plays and films.|$|E

To be aware of this fact, it is necessary, according to Said, {{to look at how}} colonialists and imperialists employed [...] "culture" [...] to control distant land and peoples.|$|R

5|$|Neighbours {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of requests from young viewers in the Neighbours website forums. Bower <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the show had featured lesbian romances before, love scenes between men are still taboo in Australian dramas. She added that Chris's coming out storyline was also based on the real life experiences of the shows writers.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Ann Shulgin {{reported}} on Facebook {{that her husband}} had developed liver cancer, and in a May 31 update on Facebook she <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> appearing frail, he seemed to be experiencing his last moments in peace and without pain.

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} debut, {{most of the}} {{development}} staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried to patch Bloodlines and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep Troika in business. Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals. That month, Boyarsky confirmed that Troika had not {{been working on a}} patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004. In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's. In a 2006 interview, Anderson <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at the Richmond Recorders studio in Melbourne in July 1981. The album was engineered and produced by Tony Cohen (The Birthday Party), together with The Go-Betweens. Forster <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Cohen, <b>although</b> having a signature sound, lacked a producer's instinct {{and the band}} had to [...] "choose their own songs and arrange them themselves," [...] resulting in many older songs being jettisoned from the album.|$|R
5000|$|Ibunda was {{released}} in 1986. It did not turn a profit, a situation the Subentra Group blamed on imported Hollywood films being more popular. Sudwikatmono described Ibunda as {{the best of the}} five films they had funded at the time. In his review, <b>Said</b> wrote <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the film within a film and scenes with were illogical, it may not be too much to call Ibunda [...] "Teguh Karya's best work yet." ...|$|R
5|$|Swedish analysts Carolina Vendil Pallin and Fredrik Westerlund <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the Russian Black Sea Fleet did {{not meet}} {{significant}} resistance, it proved effective at implementing elaborate manoeuvres. Mechanised infantry opened a second front in Abkhazia, which contributed to the rapidity of the Russian military victory.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
5|$|Although Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are {{father and}} daughter, Violeta {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space. Although they played characters of similar ages, they rarely have joint scenes. Julieta Ortega said that she has nothing in common with her character in the series. Juan Gil Navarro, who appeared in the television drama La Dueña at the same time, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> he does not normally appear in comedies he followed his wife's suggestion.|$|E
5000|$|None of the NASCAR drivers lampooned in [...] "Poor and Stupid" [...] were {{reported}} to be offended by their depiction in the episode.

500|$|After {{working with}} several coaches, {{including}} {{the head of}} the Lawn Tennis Association Carl Maes, she chose coach Martijn Bok in 2007. Bok <b>said</b> later <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Robson [...] "had trouble staying emotionally under control", he [...] "saw right away...a lot of potential in Laura." [...] Robson also began training at the National Tennis Centre, under the guidance of Bok, Maes, and the head of women's tennis at the centre, Nigel Sears, while taking school lessons at home.|$|R
50|$|Duck is not {{actually}} his real name. When he first arrived, {{he explained that}} his real name is Montague, but he was usually called Duck because everyone <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he waddled. <b>Although</b> he claims this was not true, he prefers Duck to Montague and now that is what everyone calls him.|$|R
5|$|Atchison {{remarked that}} his {{theme for the}} film, deemed an {{inspirational}} film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He {{also said that he}} wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes the public school system. Cast members <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} line-up for the Second Test at Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 {{in the middle}} order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings in the middle-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5000|$|I {{remember}} {{only one}} thing... I <b>said</b> to Kuper <b>that</b> <b>although</b> {{this was the}} first time I had sat in the dock, I did not mind it at all. He said to me, with that gentle smile which was one of his great characteristics, [...] "I don't like it at all." ...|$|R
50|$|However, it was <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Wang, <b>although</b> {{he welcomed}} these {{suggestions}} and petitions, actually {{did not act}} on them, and that while he used kind words to comfort even the lowest of soldiers, he did little in actions to benefit them. In spring 619, Wang's subordinates Dugu Wudu (獨孤武都), Dugu Wudu's cousin Dugu Ji, Yang Gongshen (楊恭慎), Sun Shixiao (孫師孝), Liu Xiaoyuan (劉孝元), Li Jian (李儉), and Cui Xiaoren (崔孝仁) plotted to surrender Luoyang to Tang troops, but were discovered, {{and they were all}} executed.|$|R
5000|$|Rogers died on 16 September 1652, aged 80. He {{was buried}} at Wethersfield. Rogers was morose, and his creed was {{severely}} Calvinistic. Firmin's Real Christian was mainly written to counteract his gloom. Rogers's stepbrother, John Ward, <b>said</b> of him <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> he [...] "had grace {{enough for two}} men, he had not enough for himself." ...|$|R
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E
5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
50|$|Dogfighting {{is banned}} in most Latin American {{countries}} and exists {{as an element}} of the underground economy in some working class societies. Although violent, dogfighting provides an opportunity for Octavio to make money. This is true to life in the sense that participating in the underground economy gives people in the lower class the ability to make money and experience mobility. González Iñárritu was heavily criticized for his inclusion of dogfighting in the film but has <b>said</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>although</b> it is horrible, dogfighting is one of the harsh realities of Mexico City.|$|R
5000|$|Although Brother Scott is not {{a gambler}} in the film, he is very greedy and makes {{consistent}} financial gains, more so than Bert. With <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> <b>although</b> Bert is always {{trying to get the}} upper hand, he can never seem to be fully successful.|$|R
5000|$|In the South Park episode [...] "Poor and Stupid," [...] Gordon, {{along with}} fellow drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr., Danica Patrick, Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth and Tony Stewart, are lampooned in {{addition}} to NASCAR itself. Commenting on the episode, Gordon <b>said</b> he thought <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the episode was making fun of NASCAR, it was still good publicity for the sport.|$|R
5|$|On August 11, 1944, the 258 {{men from}} the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who told them that troops {{fighting}} on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition {{they were supposed to}} be loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct, which carried the death penalty in times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.|$|E
5|$|Sagan {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} told on the radio that he had to ride hard {{to stay away from the}} chasing group, but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway. Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals court <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the impact statement followed the guidelines {{set by the}} National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
50|$|No {{sales figures}} were {{released}} for Sacrifice, but {{several members of}} the video game industry acknowledged the game did not sell well. James Bell, Infogrames's Senior Vice President of Creative Development, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Sacrifice, <b>although</b> an excellent game, suffered poor sales because it was badly marketed and released at the wrong time. Another reason, offered by Gillen, for Sacrifices commercial failure was the small size of its development team. Based mostly on the efforts of four people, the game was built around their gaming preferences, failing {{to take into account the}} opinions of a wider variety; hence, the game became a niche product.|$|R
60|$|For {{six days}} and nights the raft was tossed about on the open sea. It could {{scarcely}} be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it sailed, <b>although</b> as large a mast and piece of canvas as they could set up urged it slowly though the water when the wind was strong. As to steering, that was next to impossible, and in truth {{it did not matter}} much how they steered.|$|R
5000|$|Critically, the {{reception}} of Alan was mixed. Melanie McFarland, TV critic for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, stated that Alan was not an individual character. [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Hirsch’s presence, <b>although</b> not having {{a large role in}} the pilot, “adds value”. Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that Alan was “a subdued, funnier version of his Hirsch’s meddling dad from Independence Day”.|$|R
