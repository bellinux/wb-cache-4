50|$|Hovey set out {{to create}} the lightest {{aircraft}} to carry a person ever to fly, with the resulting design being a biplane, with a plywood box filled with Polyurethane foam serving as the fuselage, supporting the pilot's seat. The aircraft features a conventional fabric-covered empennage carried {{at the end of}} a short tailboom made of aluminum tube. The horizontal stabilizer is made from reinforced cardboard. Early versions used wing warping for roll control, while later models used full-span ailerons. The specified pusher configuration powerplant is a McCulloch chainsaw engine turning a hand-carved wooden propeller via a chain drive. The first prototype had a monowheel undercarriage, with skids under the wingtips, but this was soon changed to twin mainwheels carried on a <b>spring-type</b> strut. With no brakes to stop the aircraft after landing, pilots were supposed to press their heels against the mainwheels.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{production}} of a movie, commercial, music video etc., a <b>spring-type</b> clothespin is called a [...] "CP 47", [...] "C47", [...] "47", [...] "peg", [...] "ammo", or [...] "bullet". It is most useful on the set since lights used on film sets quickly become far too hot to touch; a wooden C47 is used to attach a color correction gel or diffusion to the barn doors on a light. The wooden clothespins do not transmit heat very effectively, and therefore are safe to touch, even when attached to hot lights for a significant period of time. Plastic clothespins are not used as plastic would melt with the heat of the lights, and metal would transfer the heat, making the clothespin too hot to touch. People like gaffers, grips, electricians, and production assistants may keep a collection of C47s clipped to clothing or utility belt at all times. Hence the nickname [...] "bullet", as so many crew members clip a number of C47s to their utility belts, much like an old west gunslinger would carry extra cartridges (which are often inaccurately referred to as bullets) on his gun belt.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To examine {{two types}} of {{orthodontic}} separators, focusing on the separating effect and patients' perception of pain and discomfort. METHODS: The separators tested were <b>spring-type</b> and elastomeric separators. Thirty teenagers participated, and all were scheduled for treatment with a fixed orthodontic appliance. Two <b>spring-type</b> and two elastomeric separators were placed alternately in the left or the right quadrant. After a separation period of 5 days, the amount of separation was measured with a leaf gauge. Nine questionnaires with visual analogue scales and questions with fixed answers were used to register the patient perceptions. RESULTS: The mean separation was 0. 3 mm for the <b>spring-type</b> and 0. 4 mm for the elastomeric separators (P <. 05). The springs were considered less painful than the elastomerics, but {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. For both separators, the pain was worst at day 2 and subsided almost completely by day 5. Due to pain, 14 of the 30 patients changed their food habits, and 13 took analgesics.

40|$|Stress jumps {{occur in}} fluids that possess a viscous {{contribution}} to their total stress.

40|$|Drought {{is a major}} stress {{which reduces}} crop yields, and which will {{continue}} to be an increasing problem in the coming years as climate change and limited fresh water supplies lead to higher temperatures, desertification, and increased soil salinity. These environmental stresses can significantly impact both the seed yield and quality of crops. There are several strategies which plants utilize to mitigate the effects of water deficit, making the identification of specific traits which convey drought tolerance difficult. As drought tolerance is a complex trait, accurate phenotyping to select for resilient genotypes is needed to improve our understanding of plant drought responses. In this study, stable carbon isotope screening (δ 13 C) of a diversity set of the crop plant Brassica napus grown in the field was used to identify accessions with traits linked with extremes in water use efficiency (WUE). We investigated physiological characteristics of the selected accessions to identify how these characteristics translate to differences in WUE. Using gas exchange techniques, we identified an interesting <b>spring-type</b> accession (G 302, Mozart), which exhibited the highest WUE in the field, based on δ 13 C measurements. This line displayed high CO 2 assimilation rates coupled with an increased electron transport capacity (Jmax) under lab conditions. We also analyzed stomatal conductance response to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in the selected accessions. While little variation was observed in the response rates of <b>spring-type</b> accessions, one semi-winter accession demonstrated a significantly more rapid response to exogenous ABA, which was in line with a higher WUE derived from δ 13 C measurements. This research supports the genetic data showing distinct genetic lineages for spring and semi-winter accessions. It also illustrates the importance of examining natural variation at a physiological level for understanding the underlying mechanisms of drought responses...|$|E

30|$|We used a gPhone (serial number 90), {{the newest}} <b>spring-type</b> {{gravimeter}} manufactured by Micro-g LaCoste Inc., to acquire high-quality, continuous gravity records, both below- and aboveground. At {{a depth of}} 100 m, when the gPhone was situated under an unconfined aquifer, the standard deviations of the residual gravity based on first- and second-order curve fittings are 4.2 and 2.7 µGal, respectively. Some gravity decreases caused by rainfall were clearly observed, and unknown gravity variations may also have occurred. Alternatively, when the gPhone was placed aboveground on the flank of a high mountain, the standard deviation of the residual gravity was 1.7 µGal for both the first- and second-order curve fittings. The rainfall amount and snow depth can explain most of the residual gravity.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for the ultrasonic {{evaluation of the}} interlayer interfacial stiffness of multilayered structures is proposed. As a theoretical background to this proposal, the elastic wave propagation in a multilayered structure, in which the layers are bonded with <b>spring-type</b> interfaces, is analyzed theoretically based on the transfer-matrix method. Using {{the notion of the}} Bloch phase which characterizes wave transmission in the corresponding infinite periodic structure, some explicit relations are derived for the reflection coefficient of the multilayered structure. Based on the features clarified theoretically, the interlayer interfacial stiffness of the multilayered structure can be evaluated from the locations of local minima and maxima of the amplitude reflection spectrum. By numerical analysis, the proposed procedure is shown to apply even when the viscous property of the layers is not known precisely, and when a transient waveform of a limited length is used.
