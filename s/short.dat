5|$|After {{writing the}} Maria-sama ga Miteru <b>short</b> story, Konno {{expanded}} {{it into a}} series of novels. The first volume was published on April 24, 1998, with illustrations by Reine Hibiki. In terms of the storyline, this first novel marks the beginning of the series; the original 1997 <b>short</b> story was reworked and republished in the ninth volume Cherry Blossom in 2001. Shueisha published 39 light novels in the series, ending with Farewell Bouquet on April 28, 2012. In February 2003, with 12 volumes released, Konno began to publish more <b>short</b> stories in Cobalt, with illustrations by Hibiki. Counting the 1997 debut, 27 <b>short</b> stories were published, which were included in later novels. The first five volumes of the light novel series were translated into German by Tokyopop.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed {{precursor}} to Kenny {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas <b>short,</b> dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another <b>short</b> as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas <b>short,</b> dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this <b>short,</b> Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold <b>short,</b> by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a <b>short</b> squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the <b>short</b> sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the <b>short</b> sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} crucial {{to have more}} than one path between two nodes in a given network. In the event there are additional constraints, other paths different from the <b>shortest</b> path can be computed. To find the <b>shortest</b> path one can use <b>shortest</b> path algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm or Bellman Ford algorithm and extend them to find more than one path. The k <b>shortest</b> path routing algorithm is a generalization of the <b>shortest</b> path problem. The algorithm not only finds the <b>shortest</b> path, but also k − 1 other paths in non-decreasing order of cost. k is the number of <b>shortest</b> paths to find. The problem can be restricted to have the k <b>shortest</b> path without loops (loopless k <b>shortest</b> path) or with loop.|$|R
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Figure 8, E(T) of ADA is {{slightly}} <b>shorter</b> than that of CNLP and significantly <b>shorter</b> than that of MIPv 6 and HMIPv 6.

The release includes the DVD-exclusive <b>short</b> film Mater and the Ghostlight and the film's theatrical <b>short</b> One Man Band {{as well as a}} 16-minute-long documentary about the film entitled Inspiration for Cars, which features director John Lasseter.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Figure 9, the average THL for ADA is 64.8 % <b>shorter</b> than for MIPv 6, 49.4 % <b>shorter</b> than for HMIPv 6 and 32.1 % <b>shorter</b> than for CNLP. Between the other three protocols, THL for HMIPv 6 is {{markedly}} <b>shorter</b> than for MIPv 6. When γ = 300 and α = 10 s, THL for HMIPv 6 is only 67.2 % of that for MIPv 6. THL for CNLP is <b>shorter</b> than that for HMIPv 6. In fact, although the single time handoff latency for HMIPv 6 is <b>shorter</b> than that for CNLP, the total handoff latency for CNLP is much <b>shorter</b> because its <b>shorter</b> total transmission time will experience fewer handoffs.|$|R

5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as <b>short</b> gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any <b>short</b> event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen <b>short</b> gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that <b>short</b> events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E
