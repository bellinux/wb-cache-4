The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the <b>simultaneity</b> of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail.

25|$|It may be {{difficult}} to see where <b>simultaneity</b> came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does {{not have to worry about}} <b>simultaneity.</b> As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores <b>simultaneity,</b> he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of <b>simultaneity</b> at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for <b>simultaneity</b> at a distance.|$|E

25|$|The large {{focus on}} the {{possibility}} of <b>simultaneity</b> in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though.

25|$|This {{technique}} of representing <b>simultaneity,</b> multiple viewpoints (or relative motion) is pushed {{to a high}} degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing), exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s Abundance shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's City of Paris, shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s The Wedding, also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of <b>simultaneity</b> by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force.

Although pitch <b>simultaneities</b> {{are among the}} fundamental building blocks of Western tonal music, affective responses to <b>simultaneities</b> such as isolated dyads varying in consonance/dissonance or chords varying in major/minor quality have rarely been studied in amusic individuals. Thirteen amusics and thirteen matched controls enculturated to Western tonal music provided pleasantness ratings of sine-tone dyads and complex-tone dyads in piano timbre as well as perceived happiness/sadness ratings of sine-tone triads and complex-tone triads in piano timbre. Acoustical analyses of roughness and harmonicity were conducted to determine whether similar acoustic information contributed to these evaluations in amusics and controls. Amusic individuals' pleasantness ratings indicated sensitivity to consonance and dissonance for complex-tone (piano timbre) dyads and, to a lesser degree, sine-tone dyads, whereas controls showed sensitivity when listening to both tone types. Furthermore, amusic individuals showed some sensitivity to the happiness-major association in the complex-tone condition, {{but not in the}} sine-tone condition. Controls rated major chords as happier than minor chords in both tone types. Linear regression analyses revealed that affective ratings of dyads and triads by amusic individuals were predicted by roughness but not harmonicity, whereas affective ratings by controls were predicted by both roughness and harmonicity. We discuss affective sensitivity in congenital amusia in view of theories of affective responses to isolated chords in Western listeners...|$|R

Why do newspapers keep investing massively in visual resources, operating structural changes in their make-up? In what name are these graphic-visual changes effected? The confluences between communication and visualities (in the plural in order to cover its immense variety and implications) are, as it seems, a non-deferrable confrontation involving contemporary changes in journalism. The formation of these networks thus relies on a variable and dynamic complexity, in an unlimited territory of exploration where <b>simultaneities,</b> ambiguities, levels of determination and indetermination play an important part. In conclusion, we argue that a theoretical-political principle must be encountered in order for the triad visualities, journalism and communication to be viewed in the ambit of research networks. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the complex interrelationships among worktime, wages and health {{identified in the}} Grossman model of the demand for health. We specify a 3 -equation simultaneous model designed to capture the tune dependent character of these interrelationships, and estimate the model using 8 years of panel data on 882 males aged 22 to 71. The model is estimated using Hansen's generalized methods of moments imposing a weak set of conditions on the error term covariance structure. Using our data, we estimate simpler models with more restrictive assumptions commonly found in the literature, and find substantial differences between these estimates and those from the simultaneous model. For example, the positive relationship between worktime and health found in other studies disappears when the relevant <b>simultaneities</b> are accounted for. Our simultaneous estimates also suggest that worktime spent in environmentally adverse conditions are inversely related to health status, while job related physical exercise retards health deterioration. ...|$|R

As scholarship has moved beyond Europe and the United States, the complex nature of modernism’s sociocultural matrices has become prominent, and a re-evaluation of the private and public spaces through which modernist works were disseminated – from the publishing house to the continuation of private patronage – has developed alongside a reconsideration of the way in which we theorise such activities in terms of time (Brooker et al. 1 - 4).

Our study confirms previous findings of experimental studies by highlighting the impact of early spring temperatures on the flowering of the investigated plants. However, previous studies solely based on correlation analysis do not allow deriving explicit estimates of the strength of such interdependencies without further assumptions, a gap that is closed by our analysis.

40|$|Abstract- As a {{promising}} approach for large-scale simultaneous events (e. g., DDoS attacks by unknown worms), we {{have proposed a}} multi-stage change-point detection scheme. In the scheme, the global detector gathers information from distributed change-point detectors and detects simultaneous occurrence of change-points as target events. Because the scheme neglects sporadic false-positive change-points, which are caused by non-target events such as hardware troubles and normal traffic changes, the scheme can achieve low false-positive rate. In the previous paper, we investigated {{the performance of the}} scheme against DDoS attacks by a real worm, MSBLAST. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the scheme against general DDoS attacks with various scales and <b>simultaneities.</b> In addition, we investigate the effect of the length of detection-period for the global detector on detection performance, where the detection-period means the period during which the global detector regurarly checks whether or not target events occur. The simulation results show that (1) our multi-stage change-point detection scheme achieves lower false-positive rate than a stand-alone change-point detector scheme under the constraint that detection rate must be 1. 0, (2) even if the length of detection-period for the global detector is not appropriately set, our scheme can achieve better performance than a stand-alone change-point detector scheme thanks to filtering effect of the global detector.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a spatial panel simultaneous-equations model of {{employment}} growth, migration behavior, local public services and {{median household income}} in a partial lag-adjustment growth-equilibrium framework and utilizing a one-way error component model for the disturbances. To estimate the model, we developed a five-step new estimation strategy by generalizing the Generalized Spatial Three-Stage Least Squares (GS 3 SLS) approach outlined in Kelejian and Prucha (2004) into a panel data setting. The empirical implementation of the model uses county-level data from the 418 Appalachian counties for 1980 - 2000. The estimates show the existence of feedback <b>simultaneities</b> among the endogenous variables of the model, the existence of conditional convergence {{with respect to the}} respective endogenous variable of each equation of the model, and the existence of spatial autoregressive lag effects and spatial cross-regressive lag effects with respect to the endogenous variables of the model. Moreover, the speed of adjustment parameters is generally comparable to those in literature. One of the key conclusions is that sector-specific policies should be integrated and harmonized in order to give the desirable outcome. In addition, regionally focusing resources for development policy may yield greater returns than treating all locations the same.
