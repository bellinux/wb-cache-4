25|$|Three key {{personnel}} acquisitions were made {{prior to the}} 2001–02 season, Laviolette's first. Alexei Yashin was acquired from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Bill Muckalt, defenseman Zdeno Chara and the Islanders' second overall pick in the 2001 draft. Next, Islanders prospects Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt were traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Michael Peca, who became the team's captain. By virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season, Detroit Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood was the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange. The additions {{proved to be a}} great help, as the team opened the season with a 9–0–1–1 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turn-around in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed Billy Smith's previous record of 65. During the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs. The Islanders lost in a very physical first round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, Game 5 featured Gary Roberts charging Islander defenseman Kenny Jonsson, and Darcy Tucker <b>submarining</b> Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's anterior cruciate ligament, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injury Peca before the game has even began, which Tucker denied.|$|E

5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible belt tensioning is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the belt tensioning on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis <b>submarining</b> under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic belt tensioning which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|E

40|$|Legislation in Europe {{requires}} {{children younger}} than 12 or shorter than 150 cm to use a child restraint system (CRS) when travelling in motor vehicles. These have decreased {{the number of children}} fatalities in car accidents, yet certain body regions such as the abdomen are still prone to severe trauma. One of the mechanisms by which injuries to this body region occur is called "submarining". It involves the seat-belt slipping over the pelvis onto the abdomen during rapid deceleration, therefore afflicting the abdomen with injurious loads. The motion characterising <b>submarining</b> with CRS is as of yet poorly defined, and although CRS are assessed for protection level, there is currently no established identification criteria for <b>submarining.</b> As part of the Enabling Protection for Older Children project (EPOCh), standard frontal impact sled tests of 10 CRS (6 high back booster seats; 4 booster cushions) with 10 year old anthropomorphic testing devices (ATDs) were analysed qualitatively, transversally and longitudinally for <b>submarining</b> detection. The methods used included video analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics, principal component analysis, time series analysis, as well as multiple linear regression and logistic regression, applied on both ATD trajectories and ATD instrumentation recordings (dynamic data). From the videos, trajectories and dynamic data, <b>submarining</b> motion is shown to embody an exaggerated slouching movement regardless of the CRS type. The observations and quantitative results confirm that exaggerated forward knee displacement is characteristic of <b>submarining,</b> as well as a very strong criterion for the latter's detection. No other individual trajectory or dynamic variable distinguish clear <b>submarining</b> behaviour, however the regression analyses on dynamic variables establish the association of the pelvis, lumbar and chest as representative of the knee displacement, and demonstrate the combination's capacity to distinguish <b>submarining</b> cases. These findings establish the complexity of the movement involved in <b>submarining</b> and the potential of using current ATD instrumentation for its assessment with CRS. This opens a path for an integral approach to ATD movement in CRS appraisal and suggests considering pelvis, lumbar and chest motion control for <b>submarining</b> prevention...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study and a case report was to {{demonstrate}} seat belt webbing induced injury due to seatbelt <b>submarining</b> during the frontal motor vehicle crash. <b>Submarining</b> is an undesired phenomenon during a frontal crash scenario and is dependent on design features of the seat pan and seatbelt system.

This case report and the following injury causation analysis demonstrate the shortcomings of a cantilever seat pan design in context to the occupant safety. The inadequate seat pan anti-submarining feature in association with lack of seatbelt load-limiter and Pretensioner reduces the level of occupant protection offered by the seat belt system in the rear seat.

40|$|Objective: Investigate the {{combined}} effects of belt geometry, seat substructure, and seat belt pretensioners and load limiters on rear seat occupant injury risk. Methods: An instrumented Hybrid III 5 th percentile adult female dummy {{was subjected to}} simulated frontal impacts (Δv = 45. 8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27. 1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, {{and the use of}} seat belt pretensioners with load limiters. Results: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on <b>submarining.</b> Seat belt pretensioners with load limiters reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent <b>submarining.</b> The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented <b>submarining</b> in one case but could not prevent <b>submarining</b> with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and <b>submarining.</b> Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash belt fit, antisubmarining seat pans, belt buckles positioned near the seat bight, and seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters for rear seat occupants. These data can be used to inform the design of a system of restraints to reduce injuries to rear seat occupants. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{is to determine the}} potential injury-reducing benefits to car occupants in accidents of seat and seat-belt design. The main problems addressed are the risk of injury to head, neck, and upper torso in frontal impacts, and the risk of minor neck-injuries - whiplash-injuries - in rear-end collisions. The approach is to combine mathematical and mechanical modelling of representative frontal and rear-end crash-situations, thereby enabling general-purpose parametric studies of relevant design factors. Thus the crash situations are first modelled mechanically because this enables realistic occupant environments. The next step is to transfer the scenario into the mathematical model MADYMO, where the seat and seat-belt design are further elaborated on in order to resolve the detailed effects of changes to the occupant environment. Since designs for increased restraining effect of the seat-belt may adversely affect the risk of occupant <b>submarining,</b> a means of assessing the tendency for <b>submarining</b> in MADYMO-simulations of frontal impacts is developed. This method can predict lap-belt-slip off the pelvis, which {{is the first step in}} the <b>submarining</b> event. The risk of <b>submarining</b> is then predicted in subsequent simulations. A means of reducing the belt-force while still maintaining the full protective capacity of the belt, is also studied. This principle allows for an increase in impact velocity of up to 25 % without increased risk for belt-induced injury. The coupling between design parameters of a seat-belt system which has all anchorages incorporated in the seat structure, i. e. a belt-in-seat system, is analysed. The results show system response to be more sensitive to lap-belt geometry and seat properties than to shoulder-belt geometry. In fact, the small differences in occupant response obtained when the shoulderbelt geometry has been changed indicate most occupant sizes may be accommodated without elaborate devices for adjustment of the upper point of belt-presentation. A number of parameters with possible effects on the risk of injury in rear-end collisions are also analysed. The results show the following 1) For a given impact velocity, the risk of injury increases when crash-pulse duration decreases. 2) Seat-belt usage only influences occupant response during rearward motion in severe impacts. 3) For strengths and stiffnesses below a threshold level, occupant protection decreases with decreasing stiffness and strength of the seat-back recliner. For strengths and stiffnesses above the threshold, occupant response is less sensitive to changes of these properties. 4) Recliner energy absorption is important for reducing occupant rebound, as well as for the protection of out-of-position occupants in severe impacts. MADYMO proved effective for evaluating relations between car design parameters and occupant responses, although its algorithm for rigid body contacts was considered inadequate in applications involving analysis of contacts between the occupant and its environment...|$|E
