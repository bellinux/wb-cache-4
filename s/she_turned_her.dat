25|$|Following her {{defeat in}} the European Parliament {{election}} of June 2004, 1997 presidential election candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon said that she might run as an independent candidate {{on a platform of}} opposition to the adoption of the proposed European Union constitution. She initially attempted to repeat her 1997 strategy of seeking nominations from four county councils, and approached all the county councils in the country, but was rebuffed. Shortly before the close of nominations, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> attention to attempting to obtain nomination by 20 members of the Oireachtas, but was similarly unsuccessful.|$|E

She was chosen as the most promising sportswoman at Kenya's annual SOYA Awards. In January 2011 she ran at the Discovery Kenya Cross Country meet in Eldoret, but misjudged her run and slipped into fourth place near the end.|$|E

25|$|Sewall's work in {{establishing}} the National Council of Women in the United States led to her involvement in founding the General Federation of Women's Clubs. The federation's constitution was ratified in 1890. Sewall attended its first organizational meeting in February 1891, and helped to write its bylaws, but she was disappointed when the new organization decided not to join the National Council of Women. After serving as the first vice-president of the federation, her interest in the group gradually declined, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> efforts toward the National Council of Women and other reform issues. U.S. President William McKinley appointed Sewall as U.S. representative of women to the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris.|$|E

She spoke in Cardiff {{on behalf of the}} Joint Committee for Getting Women into Parliament. She did not contest the 1918 General Election. She took {{an active role in the}} affairs of a number of organisations; She was a member of the Executive Committee, of the NUWSS successor organisation the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, she was a member of the Common Interests Committee of the English-Speaking Union, she was involved in the Reunion of British War Missions in USA, she was a member of the Council for the Representation of Women in the League of Nations and she was a Member of the British Institute of International Affairs.|$|E
25|$|At age nine, Mitchell {{contracted}} polio in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. No longer athletic, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> {{thoughts to}} her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career {{for the first}} time. By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family {{to the city of}} Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In twelfth grade, she flunked out (though she later picked up her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that she was getting too close to the criminal world.|$|E

25|$|She {{opened the}} 2010 season by {{returning}} to the half marathon in Ras Al Khaimah. She was sixth in the race while distance-débutante Elvan Abeylegesse took the honours. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> attention to the London Marathon in April, but was beaten into twelfth place and finished almost ten minutes behind race winner Liliya Shobukhova. Her next marathon appearance came at the Eindhoven Marathon in October and she led from the start and seemed likely to break her personal best. Helped by her own pacemaker, she reached the 30km mark a minute faster than her Berlin run. She slowed in the final few kilometres but her time of 2:25:35 brought her her first marathon win and a new course record – bettering Nadja Wijenberg's mark which had stood for over a decade. She set a new personal best of 2:24:26 at the Dubai Marathon in January 2011, where she came fourth.|$|E
25|$|An avid gardener, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> {{attention}} to the grounds. Chester Holmes Aldrich first designed a swimming pool for the property, a raised structure enclosed on three sides by a pergola of stone piers and wooden trellises. After that came the Bait Box, a playhouse for the couple's son, Gifford Bryce Pinchot. Elliptical openings in the stone walls around the courtyard provide views over the surrounding landscape. Next, in the late 1920s, when her husband was serving his first term as governor, came the Letter Box, a small cottage intended both as an archive for his papers and an office for his political staff {{when he was in}} residence. In their last collaboration, Aldrich and Cornelia Pinchot added a moat, which finally gave the house the raised effect Hunt had originally intended. In building it became necessary to lengthen the east lawn and build a new stone wall to support the moat.|$|E
25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> head to the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E

25|$|Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont Cross Country {{race for}} a third time. Radcliffe then {{finished}} fourth in Durham. Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury in a bizarre way, as she was sidelined after kneeling on the floor writing thank you letters for wedding presents. For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined {{a host of other}} British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E

500|$|During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier {{performed}} Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, {{and sang}} in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She {{returned to the}} Netherlands in January 1949 {{for a series of}} recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated [...] "this abominable accompanist" [...] who deserved [...] "a kick in the pants". When she found out that he had been ill for months, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> fury on the tour's promoters: [...] "What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} also notable for {{giving rise to}} the term [...] "new Madonna", a {{stronger}} and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe. Considine felt that [...] "the important thing Madonna did on the tour was to demonstrate how female sexuality can {{be a source of}} strength. Traditionally in pop culture, there are two roles that a woman can play—the good girl and the bad girl, and the bad girl is never taken seriously. But Madonna shows up the trappings of a bad girl, and demanded to be taken up seriously because she just doesn't roll over. I got more sense of the strength and power that was under her image all along." [...] Another important fact noted in the tour by scholars is the extensive use of multimedia technique to its maximum potential. Says Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, that [...] "Madonna transformed the concept of a concert tour being focused on the songs. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> Who's That Girl? tour into a ubiquitous multimedia blitz technique by including songs, dancing, choreography, videos, big screens, backdrops—not to mention the subtle preaching and messages—that made singing a secondary quality for concert goers. Evident from the people that thronged to see the tour, they were there for the spectacle—and not see Madonna {{standing in front of the}} microphone and singing.|$|E

On May 27, 2008 MTV News {{reported}} that the Pussycat Dolls were among many set to perform at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards on June 1, 2008. Scherzinger talked about the performance saying: [...] "This {{is a big deal}} for us. We just want to kill it. It's all about the Dolls right now, and we're coming strong." [...] The girls performed wearing spandex-and-leather getups, while a backdrop was displayed in the background with images of flashbulbs, tabloid headlines and diamonds. They were joined by America's Best Dance Crew winners the Jabbawockeez who descended from the ceiling wearing matching red T-shirts with stark-white masks covering their faces, and baseball caps perched at 45-degree angles atop their heads. Of the performance, Geoff Boucher from the Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "the Pussycat Dolls' set climaxed with a powerful pyro display that left celebs in the first few rows feeling a bit roasted". MTV Buzzworthy described the performance as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sultry". However, Tod Martens, in another review for the Los Angeles Times, criticized their performance. He commented: [...] " [...] onstage looking like they had escaped a taping for a sexed-up Jazzercise video." [...] He also wrote that Scherzinger never commanded the song except on [...] "the cut's final seconds when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> vocals up to a growl" [...] and noted JabbaWockeez's appearance as [...] "annoy".|$|E
