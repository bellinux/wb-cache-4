5000|$|Historically, {{penetrating}} keratoplasty, or full thickness corneal transplantation, was {{the treatment}} of choice for irreversible endothelial failure. More recently, new corneal transplant techniques {{have been developed to}} enable more <b>selective</b> <b>replacement</b> of the diseased corneal endothelium. This approach, termed endokeratoplasty, is most appropriate for disease processes that exclusively or predominantly involve the corneal endothelium. Penetrating keratoplasty is preferred when the disease process involves irreversible damage not just to the corneal endothelium, but to other layers of the cornea as well. Compared to full-thickness keratoplasty, endokeratoplasty techniques are associated with shorter recovery times, improved visual results, and greater resistance to wound rupture. Although instrumentation and surgical techniques for endokeratoplasty are still in evolution, one commonly performed form of endokeratoplasty at present is Descemet's Stripping (Automated) Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK DSAEK). In this form of endokeratoplasty, the diseased host endothelium and associated Descemet's membrane are removed from the central cornea, and in their place a specially harvested layer of healthy donor tissue is grafted. This layer consists of posterior stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium that has been dissected from cadaveric donor corneal tissue, typically using a mechanized (or [...] "automated") instrument.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of proton transfer between {{the surface of}} purple membrane and the aqueous bulk have recently been investigated by the Laser Induced Proton Pulse Method. Following a Δ-function release of protons to the bulk, the system was seen to regain its state of equilibrium within a few hundreds of microseconds. These measurements set the time frame for the relaxation of any state of acid-base disequilibrium between the bacteriorhodopsin’s surface and the bulk. It was also deduced that the released protons react with the various proton binding within less than 10 μ. In the present study, we monitored the photocycle and the proton-cycle of photo-excited bacteriorhodopsin, {{in the absence of}} added buffer, and calculated the proton balance between the Schiff base and the bulk phase in a time-resolved mode. It was noticed that the late phase of the M decay (beyond 1 ms) is characterized by a slow (subsecond) relaxation of disequilibrium, where the Schiff base is already reprotonated but the pyranine still retains protons. Thus, it appears that the protonation of D 96 is a slow rate-limiting process that generates a “proton hole” in the cytoplasmic section of the protein. The velocity of the hole propagation is modulated by the ionic strength of the solution and by <b>selective</b> <b>replacements</b> of charged residues on the interhelical loops of the protein, at domains that seems to be remote from the intraprotein proton conduction trajectory...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Atheromatous {{ascending}} aortic aneurysms (AAA) frequently {{present with}} aortic regurgitation (AR) from dilatation of the sino-tubular junction (STJ) and {{extension of the}} pathological process into the root. Experience suggests that root dilatation begins in the non-coronary, then right coronary sinus. Rather than employ aortic root replacement or the David procedure, we have elected to replace the ascending aorta and remodel the STJ and involved sinuses. We studied the outcome after <b>selective</b> sinus <b>replacement</b> in 29 consecutive AAA patients between 1995 and 2001. METHODS: There were nine male and 20 females. Age ranged from 47 to 79 years (mean 67. 5). Seven had arch aneurysms and four coronary artery disease. Nineteen were NYHA III or IV. Grade of AR was IV in 20, III in five and II in four. The STJ was dilated > 50 % of annulus diameter in each case (5. 3 - 10. 0 cm, mean 6. 4 cm). All valves had three cusps. All patients underwent ascending aortic replacement. Seven had arch replacement and four coronary artery bypass. Seven had replacement of both right and non-coronary sinuses with re-implantation of the right coronary ostium. Twelve had replacement of the non-coronary sinus alone whilst nine had right coronary sinus replacement. One with dextrocardia had left coronary sinus replacement with ostial re-implantation. The graft size was within 2 mm of annulus size except for two patients (24 mm 12, 26 mm 11, and 28 mm six). Post operative echocardiographic studies were performed. None of the patients received anticoagulation. RESULTS: There were no hospital or late deaths and no thromboembolic or infective complications. Two patients had mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. These had a size 28 graft, which in retrospect was too large. Others had no significant regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: The native aortic valve can be preserved {{in the majority of}} patients with AAA.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanistic}} {{details of}} many polyketide synthases (PKSs) remain elusive {{due to the}} instability of transient intermediates that are not accessible via conventional methods. Here we report an atom replacement strategy that enables the rapid preparation of polyketone surrogates by <b>selective</b> atom <b>replacement,</b> thereby providing key substrate mimetics for detailed mechanistic evaluations. Polyketone mimetics are positioned on the actinorhodin acyl carrier protein (actACP) to probe the underpinnings of substrate association upon nascent chain elongation and processivity. Protein NMR is used to visualize substrate interaction with the actACP, where a tetraketide substrate is shown not to bind within the protein, while heptaketide and octaketide substrates show strong association between helix II and IV. To examine the later cyclization stages, we extended this strategy to prepare stabilized cyclic intermediates and evaluate their binding by the actACP. Elongated monocyclic mimics show much longer residence time within actACP than shortened analogs.

Comparison of the binding and functional properties of related VIP analogues suggested that the VPAC(1) selectivity of Arg(11) -VIP {{was due to the}} loss of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxy group of Thr residue and the VPAC(2) receptor, steric hindrance between the Arg side chain and the VPAC(2) receptor and charge attraction by the VPAC(1) receptor. Comparison of the ability of VIP analogues to activate adenylate cyclase through chimaeric VPAC(1) /VPAC(2) and VPAC(2) /VPAC(1) receptors indicated that the first extracellular receptor loop carried most of the VPAC(2) receptors' ability to discriminate VIP from Arg(11) -VIP. Based on results obtained for a truncated VPAC(2) receptor and the closely related PACAP-preferring receptor (PAC(1)) and secretin receptors, we hypothesized that Thr(11) interacted with the VPAC(2) receptor Tyr(184) (similar to the VPAC(1) receptor Phe(200) residue).

The coupling of pattern recognition techniques via principal component analysis (PCA) has resulted in unique protein fingerprints for corresponding protein templates, allowing for MIP-based protein profiling. Polyacrylamide MIPs for memory imprinting of bovine haemoglobin (BHb), equine myoglobin (EMb), cytochrome C (Cyt C), and bovine serum albumin (BSA), alongside a non-imprinted polymer (NIP) control, were spectrophotometrically, and electrochemically characterised using modified GC electrodes. Rebinding capacities (Q) were revealed to be higher for larger proteins (BHb and BSA, Q ≈ 4. 5) while (EMb and Cyt C, Q ≈ 2. 5). Electrochemical results show that due to the selective nature of MIPs, protein arrival at the electrode via diffusion is delayed, in comparison to a NIP, by attractive selective interactions with exposed MIP cavities. However, at lower concentrations such discriminations are difficult due to low levels of MIP rebinding. PCA loading plots revealed 5 variables responsible for the separation of the proteins; E, I, E, I, ΔI. Statistical symmetric measures of agreement using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) were revealed to be 63 % for bare GC, 96 % for NIP and 100 % for MIP. Therefore, our results show that with the use of PCA such discriminations are achievable, also with the advantage of faster detection rates.

METHODS: Women with surgically excised primary BC (T 1 - 3, N 0 - 2, M 0) within the last 5 years complaining of vasomotor symptoms, were assigned to tibolone 2. 5 mg daily or placebo treatment for a maximum of 5 years. The BMD sub-study enrolled 763 patients utilizing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning at baseline and at 2 years. RESULTS: In the bone sub-study 699 out of 763 women were eligible (345 allocated to tibolone and 354 to placebo) after undergoing DXA scans, 300 (43 %) women had normal BMD, 317 (45 %) osteopenia and 82 (11. 7 %) osteoporosis.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is elucidation of the molecular mechanism for the unique photosystem II (PSII) damage and repair cycle in chloroplasts. A frequently occurring, irreversible photooxidative damage inhibits the PSII charge separation reaction and stops photosynthesis. The chloroplast PSII repair process rectifies this adverse effect by selectively removing and replacing the photoinactivated D 1 / 32 -kD reaction center protein (the chloroplast-encoded psbA gene product) from the massive (> 1, 000 kD) water-oxidizing and O 2 -evolving PSII holocomplex. DNA insertional mutagenesis in the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was applied for the isolation and characterization of rep 27, a repair-aberrant mutant. Gene cloning and biochemical analyses in this mutant resulted in the identification of REP 27, a nuclear gene encoding a putative chloroplast-targeted protein, which is specifically required for the completion of the D 1 turnover process but is not essential for the de novo biogenesis and assembly of the PSII holocomplex in this model green alga. The REP 27 protein contains two highly conserved tetratricopeptide repeats, postulated to facilitate the psbA mRNA cotranslational insertion of the nascent D 1 protein in the existing PSII core template. Elucidation of the PSII repair mechanism may reveal the occurrence of hitherto unknown regulatory and catalytic reactions for the <b>selective</b> in situ <b>replacement</b> of specific proteins from within multiprotein complexes...|$|R
