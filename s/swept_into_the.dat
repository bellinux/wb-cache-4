5|$|Due to flooding, troops {{evacuated}} {{dozens of}} communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities {{throughout the state}} were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gulf. Sixteen people died inside {{the remains of a}} building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E
5|$|Late in the night, Thảo and Phát {{met with}} Kỳ {{in a meeting}} {{organized}} by the Americans, and insisted that Khanh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-coup forces <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city; it was generally thought that the rebels did not {{put up a fight}} after being assured that Khánh would be ousted. Early in the morning, Thi, who gained the support of Kỳ, proposed a motion within the junta to remove Khánh and force him into exile, and the final vote was unanimous—Khanh was absent from the meeting. Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu then became the key figures in a junta that continued with Sửu and Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát as a civilian front, although General Minh became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|On December29, Alibera began {{a steady}} track to the {{southwest}} after the ridge weakened, and briefly deteriorated to minimal tropical storm status. However, it re-intensified to just shy of tropical cyclone status on January1. Shortly thereafter, Alibera made landfall north of Mananjary in southeastern Madagascar, at 3 a.m. local time on New Year's Day, with 10‑minute winds of 115km/h (70mph). The storm quickly weakened over land, but again restrengthened upon reaching the Mozambique Channel on January3. This was short-lived, as Alibera weakened back to tropical depression status by January5. The storm moved to the southeast, turned {{to the southwest}}, and finally back to the southeast before dissipating on January7, having been <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> westerlies.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
5|$|Waves between 5 and 13feet (1.5–4meters) were {{reported}} along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10feet (3meters). One death occurred by drowning in New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man {{was reported missing}} in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave swept two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred {{in the state of}} New York. In Rhode Island two teenagers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after being <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water by the waves.|$|E

5|$|Antiochus VII Sidetes (r.138–129BC), {{a brother}} of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife Cleopatra Thea. After {{defeating}} Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130BC to retake Mesopotamia, {{now under the}} rule of Phraates II of Parthia (r.c.138–128BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the Great Zab, followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins. After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity. Arsaces released Demetrius and sent him to Syria, but refused the other demands. By spring 129BC, the Medes were in open revolt against Antiochus, whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter. While attempting to put down the revolts, the main Parthian force <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> region and killed Antiochus in battle. His body was sent back to Syria in a silver coffin; his son Seleucus was made a Parthian hostage and a daughter joined Phraates' harem.|$|E
5|$|With its {{location}} {{close to the}} storm's center, Dauphin Island saw the greatest damage in Alabama. Access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane, slowing the progression of damage assessments. Additionally, the storm cut power and phone services. Post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island; these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end, and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds. First-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases, entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico. The number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50, though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings. In total, the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on Dauphin Island, accounting for nearly 25% of all homes, and a further 235 sustained substantial damage. An unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $30 million.|$|E

25|$|After the {{disintegration}} of the Roman empire and the subsequent feudalisation of society, the first waves of invaders, including Alans, Germanic tribes, Huns, and others, <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. Initially accepted as settlers in lands depopulated by the terrible epidemics (probably measles and smallpox) that killed much of the population, their incursions soon gave way to military expeditions with the sole object of plunder and conquest.|$|E
25|$|As the {{demographic}} {{pressure from the}} colonists grew, the remaining Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to Indian reservations. Though some Natives escaped being <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reservation, most were moved to the Grand Ronde reservation in 1856. Strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people, known as Métis in French, {{had to make a}} choice between the reservation and Anglo society. Native Americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, in September 1688 {{the largest}} naval force the Company had ever {{assembled}} <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay, with orders to blockade the ports and arrest the ships of the Grand Mughal, and, if {{this did not}} bring satisfaction, to take the town of Chittagong. Beard being dead, authority devolved to a reluctant Charnock as commander-in-chief. As he anticipated, Chittagong proved remote and unviable. Sutanuti had in the meantime been razed by the nawab's troops, therefore the squadron sailed for Madras, arriving on 7 March 1689.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{surviving}} {{facilities are}} part of Salem's Winter Island Marine Park. Salem Harbor was deep enough to host a seadrome with three sea lanes, offering a variety of take-off headings irrespective of wind direction unless {{there was a strong}} steady wind from the east. This produced large waves that <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the harbor, making water operations difficult. When the seadrome was too rough, returning amphibian aircraft would use Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Beverly. Salem Air Station moved to Cape Cod in 1970.|$|E
25|$|In 1788 the Putnams {{traveled}} to Bemis Heights, New York, with Doanda's sister and brother-in-law, Anne (née Risley) and Dr. Clement Blakesley, respectively. Putnam found {{the land and}} wood in Bemis Heights to be especially agreeable, so he resolved to stay, constructing a loghouse for shelter. However, in spring of that year, torrential rains <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area, and the families were marooned by floods. A neighbor, Zophar Scidmore, came to their rescue in a sailboat. After staying in Scidmore's home for several days, the families departed, following an Indian trail to Saratoga Springs.|$|E

25|$|The first {{waves of}} Marines—advancing in well-disciplined lines—were slaughtered; Major Berry {{was wounded in}} the forearm during the advance. On his right, the Marines of Major Sibley's 3/6 Battalion <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} end of Belleau Wood and encountered heavy machine gun fire, sharpshooters and barbed wire. Marines and German infantrymen were soon engaged in heavy hand-to-hand fighting. The casualties sustained on this day were the highest in Marine Corps history up to that time. Some 31 officers and 1,056 men of the Marine brigade were casualties. However, the Marines now had a foothold in Belleau Wood.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailers being swept away by the torrent, many houses, with people still in or on top of them, were swept into Lake Ontario. Many people were saved when the houses in which they took shelter were stopped by trees from going into the lake. The reeve, Marie Curtis, {{was quoted in the}} Globe and Mail saying that {{if it were not for}} the trees, half of the village would have been <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lake. She also described a house with 35 people on its roof that was stopped by two trees from floating into the lake.|$|E
25|$|Adult blue monkey beetles are {{typically}} found grouped in the centres of unscented flowers that bear dark discs and bright petals with spot patterns at the bases. They {{feed on the}} pollen, embedding their heads into the discs and browsing, and sometimes supporting themselves by hooking their hind tarsal claws onto the flower petals. Pollen is <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth by dense setae on the maxillae. The behavioural tendency to congregate is for mating purposes, and {{it is suggested that}} male beetles prefer dark-centred flowers with spot patterns because they mistake the glossy discs and bright spots for resting females.|$|E
