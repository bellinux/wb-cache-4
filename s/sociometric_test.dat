PROCEDURE: Personal appearance rating scales for both grade and high school children were developed, with a mean observer reliability of 92 % between two raters. Three <b>sociometric</b> <b>tests</b> were devised, one for use in grades 2 and 3, one for grade 5, and another for high school students. All children in grades 2 and 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 were measured for personal appearance and social acceptance. RESULTS: There was a small but consistent increase in the mean Personal Appearance scores of the subjects from grades 2 and 3, to 11. For all grade levels (elementary, junior-high, and senior high) girls’ mean Personal Appearance scores were significantly higher than those of boys. There was a tendency for girls to score higher in Social Acceptance than boys, although this sex difference was not statistically reliable. Coefficients of correlation, ranging from +. 261 to +. 603, were found to exist between the Personal Appearance and Social Acceptance scores R’s of +. 544 and +. 603 of the 7 th and 8 th grades, respectively, were significant at the 1 % level of confidence.

40|$|PART 1. The {{results of}} a survey in one hundred Secondary and twenty five special schools revealed: (a) Considerable support from headteachers and {{physical}} educationalists for the view that physical education can give experience of success to those {{with a history of}} failure. (b) Little concern for the desirability of finding appropriate material and teaching techniques designed especially for slow-learning girls. (c) A lack of both proper facilities and appropriate staff in special schools. PART 2. Experimental work was undertaken with four groups of adolescent educationally subnormal (mild) girls from three different schools, one of these groups acting as control. These groups were given: (a) Programmes of 'creative dance’ emphasising both partner and group experience. (b) <b>Sociometric</b> <b>tests</b> before and after the programme. (c) Behaviour assessment tests before and after the programme. As a result of this work the following points emerged: A. (i) The sociometric status of girls in the control group was relatively constant, although those girls of low sociometric status were more strongly rejected in the second test than in the first <b>test.</b> (ii) The <b>sociometric</b> status of girls in one of the experimental groups (^ 1) from a school with a well established physical education programme was also relatively constant and a reversal of the predicted 'sociodynamic' trend was statistically insignificant. (iii) After a rather more substantial dance programme two other experimental groups showed greater change in sociometric status and the reversal of the predicted 'sociodynamic' trend was statistically significant. B. (i) After behaviour assessment tests, the girls in the control group achieved significantly lower scores in the second test. (ii) The girls in the two experimental groups (as in A. iii) achieved significantly better scores in the second test. (iii) In one experimental group (as in A. ii) changes in behaviour, though positive, were insignificant.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of nondirective group play on the self-concept and sociometric status of selected members of second grade classrooms. Specific hypotheses examined were: 1. Positive change in self-concept as measured by the Scamin Self-Concept Scale will be greater in the experimental group than in either of the control groups at the termination of treatment. 2. Positive change in sociometric status as measured by the pre and post-test sociogram will be greater in the experimental group than in either of the control groups at the termination of treatment. A review of the literature in nondirective play suggests that the effectiveness of such a counseling technique has not been validated. There appears to be a need for carefully controlled research to evaluate the process and effects of nondirective play as a counseling technique. The sample consisted of second grade children in the Lebanon, Oregon, public schools who were identified as underchosen on a <b>sociometric</b> <b>test.</b> Thirty-six individuals participated in the experiment. These individuals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Each treatment group consisted of 12 members, six females and six males. The experimental group was exposed to nondirective group play for ten weeks. Control group I was exposed to a specialized reading group for ten weeks. Control group II received no attention other than the pre and post-tests. Complete testing data was obtained for all 36 subjects. The Scamin Self-Concept Scale and a <b>sociometric</b> <b>test</b> were administered to subjects prior {{to the beginning of the}} research and at the conclusion of the project. The two-factor mixed design: repeated measures on one factor analysis of variance was used comparing experimental and control groups on each instrument. The interaction effect of the self-concept score analysis yielded an F ratio of 10. 64, significant at the. 01 level. The first hypothesis was supported. Subjects exposed to nondirective play did show a significantly greater increase in self-concept scores than those subjects in the control groups. The interaction effect of the <b>sociometric</b> <b>test</b> score analysis yielded an F-ratio of 2. 49, which is not significant. There was a significant gain in scores between the pre-test and post-test sociometric scores over all three groups as shown by the F ratio of 7. 52. This is significant at the. 01 level. Hypothesis number two was not supported. The subjects exposed to nondirective play did not show a significant superiority in sociometric status score gain. The evidence from this study indicates that participation in non-directive play brings about increases in self-concept in those children identified as underchosen by a <b>sociometric</b> <b>test.</b> No significant effect of the treatment variable on sociometric status was found in this research. Recommendations for further research in nondirective play include: 1. Evaluation using long-term follow-up tests. 2. Investigation with different age groups. 3. Use of complete randomization of a particular age group in the selection of participants. 4. Investigation of the process of nondirective play to ascertain behavioral descriptions. 5.

40|$|Research {{on ethnic}} {{prejudice}} among children {{is important for}} contemporary multicultural schools seeking to enhance communication among students from different ethnic groups and provide effective intercultural education. Current scientific discourse points to the appearance of new implicit forms of prejudice, witnessed in modern multicultural societies, while traditional explicit prejudice tends to decline. However, empirical studies concerning the blatant-subtle distinction of prejudice in children are scarce. This paper examines ethnic prejudice in 329 ethnic majority preadolescents (aged 10 - 13 years) attending 10 urban and rural schools in central Greece. Data were collected using questionnaires constructed {{on the basis of}} focus group discussions with children, in addition to <b>sociometric</b> <b>tests.</b> Findings support the subtle-blatant distinction of prejudice in children and indicate that although blatant prejudice expressed as personal rejection is indeed low, perceptions of ethnic minority groups as a 'problem' for school life, as well as subtle prejudice, are substantial. Ethnic minority children are less popular and stigmatizing behaviour is common. Intimacy with an ethnic minority classmate is associated with lower levels of blatant prejudice at the individual level but the other forms of prejudice are not affected. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, {{research}} has consistently {{found that children}} in public care (LAC), in general, have low educational attainments. The research has tended to be from a social work standpoint with the focus on achievements at secondary school, In contrast, this study is from an education perspective and concerns the educational attainments of primary school LAC. This in-depth classroom-based research examines potentially modifiable aspects of social learning and behaviour {{in the education of}} LAC in order to generate hypotheses that can be subsequently tested. An investigation was carried out into the social perceptions of LAC, and their social perceptions of self, {{in the context of their}} mainstream primary school classrooms. The purposive sample consisted of 15 LAC aged five to 11 years, in 15 classrooms, in 11 mainstream primary schools, in one local authority. A total of 372 children and 59 school staff participated. A case study design employing mixed methods was used to ascertain and analyse sociometric status (SMS), locus of control beliefs (LCB) and self-esteem (S-E). The 15 LAC and their classmates completed two <b>sociometric</b> <b>tests</b> set in the context of the playground and the classroom, and two psychometric measures, PPNSIE (Nowicki-Duke, 1973) and B/G-STEEM (Maines & Robinson, 1983). School records were used to evaluate the children’s academic attainment, and school staff were consulted regarding the LAC’s SMS, LCB and S-E. The main non-directional hypothesis emerging from the empirical data is that there are complex relationships between the SMS, LCB, S-E, and educational attainment of LAC. Two additional factors became apparent from the findings. These were the varied emotional well-being of the LAC, and difficulties concerning language development. The findings of the case studies highlight the uniqueness of the 15 individual LAC in their specific classrooms and schools. This data calls into question the helpfulness of stereotyping other than for Governmental and local authority policymaking. For the class teacher, the value and practical methods of identifying specific social learning difficulties open to modification within individual LAC, and other ‘vulnerable children’, have been demonstrated.

40|$|Giftedness is a {{combination}} of above-average abilities and some other exceptional personality traits that can lead to exceptional achievements under appropriate conditions. Research shows that the personal development of a gifted child runs differently than with his peers. Personality mismatch or asynchronous development can occur when an individual with his cognitive abilities greatly exceeds the limit of his chronological age and remains in his emotional and social development at the level of his chronological age. For this reason, the problem of social inclusion of gifted pupils at school is professionally interesting, since on the basis of recognition of the social and emotional characteristics of gifted pupils we can work accordingly professionally; we support them or formulate appropriate intervention strategies. Social relations {{have a significant impact on}} pupils and their learning success. Children's development, however, depends not only on his cognitive and physical abilities, but the environment, in which the child lives, grows and develops also, plays an important role. The main purpose of the master's thesis was to find out how gifted pupils are socially accepted in the classroom, whose personality traits have the greatest impact on social inclusion, how they are perceived by classmates and how gifted pupils see themselves in the classroom. My intention was also to investigate whether the environment in which pupils derive plays an important role in the described social context. Last but not least, I was interested in how class teachers promote the social inclusion of gifted pupils and what their behavior is in the cases of observed social exclusions of gifted pupils. The survey included 263 pupils from 2 city primary schools in eastern Slovenia (of which 49 gifted pupils) and 242 pupils from 3 rural primary schools in eastern Slovenia (of which 49 gifted pupils) from grade 6 to 9, and their class teachers. The pupils filled out a questionnaire of <b>sociometric</b> <b>testing,</b> the class teachers filled out a questionnaire for class teachers, and gifted pupils completed a class tree test. The results showed that most gifted pupils have a middle sociometric status, some have a high sociometric status, and a very small proportion have a low sociometric status, which indicates that gifted pupils are generally well received in the classroom both during classes and during breaks and in their free time and are not socially excluded, as confirmed by their class teachers. For the characteristics of gifted pupils, both class teachers and classmates pointed out several positive and negative characteristics, among which communication, sociability, friendliness, rich imagination, hard work and readiness to help prevail. We did not find any major differences between gifted pupils from urban and rural schools in the survey. ...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that emotions, arousal, and goals affect how children reason in social situations, but, thus far, there has been very little research on how these variables interact. It has been hypothesized that emotion could affect any area of social information processing directly, {{but it has also}} been hypothesized that emotion might have an indirect effect on social information processing. Therefore, a primary hypothesis of the current study was whether emotion influences each step of social information processing directly or whether emotion influences social information processing indirectly by first influencing goal orientations which, in turn, influence the other areas of social information processing. Because there is evidence that aggressive children 2 ̆ 7 s social information processing may be disrupted by negative mood, I also examined whether mood affects aggressive children 2 ̆ 7 s social information processing more than that of nonaggressive children. The participants were 480 ungraded primary children enrolled in five different elementary schools from two school districts. Participants were tested in two sessions on different days. The first session consisted of <b>sociometric</b> <b>testing.</b> The second session consisted of a mood induction procedure, in which children were induced to feel either angry, happy, or neutral, followed by the response evaluation interview. Three provocation vignettes were presented, and after each vignette, competent, hostile, and inept responses were presented one at a time. For each type of response, children were asked to evaluate the instrumental and social relational consequences as well as the ease/difficulty of performing the response. Results from the current study provide further support for the hypothesis that emotion affects social information processing indirectly by first influencing children 2 ̆ 7 s goals which then affect social information processing. It also provides evidence that children 2 ̆ 7 s goals for certain situations are actually better predictors of children 2 ̆ 7 s selfefficacy beliefs than are children 2 ̆ 7 s social statuses. Our study also found results similar to past research that suggested rejected-aggressive children are more sensitive to negative arousal than are accepted-nonaggressive children. The current study did not include the negative emotions sadness and fear. Like anger, sadness and fear are also states of negative arousal; however they could induce a different set of goals and self-efficacy beliefs than does anger. Hence, more research that includes the study of sadness and fear is needed. The current study revealed an indirect influence of emotion on response evaluations. However, nothing is known about the effect of emotion on the other steps of social information processing, such as encoding of information, attribution of intent and response selection. It could be, that, rather than indirectly affecting encoding and attribution of intent, emotion could directly affect how children encode information from their environment and the attribution of their peers 2 ̆ 7 intentions. Because {{little is known about the}} effect of emotion on these steps of social information processing, future research should investigate this area further...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} the structure of the friendships exhibited by the two units, Pine Grove and White Valley, at the Camp Fire-Girl Scouts Day Camp, Atlanta, Georgia. Specifically, the study was to show the sociometric patterns of the two units, and the patterns of acceptance and rejection: To discover personality traits that were characteristic of girls being chosen and rejected more than others; To discover whether factors such as religion, belonging to another group, socio-economic accidents influenced the choices of friends. The study was limited to two units, Pine Grove and White Valley, and the spontaneous choices of friends as of one day, June 24, 1948. Data concerning the choices of friends in the two units, Pine Grove and White Valley was obtained by administering <b>sociometric</b> <b>tests.</b> The schedule and measurement of individual behavior in groups was instrumental in determining why girls were chosen or isolated as friends. Interviews with the camp directress and the adult unit leader gave additional information on the behavior and background of the girls. A sociogram was drawn and the choices of friends tabulated. In Pine Grove Unit, every girl received at least one choice and on mutual choice. The four most popular girls received at least eighteen of the thirty-three possible choices. Two girls received three mutual choices. Girls selected as their friends those persons who possessed personality traits that appealed to them. It was noted that the most popular girls were physically attractive, neat in appearance and possessed positive personality traits. They came from families of high economic and social status and tended to mutually choose each other as friends. The unpopular girls who did not rate high as choices for friends were less orderly, dressed dirtily and came from families of low economic and social standing. Most of the time, these girls behaved in an antagonistic and uncooperative manner. There was a tendency for the girls to select as friends those girls who were known to them before coming to camp. The place of contact was the school in most instances. In White Valley Unit, there were five girls who were not chosen by any of the girls. The four most popular girls received thirty-two of the forty-two possible choices. Seven girls did not have any mutual choices. The girls who were most popular were those girls who were friendly, kind, and possessed a sense of humor. These girls come from families of high economic and social standing. The unpopular girls were characterized as being 2 ̆ 2 dirty, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 smelly, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 saucy, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 greedy. 2 ̆ 2 These girls came from homes of low economic and social standing. Most of the time these girls did not participate or cooperate in the plans made by the other girls. The girls tended to choose friends among the girls that they had known before coming to camp. The girls who belonged to the Catholic church and attended the same parochial school had a strong tendency to select only girls who were Catholics. Sociometric placement of girls into cabins into cabins and units can be beneficial in the camp program. Girls who are placed where they will not be isolated and they feel that they are among friends will make a better adjustment in camp living and happier campers...|$|R

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been given to the processes by which the qualities of the teacher–child relationship (e. g., close, dependent, or conflictive) and children’s social behavior are related to young children’s social adjustment in early childhood (Palermo et al., 2007). The present dissertation, divided in three studies, investigated the direct and indirect contribution of children’s individual characteristics, quality of teacher-child relationships, and social behavior in an integrated model of peer acceptance. Study 1 aims at evaluating the internal consistency and the factorial validity of the full Student Teacher Relationship Scale (STRS) and Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation scale (SCBE- 30) that represent two instruments widely used in international research to measure the teachers’ perception of their relationships with each child and of children’s social competent/incompetent behaviors. To date, no study has examined the factorial validity of the scales, using both Exploratory Factorial Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA) in Italian children aged from 3 to 6 years. Using the results of study 1, study 2 aims at examining the relations between the quality of teacher-child relationship, children’s social-emotional behavior and peer acceptance (likability) in a sample of Italian preschool-aged children. Contrary to other studies, we used multiple informants (teachers, children themselves, and peers) and multiple methods (interviews with children, <b>sociometric</b> <b>testing,</b> and assessment scales). Study 3 aims at analyzing the relations between the quality of teacher-child relationship, children’s social-emotional behavior (anxiety-withdrawal, anger-aggression, and social competence), and peer likability in a longitudinal perspective. Less attention is given to the relation between withdrawal behavior and school adjustment over time. Given the small sample size, our hypotheses regarding the relation between anxiety-withdrawal and peer likability was somewhat exploratory. Our findings revealed that the modified three-factor versions of the STRS and SCBE- 30 scales can be considered valid instruments for examining the quality of teacher-child relationships and children’s social behavior. The original structures of the STRS scale with three correlated factors (conflict, closeness, and dependency) and of SCBE- 30 scale with three correlated factors (social competence, anger-aggression, and anxiety-withdrawal) were replicated. In line with other international research, the current work confirmed the processes by which the quality of teacher-child relationship (positive versus negative) may predict children’s social behavior and peer likeability. The positive emotional connection between teachers and children promoted children’s competent social behavior, and in turn, social competent behavior resulted as the only behavior related to peer acceptance. The results of the longitudinal study showed that socially competent behavior play an important role over time. The greater social competence displayed by children during time 1 and their progress during time 2, the more acceptable were they by their classmates. An important result regarded the effect of aggressive behavior on peer likeability. In our sample, aggressive behavior showed a long term effect on peer acceptance. Moreover, our results demonstrated that anxiety-withdrawal behavior was not related to peer likeability over time. In conclusion, the present dissertation suggests the importance of giving systematic attention to the study of teacher-child relationship and of children’s social behavior, beginning with the first years of kindergarten, through instruments widely used in international research. In addition, this present work demonstrated that children who showed close, warm interaction with teachers and cooperative play with peers, tended to be more accepted by other children, while aggressive or withdrawn children, tended to have negative relationships with teachers and to engage in disruptive play with peers. Children who are able to navigate the preschool environment effectively may benefit from these early social experiences as they enter primary school. Conversely, the transition to primary school may be more critical for anxious-withdrawn, or angry-aggressive children, who meet with difficulty in the preschool/kindergarten’s social arena...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to explore the potential socialization drop that might occur during students’ transition from class teaching (i. e. having mainly one teacher) to subject teaching (i. e. having many teachers). We had two competing assumptions: 1) that the socialization drop will affect both typically developed (TD) and so called special educational needs (SEN) students, and 2) that the drop will affect SEN students more. Using a transversal approach and <b>sociometric</b> method, we <b>tested</b> these assumptions on a sample of 685 (55 SEN) elementary school children from the Republic of Srpska, grades four through nine. The results clearly supported the second assumption. While sociometric social preference for TD children did not change through the grades, SEN children social preference dropped significantly in the transitional sixth grade, never again to recover to the fourth grade level, when {{there was no difference between}} SEN and TD children. This effect was only slightly affected by the peer discipline issues nominations.

40|$|One of {{the major}} tasks of the early {{childhood}} years is to learn positive and socially acceptable ways of interacting with others and much of this learning occurs {{within the context of}} the peer group. Positive peer interactions thus make a substantial contribution to children's social and emotional development and rejection from the peer group in childhood has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes including early school withdrawal, delinquency and mental health problems (Asher, Oden & Gottman, 1977; Kupersmidt, Coie & Dodge, 1990; Parker & Asher, 1987). The perceived power of peer rejection as a predictor variable for future maladjustment has led to increasing concern by researchers to identify the factors involved in the establishment and maintenance of negative peer status. In addition to such potential determinants as physical attributes, social cognition and communication patterns (Black & Hazen, 1990; Kurdek & Krile, 1982; Shaffer, 1988) behavioural characteristics appear to be strongly related to the development of peer social status. However, although initial behaviours serve to rapidly establish children's status within groups of previously unacquainted peers (Dodge, 1983), there is increasing evidence which suggests that, once status is established, behaviour change in itself may not be sufficient to improve social status (Mize & Ladd, 1990). The present study arises from the premise that children's reputation may have an influence on the ways in which their peers both perceive and respond to their behaviour. In other words, a prior reputation may serve to maintain a negative peer status even when behaviour is improved. The present study was therefore designed to examine the extent to which a preschool child's social status or reputation, once established, affects peer perception of his or her subsequent behaviour. Of additional interest were possible sex and status differences in social information-processing. Subjects were 62 children (35 boys and 27 girls) from three local Community Preschools. The children ranged in age from 4 years, 7 months to 6 years, 1 month of age. Prior to commencement of the main study socio-metric interviews were conducted consisting of a combination of limited choice positive nomination and a three point rating scale. Children were then assigned to one of five status groups: rejected, neglected, average, popular or controversial. Children unable to be classified were designated "other". In conjunction with socio-metric testing, teachers were asked to complete a twelve item Teacher Assessment of Social Behaviour Questionnaire (Cassidy & Asher, 1992). After completion of <b>sociometric</b> <b>testing</b> children took part in individual interviews in which they were presented with information regarding the liked or disliked status of a hypothetical same sex peer and reputational information in the form of social information pictures depicting the target child engaged in social interactions. From this information children made inferences about the hypothetical peer's general disposition by rating the likelihood that he or she would behave in either pro-social or antisocial ways. Children were then presented with two types of hypothetical situations, other involved and self involved. The other involved hypothetical event consisted of presentation of a picture showing the same sex target peer and another same sex child involved in a conflict situation. The self involved event consisted of a hypothetical situation involving the subject and the target child in which the intentions of the target peer were ambiguous but a negative outcome for the subject resulted. Children were asked their perceptions of the target peer's involvement in the hypothetical events along the dimensions of locus of control, intent and stability for the other involved event, and locus of control and intent for the self involved event. Presentation order of popular versus unpopular target peer and self involved versus other involved hypothetical events was counterbalanced across subjects. The results clearly demonstrated that preschool children's evaluations of the target peers varied as a function of the target child's reputation and the subject's gender. Overall, children made significant distinctions between popular and unpopular peers both when making dispositional evaluations of the target peer and situational attributions about the target child's involvement in the hypothetical events. In contrast to expectations, no status differences in social information-processing were found. Sex differences in the use of reputational information were evident both for dispositional inferences and situational attributions. Specifically, girls made greater distinctions between popular and unpopular peers than boys both when making inferences about the target child's disposition, and when making attributions of intent. Relative to boys, girls rated the popular peer as more friendly, more helpful and more liked and the unpopular peer as more likely to get angry, fight and hurt others. Girls also rated the unpopular peer as acting intentionally more often than boys and were less likely to ascribe intent to the popular peer. Sex differences were also observed for teacher ratings of aggression, disruption and sociability. Teachers rated boys more highly on the dimensions of aggression and disruption while girls were rated high on sociability. These dimensions were also significantly correlated with children's evaluations of the target peer. Specifically, boys rated as highly aggressive or disruptive were likely to make more negative evaluations of a popular peer on pro-social items whereas sociable children of both sexes made more positive evaluations of an unpopular peer's involvement in a self involved negative event. Overall, these results replicate previous research (Cirino & Beck, 1990; Dodge, 1980; Hymel, 1986; Waas & Honer, 1990), indicating that children vary their perceptions of and explanations for behaviour as a function of the liked or disliked status of the target peer. Additionally however, the present study extends previous research efforts by demonstrating that reputational bias interpretations of behaviour is present in a much younger age group than that previously studied. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for intervention programs and research into children's peer relations...|$|R
