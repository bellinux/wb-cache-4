5|$|In 1943, the {{formation}} of the Commando unit was changed. Each Commando now consisted of a small headquarters group, five fighting troops, a heavy weapons troop, and a signals platoon. The fighting troops consisted of 65 men of all ranks divided into two 30–man sections which were subdivided into three 10–man subsections. The heavy weapons troop was made up of 3-inch mortar and Vickers machine gun teams. The Commandos were provided with the motor transport needed to accompany them on operations. Their transport now consisted of the commanding officer's car, 15 motorcycles (six with <b>side</b> <b>cars),</b> ten 15 cwt trucks, and three 3-ton trucks. The heavy weapons troop had seven Jeeps and trailers and one Jeep for each of the fighting troops and the headquarters. This gave them enough vehicles of their own to accommodate two fighting troops, the heavy weapons troop, and the Commando Headquarters.|$|E

The front bumper was changed giving it a wide lower grille and the foglights were bulged out at the <b>side</b> (<b>cars</b> not equipped with foglights remained using the older ph2 bumper), the upper grille was changed and the headlights (which previously had black background) now had grey. The 15" [...] alloy wheels were changed and were now a 15" [...] version of the facelift 172 model on Dynamique and Extreme models. Clear side repeaters were added, as was a colourcoded rear spoiler (again on Dynamique spec cars). In the South American market, the facelifted Clio continued to use the dashboard of the 1998 model and was never updated, except for the Colombian 2008 model that included the same interior of the European version with little changes, and continued having the same exterior as the phase II model.|$|E

50|$|Russia {{worked on}} a system similar to the Bennie Railplane in the 1930s and were even {{planning}} a 332-mile line through Turkestan with {{a top speed of}} 180 mph. Their system was unique in that it had two side by <b>side</b> <b>cars</b> suspended on one rail, and it could actually dismount from the rail to cross rivers as an amphibian and then on the other side remount the rail. And while elements of this system were tested in Moscow, the Russian government instead built a conventional rail system.|$|E

However, due to safety reasons, the <b>side</b> <b>cars</b> {{and most of the}} older units had to continue to operate {{on the basis of their}} manually operated doors.
