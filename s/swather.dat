25|$|When alfalfa {{is to be}} used as hay, it {{is usually}} cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the {{subsequent}} cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a <b>swather</b> cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster. After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.|$|E

50|$|A <b>swather</b> may be {{self-propelled}} via {{an internal}} combustion engine, {{or may be}} drawn by a tractor and powered through a power take-off shaft. A <b>swather</b> uses a sickle bar (see mower) to cut the stems of the crop. A reel helps the cut crop fall neatly onto a canvas or auger conveyor which moves it and deposits it into a windrow, with all stems oriented in the same direction. As combines replaced threshing machines, the <b>swather</b> was needed to replace the binder. The mown strip left behind is the swathe.|$|E

50|$|A smaller mower {{used for}} lawns and sports grounds (playing fields) {{is called a}} lawn mower or grounds mower, which is often self-powered, or may also be small enough to be pushed by the operator. Grounds mowers have reel or rotary cutters. Larger mowers or mower-conditioners are mainly used to cut grass (or other crops) for hay or silage and often place the cut {{material}} into rows, which {{are referred to as}} windrows. <b>Swathers</b> (or windrowers) are also used to cut grass (and grain crops). Prior to the invention and adoption of mechanized mowers, (and today in places where use a mower is impractical or uneconomical), grass and grain crops were cut by hand using scythes or sickles.|$|R
50|$|Conditioning of hay {{has become}} popular. The basic {{idea is that}} it {{decreases}} drying time, particularly in humid climates or if rain interferes with haying. Usually, a salt solution is sprayed {{over the top of}} the hay (generally alfalfa) that helps to dry the hay. Conditioning can also refer to the rollers inside a <b>swather</b> that crimps the alfalfa to help squeeze out the moisture.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{mechanized}} hay production {{today is}} usually {{performed by a}} number of machines. While small operations use a tractor to pull various implements for mowing and raking, larger operations use specialized machines such as a mower or a <b>swather,</b> which are designed to cut the hay and arrange it into a windrow in one step. Balers are usually pulled by a tractor, with larger balers requiring more powerful tractors.|$|E
50|$|With the {{replacement}} of the threshing machine by the combine harvester, the binder became almost obsolete. Some grain crops such as oats are now cut and formed into windrows with a <b>swather.</b> With other grain crops such as wheat, the grain is now mostly cut and threshed by a combine in a single operation, while the binder is still in use at small fields or outskirts of mountain areas.|$|E
5000|$|Later, as {{hydraulic}} technology improved, hydrostatic transmissions {{were introduced}} by Versatile Mfg {{for use on}} <b>swathers</b> but later this technology was applied to combines as well. This drive retained the 4 speed manual transmission as before, but this time used a system of hydraulic pumps and motors to drive the input shaft of the transmission. This system is called a Hydrostatic drive system. The engine turns the hydraulic pump capable of pressures up to [...] This pressure is then directed to the hydraulic motor that {{is connected to the}} input shaft of the transmission. The operator is provided with a lever in the cab that allows for the control of the hydraulic motor's ability to use the energy provided by the pump. By adjusting the swash plate in the motor, the stroke of its pistons are changed. If the swash plate is set to neutral, the pistons do not move in their bores and no rotation is allowed, thus the machine does not move. By moving the lever, the swash plate moves its attached pistons forward, thus allowing them to move within the bore and causing the motor to turn. This provides an infinitely variable speed control from 0 ground speed to what ever the maximum speed is allowed by the gear selection of the transmission. The standard clutch was removed from this drive system as it was no longer needed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to towing an implement or supplying tractive power through the wheels, most tractors have {{a means to}} transfer power to another machine such as a baler, <b>swather,</b> or mower. Unless it functions solely by pulling it through or over the ground, a towed implement needs its own power source (such as a baler or combine with a separate engine) or else a means of transmitting power from the tractor to the mechanical operations of the equipment.|$|E
5000|$|A windrow is {{a row of}} cut (mown) hay {{or small}} grain crop. It is allowed to dry before being baled, combined, or rolled. For hay, the windrow is often formed by a hay rake, which rakes hay that has been cut by a mowing machine or by scythe into a row, or it may {{naturally}} form as the hay is mown. For small grain crops which are to be harvested, the windrow is formed by a <b>swather</b> which both cuts the crop and forms the windrow.|$|E

5000|$|A bagging hook, badging hook, fagging hook, reap hook or rip hook, {{is a large}} sickle {{usually with}} an offset handle so that the user's {{knuckles}} do not {{make contact with the}} ground. The Oxford dictionary gives the definition of the word to bag, or badge, as the cutting of grain by hand.The blade is heavier than that of a normal sickle and always without serrated blades. It is usually about 1.5" [...] (40 mm) wide with an open crescent shaped blade approx 18" [...] (450mm) across. It developed from the sickle in most parts of Britain during the mid to late 19th century, and was in turn replaced by the scythe, later by the reaping machine and subsequently the <b>swather.</b> It was still used when the corn was bent over or flattened and the mechanical reaper was unable to cut without causing the grain to fall from the ears and wasting the crop.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, Warrensberg, MO {{resident}} Max Swisher {{invented the}} very first commercially available zero-turn mower and called it the [...] "Ride King". It was a three-wheeled machine - one wheel in front and two in the rear. The patented system utilized the front wheel as the drive wheel that also was able to turn an amazing 360 degrees. The wheel was driven by the motor {{in the same direction}} 100% of the time. In order to reverse and/or utilize the zero turn capabilities, you simply turned the steering wheel 180 degrees and the mower would reverse course. In 1963, John Regier was an employee of the Hesston Corporation, a manufacturer of farm and agricultural equipment. The company had recently engineered a device called the <b>swather,</b> which, propelled by a series of belts, cut hay, alfalfa and other farming materials and laid them out in windrows. The way the belts and pulleys operated allowed for counter- rotation—a process which particularly struck Regier. An idea came to him one day: What if he could incorporate the same technology into lawnmowers? ...|$|E
50|$|Hay can be raked into rows {{as it is}} cut, {{then turned}} {{periodically}} to dry, particularly if a modern <b>swather</b> is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread {{out in the field}} until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a hay rake or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a hay conditioner, or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an on-off control system which can be used for automatic height-of-cut adjustment on both swathers and combines. The system was designed to be compatible with the hydraulic and electrical systems already present on most grain harvesting machinery. It can be pre-set by the operator, so that cutter bar movement varies between any desired maximum and minimum positions. A separate investigation was conducted to determine some of the physical properties of grain plants. The results of this investigation were applied to the design of the sensing elements in the control system. The performance of the system was determined in the laboratory by mounting grain plants of different heights in a narrow strip around the circumference of a large rotating table. The results obtained from the laboratory study showed that the operation of this system was satisfactory for all practical combinations of ground speed, grain height and density of plant population. A more complete system was then constructed and mounted on a pull-type <b>swather.</b> Field tests showed that this automatic control system performed satisfactorily and could have a number of practical applications...|$|E
