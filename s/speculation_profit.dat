25|$|Initially, the British South Africa Company claimed {{mineral rights}} in both Northern and Southern Rhodesia. During {{the period of}} its Charter, the BSAC was not {{involved}} in mining directly, but received mineral royalties and held shares in mining companies. Often the main source of income of these companies was not in mining itself but in speculation markets. In Moshanaland, complaints arose at the delay of development of mines in order to fuel <b>speculation</b> <b>profits</b> further.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>profits</b> and <b>speculation</b> in the USD/EUR trading {{of a bank}} in Germany over a four-month period. Dealing activity at the bank generates <b>profits</b> but <b>speculation</b> {{does not seem to}} contribute to this. We find that speculative positions fail to become profitable within a 30 -minutes' horizon. Also, the suggestion that exchange rate volatility would foster speculative profits cannot be confirmed. To explain daily revenues, neither the bank's speculative trading volume nor its inventory position, but only customer trading emerges as a significant determinant. Furthermore, a spread analysis reveals that there is hardly any room for revenues from speculation. foreign exchange markets, <b>speculation,</b> <b>profits,</b> market microstructure, flow analysis...|$|R

The “purely ” economic interests of real and finance capital stay in direct conflict with one another. High profitability of real investments call for low interest rates and exchange rates, and for stable financial markets, by contrast, financial <b>speculation</b> <b>profits</b> from exactly the opposite conditions. Even though the interests of real capital and labour are different as regards the distribution of income, both factors have a common interest in generating a high overall income and, hence, in a strong and stable production growth. One cannot identify “classes ” of “real capitalists ” and “finance capitalists ” in modern society: Non-financial corporations as well as employees own financial assets and have therefore also finance capital interests. It depends on the framework conditions of the system if striving fo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. What Wells {{summarized}} {{in the first}} quote above was Eurocentric capitalism. It has now become the principal source of instability and inequality in the world. <b>Speculation,</b> not <b>profit,</b> is its driver; profit has taken a back-seat. Capital market, the arena for speculation, is disconnected from the real economy, particularly the labor market which rewards less and less the workers and producers. Rewards, as private wealth are increasingly in speculative capital gains which accrue to the top 1 % elite, made up of stock market players and financial institutions, while the rest [workers, middle class and those in lower segments of the socio-economic pyramid] fall behind.

40|$|The Community Land Trust {{is based}} on a {{property}} formula which prevents <b>speculation.</b> Once <b>profit</b> is eliminated as a possible outcome, the values of use thus emerging reveal new needs and forms of living generated by the contemporary society, in tension between the crisis of the welfare and the bio-cultural changes in course. These values are accordingly manifested in the spatial organization of the projects and embedded {{in the way in which}} private, public and common property are articulated. It can be argued that the characteristics of this model, as a whole, valorize ownership and a form of no-profit capital with the main purpose of social mobility. A critical understanding of this apparent paradox should thus be addressed, particularly at the light of the current debates on the "return of the capital" (Piketty) and in consideration of the urgency to address the needs and aspirations of le plus grand nombre in order to activate a more just redistributive system...|$|R
25|$|At stake, beyond {{commercial}} <b>speculation</b> {{and financial}} <b>profit,</b> were {{the questions of}} when Cubism began, who {{led the way in}} its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent {{role in the development of}} this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{it would}} do to put his boats in the water, or at {{daylight}} next morning, Captain Daggett came alongside of his consort. He was received with a seaman's welcome, and his offers of services were accepted, just as frankly, as under reversed circumstances, {{they would have been}} made. In all this there was a strange and characteristic admixture of neighbourly and Christian kindness, blended with a keen regard of the main chance. If the former duties are rarely neglected by the descendants of the Puritans, it may be said, with equal truth, that the latter are never lost sight of. <b>Speculation,</b> and <b>profit,</b> are regarded as so many integral portions of the duty of man; and, as our kinsmen of Old England have set up an idol to worship, in the form of aristocracy, so do our kinsmen of New England pay homage to the golden calf. In point of fact, Daggett had a double motive in now offering his services to Gardiner; the one being the discharge of his moral obligations, and the other a desire to remain near the Sea Lion of Oyster Pond, lest she should visit the key, of which he had some very interesting memorandums, without having enough to find the place unless led there by those who were better informed on the subject of its precise locality than he was himself.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the rapidly-increasing usage of the Internet, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any company that had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a [...] ".com" [...] suffix in its name, leading to a stock market bubble. During the bubble, the valuations of {{companies}} in the quaternary sector of the economy increased rapidly. Venture capitalists, eager to profit on this investment demand, moved to raise and invest capital faster and with less caution than usual. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices, market confidence that the companies would turn future <b>profits,</b> <b>speculation</b> in stocks by individuals, and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the price–earnings ratio, in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements. The low interest rates of 1998–99 helped increase the availability of funding. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax in the United States, is also cited as a reason that people were willing to make more speculative investments.|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{uses the}} term financialization to {{describe}} how the U.S. economy has been radically restructured from a focus on production, manufacturing and wages, to a focus on <b>speculation,</b> debt, and <b>profits.</b> Since the 1980s, Phillips argues in American Theocracy,the underlying Washington strategy… was less to give ordinary Americans direct sums than to create a low-interest-rate boom in real estate, thereby raising the percentage of American home ownership, ballooning the prices of homes, and allowing householders to take out some of that increase through low-cost refinancing. This triple play created new wealth {{to take the place}} of that destroyed in the 2000-2002 stock-market crash and simultaneously raised consumer confidence.Nothing similar had ever been engineered before. Instead of a recovery orchestrated by Congress and the White House and aimed at the middle- and bottom-income segments, this one was directed by an appointed central banker, a man whose principal responsibility was to the bankingsystem. His relief, targeted on financial assets and real estate, was principally achieved by monetary stimulus. This in itself confirmed the massive realignment of preferences and priorities within the American system….Likewise, huge and indisputable but almost never discussed, were the powerful political economics lurking behind the stimulus: the massive rate-cut-driven post-2000 bailout of the FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) sector, with its ever-climbing share of GDP and proximity to power. No longer would Washington concentrate stimulus on wages or public-works employment. The Feds policies, however shrewd, were not rooted in an abstraction of the national interest but in pursuit of its statutory mandate to protect the U.S. banking and payments system, now inseparable from the broadly defined financial-services sector.|$|R
