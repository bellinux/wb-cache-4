25|$|The tanker and {{container}} variants {{would follow}} the same design as standard military nuclear submarines, with the tanker variant carrying almost 30,000 tons of petroleum, to be loaded and discharged from surface or underwater terminals. The container carrier was to transport 912 <b>standard</b> (20-foot) <b>freight</b> <b>containers,</b> loaded within 30 hours through hatches, assisted by internal conveyance systems. However, these plans came to nothing in the hard financial straits following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|The Ahrens AR 404 was a {{prototype}} American civil transport aircraft first flown in 1976, a high-wing monoplane powered by four turboprop engines. In {{order to facilitate}} the loading and unloading of cargo, the fuselage was of constant rectangular section along almost its entire length, the main undercarriage was retracted into sponsons on the fuselage sides, and the tail included a loading ramp. As a regional airliner, the AR 404 was designed to carry 30 passengers, or in its cargo configuration, to accommodate four <b>standard</b> D3 <b>freight</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Textainer Group Holdings Limited is {{a holding}} company {{that focuses on}} purchasing, leasing, and resale of marine cargo containers. The company {{was set up in}} 1979 and is based in Hamilton, Bermuda. There are three {{business}} segments: Container Ownership, Container Management, and Container Resale. As of January 22, 2014, the company was the lessor of about two million intermodal containers. The company leases containers to more than 400 shipping lines and other lessees. In October 2012, it acquired about 81,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of dry <b>freight</b> <b>containers</b> from managed fleet. In December 2012, the company acquired a 50.1% interest in TAP Funding Ltd. In January 2013, the company acquired about 24,000 twenty-foot equivalent units of <b>standard</b> dry <b>freight</b> <b>containers</b> from its managed fleet. The company owns two subsidiaries, Textainer Equipment Management Limited (TEML) and Textainer Limited (TL).

40|$|The first mobile {{terawatt}} laser laboratory worldwide {{has been}} built in the framework of the German-French project "Teramobile". A femtosecond laser system that delivers several TW pulse power is integrated in a <b>standard</b> <b>freight</b> <b>container</b> together with detection optics and electronics for atmospheric measurements. The aim of the project is the development of novel methods for the remote detection of atmosphere-relevant substances and parameters by the use of nonlinear optics. This work describes the status of the investigation of both, the fundamental phenomena of long-range propagation of TW pulses in air (filamentation, white-light creation etc.), as well as the possible applications (e. g. white-light lidar). It contains information about the concept, construction and properties of the mobile laboratory, as well as detailed descriptions of a series of field campaigns (e. g. at an astronomical observatory and inside a high-voltage hall) and accompanying indoor experiments. The analysis of the experimental results is presented in Chapters 3 and 4 in combination with the theoretical background and a detailed review of the literature. Among the main results presented in this work there is the evidence for filamentation (nonlinear interaction between the laser pulses and air) in an altitude of as much as 2 km. Moreover, it is shown by the example of the simultaneous detection of temperature (from oxygen absorption) and humidity (water vapor absorption) that TW laser facilitate multicomponent lidar. Finally, for the first time megavolt discharges could be triggered and guided by laser filaments...|$|R
50|$|In December 1968, the French and British partner {{companies}} (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) {{proposed a}} revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. It had been {{feared that the}} original 300-seat proposal was too large for the market, thus it had been scaled down to produce the A250. The dimensional changes involved in the shrink reduced {{the length of the}} fuselage by 5.62 meters and the diameter by 0.8 meters, reducing the overall weight by 25 tonnes. For increased flexibility, the cabin floor was raised so that <b>standard</b> LD3 <b>freight</b> <b>containers</b> could be accommodated side-by-side, allowing more cargo to be carried. Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft. It was later renamed the A300B.|$|R

The company {{has more than}} 400 leasing customers and more than 1,100 container sales customers.In January 2014, Textainer Group Holdings Limited completed the acquisition of about 30,000 TEU of <b>standard</b> dry <b>freight</b> <b>containers</b> from its managed fleet ($35 million), which increased the percentage of Textainer’s owned fleet to 77%.In December, 2013, the company announced their fleet surpassed 3 million TEU, which represented a major milestone for the company {{as well as the}} industry.In December, 2012, Textainer acquired a 50.1% interest in TAP Funding Ltd. for about $78 million, with many types of <b>container</b> (dry <b>freight,</b> refrigerated).In May 2011, Textainer acquired about 171,000 TEU of containers and related lease rights and working capital ($174 million) that it has been managing for Buss Global since 2006.In October 2009, Textainer acquired 31,000 containers (53,000 TEU) of Amphibious Container Leasing Limited (Amficon), mostly speciality containers.|$|R
