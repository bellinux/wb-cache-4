40|$|For {{crosstalk}} noise calculation, computing switching windows of a net helps us identify noise sources accurately. Traditional approaches use a single continuous switching window for a net. Under this model, <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> {{is assumed to}} happen any time within the window. Although conservative and sound, this model can result in too much pessimism since in reality the exact timing of <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> is determined by a path delay up to the net, i. e. the underlying circuit structure does not always allow <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> at arbitrary time within the continuous switching window. To address this inherent inaccuracy of the continuous switching window, we propose a refinement of the traditional approaches, where <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> {{is characterized by a}} set of discontinuous switching windows instead of a single continuous window. Each continuous switching window is divided into multiple windows, called time slots, and the <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> activity of each slot is analyzed separately to calculate the maximum noise with more accuracy. By controlling the size of a time slot we can trade off accuracy and runtime, which makes this approach highly scalable. We have confirmed by experiments on industrial circuits that up to 90 % of the noise violations detected by the traditional approach can be unreal. 1...|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for the <b>signal</b> <b>switch,</b> a simulcast of WCIV was added to WMMP's second digital subchannel, along with MeTV on 36.3, replacing ZUUS Country on that channel. The two stations then swapped licenses; WCIV's call sign {{was moved to the}} WMMP license and virtual channel 36, while WMMP's call sign and virtual channel 4 was moved to the WCIV license which will be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings. Following the swap, ZUUS Country was moved to WMMP 4.1 as interim programming during the transition to Howard Stirk Holdings ownership.|$|E
50|$|The gmaps show {{pairs of}} predicates or {{entities}} that match. For example, in gmap No. 1, the entities torque and signal match and the behaviors transmit torque inputgear secondgear and transmit <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> div10 match. Gmap No. 1 represents combining p1 and p2. Gmap No. 2 represents combining p1 and p6. Although p2 {{is compatible with}} both p1 and p6, the one-to-one mapping constraint enforces that both mappings cannot {{be in the same}} gmap. Therefore, SME produces two independent gmaps. In addition, combining the two gmaps together would make the entity mappings between thirdgear and div10 conflict with the entity mapping between secondgear and div10.|$|E
5000|$|An {{optical switch}} is a {{component}} {{with two or}} more ports that selectively transmits, redirects, or blocks an optical signal in a transmission medium. According to Telcordia GR-1073, an optical switch must be actuated to select or change between states. The actuating signal (also {{referred to as the}} control signal) is usually electrical, but in principle, could be optical or mechanical. (The control signal format may be Boolean and may be a separate signal; or, in the case of optical actuation, the control signal may be encoded in the input data <b>signal.</b> <b>Switch</b> performance is generally intended to be independent of wavelength within the component passband.) ...|$|E

While he still could move, Bushmaster had his agents capture Noah Burnstein's wife Emma to force Noah to reverse the process. His agents also captured Power Man and brought him to Seagate {{to be used as}} a guinea pig. Virtually immobile, Bushmaster watched as Noah Burnstein began the process. When Iron Fist arrived and shattered the tank to rescue Power Man, Bushmaster reached for a <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> to order his men to kill Emma Burnstein, but as he did, his transformation accelerated and left him in an immobile inert steel form less than an inch from the switch. His body then began to crumble leaving only a metal skeleton.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, several sets {{of warning}} tones {{have been used}} which varied over time, by {{government}} structure, and by manufacturer. The initial alerts used during World War II were the Alert Signal (a 3-5 minute steady continuous siren tone), and the Attack Signal (a 3-5 minute wail siren tone, or series of short tone bursts on devices incapable of wavering, such as whistles). The Victory Siren manual stated that when manual generation of the warbling tone was required, it could be achieved by holding the <b>Signal</b> <b>switch</b> on for 8 seconds and off for 4 seconds. In 1950, the Federal Civil Defense Administration revised the signals, naming the alert signal [...] "red alert" [...] and adding an [...] "all-clear" [...] signal, defined as three one-minute steady blasts, with two minutes of silence between blasts.|$|E

40|$|The Helicobacter pylori protein CagA may undergo {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation following its entry into human gastric epithelial cells with downstream effects on signal transduction. Disruption of the gp 130 receptor that modulates {{the balance of}} the SHP 2 /ERK and JAK/STAT pathways enhanced peptic ulceration and gastric cancer in gp 130 knock-out mice. In this study, we evaluated the effect of translocated CagA in relation to its {{tyrosine phosphorylation}} status on the gp 130 -mediated <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> between the SHP 2 /ERK and JAK/STAT 3 pathways. We showed that in the presence of CagA, SHP 2 was recruited to gp 130. Phosphorylated CagA showed enhanced SHP 2 binding activity and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation, whereas unphosphorylated CagA showed preferential STAT 3 activation. These findings indicate that the phosphorylation status of CagA affects the <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> between the SHP 2 /ERK and JAK/STAT 3 pathways through gp 130, providing a novel mechanism to explain H. pylori signaling...|$|E

40|$|A {{single-pass}} beam position monitor (SPBPM) {{was developed}} for measuring of the injection beam orbit of the KEK B-factory (KEKB), and 21 sets have already been installed. We adopted log-ratio processing using a logarithmic (log) amplifier for the SPBPM of KEKB. The measurement circuit consists of four log-amplifiers, four peak-hold circuits, four analog-digital converters (ADC), a memory circuit and a timing control circuit. Moreover, it coexists with the existing beam position monitor (BPM) system for a closed-orbit distortion (COD) measurement. In order to choose the BPM signal of the low energy ring (LER) and the high energy ring (HER) of KEKB, an RF <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> circuit was also manufactured. These circuits were controlled by the same VXI standard as the existing BPM system. This report summarizes the SPBPM system and its performance...|$|E
40|$|Control {{techniques}} for {{high power factor}} rectifiers which do not need input voltage sensing are gaining considerable attention due to their simpler implementation and inherently superior stability, as compared to conventional average or peak current mode control. Among these, the solutions based on integration of a current <b>signal</b> (<b>switch,</b> diode or inductor current) provide an inherent noise immunity, which makes them further appealing. This paper proposes a simple implementation of one of such control {{techniques for}} high power factor flyback, Cuk or Sepic rectifiers, which, while still retaining a high power factor, further reduces the control complexity, thus making the solution very attractive for smart-power integration. A 200 W flyback rectifier with the proposed control technique was implemented and tested. The achieved results are in good agreement with the expected performance...|$|E
40|$|Crack {{detection}} through piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) [1] {{is emerging}} as an effective and powerful technique in structural health monitoring (SHM). Because of the piezoelectric properties of the PWAS, they act as both transmitters and receivers of guided Lamb waves for such applications. With arrays of PWAS attached to the structure, excitation signals are sent {{to one of the}} PWAS and wave signals from the structure are received at all the PWAS. The signals are analyzed to detect the position of cracks. One important issue associated with the PWAS-assisted SHM is the connectivity between the PWAS arrays and the measurement instruments. An automatic <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> is necessary to send the excitation signals to PWAS and acquire the response signal from another PWAS. Such a program-controlled switch ca...|$|E

40|$|Two {{circuits}} were designed, built, {{and tested}} {{for the purpose of}} aiding in the transfer of 87 Rb atoms from a MOT to dipole traps and for characterizing the final dipole traps.

40|$|The human {{papillomavirus}} type 16 (HPV 16) life cycle {{can be divided}} into an early stage in which the HPV 16 genomic DNA is replicated, and a late stage in which the HPV 16 structural proteins are synthesized and virions are produced. A strong coupling between the viral life cycle and the differentiation state of the infected cell is highly characteristic of all HPVs. The switch from the HPV 16 early gene expression program to the late requires a promoter switch, a polyadenylation <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> and a shift in alternative splicing. A number of cis-acting RNA elements on the HPV 16 mRNAs and cellular and viral factors interacting with these elements are involved in the control of HPV 16 gene expression.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{proximity}} hybridization-triggered <b>signal</b> <b>switch</b> {{was presented}} for convenient homogeneous chem-iluminescent detection {{of a wide}} range of affinity target biomolecules, such as oligonucleotides, protein biomarkers, and aptamer-recognized targets. The presence of the target promoted the formation of a proximate complex via the proximity hybridization of two help DNA strands or the DNA strands labeled to affinity ligands, which subsequently unfolded the self-reporting molecular beacon to switch on the chemiluminescence signal. The response could be further amplified with an in situ enzymatic recycling strategy for highly sensitive chemiluminescence detection. By using an antibody as the affinity ligand, this simple protocol could sensitively detect protein biomarker in a concentration range of 6 orders of magnitude with a detection limit down to 80 fM. With the use of an aptamer as the affinity ligand, a method for homogeneous chemiluminescent detection of thrombin was proposed. The one-step and wash-free assay showed good selectivity and require...|$|E
