This attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans, and caused interest in the show to skyrocket. The BBC released a statement that the source of the leak appears to be connected to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which responded by stating that they [...] "are looking into it. That's all I can <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> because we don't know exactly what happened. It certainly wasn't done intentionally." [...] Asa Bailey, founder of the Viral Advertising Association, said that the BBC hired them for viral marketing strategies, and that he told them [...] "they should release things before their time", to create a [...] "cool factor". Both the BBC and CBC denied any involvement, but Bailey believes that to be disingenuous, saying that it is [...] "the best viral advert they could have done". The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company.|$|E

5000|$|In Britain and Ireland his {{reputation}} increased. Sir Henry Wood {{described him as}} [...] "the greatest Elijah". He formed his own concert parties and toured all over the British Isles.

He had singers, pipers, harpists and dancers and 'songs of love and war, keenes and lullabies.' He did operatic arias as well as Irish songs. He made sure to include items from both traditions. He organised one such concert in Athlone. He engaged a young John McCormack for the trip. He put McCormack {{in the care of}} Lily Foley who went on to become Mrs John McCormack.

After just nine months under Vlasov's leadership, after an inspection by Semyon Timoshenko, the division was {{recognized as one of}} the best divisions in the Army in 1940. Timoshenko presented Vlasov with an inscribed gold watch, as he 'found the 99th the best of all.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} two sociotechnical {{systems that}} are centered around two very different kinds of technological artifacts: bridges and disposable diapers. I use these examples to explore a topic {{which has been a}} long-standing interest of mine, which is how to reconcile a social constructivist view of technological innovation with ideas about technological determinism. Partisans of both these perspectives often paint them as mutually exclusive, but I have the sense that this is really not the case. This has in part been influenced by my experience as a sociologist, working with engineers and designers who seem to experience technology more in terms of the constraints it imposes than as an infinitely flexible creative medium. I think the comparison I present here is very suggestive about some of the constraints that may frequently limit the direction of technological change. I should <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> I don’t regard what I’m about to say as an airtight argument, but rather a somewhat provisional attempt to work through some of the ideas this comparison brings up – so I welcome any input.

40|$|In {{previous}} reports (Elberg and Herzberg, 1953; Herzberg and Elberg, 1953) {{the isolation}} {{and characteristics of}} a streptomycin-dependent mutant of Brucella melitenis were described. 2 The streptomycin-dependent strain retained the biochemical and antigenic characteristics of the virulent parent strain but differed in a require-ment for streptomycin for its growth. Growth in vivo was not influenced detectably by in vivo administration of streptomycin. The following studies describe the capabilities of this strain for inducing protection of mice and guinea pigs against experimental infection with virulent B. melitensis. MATERIALS AND METHODS These were described in considerable detail in the first paper of the series (Herzberg and Elberg, 1953) and need not be restated here.

40|$|In {{the film}} Groundhog Day, the {{character}} of Phil Connors is forced to relive the same day, February 2, over and over again. The choices that he makes while trapped in this time warp clearly depict the moral choices reflected in Plato's tripartite division of the soul. In the beginning of Phil's journey, his concerns are purely appetitive; however, {{by the end of}} his journey, he has reached the upper level that is philosophical. Plato wrote in the Republic that the human soul is divided into three sections; the section to which a man subscribed the majority of his time and his attention determined what type of a man he was. Plato believed "the three classes of men included the philosophic, the ambitious, and finally, the lover of gain " (40). This concept became known as Plato's tripartite division of the soul (40). In his article entitled "Plato and the Tripartite Soul, " J. L. Stocks says Plato's belief was that "the wisest are not really wise but only seekers after wisdom 1. " Whether or not this is true, when the story begins, Phil is not seeking any type of wisdom. In the Republic, Plato writes that the "most powerful characteristic [is] 'appetite, ' because of the intensity of all the appetites with eating and drinking and sex and so on " (40). Early in the movie, Phil Connors, not only by his actions but also by the way that people react to him, emerges as an egotistical, self-righteous man whose sole focus in life is himself. He is thus engrossed in the fulfillment of his various sensual appetites. As Plato would <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Phil seems to have never "looked into the upper...|$|E

By this time, Codd was familiar with, and moving in, circles of the SD involving SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny.
