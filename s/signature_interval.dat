40|$|Dendrochronological {{investigations}} {{were made}} in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) from Lovrenc, Pohorje, in the NE Slovenia. Tree ring analyses {{were made in}} discs of 25 healthy, adult, dominant or co-dominant silver firs and in cores from roof construction of two older rustic buildings from the same region using a LINTAB measuring device nad a TSAP/X of F. Rinn. We constructed the chronology of trees spanning the period of 1785 - 1996. The chronology of the old house is spanning the period of 1713 - 1852 and the chronology of barn 1745 - 1887. It was shown that the last considerable reconstruction of the house roof took place {{after the end of}} the growing period of 1952. The dating of the cores containining the outer ring 1887 confirmed the dating based on the carved inscription " 1888 ". The three chronologies were joined into 284 years long silver fir chronology for Pohorje spanning the period of 1713 - 1996. It was compared with the Slovene silver fir chronology of the Dinaric region. Despite distance and great differences between the two regions there was shown a statistically confirmed similarity of two chronologies with tBP= 9. 8, GLK= 71 % and CDI= 398. The chronologies have 21 common negative, 21 positive signature years and one common <b>signature</b> <b>interval.</b> Based on this the constructed chronology may be considered as representative for the whole Pohorje. The two chronologies are expected to be a good base to construct a regional Slovene Silver-fir chronology for dating in whole Slovenia. Two Slovene chronologies were compared with the following European silver fir chronologies: South German, stand 1993 (Becker and Siebenlist 1970 Spurk and Friedrich, pers. com.), Bavarian Forest - Germany (Eckstein, Sass 1988), Abetone - Italy (Schweingruber, ITRDB), Bannwald - Switzerland (Schweingruber, ITRDB). Both Slovene chronologies proved to be statistically similar with the two German and the Italian silver fir chronology, but showed no similarity with the Swiss one. The Pohorje chronology correlates better with both German ones and the Dinaric chronology correlates better with the Italian one. Dendrochronological investigations were made in the the silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) from Lovrenc, Pohorje, Slovenia. Tree-ring analyses were made in discs of 25 healthy, adult, dominant or codominant silver firs and in cores from the roof construction of two older rustic buildings from the same region. Based on chronologies of trees and buildings covering the periods 1785 - 1996 and 1713 - 1887, was constructed a 284 years long silver fir chronology for Pohorje. It showed a statistically significant similarity with the Slovene Dinaric silver fir chronology, despite distances between the two regions and great difference in phytogeographical conditions. Both chronologies are expected to be a good base to construct a regional Slovene silver fir chronology for dating fir from the period 1712 - 1996 in whole of Slovenia...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere is often highly unsteady. Bursts of magnetic reconnection at multiple locations on the dayside equatorial magnetopause generate flux transfer events or FTEs: twisted ropes of interconnected magnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic field lines. Once formed, the events move antisunward, displacing and perturbing the ambient media. This talk explores the perturbations predicted by both global numerical simulations and analytical models. Results from global hybrid code simulation confirm the predictions of analytical models indicating that the events generate standing forward slow mode waves as their speeds relative to the magnetosheath flow approach the Alfven velocity. Geometric considerations lead {{to the conclusion that}} events generated by component reconnection on the dayside magnetopause move poleward and exhibit strong <b>signatures</b> during <b>intervals</b> of southward IMF orientation, but move towards the flanks and exhibit weak <b>signatures</b> during <b>intervals</b> of northward IMF orientation. Changing event orientations and magnetosheath/magnetospheric magnetic field orientation can enhance the amplitudes of events reaching the flanks. Although the orientations of events on the flanks inferred from multispacecraft timing techniques are consistent with the predictions of the component reconnection model, occurrence patterns versus latitude and IMF orientation require an explanation in terms of both the component and antiparallel reconnection models...|$|R

Global features of on-line signatures are used to form an interval valued feature vector for representing signatures. A method of signature verification based on symbolic representation is proposed. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed representation scheme for signature verification on a large MCYT signature database. Unlike other signature verification methods, the proposed method is simple and efficient. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate {{the ability of the}} proposed scheme in discriminating the genuine signatures from the forgeries...|$|R

30|$|To {{examine this}} persistence, we divide the data {{collection}} periods of the two sets into two intervals of 3.5 and 9 months for sets DS 1 and DS 2, respectively. We then calculate the weighted egocentric networks for each ego in each interval. As explained in detail above, we use the number of one-hour time bins with calls, texts, or either for determining the link weights between the ego and alters. We compute the social signatures for each egocentric network and each interval by ranking alters according to their weight and calculating the fraction of weight at each rank. Following (Saramäki et al. 2014), we then calculate self-distances by computing the JSD between an ego’s own <b>signatures</b> in consecutive <b>intervals.</b> We also calculate reference distances by computing the average JSD between the signature of the ego and those of all other egos. We repeat these calculations for both channels (calls and texts) as well as mixed networks (calls and texts).|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} Pc 1 magnetic pulsations at synchronous orbit are examined {{by using measurements}} obtained with the UCLA flux-gate magnetometer on board ATS 1. In 1967, 121 intervals of Pc 1 activity occurred. These events typically had amplitudes of 1 - 7 gamma and periods of 2 - 5 sec. Most events lasted less than 30 min and occurred in the afternoon sector. Pc 1 waves were more probable during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, within 1 hour of a substorm expansion. While {{they do not have}} the <b>signature</b> of IPDP (<b>intervals</b> of pulsations of diminishing periods) events at ATS, simultaneous ground records show the occurrence of rising frequency tones characteristic of IPDP events in seven out of ten cases. The wave frequency ranged principally from 0. 1 to 0. 2 of the local proton gyrofrequency, similar to observations of electron cyclotron waves. The observed Pc 1 activity is consistent with the generation by cyclotron resonance of 30 -keV protons in a 30 /cu cm plasma...|$|R
40|$|Neogene biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic {{data are}} {{compiled}} from Holes 747 A, 748 B, and 751 A drilled on the Southern Kerguelen Plateau during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 120. Neogene sections have excellent to good magnetostratigraphic <b>signatures</b> in many <b>intervals.</b> This, {{in addition to}} minimal coring gaps and the occurrence of mixed assemblages of both calcareous and siliceous microfossil assemblages, makes these valuable biostratigraphic reference sections for intra- and extraregional correlations. This paper combines the sequence of biostratigraphic events reported from diatom, radiolarian, planktonic foraminifer, calcareous nannofossil, and silicoflagellate studies of Leg 120 sediments. It correlates microfossil datums with the geomagnetic polarity time scale to test existing age estimates and to refine biostratigraphic age controls for the southern high latitudes. Significant biostratigraphic datums are presented {{in a series of}} age-depth plots. Numerous hiatuses are clearly identified through this approach, and the positions of lesser disconformities are suggested. Most Neogene intervals are represented in at least one site, although "regional" unconformities occur in the upper Pliocene, uppermost Miocene/lowermost Pliocene, middle upper Miocene, middle middle Miocene, and at the lower/middle Miocene boundaries. The longest hiatus spanned 6 m. y., with most other hiatuses representing 1 m. y. or less. This paper compiles Leg 120 biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data for use in future syntheses of southern high latitude biostratigraphy and presents an age model for Leg 120 Neogene sediments...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP 8) {{magnetometer}} data for plasmoid <b>signatures</b> during magnetospheric <b>intervals</b> from 1981 through 1983 found 16 plasmoids and 37 traveling compression regions {{as well as}} two earthward propagating flux ropes and 19 south-north bipolar lobe signatures. The properties of these relatively near-Earth plasmoids, traveling compression regions, and earthward propagating flux ropes and a qualitative model for their formation are presented. The plasmoids have estimated sizes, durations, magnetic field signatures, downtail velocities, and substorm associations very {{similar to those of the}} plasmoids identified in International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) 3 deep-tail observations. The occurrence frequency of these near-Earth plasma sheet plasmoids is significantly smaller than that of plasmoids found in the mid- and deep tail with ISEE 3. The earthward propagating flux ropes are characterized by a south-north bipolar turning in the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) B(sub z) component, are localized near the noon-midnight meridional plane, and are strongly correlated with interplanetary magnetic field B(sub z) north and small isolated high latitude geomagnetic substorms. These events are also apparently very rare and/or spatially localized. We propose that these structures are 'proto-plasmoids,' i. e., plasmoids for which near-Earth magnetic reconnection stopped before all the closed plasma sheet field lines were reconnected. The proto-plasmoids are then 'trapped' inside closed magnetic field lines and propagate earthward owing to the effect of the distant X-line's earthward plasma flow. We suggest that the two different 'types' of plasmoids are due to the different energy states of the magnetosphere during periods of southward and northward interplanetary magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to place}} Palaeolithic finds within a precise climatic {{framework}} are complicated by both uncertainty over the radiocarbon calibration beyond about 21, 500 14 C years bp (Reimer et al., 2004) {{and the absence}} of a master calendar chronology for climate events from reference archives such as Greenland ice cores or speleothems (Svensson et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1016 /j. quascirev. 2006. 08. 003). Here we present an alternative approach, in which 14 C dates of interest are mapped directly onto the palaeoclimate record of the Cariaco Basin by means of its 14 C series (Hughen et al., 2004, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 1090300), circumventing calendar age model and correlation uncertainties, and placing dated events in the millennial-scale climate context of the last glacial period. This is applied to different sets of dates from levels with Mousterian artefacts, presumably produced by late Neanderthals, from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar: first, generally accepted estimates of about 32, 000 14 C years bp for the uppermost Mousterian levels (Pettitt and Bailey, 2000; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2002, doi: 10. 1111 / 1475 - 4754. 00040); second, a possible extended Middle Palaeolithic occupation until about 28, 000 14 C years bp (Finlayson et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 05195); and third, more contentious evidence for persistence until about 24, 000 14 C years bp (Finlayson et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 05195). This study shows that the three sets translate to different scenarios on the role of climate in Neanderthal extinction. The first two correspond to intervals of general climatic instability between stadials and interstadials that characterized most of the Middle Pleniglacial and are not coeval with Heinrich Events. In contrast, if accepted, the youngest date indicates that late Neanderthals may have persisted up to the onset of a major environmental shift, which included an expansion in global ice volume and an increased latitudinal temperature gradient. More generally, our radiocarbon climatostratigraphic approach can be applied to any 'snapshot' date from discontinuous records in a variety of deposits and can become a powerful tool in evaluating the climatic <b>signature</b> of critical <b>intervals</b> in Late Pleistocene human evolution...|$|R
40|$|During the Devonian Period {{the cool}} water Malvinokaffric Realm was located at high palaeolatitudes in the {{southern}} hemisphere. The Realm is defined by its highly endemic marine benthic fauna, which makes extra-Malvinokaffric correlations problematic. Investigation of the Devonian palynomorphs from an extensive regional sub-surface dataset (24 wells) in the Chaco Basin, Bolivia, reveals {{the presence of a}} number of stratigraphically restricted and regionally correlative epiboles (peak abundances) of the distinctive palynomorphs Bimerga bensonii, Crucidia camirense, Evittia sommeri, Petrovina connata and Ramochitina magnifica. These palynomorph epiboles were then located at outcrop by a high-resolution palynological investigation (225 samples) of two Bolivian outcrop localities in the Chaco Basin: Bermejo, Santa Cruz Department and Campo Redondo, Chiquisaca Department. The important Evittia sommeri epibole in the basal Los Monos Formation is related to a marine transgression that is present in both these outcrop sections. Additional chronostratigraphic control on this marine transgression comes from the occurrence of rare goniatites in the base of the Huamampampa Formation at Campo Redondo, which are at least early Eifelian in age (post Chotlatin small letter e with brevec Event). Based on the goniatite together with spore data, the marine transgression with Evittia sommeri in the basal Los Monos Formation can be tentatively assigned to the Mid Devonian (mid-late Eifelian) Ka?ák Event. The presence of a datable Malvinokaffric goniatite has shown that key spore taxa which are used zonally in both Laurussia and Gondwana do not all have coincident first occurrences in both areas. Furthermore, despite the appearance of some cosmopolitan elements in the microflora, Mid and Late Devonian spore assemblages in Bolivia are distinct from other regions in being relatively impoverished in both progymnosperm and lycopod spores. This floral difference is attributable to the Malvinokaffric Realm continuing to retain a distinctive cool climatic <b>signature</b> throughout this <b>interval.</b> However, the sporadic occurrences of extra-Malvinokaffric macrofauna in restricted stratigraphic intervals of the Middle Devonian in South America and South Africa are significant. The oldest known occurrence of the extra-Malvinokaffric brachiopod Tropidoleptus in Bolivia is coincident with the late Eifelian basal Los Monos Formation transgression. Hence there was a relationship between influxes of this fauna and marine transgressions, i. e. temporary periods of reduced climatic gradient. The migration of Devonian spores, and particularly heterosporous spores, between Gondwana and Laurussia clearly occurs during the Mid and Late Devonian. This is at variance with models claiming a wide Rheic Ocean during much of the Devonian...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{interpretation}} {{will establish}} a framework {{to understand the}} regional thickness distributions of the group, and seismic facies analysis will further enable {{our understanding of the}} Utsira High as a potential paleo-topographic high during Early Jurassic compared with the Stord Basin. This study aimed to understand the lateral distribution of the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group in the Stord Basin and upon the Utsira High. The Stord Basin in the northern North Sea is located approximately 50 km south of the Troll Field. The tectonostratigraphic framework of the Early Jurassic succession in the Stord Basin has been investigated to better understand the sub-regional distribution of depositional facies of the Statfjord Group. The Stord Basin was formed due to extension pre-Jurassic times, with a major phase in Permian-Triassic. Very few wells have been drilled in the Stord Basin, and the stratigraphic succession and depositional facies distribution across the basin is somewhat speculative and based on seismic mapping of the succession and conceptual depositional models based on earlier studies. Based on all public data, including 2 D and 3 D seismic, wells surrounding this area and core photos, an interpretation of the gross depositional environment in Early Jurassic was made. The study method includes seismic-well tie, seismic mapping, literature study, well correlation and interpretation of depositional facies from well logs and core photos. Seismic mapping indicate that the Utsira High likely represented a paleo-topographic high during deposition relative to the Stord Basin, reflected also in the depositional maps. The extensional breakup and forming of The Stord Basin was formed mainly due to extension in Permian - Triassic time, and continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic time. In this study two seismic horizons have been interpreted in the basin. Seismic interpretation has been carried out aiming to understand the distribution and thickness of the Early Jurassic succession in the Stord Basin and evaluate the seismic <b>signature</b> of this <b>interval.</b> Seismic mapping of the Top Hegre and Top Statfjord horizons give a framework of the Early Jurassic Statfjord Group. A literature study of previous work considering the Stord Basin has been done to gain knowledge of the structural and lithostratigraphic framework of the basin. Facies distribution within the Statfjord Group was predicted {{based on the results of}} seismic mapping and resulting isochron maps. No gross depositional facies maps are published in the area, whereas prevalent detailed core analysis and core descriptions of wells in the area are well documented. This study aims to test if seismic mapping of accommodation space can help predict gross sedimentary facies in this region. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1119 {{is located}} at water depth 395 m near the {{subtropical}} front (STF; here represented by the Southland Front), just downslope from the shelf edge of eastern South Island, New Zealand. The upper 86. 19 metres composite depth (mcd) of Site 1119 sediment was deposited at an average sedimentation rate of 34 cm/kyr during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 1 - 8 (0 - 252 ka), and is underlain across a ~ 25 kyr intra-MIS 8 unconformity by MIS 8. 5 - 11 (277 - 367 ka) and older sediment deposited at ~ 14 cm/kyr. A time scale is assigned to Site 1119 using radiocarbon dates for the period back to ~ 39 ka, and, prior to then, by matching its climatic record {{with that of the}} Vostok ice core, which it closely resembles. Four palaeoceanographic proxy measures for surface water masses vary together with the sandy-muddy, glacial-interglacial (G/I) cyclicity at the site. Interglacial intervals are characterised by heavy delta 13 C, high colour reflectance (a proxy for carbonate content), low Q-ray (a proxy for clay content) and light delta 18 O; conversely, glacial intervals exhibit light delta 13 C, low reflectance, high Q-ray and heavy delta 18 O <b>signatures.</b> Early interglacial <b>intervals</b> are represented by silty clays with 10 - 105 -cm-thick beds of sharp-based (Chondrites-burrowed), shelly, graded, fine sand. The sands are rich in foraminifera, and were deposited distant from the shoreline under the influence of longitudinal flow in relatively deep water. Glacial intervals comprise mostly micaceous silty clay, though with some thin (2 - 10 cm thick) sands present also at peak cold periods, and contain the cold-water scallop Zygochlamys delicatula. Interglacial sandy intervals are characterised by relatively low sedimentation rates of 5 - 32 cm/kyr; cold climate intervals MIS 10, 6 and 2 have successively higher sedimentation rates of 45, 69 and 140 cm/kyr. Counter-intuitively,and forced by the bathymetric control of a laterally-moving shoreline during G/I and I/G transitions, the 1119 core records a southeasterly (seaward) movement of the STF during early glacial periods, accompanied by the incursion of subtropical water (STW) above the site, and northwesterly (landward) movement during late glacial and interglacial times, resulting in a dominant influence then of subantarctic surface water (SAW). The history of passage of these different water masses at the site is clearly delineated by their characteristic delta 13 C values. The intervals of thin, graded sands-muds which occur within MIS 2 - 3, 6, 7. 4 and 10 indicate the onset at times of peak cold of intermittent bottom currents caused by strengthened and expanded frontal flows along the STF, which at such times lay near Site 1119 in close proximity to seaward-encroaching subantarctic waters within the Bounty gyre. In common with other nearby Southern Hemisphere records, the cold period which represents the last glacial maximum lasted between ~ 23 - 18 ka at Site 1119, during which time the STF and Subantarctic Front (SAF) probably merged into a single intense frontal zone around the head of the adjacent Bounty Trough...|$|R
