40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) method is used to study the aerodynamics of the YAV- 8 B Harrier II wing in the transonic region. A numerical procedure is developed to compute the flow field around the complicated wing-pylon-fairing geometry. The surface definition of the wing and pylons were obtained from direct measurement using theodolite triangulation. A thin-layer Navier-Stokes code with the Chimera technique is used to compute flow solutions. The computed pressure distributions at several span stations are compared with flight test data and show good agreement. Computed results are correlated with flight test data that show the flow is severely separated {{in the vicinity of}} the wing-pylon junction. Analysis shows that shock waves are induced by pylon <b>swaybrace</b> fairings, that the flow separation is much stronger at the outboard pylon and that the separation is caused mainly by the crossflow passing the geometry of wing-pylon junction...|$|E
