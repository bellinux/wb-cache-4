5|$|The {{time frame}} of the Solar System's {{formation}} has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on Earth are approximately 4.4billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate {{the age of the}} Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6billion years, suggesting that the Solar <b>System</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> at least this old.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the <b>system</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Much attention, in fact {{an entire}} session at this conference, is being devoted to {{protecting}} the United States against human threats [...] individuals who may pose a danger by their mere presence on US soil. However, tomorrow's terrorists will employ weapons in their attacks, and we <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> diligent in preventing these weapons from reaching their targets. Sensors {{can play an important}} role in detecting these weapons before they achieve their desired effects. A sensor system can best be understood as a way of automating search techniques that would normally be carried out by a human's touch and vision senses, or by a dog's sniffing capabilities. The list of potential threats is long, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological weapons, and each presents its own challenges. However, any effective <b>system</b> <b>must</b> meet the following requirements: (1) Sensor <b>systems</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> operationally practical. Delays <b>must</b> <b>be</b> kept to a minimum. The <b>systems</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> safe to operate. Individual privacy and corporate proprietary information <b>must</b> <b>be</b> protected. The <b>systems</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> part of a viable concept of operations; i. e., they must provide information that can enable effective, preemptive actions to be taken. (2) Sensors <b>systems</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> highly sensitive, providing a low probability of missed detections (false negatives). Our adversaries will conceal their device from detection, and they will likely probe our defenses for any weaknesses. Our <b>systems</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> robust against these techniques. (3) Sensor <b>systems</b> <b>must</b> give a low probability of false alarms (false positives). Our response to the detection of such a weapon will marshal substantial resources and, in many scenarios, be highly disruptive to the general population. Thus a system that gives frequent false alarms will soon be ignored...|$|R

25|$|The {{rules of}} {{evidence}} in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony.

Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court. In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness. In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in Hanbali madhhab.|$|E
25|$|Emissions are {{inherent}} to the combustion of diesel fuels that are {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, {{in order to ensure}} E.P.A. compliance a fuel <b>system</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust gas recirculation system, E.G.R., and the diesel particulate filter, D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.|$|E
25|$|These FM {{systems are}} unusual, {{in that they}} have a ratio of carrier to maximum {{modulation}} frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by Bessel analysis, the first sidebands are on 9.5 and 2.5MHz and the second sidebands are on 13MHz and −1MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1MHz; on demodulation, this results in unwanted output at 6−1 = 5MHz.
