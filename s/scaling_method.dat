25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct <b>scaling</b> <b>method,</b> some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E

For the purpose of facilitating system configuration, we have developed a series of <b>scaling</b> <b>methods,</b> including <b>scaling</b> factors, graph- and template-based <b>scaling</b> <b>methods.</b> In graph-based <b>scaling</b> <b>methods,</b> we have explored the application of various technologies in estimation of the average inter-ridge distance.

40|$|Agricultural {{systems and}} {{problems}} of sustainability are complex, covering a range of organisational levels and spatial and temporal scales. Integrated assessment (IA) and modelling (IAM) {{is an attempt to}} capture complex multi-scale problems. Scale changes and model linking methods (referred to as <b>scaling</b> <b>methods)</b> are important in dealing with these problems but they are often not well understood. The present study aims to analyse <b>scaling</b> <b>methods</b> used in the recently developed multi-scale IA model SEAMLESS-IF which is applied to two case studies of complex agri-environmental problems. The analysis is based on a classification of up- and down-scaling methods which is extended {{for the purpose of this}} study. Our analysis shows that scale changes refer to different spatial, temporal and functional scales with changes in extent, resolution, and coverage rate. Accordingly, SEAMLESS-IF uses a number of different <b>scaling</b> <b>methods</b> including data extrapolation, aggregation and disaggregation, sampling, nested simulation and employs descriptive response functions and technical coefficients derived from explanatory models. Despite the satisfactory results obtained from SEAMLESS-IF, a comparative quantitative analysis of alternative <b>scaling</b> <b>methods</b> is still pending and requires further attention. Improved integration of <b>scaling</b> <b>methods</b> may also help to overcome limitations of IA models related to high data demand, complexity of models and <b>scaling</b> <b>methods</b> considered, and the accumulation of uncertainty due to the use of multiple models. In the case studies, the most challenging scaling problem refers to the appropriate consideration of the farm level as intermediate level between the field and market levels. Among the <b>scaling</b> <b>methods</b> analysed, summary models are hardly applied. This is because they are often unavailable due to limited systems understanding and because they may differ depending on the question at stake.

50|$|A log <b>scaling</b> <b>method</b> {{that has}} been popular since the {{adaptation}} of trucks to haul logs has been the 'ramp scale'. In this approach, the log truck is driven beside a scale ramp which is simply an elevated platform, and from there the log scaler climbs around on the truck and on the load and measures and grades the logs. Although the ramp is typically operated by the scaling bureau, it may be located with a sawmill yard that is buying the logs {{or it may be}} at some other convenient location. Depending on the location, the ramp may scale logs for a single mill, or the ramp may be located so that logs scaled may proceed to multiple destinations. The photo at the right shows two trucks at a typical Pacific Northwest bureau scale ramp. Ramp scaling is often used where space is limited, speed is important, or the logs are of relatively low value. Assessing the grade of each log involves inspecting it for defects, but when a given log is situated {{in the middle of a}} truckload of logs it may be difficult to examine it.|$|E
