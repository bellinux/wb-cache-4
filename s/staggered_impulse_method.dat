The aim of this research was to study the charactarestics of the forces and develop the tools to calculate these forces accurately and as quickly as possible. A new <b>method,</b> called the <b>impulse</b> <b>method,</b> is developed into the finite element analysis of the electromagnetic field to calculate the forces for a wide whirling frequency range by one simulation. The idea of the <b>impulse</b> <b>method</b> is to move the rotor from its central position {{for a short period of}} time. This displacement excitation disturbs the magnetic field and, by doing this, produces forces between the rotor and stator. Using spectral analysis techniques, the frequency response function of the forces is calculated using the excitation and response signals. The <b>impulse</b> <b>method</b> is based on the assumption of the spatial linearity of the force. The <b>impulse</b> <b>method</b> is utilised in the analysis of the rotor eccentricity. The spatial linearity of the force and the effects of the circulating currents and saturation on the forces are studied herein.

40|$|Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) orbit {{determination}} and prediction {{are supported by}} the Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Flight Dynamics Division (FDD). TDRS System (TDRSS) -user satellites require predicted TDRS ephemerides that are up to 10 weeks in length. Previously, long-term ephemerides generated by the FDF included predictions from the White Sands Complex (WSC), which plans and executes TDRS maneuvers. TDRSs typically have monthly stationkeeping maneuvers, and predicted postmaneuver state vectors are received from WSC up to a month in advance.

As a result of this analysis, two new methods for generating long-term TDRS ephemeris predictions have been implemented by the FDF.

A generic <b>impulse</b> based <b>method,</b> the energy tracking method (ETM), is described to resolve collisions between multiple non-convex bodies in three dimensions. As opposed to the standard sequential <b>impulse</b> <b>method</b> (SQM) and simultaneous <b>impulse</b> <b>method</b> (SMM), which also apply impulses to avoid penetration, the energy tracking method changes the relative velocity between two colliding bodies iteratively yet simultaneously. Its main novelty is that impulses are applied gradually at multi-point contacts, and energy changes at the contact points are tracked to ensure conservation. Three main steps {{are involved in the}} propagation of the impulses during the single- and multi-contact resolution: compression, restitution-related energy loss, and separation. Numerical tests show that the energy tracking method captures the energy conservation property of perfectly elastic single- and multi-point collisions. ETM exhibits improved angular velocity estimation, as compared to SMM and SQM, as demonstrated by two numerical examples that model multi-point contact between box-shaped objects.

40|$|Humans {{and animals}} control their walking rhythms to {{maintain}} motion in a variable environment. The neural mechanism for controlling rhythm {{has been investigated}} in many studies using mechanical and electrical stimulation. However, quantitative evaluation of rhythm variation in response to perturbation at various timings has rarely been investigated. Such a characteristic of rhythm is described by the phase response curve (PRC). Dynamical simulations of human skeletal models with changing walking rhythms (phase reset) described a relation between the effective phase reset on stability and PRC, and phase reset around touch-down was shown to improve stability. A PRC of human walking was estimated by pulling the swing leg, but such perturbations hardly influenced the stance leg, so {{the relation between the}} PRC and walking events was difficult to discuss. This research thus examines human response to variations in floor velocity. Such perturbation yields another problem, in that the swing leg is indirectly (and weakly) perturbed, so the precision of PRC decreases. To solve this problem, this research adopts the weighted spike-triggered average (WSTA) method. In the WSTA method, a sequential pulsed perturbation is used for stimulation. This is in contrast with the conventional <b>impulse</b> <b>method,</b> which applies an intermittent impulsive perturbation. The WSTA method can be used to analyze responses to a large number of perturbations for each sequence. In the experiment, perturbations are applied to walking subjects by rapidly accelerating and decelerating a treadmill belt, and measured data are analyzed by the WSTA and <b>impulse</b> <b>methods.</b> The PRC obtained by the WSTA method had clear and stable waveforms with a higher temporal resolution than those obtained by the <b>impulse</b> <b>method.</b> By investigation of the rhythm transition for each phase of walking using the obtained PRC, a rhythm change that extends the touch-down and mid-single support phases is found to occur...|$|R

40|$|Impulse-based methods {{efficiently}} and accurately model high-frequency collisions of complex shapes {{based on the}} enforcement of non-penetrating constraints. It does not rely on penalty parameters nor requires the computation of penetration between bodies. This work presents a novel necessary condition for energy conservation in impulse-based methods. In previous versions of the <b>impulse</b> <b>methods,</b> such as sequential and simultaneous <b>impulse</b> <b>methods,</b> the relative velocity at the contact points after collision is directly derived from the relative velocity before collision, in a purely simultaneous or sequential manner. This work presents a novel energy tracking method (ETM), in which the relative velocities are iteratively but gradually adjusted, simultaneously modelling their interaction at each iteration. ETM ensures the energy conservation while capturing the propagation of forces during collision. The ETM is applied to model the dynamics of fragment collision {{in the context of}} fragmentation. Two approaches of fragmentation are proposed: a finite-discrete element approach, and a low cost, fragmentation pattern-based approach. The first approach models the growth of fractures using the finite element method (FEM) and advanced re-meshing technology. This finite-discrete element approach suffers from the drawback of massive computational cost. The low-cost, fragmentation pattern-based approach separate colliding bodies directly. The fragmentation pattern is generated using Weibull distribution equations, the patterns and size distributions computed using full finite/discrete element simulations and experimental results.
