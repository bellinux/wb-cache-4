He also introduced a large batch of youngsters who were unable to cope with League football. At the end of the 1980–81 season, Blackpool were in the Fourth Division, the League's basement, for the first time. Ball had departed three months earlier, replaced by Allan Brown for his second stint in the Bloomfield Road hotseat. On 21 March 1981, Blackpool played their 3,000th match in the Football League. It occurred against Chesterfield at Saltergate.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E
25|$|Jordan was now {{torn between}} his school {{business}} and {{his desire to}} be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in the next elections {{and to have the}} public support of Turner and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|In a December 18, 2000 {{article for}} People {{magazine}} entitled [...] "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey {{had been diagnosed}} with bipolar disorder [...] "a few years ago" [...] and added that his bipolar disorder was [...] "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy." [...] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth (...) , says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that [...] "no one had done a complete [...] evaluation ...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" [...] In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address [...] "this whole thing about the bipolar" [...] after receiving a phone call from [...] "the Bipolar Association" [...] asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, [...] "'No! Dr. Malibusian said ...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'" [...] Downey flatly denied being [...] "depressed or manic" [...] and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because [...] "the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober." ...|$|E

He has said that he is 'sceptical' of having a god in his life. He described his concerns about the environment as a sort of [...] "spiritualism". Corbyn has described himself as frugal, telling Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, [...] "I don't <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don't have a car".

The project, however, lingered in development for over three years. Jonathan Hensleigh completed a first draft of the script before pulling out around 2006. John Dahl was in talks to direct the film but pulled out due to script quality issues and the studio not wanting to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on the project. In a statement on May 15, 2007 and in two audio interviews Thomas Jane said that he pulled out of the project due to creative differences and the budget of the film being cut, in addition to director Walter Hill being turned down as director by Lionsgate. After reading the new script by Kurt Sutter, Jane stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wales's {{association}} with the foundation has led to controversy. In March 2008, Wales was accused by former Wikimedia Foundation employee Danny Wool of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes. Wool also stated that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away {{in part because of}} his spending habits, a claim Wales denied. Then-chairperson of the foundation Florence Devouard and former foundation interim Executive Director Brad Patrick denied any wrongdoing by Wales or the foundation, saying that Wales accounted for every expense and that, for items for which he lacked receipts, he paid out of his own pocket; in private, Devouard upbraided Wales for [...] "constantly trying to rewrite the past". Later in March 2008, it was claimed by Jeffrey Vernon Merkey that Wales had edited Merkey's Wikipedia entry to make it more favorable in return for donations to the Wikimedia Foundation, an allegation Wales dismissed as [...] "nonsense". In early 2016 Wikipedia editors perceived the WMF's Knowledge Engine project as a conflict of interest for Wales, whose business Wikia might benefit from having the WMF <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> on research in respect to search.
