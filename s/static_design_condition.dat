40|$|The diploma work {{focuses on}} the concept of a new {{prefabricated}} reinforced concrete roof element for shed roofs. The diploma work consists of three parts. The first part presents general demands that need {{to be taken into account}} when building industrial facilities. Also presented are shed roof system designs and prefabricated construction designs. For each of the two strengths and weaknesses are shown. Also exposed are some shed roof structural problems. In the second part recent shed roof system designs are presented. Strengths and weaknesses of the existing gable roof system are compared to the newly designed shed system element. In this part we also set goals and determine the <b>static</b> <b>design</b> <b>conditions</b> as also provision of microclimate conditions, which the new prefabricated reinforced concrete roof element for shed roofs must satisfy. The third part of the diploma work presents the chosen prefabricated reinforced concrete roof element for shed roof construction. Design solutions are proposed to meet the set conditions from the following aspects: ensuring sufficient daylight in the space, heat isolation, stormwater drainage as also fixing the element on the construction. This last part of the diploma work is completed with a static calculation and a calculation of armature for a new prefabricated reinforced concrete roof element of 10 m in length. The given data is provided for a real and concrete location where the newly designed element could be used and the calculation is only valid for this location...|$|R
40|$|Air {{distribution}} {{systems are}} one of the major electrical energy consumers in air-conditioned commercial buildings which maintain comfortable indoor thermal environment and air quality by supplying specified amounts of treated air into different zones. The sizes of air distribution lines affect energy efficiency of the distribution systems. Equal friction and static regain are two well-known approaches for sizing the air distribution lines. Concerns to life cycle cost of the air distribution systems, T and IPS methods have been developed. Hitherto, all these methods are based on <b>static</b> <b>design</b> <b>conditions.</b> Therefore, dynamic performance of the system has not been yet addressed; whereas, the air distribution systems are mostly performed in dynamic rather than static conditions. Besides, none of the existing methods consider any aspects of thermal comfort and environmental impacts. This study attempts to investigate the existing methods for sizing of the air distribution systems and proposes a dynamic approach for size optimisation of the air distribution lines by taking into account optimisation criteria such as economic aspects, environmental impacts and technical performance. These criteria have been respectively addressed through whole life costing analysis, life cycle assessment and deviation from set-point temperature of different zones. Integration of these criteria into the TRNSYS software produces a novel dynamic optimisation approach for duct sizing. Due to the integration of different criteria into a well- known performance evaluation software, this approach could be easily adopted by designers in busy nature of design. Comparison of this integrated approach with the existing methods reveals that under the defined criteria, system performance is improved up to 15...|$|R
40|$|Compared to the {{conventional}} gear hobbing fixtures, split fixture can effectively reduce job set-up time during the manufacturing process. This paper investigates the behaviour and analysis of split fixture under varying <b>static</b> loading <b>conditions.</b> <b>Design</b> of the part was established by considering {{the ability of the}} split fixture to carry jobs of various diameters. In order to validate the <b>design,</b> <b>Static</b> structural analysis was carried out on two positional configurations of the split fixture. A load of 1 ton was applied on the resting face of the fixture to simulate the effect of holding the job. The analysis included a study of the Stress, Deformations, and Modal analysis at different resonating frequencies to check for failure of design. By applying varying loads similar to practical conditions, it was observed that the design successfully withstood the applied forces without failure and a factor of safety of 142 was achieved in a critical loading case.

40|$|When {{building}} {{offshore wind}} turbines, a static scour protection is typically designed, allowing no movement of top layer stones under <b>design</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{leading to an}} often conservative design. Furthermore, little design guidelines exist for a scour protection around a monopile foundation under combined wave and current loading. In part 1 (De Vos et al., 2011), preceding this paper, a <b>static</b> <b>design</b> guideline for a scour protection around a monopile is suggested, based on a combined wave and current flow field. By allowing some movement of the top layer stones of the scour protection, a more economical design is obtained. This paper describes the derivation of a dynamic design formula to calculate the required stone size for a scour protection around a monopile foundation in a combined wave and current climate. The formula {{is based on the}} results of an experimental model study, described in this paper. The formula gives an expected damage level to the scour protection, based on the wave orbital velocity, wave period, steady current velocity, water depth, relative stone density and stone size. When applying the formula for a typical situation in the North Sea, a reduction of 20 % to 80 % of the required stone size is obtained, compared to the <b>static</b> <b>design</b> approach, described in part 1...|$|R

40|$|Finite-difference {{methods are}} {{computationally}} intensive and required by many applications. Parameters of a finite-difference algorithm, such as grid size, can be varied to generate design space which contains algorithm instances with different constant coefficients. An algorithm instance with specific coefficients {{can either be}} mapped into general operators to construct <b>static</b> <b>designs,</b> or be implemented as constant-specific operators to form dynamic designs, which require runtime reconfiguration to update algorithm coefficients. This article proposes a tuning method to explore the design space to optimise both the static and the dynamic designs, and an evaluation method to select the design with maximum overall throughput, based on algorithm characteristics, design properties, available resources and runtime data size. For benchmark applications option pricing and Reverse-TimeMigration (RTM), over 50 % reduction in resource consumption has been achieved for both <b>static</b> <b>designs</b> and dynamic designs, while meeting precision requirements. For a single hardware implementation, the RTM design optimised with the proposed approach is expected to run 1. 8 {{times faster than the}} best published <b>design.</b> The tuned <b>static</b> <b>designs</b> run thousands of times faster than the dynamic designs for algorithms with small data size, while the tuned dynamic designs achieve up to 5. 9 times speedup over the corresponding <b>static</b> <b>designs</b> for large-scale finite-difference algorithms...|$|R

The design process of suspension systems consists of pre-processing design stage, analysis stage and post-processing stage.

40|$|Dynamic {{modeling}} in {{the scope}} of object-oriented design is discussed and clari ed. A dynamic model {{is seen as an}} abstraction of the actual program execution. In contrast, a <b>static</b> <b>design</b> model is seen as an abstraction of the program description in which the structural relationships are emphasized. The central hypothesis behind this paper is that designers and programmers think in terms of objects instead of classes, because objects and object relations are more tangible than classes and class relations. As a consequence it is recommended that dynamic design models are worked out prior to the construction of <b>static</b> <b>design</b> models. In the paper a dynamic OOD model is developed as an abstraction of the actual program execution model. A dynamic exploration tool, which works on the abstract execution model, is also described. The dynamic exploration tool is seen as a medium which matches the properties of the dynamic design model. ...|$|R
