5|$|When the 2013 festival {{began in}} Park City, Utah, the secrecy {{about the movie}} continued. The festival's website only {{identified}} the setting as a theme park. Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the Park Record, recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> her review, she declined to identify {{the setting of the}} film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the other shows were effectively sold out.|$|E
5|$|The {{affiliation}} of the Assemblies of God {{with the}} National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG's alignment with evangelicalism and {{its opposition to}} mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement. The AG and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar world views though the AG's Pentecostal distinctives—Spirit baptism and the operation of spiritual gifts—were not embraced by most evangelical Christians. The AG's response then to the charismatic movement {{that began in the}} 1960s was a cautious one, affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture. For the first time, beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale. The fact that this occurred in these churches (which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect), the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from, and the perception by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> relation to the ecumenical movement.|$|E
25|$|Métraux {{thought at}} first that the London tablet was a forgery, due to the {{engraving}} being of the poor quality seen in modern carvings for tourists. However, after {{he had a chance}} to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> person, and after Barthel declared it authentic, his 'skepticism was dispelled' (1957:184). The evidence is principally the paraphrasing rather than copying of text Gr, which would have required literacy in the script to accomplish.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, Mike was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia. While ill, he continued to work to complete his final report on killer whales, {{and was able to}} <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> print shortly before he died on 18 October 1990. He was 51. Bigg was survived by a son Colin who died in 2009, his wife Silke, a daughter Michelle, two sisters Carol & Pamela, and his parents Andy who died in 2003 and Irene who died in 1993.|$|E
25|$|In Cambrai, {{the work}} {{attracted}} thousands of pilgrims, including such luminaries as Philip the Good (1457), Charles the Bold (1460) and Louis XI of France, who left his kingdom to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1468, 1477 and 1478. Philip the Good encouraged {{the growth of}} a cult around the painting, commissioning numerous copies following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. Philip hoped that the Cambrai Madonna would serve as a significant icon, around which he could rally sufficient religious fervour to launch a crusade to retake the city.|$|E
25|$|Archbishop Polding {{laid the}} {{foundation}} stone for the present cathedral in 1868. It {{was to be a}} huge and ambitious structure with a wide nave and aisle and three towers. Polding did not live to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> use as he died in 1877. Five years later, on 8 September 1882, his successor, Archbishop Vaughan, presided at the dedication Mass. Archbishop Vaughan gave the peal of bells which were rung {{for the first time on}} that day. Vaughan died while in England in 1883.|$|E
60|$|Gretz lies {{out of the}} forest, down by {{the bright}} river. It boasts a mill, an ancient church, a castle, and a bridge of many sterlings. And the bridge {{is a piece of}} public property; {{anonymously}} famous; beaming on the incurious dilettante from the walls of a hundred exhibitions. I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Salon; I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Academy; I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the last French Exposition, excellently done by Bloomer; in a black-and-white by Mr. A. Henley, it once adorned this essay {{in the pages of the}} MAGAZINE OF ART. Long-suffering bridge! And if you visit Gretz to-morrow, you shall find another generation, camped at the bottom of Chevillon's garden under their white umbrellas, and doggedly painting it again.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Kanin began solo writing in earnest with Heat of Anger, about a strong, older woman lawyer played by Susan Hayward, {{and a younger}} male lawyer. At first Kanin was {{put off by the}} lack of an {{immediate}} reaction from an audience, but once she realized that more people had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> one night than would have ever <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> theaters if <b>it</b> played for a year, she was hooked and wrote five more films for television.|$|R
25|$|With secession, many Quebec nationalists {{think they}} have the answer to Canada's continual {{constitutional}} debate. Marginalized after the Patriotes rebellion of 1837–38, the secessionist option was resurrected as a credible solution {{in the wake of the}} 1960s Quiet Revolution of Quebec. Some politicians see the independence as the normal conclusion of the Quebec struggle for the conservation of its autonomy within the Canadian federal framework. Some <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a broader perspective of every people's right to self-determination and what they see as the normal evolution of a 400-year-old former French colony that fell victim to the colonial wars between Great Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|Philip of Burgundy ordered Gossaert {{to execute}} a replica for the church of Middelburg, and the value which was then set on the picture is {{apparent}} {{from the fact that}} Dürer came expressly to Middelburg (1521) to <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 1568 the altarpiece perished by fire. In 1508 Gossaert accompanied Philip of Burgundy on his Italian mission to the pope, and by this accident an important revolution was effected in the art of the Netherlands. Gossaert appears to have chiefly studied in Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He not only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion of travelling to Italy; and from that time till the age of Rubens and Van Dyck it was considered proper that all Flemish painters should visit the peninsula. The Flemings grafted Italian mannerisms on their own stock, and the cross turned out so unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of originality.|$|E
25|$|As {{the year}} moves on, Den decides {{that he wants}} to leave Angie so he can marry Jan. He finally gets round to telling Angie his {{intentions}} in October, after which Angie becomes distraught. Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he'd overheard her conversation with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> response, Angie and Sharon pack their bags and walk out of the pub, choosing to take the route through the public area to cause Den the most embarrassment possible.|$|E

Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time. Lennon too had been a friend of Harrison's since school days, and Leng includes him {{as a source of}} Harrison's [...] "minibereavement" [...] at the Beatles' impending demise.|$|E
500|$|Spain won the 2010 FIFA World Cup {{with seven}} players from Barcelona, setting {{a record for}} the most players to be {{provided}} by a club side for a team in a World Cup final. Joachim Löw, coach of Germany, said after his side's defeat by Spain that the opposition had a distinct Barcelona style: [...] "You can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> every pass, how Spain plays is how Barcelona plays. They can hardly be beaten. They are extremely confident and very calm {{in the way they}} circulate the ball." ...|$|E

500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't know why I wrote that down, why Debra [...] and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face".|$|E
500|$|Wallraf-Richartz Museum's Langlois Bridge at Arles {{depicts a}} woman holding an {{umbrella}} as she crosses the Langlois Bridge, following {{a horse and}} buggy that just crossed the bridge. [...] The water in the canal subtly reflects the bridge and the few clouds in the sky. [...] Van Gogh uses impasto paint and color to reflect light, much as we would <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments. The painting is currently at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Germany.|$|E
500|$|... the {{edition of}} Shakespeare – viewed with {{historical}} {{understanding of what}} it involved in 1765 – could seem a remarkable feat; and we are not speaking of just the great Preface To <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> perspective, we have only to remind ourselves what Johnson brought to it – an assemblage of almost every qualification we should ideally like to have brought to this kind of work with the single exception of patience... Operating in and through these qualities was his own extensive knowledge of human nature and life. No Shakespearean critic or editor has ever approached him in this respect.|$|E
