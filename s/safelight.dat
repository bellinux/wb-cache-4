[...] Each sheet of film was viewed under either a green or an orange <b>safelight</b> in his darkroom, allowing him to control the individual development of a negative. He continued to use this technique {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|Red {{illumination}} was (and sometimes still is) {{used as a}} <b>safelight</b> {{while working}} in a darkroom as it does not expose most photographic paper and some films. Today modern darkrooms usually use an amber <b>safelight.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{black and}} white gelatin-silver process may be done using a <b>safelight</b> for {{darkroom}} illumination. The contact printer may also contain a <b>safelight</b> so that the negative can be examined before the photographic paper is laid upon it.|$|E
50|$|UV filters {{span the}} color {{spectrum}} {{and are used}} {{for a wide variety}} of applications. Ortho Red ahave negativend Deep Ortho Red lights are commonly used in diffusion transfer, typesetting films/paper, and other applications dealing with orthochromatic materials. Yellow Gold, Yellow, Lithostar Yellow, and Fuji Yellow filters or <b>safelights</b> provide safe workspaces for contact proofing applications like screen printing and platemaking. Pan Green, Infrared Green, and Dark Green filters or <b>safelights</b> are commonly used in scanning applications, work with panchromatic film ,and papers and x-rays.|$|R
50|$|Rust is a red-orange-brown color {{resembling}} iron oxide. It is {{a commonly}} used color in stage lighting, and appears {{roughly the same}} color as photographic <b>safelights</b> when used over a standard tungsten light source. The color is number 777 in the Lee Filters swatch book.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Wellingborough, England, {{the son of a}} Wesleyan minister, and {{attended}} the University of London. In 1906 he was awarded his D.Sc. with a dissertation on photographic theory. From 1906 until 1912 he worked for Wratten and Wainwright, Ltd., assisting Frederick Wratten in developing the first panchromatic photographic plates, as well as light filters and <b>safelights</b> for the darkroom.|$|R
50|$|Differently sensitised {{materials}} require different safelights. In traditional black-and-white photographic printing, photographic papers normally {{are handled}} under an amber or red <b>safelight,</b> as such papers typically are sensitive only to {{blue and green}} light. Orthochromatic papers and films are also sensitive to yellow light and must be used only with a deep red <b>safelight,</b> not with an amber one. Panchromatic films and papers, nominally sensitive to the entire spectrum, sometimes have a region of minimum in their range of sensitivity that allows the careful use of <b>safelight</b> confined {{to that part of}} the spectrum. For example, Kodak Panalure panchromatic paper is tolerant of limited exposure to light filtered through a Kodak 13 <b>Safelight</b> Filter. Other panchromatic materials must be handled only in total darkness.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Safelight,</b> Burke’s debut novel, is a {{love story}} {{involving}} a fencer with HIV and a paramedic who interacts with the world through photographs of his patients. Burke stated that he believed the novel was about “personal redemption.” The book was well received, with the New York Times' Julia Livshin calling the novel “a minimalist tour de force.” Daniel Menaker, ex-editor and chief of Random House, called <b>Safelight</b> one of [...] "the most under-rated novels I've edited." ...|$|E
5000|$|Low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps are {{extremely}} efficient. They produce a deep yellow-orange light {{and have an}} effective CRI of nearly zero; items viewed under their light appear monochromatic. This makes them particularly effective as photographic <b>safelights.</b> High-pressure sodium lamps tend to produce a much whiter light, but still with a characteristic orange-pink cast. New color-corrected versions producing a whiter light are now available, but some efficiency is sacrificed for the improved color.|$|R
50|$|All {{photographic}} papers {{consist of}} a light-sensitive emulsion, consisting of silver halide salts suspended in a colloidal material - usually gelatin- coated onto a paper, resin coated paper or polyester support. In black-and-white papers, the emulsion is normally sensitised to blue and green light, but is insensitive to wavelengths longer than 600 nm {{in order to facilitate}} handling under red or orange <b>safelighting.</b> In Chromogenic colour papers, the emulsion layers are sensitive to red, green and blue light, respectively producing cyan, magenta and yellow dye during processing.|$|R
40|$|The action {{spectrum}} for photoreactivation by enzymes from human leukocytes and fibroblasts extends from 300 to approximately 600 nm {{with a maximum}} near 400 nm. The ability of the human enzymes to utilize light of wavelengths greater than 500 nm suggested that yellow or gold lights conventionally used as <b>safelights</b> for photoreactivation might serve as sources of photoreactivating light for these enzymes. Experiments using lights {{with a range of}} spectral outputs confirm that the standard yellow “safe” lights do produce photoreactivation by the human but not the Escherichia coli enzyme...|$|R
50|$|Burke {{was born}} in Wilmette, Illinois and studied at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. After graduating he became a {{paramedic}} for the New York City Fire Department. Burke used these experiences in his novels <b>Safelight</b> (2004) and Black Flies (2008). Through 2015, Burke has published three novels: <b>Safelight</b> (2004), Black Flies (2008) and Into the Savage Country (2015). He also {{has been involved in}} various film and television projects, including work on the script for the film Syriana (2005).|$|E
50|$|A <b>safelight</b> is a {{light source}} {{suitable}} {{for use in a}} photographic darkroom. It provides illumination only from parts of the visible spectrum to which the photographic material in use is nearly, or completely, insensitive.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "safe" [...] in [...] "safelight" [...] is relative, {{as in most}} cases, a sensitised {{material}} {{eventually will}} be affected by its <b>safelight</b> if exposed to it for an extended length of time.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the many}} {{problems}} of growing plants in completely controlled environments, {{such as those}} anticipated for the space station and the CELSS program, {{is the need to}} provide light that is both adequate for photosynthesis and of proper quality for normal growth and development. NASA scientists and engineers have recently become interested in the possibility of utilizing densely packed, solid state, light emitting diodes (LED's) as a source for this light. Unlike more conventional incandescent or electrical discharge lamps, these sources are highly monochromatic and lack energy in spectral regions thought to be important for normal plant development. In addition, a recent observation by NASA scientist has suggested that infra-red LED's, that are routinely used as photographic <b>safelights</b> for plants grown in darkness, may interact with the ability of plants to detect gravity. In order to establish how plants respond to light from these LED light sources we carried out a series of experiments with known pigment mutants of the model mustard plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, growing in either a gravity field or on a clinostat to simulate a micro-gravity environment. Results indicate that only red light from the 665 nm LED's disrupts the ability of normal wildtype seedlings to detect a gravity stimulus. There was no consistent effect found for the far-red (735 nm) LED's or either of the infrared (880 nm or 935 nm) LED sources but both showed some effect in {{one or more of the}} genotypes tested. Of these five members of the phytochrome multigene family in Arabidopsis, only the phytochrome B pigment mutant (hy 3) lacked the ability to detect gravity under all conditions. There was no effect of either micro-gravity (clinostat) or the infra-red LED's on the light induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Measurements of the pigment phytochrome in oats also showed no photoconversion by 15 min irradiations with the infra-red LED's. We conclude that phytochrome B is required for the perception of gravity and that only red light is able to disrupt this perception. The infra-red LED's also do not appear to interact with gravity perception in Arabidopsis, but caution should be exercised if infra-red LED's are to be used as photographic <b>safelights</b> for these types of experiments...|$|R
50|$|A <b>safelight</b> usually {{consists}} of an ordinary light bulb in a housing closed off by a coloured filter, but sometimes a special light bulb or fluorescent tube with suitable filter material coated directly on the glass is used in an ordinary fixture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safelight</b> is a 2015 American drama film, {{written and}} {{directed}} by Tony Aloupis, and starring Juno Temple, Evan Peters, Kevin Alejandro, Jason Beghe, Ariel Winter, and Christine Lahti. The film had its world premiere on April 17, 2015 at the Nashville Film Festival.|$|E
50|$|Imagesetter film is {{a silver}} halide-coated plastic film very similar to normal {{black-and-white}} photographic film, except the spectral sensitivity is reduced to a much narrower band around {{the output of the}} laser of the individual imagesetter. This allows the film to be handled under a (usually red) <b>safelight,</b> instead of in total darkness like most photographic film.|$|E
50|$|Orthochromatic {{photography}} {{refers to}} a photographic emulsion that is sensitive to only blue and green light, and thus can be processed with a red <b>safelight.</b> The increased blue sensitivity causes blue objects to appear lighter, and red ones darker. A cyan lens filter (which removes red light) {{can be used with}} standard panchromatic film to produce a similar effect.|$|E
50|$|All of {{this was}} done {{in a matter of}} minutes, and some of the steps in (red) <b>safelight</b> conditions, which meant that the {{photographer}} had to carry the chemicals and a portable darkroom with him wherever he went. After these steps the plate needed rinsing in fresh water. Finally, the plate was dried and varnished using a varnish made from sandarac, alcohol and lavender oil.|$|E
50|$|On February 17, 2015, {{the first}} {{theatrical}} trailer was released for the film. <b>Safelight</b> had its world premiere at the Nashville Film Festival on April 17, 2015, and screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival on April 25, 2015. On June 4, 2015, {{it was announced}} ARC Entertainment had acquired distribution rights to the film and set a July 17, 2015 in a limited release and through video on demand.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{photosensitive}} {{materials used}} in technical and industrial applications, such as photoresist, are sensitive only to blue, violet, and ultraviolet light and may be handled under a brighter yellow <b>safelight.</b> Low-pressure sodium vapour lamps sometimes are used in larger industrial darkrooms. They emit nearly monochromatic light at 589 nm (yellow), to which the materials are insensitive; as a result they can be extremely bright while still [...] "safe".|$|E
50|$|In {{darkness}} or by {{the light}} of a <b>safelight,</b> the silver surface was exposed to halogen fumes. Originally, only iodine fumes (from iodine crystals at room temperature) were used, producing a surface coating of silver iodide, but it was soon found that a subsequent exposure to bromine fumes greatly increased the sensitivity of the silver halide coating. Exposure to chlorine fumes, or a combination of bromine and chlorine fumes, could also be used. A final re-fuming with iodine was typical.|$|E
50|$|The process {{began in}} the 1890s, {{originally}} as a copy-guard against film pirates. The film was tinted amber, {{the color of the}} <b>safelight</b> on film printers. The discovery of bleaching methods by pirates soon put an end to this. Both the Edison Studios and the Biograph Company began tinting their films for setting moods. Because orthochromatic film stock could not be used in low-light situations, blue became the most popular tint, applied to scenes shot during the day and when projected, signified night.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Peters {{starred in}} the {{independent}} comedy film Adult World, opposite John Cusack and Emma Roberts. Peters played the mutant Quicksilver in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past and its 2016 sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse. In 2015, Peters {{starred in the}} horror film The Lazarus Effect and the drama film <b>Safelight,</b> alongside Juno Temple, and in 2016 he {{had a role in}} the comedy-drama Elvis & Nixon. He will be reprising the role of Quicksilver in the 2018 film X-Men: Dark Phoenix.|$|E
50|$|In amateur processing, {{the film}} {{is removed from the}} camera and wound onto a reel in {{complete}} darkness (usually inside a darkroom with the <b>safelight</b> turned off or a lightproof bag with arm holes). The reel holds the film in a spiral shape, with space between each successive loop so the chemicals may flow freely across the film's surfaces. The reel is placed in a specially designed light-proof tank (called daylight processing tank or a light-trap tank) where it is retained until final washing is complete.|$|E

50|$|In the 1940s Pitseolak {{was living}} in Cape Dorset working for fur-traders when he {{acquired}} his first camera, from a Catholic missionary. With {{the help of his}} second wife Aggeok (1906-1977), he developed his first photographs in a hunting igloo. Many difficulties had to be overcome, including extreme climate changes, high light levels from the reflective snowscape, and the difficulty of obtaining film and developer. Peter and Aggeok experimented. They used a battery-powered flashlight covered with red cloth as a <b>safelight,</b> and a lens filter made from old sunglasses.|$|E
50|$|In most darkrooms, an enlarger, {{an optical}} {{apparatus}} {{similar to a}} slide projector, that projects {{the image of a}} negative onto a base, finely controls the focus, intensity and duration of light, is used for printmaking. A sheet of photographic paper is exposed to the enlarged image from the negative. When making black-and-white prints, a <b>safelight</b> is commonly used to illuminate the work area. Since the majority of black-and-white papers are sensitive to only blue, or to blue and green light, a red- or amber-colored light can be safely used without exposing the paper.|$|E
50|$|However, all {{of these}} were glass-based plate products. Panchromatic {{emulsions}} on a film base were not commercially available until the 1910s and did not come into general use until much later. Many photographers who did their own darkroom work preferred to go without the seeming luxury of sensitivity to red—a rare color in nature and uncommon even in man-made objects—rather than be forced to abandon the traditional red darkroom <b>safelight</b> and process their exposed film in complete darkness. Kodak's popular Verichrome black-and-white snapshot film, introduced in 1931, remained a red-insensitive orthochromatic product until 1956, when it was replaced by Verichrome Pan. Amateur darkroom enthusiasts then had to handle the undeveloped film by the sense of touch alone.|$|E
5000|$|In {{developing}} his 8x10 negatives, {{he did so}} by inspection {{during the}} development process. While the development was well underway, Baer briefly checked his highlight densities with a dim green <b>safelight</b> and continued development until he obtained his desired densities. He developed early Isopan and later Super XX Black & White film in his variation of ABC Pyro. [...] For some color work, Baer used Ektachrome film developed in a commercial developer but exposed at values he worked out in extensive testing. Although reluctant to use filters, Baer did so when necessary to make his photograph most effectively express the subject—as he described in technical entries in his several books. He seldom changed from his favorite print developer Amidol modifying it as necessary as printing papers evolved.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "photosculpture" [...] method {{consisted}} of photographing a subject {{from a variety}} of equidistant angles and projecting each photograph onto a screen, where a pantograph was used to trace the outline onto modeling clay. In photo-polymerization, a vat of liquid polymer is exposed to controlled lighting under <b>safelight</b> conditions. The exposed liquid polymer hardens. Polymerization occurs when photopolymers are exposed to light when photopolymers contain chromophores, otherwise, the addition of molecules that are photosensitive are utilized to react with the solution to begin polymerization. Polymerization of monomers lead to cross-linking, which creates a polymer. Through these covalent bonds, the property of the solution is changed. The build plate then moves down in small increments and the liquid polymer is again exposed to light. The process repeats until the model has been built. The liquid polymer is then drained from the vat, leaving the solid model. The EnvisionTEC Perfactory {{is an example of a}} DLP rapid prototyping system.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Biological chemistryAngiosperm {{plants like}} barley (Hordeum vulgare) lack {{chlorophyll}} when grown in complete dark. Upon exposure to light, chlorophyll is formed {{during the process}} of deetiolation. Here, we show that in complete darkness barley seedlings accumulate monovinyl protochlorophyllide. Also small amounts of a second protochlorophyllide form were found. Spectroscopic measurements indicated that the unknown pchlide form is divinyl protochlorophyllide. Upon exposure to light for ten seconds some of MV-protochlorophyllide was photoreduced to MV chlorophyllide while divinyl pchlide remained constant. The loss of chlide and accumulation of chlorophyllide a was determined. Within twenty minutes MV-pchlide concentration was restored, the concentration of chlide was strongly decreased and chl continued to accumulate. Interestingly, exposure of plants to <b>safelight</b> was not capable to phototransform MV-Pchlide. However it resulted in increase in the second protochlide form upon exposure of barley seedlings to light. The finding indicates that the <b>safelight</b> used in the experiment influences capacity of chlorophyll biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The first mitosis in spores of the fern A. capillus-veneris was {{observed}} {{under a microscope}} equipped with Nomarski optics with irradiation from a <b>safelight</b> at 900 nm, and under a fluorescent microscope after staining with 4 [prime], 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole. During imbibition the nucleus remained near one corner of each tetrahedron-shaped dormant spore, and asymmetric cell division occurred upon brief irradiation with red light. This red light-induced mitosis was photoreversibly prevented by subsequent brief exposure to far-red light and was photo-irreversibly prevented by brief irradiation with blue light. However, neither far-red nor blue light affected the germination rate when spores were irradiated after the first mitosis. Therefore, the first mitosis in the spores {{appears to be the}} crucial step for photoinduction of spore germination. Furthermore, experiments using a microbeam of red or blue light demonstrated that blue light was effective only when exposed to the nucleus, and no specific intracellular photoreceptive site for red light was found in the spores. Therefore, phytochrome in the far-red absorbing form induces the first mitosis in germinating spores but prevents the subsequent mitosis in protonemata, whereas a blue-light receptor prevents the former but induces the latte...|$|E
40|$|Soluble {{phytochrome}} {{of maize}} coleoptiles does not readily permeate Sephadex G 200 and is eluted {{in the void}} volume as a single species. The exclusion by Sephadex G 200 is not due to molecular aggregation. This property of maize phytochrome is found with material extracted from both the dark grown or far red and red irradiated tissues; and at 4 °C elution proceeds under normal laboratory lighting {{as it does in}} darkness or under a green <b>safelight.</b> During chromatography on Sepharose 4 B of soluble extracts of maize coleoptiles containing soluble phytochrome it behaves as a single species and it is eluted at a position similar to that of catalase. Phytochrome recovered from the phytochrome-binding site complex which is formed inside cells of coleoptiles following irradiation with red light is eluted ahead of catalase suggesting that it has gained in size. A further size increase (about 2 -fold) is observed when the particulate fraction containing the complex is treated with Triton X 100. Control experiments demonstrate that the size increase is due neither to molecular aggregation nor to gross protein-denaturation but is probably due to a change in molecular con-figuration...|$|E
