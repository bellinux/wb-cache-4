5|$|Although most Final Fantasy {{installments}} are stand-alone <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> {{different settings}} and main characters, they feature identical elements {{that define the}} franchise. Recurring elements include plot themes, character names, and game mechanics. Plots center {{on a group of}} heroes battling a great evil while exploring the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide.|$|E

5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short <b>stories,</b> <b>with</b> each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> {{predominantly}} indigenous casts, Drama dari Krakatau {{is set in}} a rural area, far from the cities where the ethnic Chinese populace were concentrated. Geography plays a major role. The novel starts on a macro scale, depicting the origins of the archipelago from rising sea levels caused by the sinking of Poseidonis, then progresses increasingly towards the micro scale, passing through views of Java, Sumatra, and Krakatoa, before focusing on the home of Tjakra Amidjaja {{and the beginning of the}} plot. A later passage details the view from Mount Ciwalirang, showing Java, Krakatoa and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Back in the West End, Richardson was {{in another}} Sherriff play, The White Carnation, in 1953, and in November {{of the same year}} he and Gielgud starred {{together}} in NCHunter's A Day by the Sea, which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played Dr Watson in an American/BBC radio co-production of Sherlock Holmes <b>stories,</b> <b>with</b> Gielgud as Holmes and Orson Welles as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.|$|E

5|$|Eliot's {{poetry is}} filled with {{religious}} images beyond those common to Christianity: the Four Quartets brings in Hindu <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> a particular emphasis on the Bhagavad-Gita of the Mahabharata.

5|$|Finally, in August 1831, La Peau de chagrin: Conte philosophique was {{published}} in two volumes. It was a commercial success, and Balzac used his connections {{in the world of}} Parisian periodicals to have it reviewed widely. The book sold quickly, {{and by the end of}} the month another contract had been signed: Balzac would receive 4,000francs to publish 1,200additional copies. This second edition included a series of twelve other <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> fantastic elements, and was released under the title Romans et contes philosophiques (Philosophical Novels and Stories). A third edition, rearranged to fill four volumes, appeared in March 1833.|$|E

Although the Legend imprint ceased in 1998, Monkeyman and O'Brien continued to appear in print, sometimes in crossover <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> other comics characters, such as Gen¹³/Monkeyman and O'Brien (1998), and Savage Dragon #41 (September 1997).|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> {{functional}} shops on {{the ground}} floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly {{rather than}} {{placed in a}} continuous line. The open areas between the buildings accommodate different types of public areas, while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond the avenue, such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate. The buildings lining the avenue range in height from three to six <b>stories,</b> <b>with</b> the higher stories set back from the street line. There is also a two-story, domed atrium housing shops and restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} known for its prosperity, with shaded streets, gardens, and markets. It {{contained}} high-rise residential buildings, some seven storeys tall, which could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. Al-Muqaddasi in the 10th century described them as Minarets, while Nasir Khusraw in the early 11th century described some of them rising up to 14 <b>stories,</b> <b>with</b> roof gardens on the top storey complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigation.|$|E

It was also remade in Malayalam as Hridayam Oru Kshethram (1976), and in Kannada as Kumkuma Rakshe (1977). The former was directed by P. Subramaniam while the latter was by S. K. A. Chari.|$|E

5|$|The game is set during World War II and the {{campaign}} mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three <b>stories,</b> <b>with</b> a total of twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the regenerating health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a Doric column. It is divided into four <b>stories</b> <b>with</b> a spiral stairway, and topped by a gallery carrying the lantern. The keeper's cottages are three one story cottages, sharing a roof. Other structures which still stand at the location are a circa 1930 privy and workshop built in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her <b>stories,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Tenar, were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used. The Tombs of Atuan examines the development of a young girl in great detail, a choice unusual for a fantasy writer of the period in which the book was written.|$|E
