'There {{never was}} a dearer or a blesseder young lady than is my young lady, Sir,' said Susan, 'and I ought to {{know a great deal}} better than some for I have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her grief and I have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her joy (there's not been much of it) and I have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> with her brother and I have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her {{loneliness}} and some have never <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and I say to some and all--I do!' and here the black-eyed shook her head, and slightly stamped her foot; 'that she's the blessedest and dearest angel is Miss Floy that ever drew the breath of life, the more that I was torn to pieces Sir the more I'd say it though I may not be a Fox's Martyr..' ...|$|R

60|$|The {{spelling}} is correct, for I have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> write it. No {{doubt she}} had been named by ear; but she so splendidly bore the orthography that Tom Moore himself (had he <b>seen</b> <b>her)</b> would have endorsed the phonography.|$|R
60|$|He had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> before either I or the {{gardener}} had <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> though we knew {{which way to}} look, and he didn't. I began to think him rather a quicker man than {{he appeared to be}} at first sight.|$|R

6000|$|... "I deny it. I utterly deny it," [...] said Eleanor, {{jumping from}} her seat and {{literally}} flashing before Mr. Arabin, as {{she stood on the}} drawing-room floor. He had never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so excited, he had never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look half so beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{when you}} know all. I have been wanting to speak about this, and I am glad the subject is begun. The reason, of course, is Eustacia Vye. Well, I confess I have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> lately, and have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> a good many times." ...|$|R

5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} <b>see</b> <b>her</b> alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
5|$|Tosca {{arrives in}} time to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> lover taken to an {{antechamber}} to be tortured. He is able to speak briefly with her, telling her to say nothing.

60|$|Mr. Guppy stares. Lady Dedlock sits {{before him}} looking him through, {{with the same}} dark shade upon her face, in the same {{attitude}} even to the holding of the screen, with her lips a little apart, her brow a little contracted, {{but for the moment}} dead. He <b>sees</b> <b>her</b> consciousness return, <b>sees</b> a tremor pass across her frame like a ripple over water, <b>sees</b> <b>her</b> lips shake, <b>sees</b> <b>her</b> compose them by a great effort, <b>sees</b> <b>her</b> force herself back to the knowledge of his presence and of what he has said. All this, so quickly, that her exclamation and her dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those long-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs, which, struck by the air like lightning, vanish in a breath.|$|R
5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially well off.

Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan.

Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E

The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although {{this may have been}} justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot <b>see</b> <b>her</b> any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
