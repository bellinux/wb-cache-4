In this paper, we proposed a new grey-based approach to deal with <b>selection</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The work procedure is shown as follows briefly: First, the weight and rating of attribute for all alternatives are described by linguistic variables that can be expressed in grey number.

40|$|Supplier {{selection}} {{is an important}} component of supply chain management in today’s global competitive environment. Hence, the evaluation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> have received considerable attention in the literature. Many attributes of suppliers, other than cost, are considered in the evaluation and selection process. Therefore, the process of evaluation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> is a multi-criteria decision making process. The methodology adopted to solve the supplier selection problem is intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution). Generally, TOPSIS is based on the concept of minimum distance from the positive ideal solution and maximum distance from the negative ideal solution. We examine the deficiencies of using only one metric function in TOPSIS and propose the use of spherical metric function in addition to the commonly used metric functions. For empirical supplier selection problems, more than one metric function should be used...|$|E
