25|$|<b>Stonebrood</b> (Aspergillosis larvae apium) is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. It causes mummification of the brood of a honey bee colony. The fungi are common soil {{inhabitants}} {{and are also}} pathogenic to other insects, birds, and mammals. The disease is difficult to identify {{in the early stages}} of infection. The spores of the different species have different colours and can also cause respiratory damage to humans and other animals. When bee larvae take in spores, they may hatch in the gut, growing rapidly to form a collar-like ring near the larval heads. After death, the larvae turn black and become difficult to crush, hence the name <b>stonebrood.</b> Eventually, the fungus erupts from the integument of the larvae and forms a false skin. In this stage, the larvae are covered with powdery fungal spores. Worker bees clean out the infected brood and the hive may recover depending on factors such as the strength of the colony, the level of infection, and hygienic habits of the strain of bees (variation in the trait occurs among different subspecies/races).|$|E

A disinfection of the honeycombs and utensils is recommended for an extensive disease outbreak.|$|E
40|$|Chalkbrood and <b>stonebrood</b> are two fungal {{diseases}} {{associated with}} honey bee brood. Chalkbrood, caused by Ascosphaera apis, {{is a common}} and widespread disease that can result in severe reduction of emerging worker bees and thus overall colony productivity. <b>Stonebrood</b> is caused by Aspergillus spp. that are rarely observed, so the impact on colony health is not very well understood. A major concern {{with the presence of}} Aspergillus in honey bees is the production of airborne conidia, which can lead to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary aspergilloma, or even invasive aspergillosis in lung tissues upon inhalation by humans. In the current chapter we describe the honey bee disease symptoms of these fungal pathogens. In addition, we provide research methodologies and protocols for isolating and culturing, in vivo and in vitro assays that are commonly used to study these host pathogen interactions. We give guidelines on the preferred methods used in current research and the application of molecular techniques. We have added photographs, drawings and illustrations to assist bee-extension personnel and bee scientists in the control of these two diseases.

40|$|<b>Stonebrood</b> is {{a disease}} of honey bee larvae caused by fungi from the genus Aspergillus. As very few {{studies have focused on}} the {{epidemiological}} aspects of <b>stonebrood</b> and diseased brood may be rapidly discarded by worker bees, it is possible that a high number of cases go undetected. Aspergillus spp. fungi are ubiquitous and associated with disease in many insects, plants, animals and man. They are regarded as opportunistic pathogens that require immunocompromised hosts to establish infection. Microbiological studies have shown high prevalences of Aspergillus spp. in apiaries which occur saprophytically on hive substrates. However, the specific conditions required for pathogenicity to develop remain unknown. In this study, an apiary was screened to determine the prevalence and diversity of Aspergillus spp. fungi. A series of dose–response tests were then conducted using laboratory reared larvae to determine the pathogenicity and virulence of frequently occurring isolates. The susceptibility of adult worker bees to Aspergillus flavus was also tested. Three isolates (A. flavus, Aspergillus nomius and Aspergillus phoenicis) of the ten species identified were pathogenic to honey bee larvae. Moreover, adult honey bees were also confirmed to be highly susceptible to A. flavus infection when they ingested conidia. Neither of the two Aspergillus fumigatus strains used in dose–response tests induced mortality in larvae and were the least pathogenic of the isolates tested. These results confirm the ubiquity of Aspergillus spp. in the apiary environment and highlight their potential to infect both larvae and adult bees...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of aspergillosis in humans and various animal species has {{increased over the}} last decades. Aspergillus species are found worldwide in humans and in almost all domestic animals and birds {{as well as in}} many wild species, causing a wide range of diseases from localized infections to fatal disseminated diseases, as well as allergic responses to inhaled conidia. Some prevalent forms of animal aspergillosis are invasive fatal infections in sea fan corals, <b>stonebrood</b> mummification in honey bees, pulmonary and air sac infection in birds, mycotic abortion and mammary gland infections in cattle, guttural pouch mycoses in horses, sinonasal infections in dogs and cats, and invasive pulmonary and cerebral infections in marine mammals and nonhuman primates. This article represents a comprehensive overview of the most common infections reported by Aspergillus species and the corresponding diseases in various types of animals...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro antimycotic activity of 17 chemically defined essential oils (EOs) both alone and as a mixture, against agents responsible for <b>stonebrood</b> caused by Aspergillus flavus, and chalkbrood caused by Ascosphaera apis in European honeybees. Cinnamomum zeylanicum yielded the lowest MIC value against A. flavus, but was not effective against A. apis, while Litsea cubeba and Pelargonium graveolens appeared to be effective against all checked fungi. Aspergillus niger showed the lower sensitivity. Two mixtures composed by L. cubeba, C. zeylanicum and Cymbopogon flexuosus (M 1) and by L. cubeba, C. zeylanicum, P. graveolens and C. flexuosus (M 2), respectively, were tested, both resulting effective. The components of M 1 showed a synergistic effect. The use of mixtures allowed to decrease the total amount of EOs. The use of these products could be of interest for an alternative natural approach in honeybee disease management...|$|E
40|$|Evolution of {{virulence}} in parasites has profound {{effects on}} both host-parasite co-evolution and ecology and {{is influenced by}} environmental factors and the genotypes involved. Many parasite infections consist of multiple strains or species that are predicted to result {{in the evolution of}} more virulent strains that exploit the host less prudently. In opportunistic parasites, the dynamics and evolution of virulence are poorly understood as traditional epidemiological models do not adequately describe parasites capable of persisting outside of the host. In addition, as microbial pathogenicity may shift from opportunistic to obligatory strategies with time, knowledge of the evolutionary dynamics of opportunistic pathogens is crucial for predicting and understanding disease emergence. Aspergillus species of fungi have a ubiquitous distribution and are the etiological agents of <b>stonebrood</b> disease in honey bees. It is generally considered that <b>stonebrood</b> occurs rarely in honey bees, but the epidemiology and predisposing conditions for the disease are almost entirely unknown. In this study, I examine the occurrence, pathogenicity and competitive ability of Aspergillus spp. when infecting honey bees, as well as the effect of nutrition on host susceptibility and the adaptation of the fungi over the course of experimental evolution. A high prevalence and diversity of Aspergillus spp. isolates were identified following the screening of an apiary, and the pathogenicity of three species (A. flavus, A. nomius and A. phoenicis) was established. Further, in laboratory-reared larvae a nutritionally limited diet increased susceptibility to A. fumigatus. In a series of single-generation interspecific competition experiments between Aspergillus spp. and the obligate pathogen chalkbrood (Ascophaera apis), the virulence and fitness of dual infections were influenced by complex within-host interactions depending on the species involved, which ranged from synergistic to inhibitory effects. Finally, following serial passage of A. flavus and A. phoenicis in the honey bee larval hosts to determine the evolution of virulence and fitness, no evidence of host adaptation was observed, revealing the unpredictability of these asexually reproducing opportunistic pathogens. These findings illustrate a complex relationship between Aspergillus spp. and honey bees and emphasises the significant influence these ubiquitous organisms can have on the ecology and evolution of honey bees...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe genetic {{basis of}} host {{resistance}} to parasites {{is a fundamental}} aspect of host-parasite co-evolution, yet the precise mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we follow on from a previous study on the genetically mediated variation in resistance to two common fungal brood parasites that cause chalkbrood and <b>stonebrood</b> in the honey bee. We assessed whether genetically mediated variation in resistance {{can be explained by}} the baseline immunocompetence of different larval genotypes by correlating the constitutive expression of two key immune genes with the observed level of resistance of each larval genotype to four different fungal brood parasites. We found significant variation between larval genotypes in the constitutive expression of abaecin but not defensin 2, but despite a suggestion of negative correlations between gene expression and resistance level in older larvae, there was no consistent evidence that baseline abaecin expression is a relevant predictor of resistance to these parasites. These results suggest that the constitutive expression of abaecin appears to have a genetic basis in honey bee larvae but that mechanisms other than innate expression of antimicrobial peptides might be more important in defence against the specific fungal brood parasites assessed here...|$|E
40|$|Parasites {{are thought}} to be a major driving force shaping genetic {{variation}} in their host, and are suggested to be a significant reason for the maintenance of sexual reproduction. A leading hypothesis for the occurrence of multiple mating (polyandry) in social insects is that the genetic diversity generated within-colonies through this behavior promotes disease resistance. This benefit is likely to be particularly significant when colonies are exposed to multiple species and strains of parasites, but host-parasite genotypic interactions in social insects are little known. We investigated this using honey bees, which are naturally polyandrous and consequently produce genetically diverse colonies containing multiple genotypes (patrilines), and which are also known to host multiple strains of various parasite species. We found that host genotypes differed significantly in their resistance to different strains of the obligate fungal parasite that causes chalkbrood disease, while genotypic variation in resistance to the facultative fungal parasite that causes <b>stonebrood</b> disease was less pronounced. Our results show that genetic variation in disease resistance depends in part on the parasite genotype, as well as species, with the latter most likely relating to differences in parasite life history and host-parasite coevolution. Our results suggest that the selection pressure from genetically diverse parasites might be an important driving force in the evolution of polyandry, a mechanism that generates significant genetic diversity in social insects...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the occurrence of honeybee diseases in Incheon area, {{at the point of}} great wide-spread of sacbrood disease in the country. Sixteen resident beekeeping apiaries; 3 native honeybee and 13 European honeybee apiaries were selected for this research. Over 20 adult bees were evenly collected from the most colonies of each apiary three times (March, June, November) within a year. In this work, 13 honeybee diseases including 7 viral diseases, 2 bacterial diseases, 2 fungal diseases, and 2 parasitic diseases were detected by preliminary inspections and PCR. As a result, viral infections were confirmed at 34 among 48 apiaries (70. 8 %) over the entire examination period. Parasitic diseases showed the high-est detection rate of 45. 8 %, which are detected in 44 among 96 cases. In the seasonal prevalence, 30 cases (15. 6 %) of 7 pathogens were detected from 14 apiaries in March, 50 cases (24. 0 %) of 9 pathogens and 56 cases (26. 9 %) of 9 pathogens were detected from all apiaries in June and November, respectively. Nosema was shown to be the most prevalent pathogen from March to November, followed by sacbrood virus (SBV) and <b>stonebrood.</b> The spread of SBV infection in Incheon would be under-estimated by the increasing of detection rate over the time. Especially, Chinese sacbrood virus was de-tected from 4 European honybee apiaries, but clinical symptoms were not found. No chalkbrood, acute bee paralysis virus, and chronic bee paralysis virus were detected in this study. The effective therapy and preventive measures should be prepared for beekeeping industry...|$|E
