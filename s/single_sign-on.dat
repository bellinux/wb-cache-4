This paper presents results {{of the development of}} the Authorisation (AuthZ) infrastructure for on-demand multidomain network resource provisioning (NRP). We propose a general Complex Resource Provisioning (CRP) model that {{can be used as a}} basis for AuthZ infrastructure development providing a common abstraction for provisioning both network and Grid resources. This model allows common policy expressions, using <b>single</b> user <b>sign-on</b> credentials when requesting and accessing complex Grid-Network resources. The implementation described is based on the generic AAA Authorisation Framework (GAAA-AuthZ) and suggests a number of security mechanisms and components that extends GAAA-AuthZ to achieve consistent policy enforcement and security context management: Token Validation Service (TVS), AuthZ ticket used for AuthZ session management, a special XACML profile for NRP, reference model for policy obligations handling (OHRM). The proposed infrastructure and solutions are being implemented in the framework of the EU project Phosphorus and use authors experiences gained from the major Grid based and Grid oriented projects...|$|R

40|$|Evolving {{communication}} technologies stimulate a {{rapid growth}} in utilisation of communication-capable devices and therefore amount of transmitted data. This imposes new requirements for automatic device and data management necessary for successful exploitation of new opportunities. Unfortunately, currently developed systems, including Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine communications, mainly focus on industrial applications that involve fixed users, proprietary environments as well as ad-hoc devices and things, whereas regular users along with possibilities and challenges created by growing sets of personal user equipment remain ignored. This thesis addresses the defined problem by analysing currently developed and utilised communication technologies and identity management systems as well as proposing an advanced identity management system that considers user-related needs and enables user-aware automatic device-to-device communications. Our system is unique compared to other automatic communication systems in that it enables global communication of devices owned or used by different parties and supports dynamic connection and relationship establishment based on data administered in a sophisticated identity management infrastructure. Unlike existing identity management mechanisms, our system extends {{the notion of an}} identified and authenticated entity to a combination of both user and device. Furthermore, the system introduces an original <b>Single</b> Device <b>Sign-On</b> feature that simplifies user login procedure when accessing a service with multiple devices. As a consequence, this thesis suggests a new direction for evolution of communication technologies as well as user-targeted Internet-based services and applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{managing}} {{access to}} information systems (ISs) required direct interaction with {{a limited number of}} users. Increasingly, managing access involves handling an increased numbers of internal and external students, faculty, and staff as well as partners such as workforce development centers, the U. S. Department of Education, and the Council on Higher Education Accreditation. At Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU), the approach to identity management (IdM) required the distribution of a username and password to authenticate MnSCU employees and students. Authentication enables authorized users to access campus-supported ISs and Office of the Chancellor (OOC) supported ISs such as the Integrated Statewide Record System (ISRS). In some cases, an MnSCU employee or student will receive as many as 7 usernames and passwords. When a new employee or student joins MnSCU, the campus IT group creates a general log-on to campus-supported ISs. This log-on consists of a username and password and provides the new employee or student with access to a local area network (LAN) hosted application such as e-mail and campus directory services. The author used Minnesota State College-Southeast Technical (MSC-ST) as the unit of analysis. In this inquiry, the following propositions guided and shaped the case study data collection: (a) system development processes (SDPs), (b) <b>single</b> access <b>sign-on</b> credentials through all MSC-ST ISs, (c) electronic data assurances, and (d) implementation across public and private security zones. The findings from this case study were used to develop a paradigm supporting the design and development of an IdM system model at MSC-ST. This model contributed to the establishment of a uniform IdM system for use by MSC-ST students, staff, and faculty regardless of time and location. Based on findings from this case study, key processes involved in establishing this IdM system based on uniform identities and authentication processes were documented. Key steps involved in facilitating secure IS access to MSC-ST resources by students, staff, and faculty accessing OOC-supported ISs as well as MSC-ST campus-specific applications were described. The author contributed to advancements in the IS space {{through the use of a}} replicable approach for implementing an IdM paradigm at MSC-ST...|$|R
