In this work, a methodology, based on a new and extended use of tolerance charting, that allows incorporation of in-process inspection operations to improve process plans is presented. The methodology proposes {{the transfer of the}} manufacturing <b>specification</b> <b>tolerance</b> between surfaces to specification tolerances established between these surfaces and a common reference system. In this way, all variability sources originated by part locating and fixturing can be separately considered from the ones originated by the process-machine system.

40|$|Abstract: Process {{capability}} indices Cp and Cpk {{have been}} widely used to provide numerical measures on process potential and process performance. While Cp measures process variation relative to the <b>specification</b> <b>tolerance,</b> which only reflects process potential, Cpk considers process variation as well as process centering, which gives an approximate measure of process yield. In this paper, the statistical properties of the estimated Cpk for two classes of stable processes are investigated under different real-world conditions: (1) normal processes with constant mean, and (2) normal processes with known probability P (µ ≥ m) = p, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, where m is the mid-point of the specification interval. For the two classes of processes, the distributions, the probability density functions, the asymptotic behaviors, and other statistical properties of their estimators are derived...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fuzzy process {{capability}} indices {{are used to}} determine whether a production process is capable of producing items within <b>specification</b> <b>tolerance,</b> where instead of precise quality we have two membership functions for specification limits. In practice these indices are estimated using sample data and it is of interest to obtain confidence limits for fuzzy capability index given a sample estimate. After introducing 100 (1 − α) % fuzzy confidence interval by Parchami et al. in 2005 and 2006, for fuzzy capability index ˜ Cp, our observation leads us to propound an open problem about the consistency property for interval estimation of ˜ Cp. In this paper we redefine some concepts about fuzzy confidence interval and then we show the consistency property of the fuzzy confidence interval proposed by Parchami et al. in 2006 holds for almost every α in [0, 1]...|$|E
40|$|Cpk, and Cpm, {{have been}} {{proposed}} to provide numerical measures on manufacturing potential and actual perfor-mance. Combining the advantages of those indices, a more advanced index Cpmk is proposed, taking the pro-cess variation, centre of the <b>specification</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and the proximity to the target value into account, which {{has been shown to}} be a useful capability index for manufac-turing processes with two-sided specification limits. In this paper, we consider the estimation of Cpmk, and we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the lower confidence bounds on Cpmk based on the estimation, which presents ameasure on theminimummanufacturing capability of the process based on the sample data. We also provide tables for practitioners to use in measuring their processes. A real-world example of current trans-mitters taken from a microelectronics device manufac-turing process is investigated to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

40|$|During routine {{inspections}} of the Space Shuttle's Main Propulsion System (MPS) Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) pre-valve, the mechanism provided {{to maintain the}} valve {{in the open position}} was found cracked. The mechanism is a Vespel roller held against the valve visor by a stack of Belleville springs. The roller has been found cracked 3 times. All three instances were in the same valve in the same location. There are 6 pre-valves on each orbiter, and only one has exhibited this problem. Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of <b>specification</b> <b>tolerance</b> stack up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress riser. The detent assembly was removed and replaced with parts that were on the low-side of the tolerance stack up to eliminate the potential for high loads on the detent roller.

40|$|ABSTRACT MICROWAVE FILTER DESIGN: COUPLED LINE FILTER by ??? Michael S. Flanner 2011 Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Electronic Engineering Option California State University, Chico Spring 2011 Radio Frequency (RF) filters {{operating}} in the microwave frequency range are needed for applications including wireless and satellite communications as well as military applications. These applications demand high performance filters that will contribute {{as little as possible}} to a system???s size and cost. Advances in materials used to construct these filters have played a significant part in meeting these demands. Planar and dielectric resonator filters are among the filter types which benefit from higher quality dielectric materials. Planar, or printed circuit board (PCB) based filters are popular and relatively practical to design. This paper presents the design and test of a planar coupled line filter constructed from relatively high quality dielectric material. The bandpass coupled line filter presented here is specified to have a midband at 1. 69 GHz and bandwidth of 0. 169 GHz. Passband insertion and return loss is specified to be 10 dB respectively. The design was derived from standard filter design theory and formula available in the literature. An optimized computer aided (CAD) design was also generated for comparison. The ???Microwave Office??? design software was provided by Applied Wave Research Inc., operating with an educational license. Both formula and simulation based designs had nearly identical physical structure and performance under simulation. A prototype of the design was manufactured and tested on the bench using an Agilent 8714 ES RF Network Analyzer (3. 0 GHz). The measured passband insertion loss was < 3. 6 dB, meeting the specified goal and consistent with expected response based on simulation. Placement of the filter???s midband was offset from the expected value. This was most likely a result of wide tolerance in the dielectric permittivity specified for the PCB substrate. Also the filter???s bandwidth was wider than expected. Possible causes might have been the test equipment calibration, impedance mismatch amongst the measurement system???s cables and adapters, or trace impedance errors resulting from structural defects in the etched microstrip lines. A coupled line RF filter was designed and working prototypes of the design performed well. Passband insertion loss measured well within the target specification. The filter owes its low signal loss to refined formula published in the literature {{as well as to the}} availability of the high quality PCB material sampled by Rogers Corporation. AWR???s simulation software was also helpful in the design process. The simulation software saved design time and effort by allowing pre-production verification of the design. The software also allowed various design iterations to be explored much more quickly than would have otherwise been possible. Differences between simulated and prototype performance likely resulted from material <b>specification</b> <b>tolerance,</b> possible errors in transmission line trace structure, as well as other possibly measurement related factors. Measured passband insertion loss was less than 3. 6 dB, exceeding the target spec of 5 dB maximum. Measured midband was 1. 61 GHz, showing an offset from the target 1. 69 GHz. Measured bandwidth was 206 kHz, which was wider than the target 169 kHz. Performance could be further improved with refinements to the design and the construction material. The design equations could be further optimized by taking into account field fringing effects and by obtaining precise material specs from the PCB manufacturer. Redoing the filter on substrate with lower specified dissipation factor (i. e. higher quality factor) could further reduce signal loss. The material used here had a quality factor approximately double that of standard FR- 4 board material. Even higher quality material is available. The result should be an excellent and practical filter which can be designed without the need for expensive CAD toolsCSU, Chic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTolerances of {{components}} can accumulate {{to result in}} quality variations when these components are assembled. One {{way to reduce the}} assembled variation is to tighten <b>tolerance</b> <b>specifications</b> of each component that, however, increases product cost. This paper investigates the effect of grouping for components with uniform and normal distributions by the developed “grouped random assembly” method. It is a method that first sorts and divides components into several groups and then assemble each group with corresponding group in order to reducing assembly tolerance. Distribution of resultant dimension based on the “grouped random assembly” approach is then analyzed. The results showed that, without changing components’ <b>tolerance</b> <b>specifications,</b> assembly <b>tolerance</b> depends on the number of grouping. Tolerance stack-up can be dramatically reduced with a suitable grouping strategy. The merit of this research is to develop a theoretical foundation for the grouped random assembly method.
