40|$|Abstract. Mobile phones become popular, and Android is {{the most}} popular open source mobile platform. To protect the mobile user’s {{security}} and privacy, it is necessary for us to adopt certain secure <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism. Regrettably, existing <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism failed to provide more stronger security. In this paper, we present a method to strength the screen lock’s security. Our evaluation shows that our <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> is stronger than the existing mechanism...|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} feature of the xscreensaver daemon's design is that the display modes are sandboxed into a separate process from the <b>screen</b> <b>locking</b> framework. This means that a programming error {{in one of the}} graphical display modes cannot compromise the screen locker itself (e.g., a crash in a display mode will not un-lock the screen).|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons why {{smartphone}} users do not adopt <b>screen</b> <b>locking</b> mechanisms is due to the inefficiency of entering a PIN/pattern each time they use their phone. To address this problem we designed a context-sensitive <b>screen</b> <b>locking</b> application which asked participants to enter a PIN/pattern only when necessary, and evaluated its impact on efficiency and satisfaction. Both groups of participants, who prior to the study either locked or did not lock their phone, adopted our application and felt that unlocking their phone only when necessary was more efficient, did not annoy them and offered a reasonable level of security. Participants responded positively to the option of choosing when a PIN/pattern is required in different contexts. Therefore, we recommend that designers of smartphone locking mechanisms should consider ceding a reasonable level of control over security settings to users to increase adoption and convenience, while keeping smartphones reasonably secure...|$|R

30|$|Some sensors, like {{accelerometer}} and gyroscope, {{seem less}} sensitive {{compared to other}} device features like GPS location, device ID, and network access. Mainstream mobile platforms, like Android, set no restrictions on accessing these innocuous sensors. However, when a user uses the device in regular patterns, things become more complicated. For example, when the user touches the screen to enter her <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> password, the accelerometer may reveal regular patterns [1]. Recent studies [1 – 10] have shown that, by utilizing these innocuous sensors, attackers are able to infer users’ behavior patterns and launch severe privacy inference attacks, such as keylogging [1, 2], inferring user activity [4], profiling [6], and tracking [9]. For example, [4] demonstrates the feasibility for a malicious app to infer the smartphone user’s transportation mode, i.e., whether the user is stationary, walking, running, biking, or in motorized transport, by utilizing the onboard accelerometer. Indeed, privacy inference attacks based on innocuous sensors is an emerging and severe threat on smart devices.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an Electroencephalogram based Brain Computer Interface as a new {{modality}} for Person Authentication and develop a <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> application that will lock and unlock the computer screen at the users will. The brain waves of the person, recorded in real time are used as password to unlock the screen. Data fusion from 14 sensors of the Emotiv headset is done to enhance the signal features. The power spectral density of the intermingle signals is computed. The channel spectral power in the frequency band of alpha, beta and gamma {{is used in the}} classification task. A two stage checking is done to authenticate the user. A proximity value of 0. 78 and above is considered a good match. The percentage of accuracy in classification is found to be good. The essence of this work is that the authentication is done in real time based on the meditation task and no external stimulus is used...|$|E
40|$|A large {{variety of}} {{security}} tools exist for Smartphones, {{to help their}} owners to secure the phones and prevent unauthorised others from accessing their data and services. These range from <b>screen</b> <b>locks</b> to antivirus software to password managers. Yet many Smartphone owners do not use these tools despite their being free and easy to use. We were interested in exploring this apparent anomaly. A number of researchers have applied existing models of behaviour from other disciplines {{to try to understand}} these kinds of behaviours in a security context, {{and a great deal of}} research has examined adoption of <b>screen</b> <b>locking</b> mechanisms. We review the proposed models and consider how they might fail to describe adoption behaviours. We then present the Integrated Model of Behaviour Prediction (IMBP), a richer model than the ones tested thus far. We consider the kinds of factors that could be incorporated into this model in order to understand Smartphone owner adoption, or rejection, of security tools. The model seems promising, based on existing literature, and we plan to test its efficacy in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Blind {{mobile device}} users face {{security}} risks such as inaccessible authentication methods, and aural and visual eavesdropping. We interviewed 13 blind smartphone users {{and found that}} most participants were unaware of or not concerned about potential security threats. Not a single participant used optional authentication methods such as a password-protected <b>screen</b> <b>lock.</b> We addressed the high risk of unauthorized user access by developing PassChords, a non-visual authentication method for touch surfaces that is robust to aural and visual eavesdropping. A user enters a PassChord by tapping several times on a touch surface {{with one or more}} fingers. The set of fingers used in each tap defines the password. We give preliminary evidence that a four-tap PassChord has about the same entropy, a measure of password strength, as a four-digit personal identification number (PIN) used in the iPhone’s Passcode Lock. We conducted a study with 16 blind participants that showed that PassChords were nearly three times as fast as iPhone’s Passcode Lock with VoiceOver, suggesting that PassChords are a viable accessible authentication method for touch screens...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{smartphones}} {{are shipped}} with various embedded motion sensors, {{such as the}} accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation sensors. These motion sensors are useful in supporting the mobile UI innovation and motion-based commands. However, they also bring potential risks of leaking user’s private information as they allow third party applications to monitor the motion changes of smartphones. In this paper, we study the feasibility of inferring a user’s tap inputs to a smartphone with its integrated motion sensors. Specifically, we utilize an installed trojan application to stealthily monitor the movement and gesture changes of asmartphoneusingitson-boardmotionsensors. Whenthe user is interacting with the trojan application, it learns the motion change patterns of tap events. Later, when the user is performing sensitive inputs, such as entering passwords on the touchscreen, the trojan application applies the learnt pattern to infer the occurrence of tap events on the touchscreen {{as well as the}} tapped positions on the touchscreen. For demonstration, we present the design and implementation of TapLogger, a trojan application for the Android platform, which stealthily logs the password of <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> and the numbers entered during a phone call (e. g., credit card and PIN numbers). Statistical results are presented to show the feasibility of such inferences and attacks...|$|E
40|$|As {{information}} technology pervades our lives we have increasingly {{come to rely}} on these evermore sophisticated and ubiquitous items of equipment. Portability and the desire to be connected around the clock has driven the rapid growth in adoption of mobile devices that enable us to talk, message, tweet and inform at will, whilst providing a means to shop and administer bank accounts. These high value, high risk, desirable devices are increasingly the target of theft and improvement in their protection is actively sought by Governments and security agencies. Although forms of security are in place they are compromised by human reluctance and inability to administer them effectively. With typical users operating across multiple devices, including traditional desktop PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, they can regularly find themselves having a variety of devices open concurrently. Even if the most basic security is in place, there is a resultant need to repeatedly authenticate, representing a potential source of hindrance and frustration. This thesis explores the need for a novel approach to user authentication, which will reduce the authentication burden whilst providing a secure yet adaptive security mechanism; a so called Authentication Aura. It proposes that the latent security potential contained in surrounding devices and possessions in everyday life can be leveraged to augment security, and provides a framework for a distributed and cooperative approach. An experiment was performed to ascertain the technological infrastructure, devices and inert objects that surround individuals throughout the day. Using twenty volunteers, over a fourteen-day period a dataset of 1. 57 million recorded observations was gathered, which confirmed that between 6 am and 12 pm a significant device or possession is in near proximity 97. 84 % of the time. Using the data provided by the experiment as the basis for a simulation of the framework, it suggests a reduction of up to 80. 36 % in the daily number of required authentications for a user operating a device once every 30 minutes, with a 10 minute <b>screen</b> <b>lock</b> in place. Examining the influence of location alone indicated a reduction of 50. 74 % in user interventions lowering the average from 32 to 15. 76, the addition of the surroundings reducing this further to 13. 00. The analysis also investigated how a user’s own authentication status could be used to negate the need to repeatedly manually authenticate and it was found that it delayed the process for up to 90 minutes for an individual user. Ultimately, it confirms that during device activation it is possible to remove the need to authenticate with the Authentication Aura providing sufficient assurance. Orange/France Teleco...|$|E
