5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an outline of the corpse of a real giant. One story says the giant came from Denmark leading an invasion of the coast, and was beheaded by the people of Cerne Abbas while he <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hillside.|$|E
5|$|He {{acted in}} {{basement}} plays in New York's theatrical underground but was rejected for the Actors Studio as a teenager. Pacino then joined the Herbert Berghof Studio (HB Studio), {{where he met}} acting teacher Charlie Laughton (not {{to be confused with}} the British actor Charles Laughton), who became his mentor and best friend. In this period, he was often unemployed and homeless, and sometimes <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street, in theaters, or at friends' houses.|$|E
5|$|He {{was asked}} to leave the college in 1908 after {{offering}} a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she {{was caught in a}} snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E
60|$|Passing Avice's chamber he {{perceived}} {{that the little}} bed had not been <b>slept</b> <b>on.</b> At <b>the</b> door of the spare room he looked in. In one corner stood a walking-stick--his own.|$|R

5|$|Lin {{said that}} he understands Mandarin, though he could use some help {{speaking}} it; he can also read and write a little. He took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

5|$|There {{were six}} protests on 1 April 2009: a {{security}} operation at ExCeL London, a Stop the War march, a Free Tibet protest outside the Chinese Embassy, a People & Planet protest, a Climate Camp protest, and a protest outside the Bank of England. Over 4,000 protesters {{were at the}} Climate Camp and the same number at the Bank of England. On 1 April over 5,500 police officers were deployed and the following day 2,800, {{at a cost of}} £7.2 million. Officers worked 14-hour shifts. They ended at midnight, <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of police stations, were not given a chance to eat, and were back on duty at 7 am. This was viewed as having contributed to the difficulties they faced.|$|E
5|$|Though Lancashire was a {{football}} stronghold {{in the early}} years of the professional game, providing a large proportion of Football League teams, the cup final had never been contested between two Lancashire clubs until the 1904 final. 30,000 supporters from the region travelled to London, sparking press reports of records for North-South rail travel. Lacking alternative accommodation, several thousand <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platforms at Euston and St Pancras. A jovial atmosphere built up, with the Manchester Industrial Boys Band playing Hiawatha. However, in London itself, the match received less attention than a final featuring a southern team would have done. Tickets in an uncovered stand cost 5s.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to the Dominican Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E

60|$|With {{nothing of}} special {{importance}} to do, the whole crowd <b>slept</b> late <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following morning, which was Sunday. Dick Rover {{was glad to}} take it easy, but declined to have a physician when that was suggested.|$|R
5|$|The Germans {{occupied}} Le Touquet on 22 May 1940 and Wodehouse had {{to report}} to the authorities daily. After two months of occupation the Germans interned all male enemy nationals under 60, and Wodehouse was sent to a former prison in Loos, a suburb of Lille, on 21 July; Ethel remained in Le Touquet. The internees were placed four to a cell, each of which had been designed for one man. One bed was available per cell, which was made available to the eldest man—not Wodehouse, who <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> granite floor. The prisoners were not kept long in Loos before they were transported in cattle trucks to a former barracks in Liège which was run as a prison by the SS. After a week the men were transferred to Huy in Liège, Belgium, where they were incarcerated in the local citadel. They remained there until September 1940, when they were transported to Tost in Upper Silesia (then Germany, now Toszek in Poland).|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Andrianampoinimerina, Nanjakana {{enclosed}} five houses that served as residences for his children. The house called Nanjakana ("place of royalty") was built by Andriambelomasina and renovated by Andrianampoinimerina, who moved it into the compound and lived in it before succeeding to the throne. He renovated it for use by his son, Radama I, who slept here during visits to Ambohimanga after succeeding his father as King of Madagascar. According to oral history, a large stone near the Nanjakana house {{was used as a}} seat by Andriambelomasina and Andrianampoinimerina when reflecting on governance decisions. Andrianampoinimerina added a two-story house called Manambitana ("favored by fate") that was the largest of all the traditional houses at Ambohimanga. The king's children <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper floor during visits to the royal city, while the ground floor housed such royal property as palanquins and storage chests. This house was destroyed in the 1861 fire and was reconstructed under Rasoherina, who used it as a residence. After removing the historic Manandraimanjaka house from the Mahandrihono compound, Andrianampoinimerina built a new house with the same name in the Nanjakana compound. This was likewise destroyed in the 1861 fire, and was later rebuilt by Ranavalona II. Also destroyed in the fire was a house called Fohiloha ("short") that Ranavalona I had relocated from the royal compound in Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga in 1845; Fohiloha was later rebuilt by Rasoherina. Other buildings that Ranavalona I moved from the rova at Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga included Kelisoa ("beautiful little one") and Manantsara.|$|E

60|$|Off Cape Horn, what {{before had}} been very uncomfortable became a serious hardship. Drenched through and through by the spray of the sea at night.

25|$|The house {{features}} a tower {{where he could}} relax and read newspapers. His wife Augusta sometimes <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch on hot summer days beneath its copper roof. Several windows {{in the living room}} and vestibule were made from stained glass.|$|E
25|$|As night fell, the British, dispirited by {{the scale}} of losses, <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wet ground, ready to renew the combat in the morning. But about 5am the Rangiriri garrison—still with arms and {{ammunition}} and with an escape route open to the east—raised a white flag, expecting to talk terms with Cameron. British soldiers advanced on the redoubt and entered, shook hands with their combatants, then surprised the Māori by demanding they surrender all their arms and taking them prisoner.|$|E
25|$|As head of SNCC, Barry led {{protests against}} racial {{segregation}} and discrimination. After he left McComb, Barry's lobbied the state legislatures {{to try to}} convince them to vote to make the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) the recognized Democratic party of Mississippi in the 1964 Democratic National Convention. In a protest of their continuing disenfranchisement, African Americans had organized this party to prove that blacks wanted to vote and conducted a trial election. Barry <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boardwalk in Atlantic City the night after speaking to the New Jersey Legislature.|$|E
60|$|Yet the day {{passed without}} the storm coming, {{and that night}} the {{occupants}} of <b>the</b> batteaux <b>slept</b> soundly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore of a tiny bay opening up from the lake.

60|$|The {{bland and}} open-hearted {{proprietor}} of Bachelor's Hall <b>slept</b> <b>on</b> amidst <b>the</b> congenial accompaniments of rain, mud, dirt, damp, fog, and rats, {{until late in}} the day; when, summoning his valet Tom Scott to assist him to rise, and to prepare breakfast, he quitted his couch, and made his toilet. This duty performed, and his repast ended, he again betook himself to Bevis Marks.|$|R
25|$|Returning from Hampshire at {{the latter}} part of 1943, Bacon and Hall took the ground floor of 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, John Everett Millais' old house and studio.

Upon returning to Chicago, this employee drove to Gacy's house as he was in his yard and beat him. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the youth from further attacking Gacy and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality work.|$|E
