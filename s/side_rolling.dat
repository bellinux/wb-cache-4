40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} costly problem in the automotive industry due to tool fracture during the splines cold rolling of steel shafts. The objective is to study {{the cause of this}} failure and propose solutions that can be implemented in the workshop. The writing starts with a brief introduction of the companies involved in shafts production and problem solving. It introduces the cold rolling process and its advantages on splines manufacturing, and it goes through relevant material and process characteristics that help to determine the cause of tool fracture. In order to understand the process failure and production flow, it has been necessary to build up an Ishikawa diagram with possible tool fracture causes. After collecting and analysing the data about the machine tool, cold rolling process and work-piece and rolling tool materials, tests and experiments have been done. It has been considered that there is a rolling tool fatigue that causes tool fracture. Beside tool fracture, two more problems with production flow instability and the right <b>side</b> <b>rolling</b> tool have been detected. Testing the material hardness of the work-piece has shown continuous hardness fluctuations from the supplier. Rolling tool misalignment has been measured by using a vernier caliper measurement device. Rolling tools material hardness analysis shows that tool is very hard and it is possible to use a tougher material which responds better to cyclic loads. Leax has tried to solve the problem by testing another lubrication and tool coatings. A modal analysis test has been performed in order to find the natural frequency of the work-piece which possibly may lead to vibration and over loading one of the rolling tools. The conclusion that has been reached is that main cause of fracture is rolling tool fatigue due to cyclic loads and it is important to use other rolling tool material. The other two detected problems, production flow instability and rigth <b>side</b> <b>rolling</b> tool fracture, should be considered {{as a part of the}} problem in order to significantly increase tools life and stabilize production flow rate...|$|E

All the plates were rolled post welding. Residual strain profiles of the post weld rolled plates were measured, using the SALSA strain scanner, and the inplane stress were characterized.

Reverse rolling was found to be more effective in removing distortion while the stress profile did not show any significant reduction of the peak stress...|$|E

40|$|Purpose â€“ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the aerodynamics characteristics (especially the <b>side</b> force/moment and <b>rolling</b> characteristics), to analyze the impacts generated by different parameters of wrap-around fins (WAFs) and to find the corresponding mechanism. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The paper has adopted three different types of WAFs for the rocket configurations and the sub-regions dividedtechnology to investigate the lateral and rolling characteristics of WAFs, including the fins with variations in span to chord ratio, thickness,leading-edge sweep, curvature radius, fin numbers, setting angles and rotated angles. Simulations have been performed at Mach numbers from 3 to 4 through an angle-of-attack range of about 0 Â° to 10 Â° and at model rolling angles of 45 Â° to 90 Â°. Findings â€“ The paper shows that the WAF configurations can greatly improve the longitudinal stability and enhance the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics for the whole rocket. The total drag of the whole rocket is mainly stemmed from the body, while the drag generated by the WAF account for only about 7. 42 per cent. The extra <b>side</b> forces and <b>rolling</b> moments are due largely to the unequal pressure distributions on both sides of the fin (windward or leeward). Maintaining a certain negative setting angle (d) can effectively avoid the coning movement and improve the flight stability at high angles of attack. The size of the span and chord are two main factors in controlling the longitudinal characteristics. For the <b>side</b> force/moment and <b>rolling</b> characteristics, different geometric parameters of the WAFs have played different roles. Originality/value â€“ The paper provides the qualitative and quantitative analysis for different WAFs configurations by investigating the curves ofdifferent parameters and contouring of static pressure distributions. Findings can provide some suggestions for the designers for avoiding some significant dynamic problems, such as Magnus instability and roll rate variations during flight...|$|R
