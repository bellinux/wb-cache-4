25|$|FARC, {{which some}} had been {{perceived}} as relatively passive, in February {{began to show}} signs of what analysts considered renewed vigor. It made a series of attacks against small military units, which left at least three dozen casualties. Uribe <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> that FARC remained strong and had never retreated, and he credited Colombia's soldiers for previous successes against FARC activities.|$|E
25|$|During the 2000 {{election}} the CBC ran {{an extended}} documentary purporting to review Day's religious beliefs. In this documentary the CBC interviewed Professor Pliny Hayes, Chair of the Department of Natural Sciences at Red Deer College, {{who reported that}} Day <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> at the college that there is scientific proof {{that the world is}} about 6,000 years old and that early man co-existed with dinosaurs. Day {{filed a complaint with the}} CBC for the fact that he was at no time asked for comment on the matter.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the ideals}} of {{democracy}} are far from realised on the mainland. For example, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao once <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> that without real democracy, {{there is no guarantee}} of economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist who received the global 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, died in prison. Others, such as Qin Yongmin (秦永敏) of the Democracy Party of China, who was only released from prison after twelve years, do not praise the Xinhai Revolution. Qin Yongmin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao Zedong was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{committed}} to the Iraq War, but <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> in June 2007 that he would [...] "learn the lessons" [...] from the mistakes made in Iraq. Brown {{said in a letter}} published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold an inquiry into the war. He {{is also a member of}} the lobby group, Labour Friends of Israel.|$|E
500|$|Judo did not {{die with}} Kanō. Instead, during the 1950s, judo clubs sprang up {{throughout}} the world, and in 1964, judo was introduced as an Olympic sport in the Tokyo Olympics, and was reintroduced at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Kanō's posthumous reputation was therefore assured. Nonetheless, his true legacy was his idealism. As Kanō <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> given in 1934, [...] "Nothing under the sun is greater than education. By educating one person and sending him into the society of his generation, we make a contribution extending a hundred generations to come." ...|$|E
5000|$|Senator Tito Sotto <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{privilege}} <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> the Senate {{that the}} use of the over-the-counter drug [...] "Wari-Activ" [...] (muscle pain killer, also known as laughing gas) {{is one of the reasons}} for the death of 5 people in the concert.|$|R

500|$|Calhoun was {{consistently}} {{opposed to the}} War with Mexico, arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed the alarming and growing lust of the public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers, bloat executive powers and patronage, and saddle the republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation. Calhoun feared, moreover, that Southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered Mexican territories, as nearly happened with the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the war would detrimentally lead to the annexation of all of Mexico, which [...] would bring Mexicans into the country, whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms. He <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> on January 4, 1848: ...|$|E
500|$|France has {{explicitly}} {{called for}} a permanent seat in the UN for its close EU partner: [...] "Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influence—France {{would like to see}} them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council", French president Jacques Chirac <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> in Berlin in 2000. The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines also expressed his country's support for Germany's bid, together with Japan's. Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but {{as long as there is}} little sign that France and the UK will give up their own seats, Germany should also have a seat.|$|E

2500|$|Nasrallah <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> {{delivered}} in Beirut and aired on Al-Manar TV on 28 September 2001: [...] "What do the Jews want? They want security and money.

2500|$|Perry's 17th {{book was}} Monash: The Outsider Who Won a War, which was universally {{critically}} acclaimed. Former Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> to the National Archives of Australia on June 2007: 'This wonderful biography...is a superb work, and [...] the growing store {{of what can}} only be called epic Australian histories of that period.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, Schlafly <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, [...] "By getting married, {{the woman}} has consented to sex, and I don't think {{you can call it}} rape." [...] In an {{interview}} on March 30, 2006, she attributed improvement in women's lives during the last decades of the 20th century to labor-saving devices such as the indoor clothes dryer and disposable diapers.|$|E

5000|$|On Sunday, August 28, 2005, Chávez {{called on}} the U.S. Justice Department to {{investigate}} the matter: [...] "My {{government is going to}} take legal action in the United States," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> televised <b>speech.</b> [...] "If the U.S. government does not take the necessary steps, we will denounce the U.S. government at the United Nations and the Organization of American States".|$|R
2500|$|After more speeches {{against the}} Bill during early 1969, and with left-wing Labour members also against {{reforming}} the House of Lords {{because they wanted}} its abolition, Harold Wilson announced on 17 April that the Bill was being withdrawn. Wilson's statement was brief, with Powell intervening: [...] "Don't eat them too quickly", which provoked much laughter in the House. Later that day Powell <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> to the Primrose League: ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, he {{delivered}} an upbeat {{assessment of the}} economy, saying growth was healthy and the housing market was nearing a turnaround.

2500|$|She <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> at the United Nations {{that the}} Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant {{jihadist}} group {{may be trying}} to kill her, and later {{that there could be a}} conspiracy against her led by the US; Elisa Carrió dismissed such threats as mere conspiracy theories.

2500|$|In November 2005 McCain <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> {{that the}} U.S. {{government}} {{must do more}} to keep public support high for the war, and that more troops were needed, {{as well as a}} number of other changes in the U.S. approach to the war.

2500|$|President Nicolas Sarkozy {{felt that}} his {{victory in the}} 2007 presidential {{election}} gave him a mandate to carry out labour reforms, stating [...] "I said before I was elected what I would do," [...] and [...] "we will do these reforms {{because they have to}} be done."

60|$|His manner was admirable. He {{suggested}} sympathy without expressing it. He could {{convey to}} Ruth {{that he thought}} her a misunderstood and neglected wife while talking to her about the weather. He could make his own knight-errant attitude toward her perfectly plain without saying a word, merely by playing soft music {{to her on the}} piano; for he had the gift of saying more with his finger-tips than most men could have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>speech</b> carefully rehearsed.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1990s, {{much of the}} Jewish-black {{conflict}} {{centered on}} allegations of anti-Semitism made against studies of Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade and allegations that they were over-represented as prominent figures in it.

His comments drew widespread outrage and calls for his dismissal from his position.|$|R
500|$|McCarthy's methods {{also brought}} on the disapproval and {{opposition}} of many.
