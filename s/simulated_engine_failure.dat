5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a <b>simulated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of}} the crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>failure</b> {{represents}} a major safety concern to helicopter operations, {{especially in the}} critical flight phases of takeoff and landing from/to small, confined areas. As a result, the JAA and FAA both certificate a transport helicopter as either Category-A or Category-B according {{to the ability to}} continue its operations following <b>engine</b> <b>failures.</b> A Category-B helicopter must be able to land safely in the event of one or all <b>engine</b> <b>failures.</b> There is no requirement, however, for continued flight capability. In contrast, Category-A certification, which applies to multi-engine transport helicopters with independent engine systems, requires that they continue the flight with one engine inoperative (OEI). These stringent requirements, while permitting its operations from rooftops and oil rigs and flight to areas where no emergency landing sites are available, restrict the payload of a Category-A transport helicopter to a value safe for continued flight as well as for landing with one engine inoperative. The current certification process involves extensive flight tests, which are potentially dangerous, costly, and time consuming. These tests require the pilot to <b>simulate</b> <b>engine</b> <b>failures</b> at increasingly critical conditions, Flight manuals based on these tests tend to provide very conservative recommendations with regard to maximum takeoff weight or required runway length. There are very few theoretical studies on this subject to identify the fundamental parameters and tradeoff factors involved. Furthermore, a capability for real-time generation of OEI optimal trajectories is very desirable for providing timely cockpit display guidance to assist the pilot in reducing his workload and to increase safety in a consistent and reliable manner. A joint research program involving NASA Ames Research Center, the FAA, and the University of Minnesota is being conducted to determine OEI optimal control strategies and the associated optimal,trajectories for continued takeoff (CTO), rejected takeoff (RTO), balked landing (BL), and continued landing (CL) for a twin engine helicopter in both VTOL and STOL terminal-area operations. This proposed paper will present the problem formulation, the optimal control solution methods, and the key results of the trajectory optimization studies for both STOL and VTOL OEI operations. In addition, new results concerning the recently developed methodology, which enable a real-time generation of optimal OEI trajectories, will be presented in the paper. This new real-time capability was developed to support the second piloted simulator investigation on cockpit displays for Category-A operations being scheduled for the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator in June-August of 1995.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a CODAD {{propulsion}} plant configuration, with two diesel engines {{assigned to a}} shaft line, the power balancing between the two diesel engines is managed by the {{propulsion plant}} governor mainly by equally distributing the fuel mass flow between the two engines, without verifying the effective power delivered by each engine. If one of the diesel engines of a CODAD propulsion plant runs under faulty conditions, its power is different, also in case of equal fuel mass flow, from that delivered by the other (un-faulty) diesel engine of the same propulsion system. Usually this power unbalancing cannot be detected by the engines governor and then cannot be corrected, with the consequence that one engine of the system (the un-faulty one) runs in overloading conditions. In this paper an improvement of the CODAD propulsion plant governor logic is proposed in order to cancel or reduce the power unbalance determined by an engine working in faulty conditions. The proposed improved governor scheme has been tested by <b>simulating</b> different <b>engine</b> <b>failures</b> {{through the use of}} a suitable CODAD propulsion system simulator, developed by the authors, and by comparing the simulation results with those obtained in case of a conventional governor...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the subject}} is {{controversial}} and hotly debated, some believe shock cooling, as commonly explained, {{is nothing but a}} myth. This position is supported by the fact twin engine planes commonly experience ideal conditions for shock cooling during <b>simulated,</b> single <b>engine</b> <b>failures,</b> yet statistically show no difference in wear or damage distribution between engines. Equally, it has been pointed out the rate cylinder head temperatures drop off after a normal engine shutdown is often much faster than the usual rates deemed to present a shock cooling risk. Furthermore, others believe damage usually associated with shock cooling is actually caused by rapid throttle changes where fuel, which has been supercooled during high-altitude flight, is introduced into a very hot engine cylinder during descent, where rich of peak (as opposed to lean of peak) operation is considered the norm, thus causing higher operating temperatures. It is well established, high operating temperatures in of themselves, can contribute to excessive component wear and damage, which is typically associated with [...] "shock cooling". Given the available data, it strongly suggests [...] "shock cooling" [...] is nothing but a myth, at least in the context as commonly explained.|$|R

40|$|As long as {{the pilot}} is a key {{agent in charge of}} the flight, the {{definition}} of metrics able to predict his performance is a great challenge. Currently, online assessment of the aircrew performance relies on the aircraft state vector analysis. More recent approaches propose to refine this performance measurement by taking into account the pilots-aircraft interactions state vector (e. g. the pilot’s actions on his user interface) or the pilot’s physiological state vector. In this latter perspective, this preliminary study proposes to assess the benefits of using a standalone eye tracker in a light aircraft in real conditions. In spite of a sensitivity to light conditions and a definition of areas of interest limited to a part of the cockpit, the eye tracker has provided interesting behavioural (fixations) and physiological (pupillometry) measures in nominal (from take-off to landing) and degraded (provoke a <b>simulated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> and plane down toward the airfield) conditions.

40|$|Currently, online {{assessment}} of the aircrew performance focuses on behavioural data (flight data and pilot’s actions) and the detection may intervene too late for coping with the situation degradation. An early {{assessment of}} the pilot’s "internal state", based on physiological data collected from his autonomous nervous system (ANS) and predictive of his behaviour, is necessary.

40|$|A {{simulator}} {{study has}} been made to determine the effectiveness of a single instrument presentation as an aid to the pilot in controlling both rotation and climbout path in take-off. The instrument was basically an angle-of-attack indicator, biased with a total-pressure-rate input as a means of suppressing the phugoid oscillation. Linearized six-degree-of-freedom equations of motion were utilized in simulating a hypothetical supersonic transport as the test vehicle. Each of several experienced pilots performed a number of simulated take-offs, using conventional flight instruments and either an angle-of-attack instrument or the combined angle-of-attack and total-pressure-rate instrument. The pilots were able to rotate the airplane, with satisfactory precision, to the 15 deg. angle of attack required for lift-off when using either an angle-of-attack instrument or the instrument which combined total-pressure-rate with angle of attack. At least 4 to 6 second-S appeared to be required for rotation to prevent overshoot, particularly with the latter instrument. The flight paths resulting from take-offs with simulated engine failures were relatively smooth and repeatable within a reasonably narrow band when the combined angle-of-attack and total-pressure-rate instrument presentation was used. Some of the flight paths resulting from take-offs with the same engine-failure conditions were very oscillatory when conventional instruments and an angle-of-attack instrument were used. The pilots considered the combined angle-of-attack and total- pressure-rate instrument a very effective aid. Even though they could, with sufficient practice, perform satisfactory climbouts after <b>simulated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>failure</b> by monitoring the conventional instruments and making correction based on their readings, it was much easier to maintain a smooth flight path with the single combined angle-of-attack and total-pressure-rate instrument...|$|E
