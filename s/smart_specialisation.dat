5000|$|During {{his term}} as European Commissioner for Regional Policy (February 2010-November 2014) Johannes Hahn {{implemented}} {{the most ambitious}} and comprehensive reform of EU Regional Policy so far. The main achievement of the reform is the transformation of Regional Policy from a subvention- into a genuine investment policy, closely linked with EU economic governance and macro-economic conditions. This allows e.g. to modify programmes to support key structural reforms.The reform refocuses investments in the real economy and on priority areas which create sustainable jobs and foster growth such as the low carbon economy, support for small and medium enterprises, innovation & research, education and training. The introduction of clearly defined conditions {{as well as a}} better evaluation system make sure that the principle of [...] "better spending" [...] is actually safeguarded. Countries and regions will have to announce upfront what objectives they intend to achieve with the available resources and identify precisely how they will measure progress towards those goals. This will allow better monitoring and more focused investments.Based on the new regulation, European regions have developed so called <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> strategies to identify their particular strengths and potentials as the basis for investments. The adoption of smart specialistion strategy was an ex-ante conditionality for the approval of regional programs for the period 2014-2020.Despite cuts in the overall EU budget, EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn succeeded to keep the high level of financial support for strategic investments in the new period (2014-2020): Funding for regional and cohesion policy in 2014-2020 amounts to 351,8 billion Euro. Taking into account the national contribution of member states, and the leverage effect of financial instruments, the overall impact of investments is likely to be about 600 billion Euro.Parts of the reform were already implemented {{in the last year of}} the Barroso term. Thanks to increased flexibility, allowing reprogramming of structural funds, the reformed Cohesion Policy paid also an important role in overcoming coping with the economic crisis. Measures in this context were e.g. reallocation of unused funds for education, training and employment as well as for providing urgently needed liquidity for enterprises [...]The reform, endorsed by the Council and European Parliament with overwhelming majority and strongly supported also by stakeholders and the Committee of the Regions, established Hahn's reputation as a [...] "forward looking, bold reformer".|$|E

40|$|Introduction] The {{notion of}} 'smart specialisation' {{is set to}} become an {{important}} policy rationale in the upcoming structural funding period 2014 - 2020. Although the original academic concept of this policy approach was sectorally oriented and rooted {{in the analysis of}} the EU-US productivity gap (e. g. Foray et al. 2009), the concept is increasingly applied to regional contexts. Essential for the application of the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept in a regional context is the fact that regions are often faced with scarce resources and limited budgets which they should allocate according to external influences (e. g. global competition) and inherited structures (sectoral foci, linkages between sectors, innovation infrastructure). Therefore, and in accordance with the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> strategy (S 3), regional governments need to design policies {{in such a way as}} to support the most promising areas of present and future comparative advantage in order to foster regional prosperity. Although the ideas behind <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> are not entirely new on the regional level, the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept is going to expand its influence to regional innovation policy making. Thus, this contribution illuminates the interface between the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept and regional systems of innovation approach, since innovation is going to be a key issue in the next structural funding period. Key arguments for the usefulness of the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept in the field of the design of regional innovation policy making will be collected and three examples are presented in form of case studies. This contribution aims to demonstrate that the principles of <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> have been implicitly applied in certain European regions for years in form of future-oriented transformation processes. Likewise this contribution aims to illustrate how the experiences from these regions can contribute to policy learning. In doing so, the structure is the following: firstly, existing literature on the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept is revised and secondly, these findings are reconsidered with regard to the regional systems of innovation approach. In particular, if and how the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept will influence regional development processes and potentially regional innovation systems. Three key working theses adopt these ideas and guide the empirical analyses. Methodologically, the paper pursues a case study approach. The policy trajectories of three different case study regions are analysed within the innovation systems approach and conclusions are drawn concerning the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept. Finally, the paper closes with a conclusion, concerning the influencing potential of the <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> concept on regional innovation systems...|$|E

40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> is {{currently}} probably the largest innovation policy {{experiment in the}} world. Its aim is to move the EU less developed countries and regions on path of R&D based growth.

Yet, internationalization {{does not seem to}} be a crucial component in the design and development of Research and Innovation Strategies for <b>Smart</b> <b>Specialisation</b> (RIS 3), which is at odds with the strong dependence of the EU New Member States (EU- 13) on FDI and global value chains. Our analysis is grounded in the key ’stylized facts’ related to EU- 13 R&D&I activities, and the complex link between innovation and internationalization. Innovation systems in the EU- 13 are fragmented and based on largely public R&D systems and on predominantly production oriented foreign direct investment (FDI). This structural weakness calls for stronger support for innovation oriented activities and for the integration of global value chains (GVCs) and FDI into local innovation systems.

40|$|In recent years, <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> {{has been}} a key {{building}} block of regional economic and development policy across the European Union.

The progress of identifying regional smart specialisations is diversified. Fifteen Polish regions are registered in S 3 Platform, of which only five are peer-reviewed and eight have adopted RIS 3 priorities. Worth mentioning is the fact that specialisations identified at both national and regional level are convergent which indicates that both approaches selected effective specialisations, focused on whole country's economic growth.

40|$|Science and {{technology}} parks (STPs) are very common instruments used by {{regional and national}} authorities for regional development. Their main objective is to foster science-based growth poles to stimulate economic diversification away from declining industries. Today, STPs are present in many European regions. They concentrate {{a wide range of}} innovative companies and research organisations, and as a consequence the overall knowledge intensity of these places is very high. STPs are thus likely to include seeds for the domains of knowledge-intensive specialisation, on which regions can rely to increase their competitiveness. This is why STPs seem well placed to {{play a key role in}} innovation strategies for <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> (S 3). We argue that the diversity of STP models by definition means that their contribution to <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> is very likely to depend on the specific context. Three key roles for STPs in the design and implementation of <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> strategies are proposed: (1) STPs may provide an adequate innovation ecosystem for the development of pilot innovation initiatives, well in line with the entrepreneurial discovery process that should drive the regional economies towards new, distinctive and competitive areas of activities. (2) STPs can play an important role as one of the relevant stakeholders forming the quadruple helix of innovation actors shaping <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> strategies. (3) STPs can add the needed external and outward-looking dimension to <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> strategies, a dimension that is today still very much under-developed. Yet, these contributions from STPs cannot be taken for granted. We identify limitations and success conditions for each of the three roles. Illustrative examples of STPs in Finland, England and the Netherlands show how STPs can actively and creatively contribute to the design of innovation strategies and to the external connectivity of their home regions.

However, {{in order to understand}} why <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> is so important in the Cohesion Policy reform process, it is also necessary to understand {{the context in which the}} concept originally emerged, and then to identify how the concept is translated to the regional setting. We illustrate the types of issues arising by means of several examples of policy initiatives...|$|E

It emphasises the need for robust framework conditions, which allow market-driven allocation of innovation, capital and labour – only competitive and open markets are amenable to innovation. But <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> also establishes the need for government to listen to market signals when allocating budgets for investment in knowledge and innovation across different fields and sectors.   In November 2009, the European Commission published the report “Knowledge for Growth”, the results of an expert advisory group to the EU. Tasked with finding an alternative to public policies that were seen to spread public investments in knowledge and innovation – research, education, public support to business R&D, etc – thinly across technology research fields such as biotechnology, ICTs, and nanotechnology, the expert group proposed that national and, especially, regional governments should encourage investment in domains that would “complement the country’s other productive assets to create future domestic capability and interregional comparative advantage”. This strategic proposal was coined “smart specialisation” and it spread quickly and was adopted in the EU 2020 Agenda with its objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Indeed, Research and Innovation Strategies for <b>Smart</b> <b>Specialisation</b> (RIS 3) are proposed as an ex -ante conditionality for future EU Structural Fund Programmes 1 with a view to concentrate resources on research and innovation to maximize the impacts of the structural funds. However, the issues raised by <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> go far beyond the discussion in the EU context. A number of countries, within OECD or not, are now taking interest in <b>Smart</b> <b>Specialisation</b> as one way to lead their economies out of the crisis by leveraging regional dynamism in innovation led/knowledge - intensive economic development.  ...|$|E

It aims at supporting the implementation of regional <b>smart</b> <b>specialisation</b> strategies and the optimal and effective uptake of cohesion funds in the energy area. This report aims to foster cooperation amongst regions with common interest in a particular energy theme, which allows mutual learning amongst regions. Consequently, the objective of this work is to provide and test a methodology to identify similarities within a group of regions with a particular interest in wind energy. This analysis facilitates the identification of leading regions and regions with structural similarities and recommends potential partnerships amongst them. JRC.
