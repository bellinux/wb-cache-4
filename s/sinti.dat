5|$|On 10 December 1942, Himmler {{issued an}} order to send all <b>Sinti</b> and Roma (Gypsies) to {{concentration}} camps, including Auschwitz. A separate camp for Roma was set up at Auschwitz II-Birkenau known as the Zigeunerfamilienlager (Gypsy Family Camp). The first transport of German Gypsies arrived on 26 February 1943, and was housed in Section B-IIe of Auschwitz II. Approximately 23,000 Gypsies {{had been brought to}} Auschwitz by 1944, 20,000 of whom died there. One transport of 1,700 Polish <b>Sinti</b> and Roma were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, as they were suspected to be ill with spotted fever.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Nebe lent a {{commissioner}} in his Criminal Police Office, Christian Wirth of Stuttgart, to the euthanasia organisation, {{which ran}} the programme of involuntary euthanasia of the disabled. Also in 1939, {{as head of}} Kripo, {{he was involved in}} the discussions around the upcoming campaigns against the <b>Sinti</b> and Roma. Nebe wanted to include sending Berlin's Gypsies to the planned reservations for the Jews and others in the east. In October 1939, Nebe ordered Adolf Eichmann to put Gypsies with Jews on the transports to Nisko.|$|E
5|$|The next {{largest group}} of victims were non-Jewish Poles, who {{accounted}} for 70,000 to 75,000 deaths. Twenty-one thousand Roma and <b>Sinti</b> were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations. Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained in concentration camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.|$|E
5|$|Auschwitz I {{was first}} {{constructed}} to hold Polish political prisoners, {{who began to}} arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941, and Auschwitz II–Birkenau {{went on to become}} a major site of the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp's gas chambers from all over German-occupied Europe, where they were killed en masse with the pesticide Zyklon B. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1million died. Around 90 percent of those killed were Jewish; approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp. Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 Poles, 23,000 Romani and <b>Sinti,</b> 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, and tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of homosexuals. Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and medical experiments.|$|E
5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time <b>Sinti</b> and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October 2012 the Memorial to the <b>Sinti</b> and Roma Victims of National Socialism was {{unveiled}} in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{victims and}} the {{perpetrator}} {{died in the}} incident, 16 others were injured, four by gunshots. Three of the dead were female, and six were male. Two {{of the victims were}} of Turkish origin, one Greek two victims were from German <b>Sinti</b> families and one from a Kosovan Roma family.|$|E
25|$|Nazi human {{experimentation}} was {{a series}} of medical experiments on large numbers of prisoners, including children, by Nazi Germany in its concentration camps in the early to mid 1940s, during World War II and the Holocaust. Chief target populations included Romani, <b>Sinti,</b> ethnic Poles, Soviet POWs, disabled Germans, and most prominently of all, Jews from across Europe.|$|E
25|$|In September 2001, the French Radio rebroadcast the 1998 {{interview}} with Münch. Lawyers Without Borders, the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism and the Union of Jewish Students in France lodged complaints. In 2002, {{all of the}} accused responsible staff members of the public-law broadcasting institution Radio France were acquitted of the accusation of assistance in incitement to race hatred. The reasoning of the court decision reads that all radio listeners would have understood that Münch's statements about <b>Sinti</b> and Roma and about NS-extermination camps {{were taken from the}} Nazi-propaganda.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2012 {{the world}} premiere of the Requiem for Auschwitz, by {{composer}} Roger Moreno Rathgeb, was performed at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam by The Roma and <b>Sinti</b> Philharmoniker directed by Riccardo M Sahiti. The Philharmoniker is a pan-European orchestra of Roma and Sinto musicians generally employed by other classical orchestras; it is focused on the contribution of Roma culture to classical music. Dutch-Swiss Sinto Moreno Rathgeb wrote his requiem for all victims of Auschwitz and Nazi terror. The occasion of the premiere was coupled to a conference, Roma between Past and Future. The requiem has since been performed in Tilburg, Prague, Budapest, Frankfurt, Cracow, and Berlin.|$|E
25|$|A main {{theme in}} Grass's work is World War II {{and its effects}} on Germany and the German people, {{including}} a critique of the forms of ideological reasoning that undergirded the Nazi regime. The place of the city of Danzig/Gdańsk and its ambiguous historical status in between Germany and Poland often stands {{as a symbol of the}} ambiguity between ethnic groups, also found in Grass's own heritage which includes both German and Slavic family members who fought on opposite sides of the war. His works also show a sustained concern for the marginal and marginalized subjects, such as Oskar Matzerath, the dwarf in The Tin Drum whose body was considered an aberration unworthy of life in the Nazi ideology, or with Roma and <b>Sinti</b> people who were also deemed impure and unworthy and subjected to eugenics and genocide.|$|E
25|$|A {{portion of}} the {{homeless}} population are generally in transit, {{but there is no}} generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy. Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where homeless persons of Roma, <b>Sinti</b> and other ethnic descent have rejected the term gypsy, which they view as a racial slur. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, vagabond, tramp or drifter. Occasionally, these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler, e.g. hobo. The pejorative term bum is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a work ethic. The term transient is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.|$|E
500|$|Weizsäcker {{declared}} that younger generations of Germans [...] "cannot profess a guilt {{of their own}} for crimes they did not commit." [...] With his speech, Weizsäcker {{was also one of}} the first representatives of Germany to remember the homosexual victims of Nazism as a [...] "victim group." [...] This was also the case with his recognition of the <b>Sinti</b> and Roma as another victim group, a fact that was highlighted by the long-time head of the Central Council of German <b>Sinti</b> and Roma, Romani Rose.|$|E
500|$|This issue came {{up again}} in 2002, when Riefenstahl was one hundred years old and she was taken to court by a Roma group for denying the Nazis had exterminated gypsies. Riefenstahl apologized and said, [...] "I regret that <b>Sinti</b> and Roma [...] had to suffer {{during the period of}} National Socialism. It is known today that many of them were murdered in {{concentration}} camps".|$|E
500|$|Four sizable {{groups of}} people are {{referred}} to as [...] "national minorities" [...] because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. The Sorbs, a Slavic population of about 60,000, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. The Roma and <b>Sinti</b> live throughout the whole federal territory and the Frisians live on Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.|$|E
500|$|The Nazi {{genocide}} of the Romani {{people was}} ignored by scholars until the 1980s, and opinions continue to differ on its details. According to historians Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, the genocide of the Romani began later {{than that of}} the Jews and a smaller percentage was killed. Hitler's genocidal campaign against Europe's Romani population involved the application of Nazi [...] "racial hygiene" [...] (selective breeding applied to humans). Although despite discriminatory measures some Romani (including some of Germany's <b>Sinti</b> and Lalleri) were spared deportation and death, the remaining Romani groups suffered a fate {{similar to that of the}} Jews. Romani were deported to the Jewish ghettos, shot by SS Einsatzgruppen in their villages, or deported and gassed in Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>Sinti</b> gypsy, Vittorio Mayer Custodino, (known as [...] "Spatzo" [...] or [...] "Sparrow") came {{in contact}} with the {{religion}} while in prison in Sicily. Through him a number of Sicilian <b>Sinti</b> joined the religion by March 1978. In 1989 the first member of the Arbëreshë, Pietro Pandolfini, from Gela, joined the religion. In 1990 some sixty youth gathered in Gela for a conference.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study done}} in 1953 showed {{that of the}} 42,000 people who had survived the Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp, only 700 were entitled to compensation under the 1953 law. The German historian Alf Lüdtke wrote {{that the decision to}} deny that the Roma and the <b>Sinti</b> had been victims of National Socialist racism and to exclude the Roma and <b>Sinti</b> from compensation under the grounds that they were all [...] "criminals" [...] reflected the same anti-Gypsy racism that made them the target of persecution and genocide during the National Socialist era. The cause of the Roma and <b>Sinti</b> excited so little public interest that it was not until 1979 that a group was founded to lobby for compensation for the Roma and the <b>Sinti</b> survivors. Communist concentration camp survivors were excluded from compensation under the grounds that in 1933 the KPD had been seeking [...] "violent domination" [...] by working for a Communist revolution, and thus the banning of the KPD and the subsequent repression of the Communists were justified. In 1956, the law was amended to allow Communist concentration camp survivors to collect compensation provided that they had not been associated with Communist causes after 1945, but as almost all the surviving Communists belonged to the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime, which had been banned in 1951 by the Hamburg government [...] as a Communist front organisation, the new law did not help many of the KPD survivors. Compensation started to be paid to most Communist survivors regardless if they had belonged to the VVN or not following a 1967 court ruling, through the same court ruling had excluded those Communists who had [...] "actively" [...] fought the constitutional order after the banning of the KPD again in 1956. Only in the 1980s were demands made mostly from members of the SPD, FDP and above all the Green parties that the Federal Republic pay compensation to the Roma, <b>Sinti,</b> gay, homeless and Asoziale survivors of the concentration camps.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{methods used}} for fortune telling in Europe and the Americas include astromancy, horary astrology, {{pendulum}} reading, spirit board reading, tasseography (reading tea leaves in a cup), cartomancy (fortune telling with cards), tarot reading, crystallomancy (reading of a crystal sphere), and chiromancy (palmistry, {{reading of the}} palms). The last three have traditional associations in the popular mind with the Roma and <b>Sinti</b> people (often called [...] "gypsies").|$|E
2500|$|The word Ursari {{may also}} {{refer to a}} dialect of Balkan Romani, as spoken in Romania and Moldova, {{although}} {{it is estimated that}} most Ursari, like the Boyash, speak Romanian as their native language. There is no scholarly consensus on whether Ursari belong to the <b>Sinti</b> subgroup of the Roma people or to {{the other half of the}} Roma population. A Romanian poll conducted in 2004 among 347 Roma found that 150 referred to themselves as [...] "Ursari" [...] (or 43.2%, and the largest single group).|$|E
2500|$|An anti-miscegenation law {{was enacted}} by the National Socialist {{government}} in September 1935 {{as part of the}} Nuremberg Laws. The Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre (Protection of German Blood and German Honor Act), enacted on 15 September 1935, forbade marriage and extramarital sexual relations between persons racially – or rather racistically – regarded as non-Aryans and Aryans (persons of [...] "German or related blood"); this included all marriages, where at least one partner was a German citizen. Non-Aryans comprised mostly Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent. However, Germans of extra-European and especially of African descent and Germans regarded as belonging to the minority group of <b>Sinti</b> and Roma (Gypsies) were also considered as non-Aryans. On the 26 November 1935, the laws were extended to [...] "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring". Such extramarital intercourse was marked as Rassenschande (lit. race-disgrace) and could be punished by imprisonment – later usually followed by the deportation to a concentration camp, often entailing the inmate's death. Germans of African and other extra-European descent were classified following their own origin or the origin of their parents. <b>Sinti</b> and Roma were mostly categorised following police records, e.g. mentioning them or their forefathers as Gypsies, when having been met by the police as travelling peddlers.|$|E
2500|$|The Society for Threatened Peoples {{estimates}} the Romani deaths at 277,100. Martin Gilbert estimates that {{a total of}} more than 220,000 of the 700,000 Romani in Europe were killed, including 15,000 (mainly from the Soviet Union) in Mauthausen in January–May 1945. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cites scholars who estimate the number of <b>Sinti</b> and Roma killed as between 220,000 and 500,000. Dr. Sybil Milton, a historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Research Institute, estimated the number of lives lost as [...] "something between a half-million and a million-and-a-half".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Münch made derogative {{statements}} about Roma and <b>Sinti</b> on the French radio programme France-Inter, {{where he said}} that the Roma were [...] "pathetic" [...] and the gas chambers would have been the only solution for them. Münch was accused of [...] "incitement of racial hatred". He did not take part in the court hearing. A medical expert opinion had certified him [...] "psychologically disturbed". The acquittal was based on this expert opinion. The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported on 7 May 2001 that the Paris appeal court had annulled the June 2000 acquittal.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{government}} paid {{war reparations}} to Jewish {{survivors of the}} Holocaust, {{but not to the}} Romani. There were [...] "never any consultations at Nuremberg or any other international conference as to whether the <b>Sinti</b> and Roma were entitled like the Jews to reparations." [...] The Interior Ministry of Wuerttemberg argued that [...] "Gypsies [...] persecuted under the Nazis not for any racial reason but because of an asocial and criminal record". When on trial for his leadership of Einsatzgruppen in the USSR, Otto Ohlendorf cited the massacres of Romanis during the Thirty Years War as a historical precedent.|$|E
2500|$|... “Auschwitz is {{the largest}} Jewish {{cemetery}} in the world. Auschwitz is where the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated {{more than a million}} Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS Doctor Josef Mengele conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and <b>Sinti</b> and Soviet prisoners of war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today’s anti-Semites and hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 1942, Himmler {{ordered that}} the Romani {{candidates}} for extermination should be transferred from ghettos to the extermination facilities of Auschwitz-Birkenau. On November 15, 1943, Himmler ordered that Romani and [...] "part-Romanies" [...] {{were to be}} put [...] "on {{the same level as}} Jews and placed in concentration camps". The camp authorities housed Roma in a special compound that was called the [...] "Gypsy family camp." [...] Some 23,000 Roma, <b>Sinti</b> and Lalleri were deported to Auschwitz altogether. In concentration camps such as Auschwitz, Gypsies wore brown or black triangular patches, the symbol for [...] "asocials," [...] or green ones, the symbol for professional criminals, and less frequently the letter [...] "Z" [...] (meaning Zigeuner, German word for romani people).|$|E
2500|$|The Nazis {{established}} the Racial Hygiene and Demographic Biology Research Unit (Rassenhygienische und Bevölkerungsbiologische Forschungsstelle, Department L3 of the Reich Department of Health) in 1936. Headed by Dr. Robert Ritter {{and his assistant}} Eva Justin, this Unit was mandated to conduct an in-depth study of the [...] "Gypsy question (Zigeunerfrage)" [...] and to provide data required for formulating a new Reich [...] "Gypsy law". After extensive fieldwork {{in the spring of}} 1936, consisting of interviews and medical examinations to determine the racial classification of the Roma, the Unit determined that most Romani, whom they had concluded were not of [...] "pure Gypsy blood", posed a danger to German racial purity and should be deported or eliminated. No decision was made regarding the remainder (about 10 percent of the total Romani population of Europe), primarily <b>Sinti</b> and Lalleri tribes living in Germany. Several suggestions were made. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler suggested deporting the Romani to a remote reservation, as had been done by the United States for its Native Americans, where [...] "pure Gypsies" [...] could continue their nomadic lifestyle unhindered. According to him: ...|$|E
2500|$|Proximity to Nazi Germany as a {{bordering}} nation {{made the}} Swiss government very tentative {{about dealing with}} the Jews. Sharing a physical border with Germany was {{also part of the}} reason that the Swiss maintained amicable economic relations with Germany. Correspondingly, both Sweden and especially Switzerland cooperated with the Nazis concerning banking and the exploitation of financial opportunities, as they knowingly accepted expropriation of money and goods, which previously belonged to Jewish companies and/or families for their own gain. Before 1938, Swiss alien and refugee policy was already restrictive toward certain people and groups, notably foreign Roma and <b>Sinti.</b> However, from that date, restrictions were intensified, particularly towards Jews. As part of that policy, the Swiss government requested that the German government mark the passports of German Jews with a [...] "J" [...] as they were not ready to grant asylum on the grounds of racial persecution. This policy took effect following the Anschluß with Austria, as the Swiss government was concerned about potential Jewish refugees fleeing and inundating them accordingly. In 1942 Swiss borders were completely closed to all Jewish refugees, which even included Jewish children.|$|E
