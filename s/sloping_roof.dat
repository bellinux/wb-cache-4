5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the <b>sloping</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow <b>sloping</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sloped roofs {{that are}} {{prevalent}} in the southeastern United States also pose a significant challenge for SCV roofs. Soil media erosion and poor plant establishment {{are the most common}} problems and can occur on any angle of <b>sloped</b> <b>roof</b> if not designed properly. Erosion blankets and green roof soil media stabilization products are used to mitigate the effects of <b>sloped</b> <b>roofs.</b> Flat <b>roofs</b> and low <b>sloped</b> <b>roofs</b> are conventional <b>roof</b> <b>slopes</b> by the building industry in the southeastern United States and allow for successful implementation of SCV roofs.|$|R

Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E
25|$|The dome of Saint Peter's in Rome {{inspired}} {{the dome of}} the chapel of the Sorbonne (1635–1642) commissioned by Cardinal Richelieu, who was the proviseur, or head of the college. The chapel became his final resting place. The plan was taken from another Roman church, San Carlo ai Catinari. The new style, sometimes called Flamboyant Gothic or French baroque, appeared in many other new churches, including Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle (1624), Notre-Dame-des-Victoires (1629), Saint-Sulpice (1646), and Saint-Roch (1653). The largest project in the new style was Val-de-Grâce, built by Anne of Austria, the widow of Louis XIII. Modeled after the Escorial in Spain, it combined a convent, a church, and royal apartments for the widowed queen. One of the architects of Val-de-Grâce and several of the other new churches was François Mansart, most famous for the <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> that became the signature feature of the buildings of the 17th century.|$|E

500|$|Tegulae were {{originally}} made perfectly flat, or {{with nothing more}} than a ridge underneath the upper border, which allowed the tile to be [...] "hung" [...] upon a <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> so that it would not slide to the ground. Later, tegulae were formed with a raised border on the two vertical sides, which would channel rainwater {{to the bottom of the}} tile, rather than allowing it to seep between tiles to dampen the roofing materials. Another improvement occurred when these two raised borders were made to converge, forming a broad v-shaped trapezoid with the narrowest edge downwards, nestling into the widest part of the tile below it to form a continuous channel.|$|E
500|$|The jagamohana is {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and has a two-element <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> with clerestory windows between them.

In addition, there are trellised windows with slabs of stone sculptures depicting dancers and musicians. Light enters the interior through doors and the latticed windows. The junction of the vimana and the jagmohana is not cleanly built, leading some scholars to postulate that the porch was added at a much later date; however, the primitive connection is attributed to the building technique. The temple was constructed by burying completed portions in inclined layers of earth up which heavy pieces of stone were dragged.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{considerable}} population increase {{from the end of the}} 19th century, a number of new churches were built in various styles. Next to Aalborg Hall, Ansgar's Church with its tall tower was built in 1929 to a design by Hother August Paludan in a modern Baroque style. St Mark's Church (Sankt Markus Kirke), completed in 1933, was designed by Einar Packness. Its tower is crowned by an imposing spire. The Biblical figures known as the Johannes Group (based on Christ's meeting with John the Baptist in Matthew, Chapter 3) sculpted by Bertel Thorvaldsen are displayed around the interior. The Margrethe Church with its steeply <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> reaching [...] is the work of Carlo Odgaard and Aaby Sørensen.

500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. [...] and Hereward saw {{the introduction of a}} new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the [...] through to the [...] of 1944. This was necessary as Hereward was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had a trunnion height [...] higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman to see over the top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic wedge shape with a <b>sloping</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
500|$|A form {{of models}} of houses in pottery, and {{sometimes}} bronze, called [...] "hut urns" [...] gives us some indications. [...] These were apparently {{used to hold}} cremated ashes, and {{are found in the}} preceding Villanovan culture and early Etruscan burials, especially in northern areas. [...] The hut urns show a conventional model with a single interior space. [...] They are usually round or slightly oval, often with prominent wooden beams laid in two rows on the <b>sloping</b> <b>roof,</b> which cross at the central ridge and project some way in [...] "V"s into the air; these projections seem to have been sometimes carved or otherwise decorated. [...] The urns always have a large square-ish door for access, sometimes two, and the outline of windows in the walls may be indicated by ridges or marks in the clay. [...] There is very often a window and exit for smoke, above the door in the roof, and at the opposite end.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century, Bishop Thomas Beckington left {{much of his}} estate to the Vicars' Choral, {{enabling}} repairs to be carried out. The gardens {{in front of the}} houses were not part of the original scheme with the garden walls being added as part of this development. The walls are on average [...] {{from the front of the}} houses. He unified the appearance of the terraces including the installation of a single arch-braced and wind-braced trussed <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> around 1466. The chimney shafts were renewed and raised, possibly because of the introduction of coal as the fuel rather than wood. Each stack incorporates two heraldic shields and the upper sections of the stacks are octagonal. The shields are those of the Bishop, a beacon above tun, and the arms of his three executors; sugar loaves for Hugh Sugar, three swans for Richard Swan, and the talbot for John Pope. Many of the original windows were replaced in the 18th century. Shrewsbury House is architecturally different from all the other buildings. It was re-built in the 19th century after a fire that burnt down the original structure.|$|E

Artillery emplacements for the 25th divisional artillery and 112th Army Field Brigade were built and the Guards Division field artillery was placed in concealed forward positions. Road making {{and the construction of}} dugouts and communication trenches took place first between 12 and 30 April and then between 11 May and 6 June. An assembly trench was dug [...] from the German front line, in three hours on the night of [...] complete with communication trenches and barbed wire.

500|$|In 1958–1959 four {{projects}} were announced. The old Bowling Green pavilion on the Trinity Road became a medical centre, {{the basement of}} the aquarium building was converted into a gym, four large floodlight pylons were installed, and a training ground was purchased [...] from Villa Park. The floodlights were first used in November 1958 for a friendly match against the Scottish side Heart of Midlothian. In mid-1962, £40,000 was spent on a roof for the Holte End, the first to provide cover for the ordinary terrace fans at Villa Park since 1922. The old barrel-shaped roof on the Witton Lane Stand, the only remaining feature of the 1897 Villa Park, was removed in mid-1963 and replaced with a plain <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> in the same style as the Holte End. Villa Park was chosen by FIFA to host three matches for the 1966 World Cup on the condition that the Witton Lane Stand became all-seater. The players' tunnel had to be covered with a cage while the pitch was widened by [...] Regular ground developments and innovations began in mid-1969 {{under the direction of the}} new chairman, Doug Ellis, who set about redeveloping Villa Park for the modern era. Much of the stadium had fallen into disrepair and was in need of modernisation. Ellis updated the infrastructure, installed a new public address system, carried out plumbing work which included installing new toilets, resurfaced the terraces, and built a new ticket office. His tenure saw executive lounges replace the old offices in the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E
