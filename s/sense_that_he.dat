5|$|In 1912, Frank {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was different.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov, a {{conflicted}} former student, {{lives in}} a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg. He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. His motivation comes from the overwhelming <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.|$|E
25|$|According to Ayatollah Khu’i {{there is}} no doubt that Uthman {{collected}} the Quran during his time, but not in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> collected the verses and suras in one volume, but in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> united the Muslims on the reading of one authoritative recension. He also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad.|$|E
5000|$|Neal is {{notoriously}} closed off {{but even so}} Georgie <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is angry at her as he leaves. Georgie asks him to call her when he lands.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 19: <b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is on {{the verge}} of {{attaining}} his goal, the Bodhisattva sets out for the bodhimaṇḍa, the sacred place where all bodhisattvas in their last existence attain full and complete awakening.|$|R
50|$|Jorge {{moves into}} the house with his girlfriend Lucia and starts renovating the rundown place. Lucia <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> like his father, lusts after Viridiana, and soon leaves. Jorge then makes a pass at the willing Ramona.|$|R
25|$|Spade has no original. He {{is a dream}} man in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{what most}} of the private detectives I worked with {{would like to have}} been, and, in their cockier moments, thought they approached.|$|E
25|$|Scene 3: Ricky Roma {{delivers}} a monologue to James Lingk. Roma does not {{bring up the}} real estate he wants to sell to Lingk until the very end. Instead, Roma preys upon Lingk's insecurities, and his <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has never done anything adventurous with his life.|$|E
25|$|In the rear, Wheeler's cavalry {{continued}} to harass the Union line of communication on the turnpike back to Nashville. Convoys of wounded {{had to travel}} under heavy escort {{to be protected from}} the cavalry, and Wheeler interpreted these movements as preparations for a retreat, and he reported such to Bragg. Buoyed by his <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had won the battle, Bragg was content to wait for Rosecrans to retreat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{could not}} hold the ban in place through sheer force of will, Oglethorpe sought and {{received}} Parliamentary backing when the House of Commons passed legislation codifying the prohibition on slavery in Georgia in 1735.|$|R
50|$|Plüschow <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was being}} watched, even by {{officials}} openly friendly to Germany. As {{he was about}} to be arrested, he leapt in a rickshaw and went to the railway station, where he bribed a guard and slipped on a train to Shanghai.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Chiwatenhwa <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might {{eventually}} be killed for his faith {{and love for}} Jesus Christ. He was martyred on 2 August 1640, aged 38. Jesuit martyr of North America (Canada) Gabriel Lalemant considered Chiwatenhwa a great catechist amongst his own people, [...] "their apostle".|$|R
25|$|Nadal is a clay court {{specialist}} in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been extremely successful on that surface. Since 2005, he won ten times at Roland Garros, ten times at Monte Carlo, ten times at Barcelona and seven at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label owing to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning eight Masters series titles on hardcourt, and winning the Olympic gold medal on hardcourt.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{court cases}} against Him: Swamiji {{had to face}} many court cases filed against him. The basis of these cases was the Chitrapur Math Trust deed, which was very weak in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> was the sole trustee. This meant that anybody could find any small fault in the {{execution}} of developmental programs under the trust and the blame would fall on him. Swamiji came clean in all these court cases. The fact that a guru of a community {{had to go through}} trial in court cases, resulted in a character assassination of sorts.|$|E
25|$|Makkali Gosala {{seems to}} have {{combined}} the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in niyati (destiny), svabhava (nature), and sangati (change), and possibly parinama, which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ahetuvadin, vainayikavadin, ajnanavadin, and issarakaranavadin. According to him all beings undergo development (parinama). This culminates {{in the course of}} time (samsarasuddhi) in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of niyati (destiny), bhava (nature), and sangati (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to niyativada (fatalism) only in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought that some future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.|$|E
50|$|At {{the limit}} of his sanity, and <b>sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> going to die tonight, Heinz carries Linda up to his mother's apartment. He tries to get his mom to {{recognize}} the man he's become, but becomes frustrated when this appeal fails and throws his mother out the window.|$|R
5000|$|..... a voter on this {{voting machine}} has no knowledge, through his <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has {{accomplished}} a result. The most {{that can be}} said is, if the machine worked as intended, then he has made his holes and voted. It does not seem to me that this is enough.|$|R
50|$|That evening, Steve and Jean are playfully {{sharing a}} joint of marijuana. Johnna sees this and, <b>sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intends to molest her, goes after {{him with a}} shovel. Barbara confronts Jean and slaps her. This impels Bill to take Jean back to Colorado, leaving Barbara. Karen also leaves with Steve.|$|R
25|$|Self-important, romantic, {{and nearly}} always wrong, Barney dreamed {{of the day}} he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever {{frustrated}} that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, three left arm spinners {{dominated}} the Indian domestic cricket scene. Along with Doshi there were, Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay, & Rajinder Goel of Haryana & Delhi. Goel still holds {{the record for}} the highest number of wickets in the Ranji Trophy (640 at 17.14). Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S. Bedi. With a world class left arm spinner readily available, the selectors were reluctant to give the others much chance. Thus, Shivalker and Goel had to content themselves with a few unofficial test matches against Sri Lanka. Goel was specially unlucky, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was originally selected to make his official Test Debut against WI at Delhi, in 1974–78. But a last minute change saw off spinner Venkat replacing him. Doshi, in that sense, can be considered to be the luckiest; at least he got the chance to represent India in full internationals. Nevertheless, he too lost the best years of his playing career waiting for his chance to come.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein has {{described}} himself as [...] "an old-fashioned communist," [...] in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "see no value whatsoever in states." ...|$|E
5000|$|He was so {{struck by}} the {{powerful}} visual effect of the strong colour and bold geometric design which spoke directly to the <b>senses,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was determined to rediscover the Suprematist and Constructivist art which had been lost and forgotten in the attics, studios and basements of Moscow and Leningrad.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} morning, John <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{will never}} see her again. He attempts to share with her details about his life. Elizabeth tells him {{that it is too}} late as she leaves the apartment. John begins his mental countdown to 50, hoping she will come back by the time he is finished.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had made}} history, Clay quickly {{ran to the}} ropes amidst the commotion in the ring and shouted at sportswriters, [...] "Eat your words!" [...] In a scene that has been rebroadcast countless times over the ensuing decades, Clay {{repeatedly}} yelled [...] "I'm the greatest!" [...] and [...] "I shook up the world." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the same}} vein, though Laszlo {{asserts that the}} Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, [...] "This is still unoccupied France; any {{violation}} of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault," [...] Ebert points out, [...] "It makes no <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could walk around freely.... He would be arrested on sight." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Kunichika's Meiji-era works {{remained}} {{rooted in}} the traditions of his teachers, he {{made an effort to}} incorporate references to modern technology. In 1869 he did a series jointly with Yoshitoshi, a more [...] "modern" [...] artist in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> depicted faces realistically. In addition, Kunichika experimented with [...] "Western" [...] vanishing point perspective.|$|E
500|$|Despite his flaws, Saint-Just {{is often}} accorded {{respect for the}} {{strength}} of his convictions. Although his words and actions may be viewed as reprehensible, his commitment to them is rarely questioned: he was [...] "implacable but sincere". Like Robespierre, he was incorruptible in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> exhibited no attraction to material benefits but devoted himself entirely to the advancement of a political agenda.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{in grave}} danger, Havana ventures {{into the jungle}} to find Woody near a hidden {{storehouse}} of ammunition and explosives. There she encounters Lazear's jealous girlfriend, Chita, and pretends she and Woody are married. Tex arrives to help Woody fight off the revolutionaries, then is by their side again when Woody and Havana are actually wed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> couldn’t {{break the}} stalemate, Aspinall dropped the Grand Canyon dams from the CRPB in late August 1967. The bill {{eventually}} {{passed in the}} middle of 1968, creating the Colorado River Basin Act. However, in exchange for the his compromise, Aspinall did receive five projects for Colorado (the Dallas Creek, Animas-La Plata, West Divide, San Miguel, and Dolores projects).|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Saira and Mariam are {{taken aback by}} Sherry’s {{proposal}} to Anam, as they assume <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never showed any interest in her and Mariam even <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> loves Zoya, but remains silent. She rather discusses this matter with Ansar, who warns her not to speak anything in front of Kamaal. Saira, though dislikes Anam because of her arrogance and attitudes, doesn’t dares to speak anything {{in front of her}} husband.|$|R
500|$|Thompson claims Scissorhands {{is based}} on a pet dog of hers. [...] She {{described}} her dog as follows: [...] "he was the most soulful, yearning creature I ever met. She wanted to participate in everything. She didn’t need language to communicate. She communicated with her eyes." [...] She described the character as similar to Frankenstein's monster and Pinocchio in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "an outsider who wants to be an insider".|$|E
500|$|Tom Mankiewicz wrote a {{first draft}} for the script in 1973, {{delivering}} a script {{that was a}} battle of wills between Bond and Scaramanga, who he saw as Bond's alter ego, [...] "a super-villain of the stature of Bond himself." [...] Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton and Mankiewicz's growing <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "feeling really tapped out on Bond" [...] led to the re-introduction of Richard Maibaum as the Bond screenwriter.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to win a game at the 1998 World Cup, Georges Leekens chose a 4–3–3 {{arrangement}} for Belgium's second and third group matches. Robert Waseige, Belgium coach around 2000, said that [...] "above all, [...] 4–4–2 system [...] holy", in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left good attackers on the bench to keep his favourite formation. Wilmots opted for the 4–3–3 line-up again, {{with the intention of}} showing dominant football against any country.|$|E
50|$|Narval learns Nina's own dark secret. She and {{her husband}} had been imprisoned by the Nazis in a {{concentration}} camp during World War II. She was released. <b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was planning an escape, she had written him a letter begging him to wait, that the Allies would liberate him soon enough. However, she entrusted the letter to a man who betrayed them. Her husband was executed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{support of}} at least 3 member states, West Germany, Italy, and France, de Gaulle shifted tactics and he reissued the Fouchet Plan in January 1962. This plan again omitted NATO and sent a clear message that de Gaulle wanted to {{separate}} Europe from NATO. This move irritated the other members, including Italy and West Germany and strengthened the Dutch position".|$|R
50|$|<b>Sensing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was on to}} something, Navarro {{followed}} suit with his own creations. Wampus was launched the same year; it featured the eponymous alien monster sent by an evil cosmic intelligence to destroy the Earth, and the exploits of a S.H.I.E.L.D.-like organization named C.L.A.S.H.. Unfortunately, Editions Lug had run-ins with French censorship, and both Fantask and Wampus were cancelled after only six issues.|$|R
