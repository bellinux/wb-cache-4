5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gočeva {{released}} the album Makedonsko Devojče {{in collaboration with}} Macedonian composer Zlatko Origjanski. The album features elements of Macedonian traditional music and it represented {{a change in the}} musical style for the singer. According to Gočeva, the album served as an experimental work for her in order to establish whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to successfully record folk music. Makedonsko Devojče {{turned out to be a}} commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 Sunčane Skale festival in Montenegro. Its popularity among the Macedonian public lasted for several years after its release.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg {{required}} {{major repairs}} before <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to return to}} Germany, so she was temporarily moored in the harbor with her broadside facing the harbor entrance. This would allow her to bring all of her main battery guns to bear against any British naval attack. The rest of Gruppe 3 returned to Germany. On the evening of 9 April, she was attacked by British bombers, but to no effect. The following morning, the British launched another air raid on the ship. The raid consisted of sixteen Blackburn Skua dive bombers of the British Fleet Air Arm (seven of 800 Naval Air Squadron and nine of 803 Naval Air Squadron), launched from RNAS Hatston, Orkney. Königsbergs thin deck armor rendered her quite vulnerable to dive bomber attack. The Skuas attacked in three groups: the nine of 803 NAS, six of 800 NAS, and one aircraft of 800 NAS which lost contact during the outward flight but found Königsberg independently. The dive bombers attacked at 7:20, catching the ship's crew off guard. Half of the dive bombers had completed their dives before the crew realized they were under attack. Only one large anti-aircraft gun was reported as being manned with shells being fired once every five seconds from the aft of the ship with lighter anti-air weapons firing from the shore and adjacent ships firing even later in the attack.|$|E

25|$|The case {{involved}} a severely disabled lady, Miss Coughlan, who was receiving nursing care in Mardon House, a National Health Service facility {{managed by the}} North and East Devon Health Authority. The Authority had made several representations to her that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to live out her days in Mardon House. Subsequently, the Health Authority decided to shut the facility down {{as the cost of}} operating it was becoming excessive. Coughlan sought judicial review of the Authority's decision, claiming that its representations had induced in her a legitimate expectation that Mardon House would be her home for life.|$|E

25|$|This {{evidence}} {{was enough to}} lead police to Dyer, but they still had no strong evidence to connect her directly with a serious crime. Additional evidence they gleaned from witnesses, and information obtained from Bristol police, only served to increase their concerns, and D.C. Anderson, with Sgt. James, placed Dyer's home under surveillance. Subsequent intelligence suggested that Dyer would abscond if she became at all suspicious. The officers decided to use a young woman as a decoy, hoping <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to secure a meeting with Dyer to discuss her services. This may {{have been designed to}} help the detectives to positively link Dyer to her business activities, or it may have simply given them a reliable opportunity to arrest her.|$|E

Later, Kamal Amrohi offered Meena Kumari a {{lead role in}} his upcoming film Anarkali and the contract was signed on 13 March 1951. On 21 May 1951 Meena Kumari {{was involved in a}} serious motor car accident while returning from Mahabaleshwar to Bombay. She was admitted to Sasoon hospital in Poona, was severely injured around the left hand, and there was some doubt whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to use it again. Kumari went through terrible bouts of depression, and Kamal Amrohi religiously visited her during her days in the hospital. When they were not scheduled to meet, both Kumari and Amrohi would write letters to each other.|$|E

On April 25, Giffords's doctors gave her medical clearance to travel to Florida for the launch, originally scheduled for April 29. She went to Florida where she was to watch from a private family area, without any public appearance or photography. The launch of STS-134 was delayed due to mechanical problems, and Giffords and Kelly returned to Houston after meeting with President Obama, who had also planned to see the launch with his family at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).|$|E

This was affirmed in the Court of Appeal, where {{the court also}} ordered Subashini to take her case to the Syariah Court. As of September 2007, their case is pending in the Federal Court after an appeal by Subashini. Subashini is also seeking to stop or declare void the conversion of their children. As of 27 December 2007, R. Subashini failed {{in an attempt to}} stop her husband from divorcing her in an Islamic court. She also failed to persuade the federal court her husband should be banned from converting their four-year-old son to Islam. The appeal was rejected on a technicality but court added that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to try again in a few months.|$|E
25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman {{would have to tell}} every person in the room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E

According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she [...] "thought {{it would be great}} [...] if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.'
