25|$|The {{clothing}} that the then-unidentified victim wore, Faded Glory, was traced to Walmart, its exclusive retailer.

The child's footprints were taken and compared to those from hospitals in the area, but did not match any of the records. By studying isotopes from his body, it was believed that he had lived in Illinois for most, if not all, of his short life. The analysis also indicated that his mother had lived {{in the northern part of}} the continent, where she spent most of her pregnancy.|$|E
