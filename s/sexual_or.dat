5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
5|$|The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, {{like the}} marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, {{may have been}} too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> {{aggressive}} displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.|$|E
5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted {{system at the}} higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (<b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, <b>sexual,</b> <b>or</b> age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

25|$|Online {{infidelity}} {{can be just}} as {{damaging to}} a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness. A possible explanation is that our brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly. Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> emotional in nature, often leads to off-line infidelity.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{representations}} of {{homosexuals in the}} Japanese media tend towards caricature {{on the basis of}} stereotypes of <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> behavioral deviance (e.g. the actually straight Hard Gay), there are several examples of transgender persons with popular celebrity status in Japan such as Haruna Ai.

25|$|Since the Vocaloid or its vocal {{library is}} {{released}} for producers {{to do as}} they please, some producers think of the Vocaloids as dolls {{and that they can}} make them sing whatever they want. The portrayals of Vocaloids can at times touch controversial issues. Releases put out as young children risk becoming subject to <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> pedophilic portrayals.|$|E
25|$|Fiction about gynoids {{or female}} cyborgs {{reinforce}} essentialist ideas of femininity, according to Margret Grebowicz. Such essentialist ideas may present as <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> gender stereotypes. Among the few non-eroticized fictional gynoids include Rosie the Robot Maid from The Jetsons. However, {{she still has}} some stereotypically feminine qualities, such as a matronly shape and a predisposition to cry.|$|E
25|$|In some fairy-wrens such as {{the superb}} and red-backed, males pick flower petals in colors {{contrasting}} with their bright nuptial plumage and present them to others of their species that will acknowledge, inspect and sometimes manipulate the petals. This function seems not linked to <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> aggressive activity in the short and medium term thereafter, though its function is apparently not aggressive and quite possibly sexual.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sexual</b> desire {{disorders}} <b>or</b> decreased libido {{are characterized}} by a lack or absence for {{some period of time}} of <b>sexual</b> desire <b>or</b> libido for <b>sexual</b> activity <b>or</b> of <b>sexual</b> fantasies.

25|$|Abusive {{power and}} control (or {{controlling}} behaviour or coercive control) {{is the way that}} abusers gain and maintain {{power and control}} over a victim for an abusive purpose such as psychological, physical, <b>sexual,</b> <b>or</b> financial abuse.

25|$|While {{women in}} the United States tend to live longer than men, they {{generally}} are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and therefore have more barriers to accessing healthcare. Being of lower SES also tends to increase societal pressures, {{which can lead to}} higher rates of depression and chronic stress and, in turn, negatively impact health. Women are also {{more likely than men to}} suffer from <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> intimate-partner violence both in the United States and worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Violence against girls discourages {{them from}} {{attending}} school. <b>Sexual</b> <b>or</b> physical {{violence on the}} way to and from school or at home reduces girls' ability to concentrate in class. Instead of attending to the lesson, they are thinking about the violence they have experienced or worrying about future violence to come. Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework. Abused girls {{are more likely to have}} low attainment, more grade repetition and a higher drop-out rate than non-abused girls.|$|E
25|$|Bahá'í law limits {{permissible}} {{sexual relations}} to those {{between a man}} and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain from sex outside matrimony. Bahá'ís do not, however, attempt to impose their moral standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality, whether <b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> otherwise, the Bahá’í teachings also take account of human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be contrary to the spirit of the Bahá’í teachings.|$|E
25|$|As may {{be noted}} from the name, sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are transmitted {{from one person to}} another by certain sexual activities rather than being actually caused by those sexual activities. Bacteria, fungi, protozoa or viruses are still the causative agents. It is not possible to catch any sexually transmitted disease from a sexual activity with a person who is not carrying a disease; conversely, a person who has an STI got it from contact (<b>sexual</b> <b>or</b> otherwise) with someone who had it, or his/her bodily fluids. Some STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding.|$|E
