Coastal Command's performance contrasted heavily with the service' joint mine-laying effort with Bomber Command, that sank 86 enemy vessels in the same period, (totalling 82,983 tons) and ten others damaged for the loss of just 31 aircraft. The performance of Coastal Command's strike wings was down to poor intelligence and equipment, which it was refused, in favour of diverting them to other roles.|$|E

5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. <b>Seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E

The collected monthly data for 12 years {{was obtained from the}} China <b>seaborne</b> container <b>trade</b> (CSCT) and the China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI). Containership fleet development and the prices of new and second-hand container ships were classified based on five container vessel sizes (January of 2004 –December of 2015). The period of simulation for this study was from 2004 to 2020. To analyze the optimal timing for the container ship orders, container ship fleet development as a supply factor and the CSCT as a demand factor, both of which are components of CCFI, were simulated. After the first simulation, CCFI was simulated holistically. Based on the CCFI simulation results, it was possible to develop three optimal timing scenarios for ship order placement. The CCFI for October 2016 was in the initial entry status of a short-term rebound, which makes it possible for shipping companies to order ships without the risk of revenue loss.

In this context, fears have increasingly been voiced that the international coal market - analogous to the oil market which continues to be dominated by the OPEC-might witness the emergence of a supplier cartel, a "COAL-PEC". A strong tendency towards the concentration of companies has in fact been observed in the international coal market in the past years. Increased prices could have resulted from the use of market power.

Ships that ply the maritime domain are primary mode of transportation and carry about 80 % {{of the world trade}} volume (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD July 2003). Port Operations and ancillary services such as freight forwarding, shipping play an enormous role in generating economic growth. <b>Seaborne</b> <b>trades</b> through port terminal operations had attracted regional competitions for volume of cargo by sea. Ports such as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and also Malaysia are stepping up their efforts in improving port operations and increase efficiency in handling cargo in order to become world’s class port. The role of ports have been to facilitate efficient movement of goods in the global supply chain. Port Klang as national gateway has changed radically and dramatically into a major port not just handling a larger volume of national cargo but more significantly a port of international repute handling an increase volume of transhipment cargo as well. The hinterland logistics and infrastructures and synchronized supply chain will also need further attention as they play complementary and supporting role in Malaysia’s economy. Two of the exciting economy corridors had been launched notably the Northern Corridor Economic Region and Iskandar Development Region in December 2006 and July 2007 respectively (see appendix 2) These initiatives with commitment that involved more RM 100 billions of development projects over the few years will certainly propel the National Load Centre agenda into greater height. Today’s globalised trade where physical movement of good and services are seamless and reduction in trade barriers, has posed some challenges on how business should be efficiently and effectively operate. The competitions are stiff and companies are competing fiercely and as result turning the market place into some “red ocean” a terminology used in the “Blue Ocean” Strategy. “Red ocean” describes companies trying to beat competition on same limited terrain where competitive advantange and survival are intensified to gain market share. To be able to compete globally terminal operators, logistics and supply chain participants should achieve operational excellence through meticulous planning and continuous improvement in efficient handling and in the process to reduce costs in the whole supply chain logistics. Port Klang will have to adopt competitive business model in order to sustain growth and continue foreign direct investment. Iskandar Development Region (IDR) had attracted some USD 1. 2 billions investment from middle east investors. In addition, Dubai World is preparing its masterplan for their interest in 2, 255 acres of Tanjung Bin for industrial development as well as 500 acres near Port of Tanjung Pelepas for distripark and logistics (source [URL].

40|$|The Guayas River estuary {{supports}} extensive socio-economic processes. It {{is formed}} at {{the confluence of}} the Babahoyo and Daule Rivers and runs for around 65 km before discharging into the Pacific Ocean. Its relevance within the national context is linked to the city of Guayaquil, the most populated city and commercial capital of Ecuador. Recently it was considered the main <b>seaborne</b> <b>trading</b> route for the country. Nowadays the estuary experiences a number of sedimentation related issues which hinder its navigability and increase the potential risk of flooding in the northern low lying areas of Guayaquil. Although these problems have been accentuating over the years, {{little is known about the}} estuary’s morphological evolution. Therefore, the main focus of this study is to provide a comprehensive explanation of the estuary's morphological development and the processes behind its evolution. In this regard, a morphodynamic numerical model was implemented using the software Delft 3 D Flexible Mesh. The estuary itself has not been the subject of many studies related to morphology. The lack of information was one of the major challenges for this research, especially in relation to bed topography. In order to cope with this, state of the art techniques were applied to derive the missing data. This is the basis to set up the model for the different scenarios that simulate natural events and anthropic interventions carried out within the estuary and that have been identified as some of the potential causes of sedimentation. A total of five events or so called 'interventions' were defined, namely: the reduction of intertidal areas due to mangrove deforestation and shrimp farms, El Niño phenomenon, the construction of the Daule-Peripa dam at the headwaters of the Daule River, the construction of the 'Puente de la Unidad Nacional' bridge over the Daule and Babahoyo Rivers near their confluence and finally the sediment overload due to deforestation of the upstream basin. The final analysis of the different cases determined that the changes in tidal asymmetry are the main causes of sedimentation and the overall estuary morphological evolution. Amongst others, the leading contributors to this tidal variability can be attributed to the discharge of the Daule and Babahoyo Rives and the decimation of intertidal areas. Depending on the magnitude of the discharges, the predominant flood dominant character of the estuary is either reduced or even shifted towards ebb dominance. This is verified when the hydrographs peak during the wet season particularly in the higher regions near {{the confluence of the}} rivers. The intertidal flats, on the other hand, have been severely reduced due to increased shrimp farming practices and the sequential loss of mangrove forests along the estuary banks. This has principally reduced hydraulic friction and natural wave damping effects which has ultimately enhanced flood dominance. It was also concluded that events such as the bridge construction over the Daule and Babahoyo Rivers as well as the sediment overload related to deforestation of the upstream basin are of minor importance. In view of the above, in order to control the sedimentation in the estuary and especially around Guayaquil, three alternatives are proposed (or a combination of them) as potential mitigating measures. The first is to control the discharge of the Daule River through the operation of the Daule-Peripa dam. The second is to recover some of the intertidal flats which have been decimated by aquaculture practices. The third is to dredge the area of the estuary close to Guayaquil. The final solution requires a more detailed study. However it will involve a compromise between the cost of dredging and the decreased profit from hydro power generation and aquaculture.

40|$|Purpose The {{development}} of the Pacific <b>seaborne</b> coal <b>trade</b> since 1960 has been central to East Asia's economic expansion. In exploring the growth of this trade this paper seeks to understand why Japanese steel mills (JSMs), the world's largest coal importers, used few of the strategies that one would expect {{in the light of}} resource dependency theory, relying instead on market exchanges. Design/methodology/approach This study relies primarily on archival sources, held by the Departments of Mines and Natural Resources in Victoria (British Columbia) and Brisbane (Australia) to reconstruct changing patterns of supply and price in the Pacific coal trade. Findings It is found that by relying on a strategy that amounted to "vertical quasi-integration" JSMs were able to use their combined power to dictate the terms of market exchanges with buyers during the 1980 and 1990 s. By 2000, however, this strategy had become counter-productive, as low prices fostered the emergence of a powerful Australian-based selling oligopoly. Research limitations/implications The study contributes towards the growing study of transnational events, experiences and institutions in management history, filling a noticeable gap in resource dependency theory, which has not previously explored the long-term consequences of strategies aimed at reducing dependency. Practical implications East Asia has become the major engine for world economic growth and manufacturing output since the 1970 s, and this study explores {{for the first time the}} genesis and {{development of}} the Pacific coal trade that has underpinned this growth. Social implications - The study demonstrates the long-term adverse consequences of attempts to manipulate buyer-supplier relationships to minimise cost inputs. By creating a low-cost environment, coal buyers ensured the emergence of a sellers' cartel that eventually forced up world coal prices to the detriment of consumers. Originality/value - No previous study has attempted a study of a major international commodity trade over such an extensive timeframe. It is likely that similar attempts to manipulate supply and price in other commodity trades will, over time, result in similar outcomes.

40|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, ships {{could be built}} {{wherever}} a limited range of wood types (primarily oak) was available on the coast. The larger ships of later centuries, however, ideally required the wood of several different types of trees. The hulls were built of oak; the crooked oak wood used in constructing the bent frames of the hulls was increasingly obtainable from the copses that grew near the large cities and on the rivers of Central Europe. Due to its much lower volumetric weight, coniferous wood was much better suited for masts. This wood can be more easily transported by floating, and ships built in part with coniferous wood are lighter and easier to maneuver. Coniferous wood was not uniformly available to the shipyards in the various port cities of Central Europe. Pine, spruce and fir trees in Southern Germany provided the softwood that was floated {{to the mouth of}} the Rhine. Shipbuilders on the mouth of the Elbe imported it from Bohemia and the pine forests of Eastern Central Europe. It was also possible to transport the wood of pines and spruces on the rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea further east. ln the Baltic Provinces, Finland and Scandinavia, spruce and pine wood grew quite near the coast. On the other hand, little or no coniferous wood could be floated down the rivers Ems and Weser. Scotland was the only area of the British lsles with a natural supply of pine wood. The discrepancies in the availability of wood were most apparent during the High and Late Middle Ages, a period when the volume of wood trade by sea was still limited. At that time, the shipyards of the Netherlands were thus clearly at an advantage with regard to wood supply. ln later times the differences in wood availability on the coast were compensated by <b>seaborne</b> wood <b>trade.</b> " (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|Lead {{is often}} {{relegated to a}} {{footnote}} or sidebar {{in the study of}} ancient metals. However, the hundreds of lead ingots discovered in underwater sites over the past half-century have attested to the widespread production and trade of this utilitarian metal. Shipwreck sites allow independent dating evidence not available for many land find. They also provide information about shipment size as well as accompanying cargo which can offer clues about trade patterns and markets for lead in the ancient world. While lead was not particularly rare nor valuable, it represents small- to moderate-scale trade that bridges the gap between luxury trade and the circulation of staple agricultural products. It thus {{can be viewed as a}} proxy for the many other perishable materials that supported daily life, such as timber, cloth, cordage, leather and pigments. Due to the abundance of lead ingot finds, published in many different languages with great variation in the details provided, it is difficult to compare all of this material. This thesis, therefore, compiles and presents data on all published lead ingots from Mediterranean and Atlantic shipwrecks through the fourth century C. E., in order to provide a framework to analyze the ancient <b>seaborne</b> lead <b>trade.</b> Sixty-eight sites containing lead ingots, lead ore or lead minerals are included in the analysis, divided into six time periods: Bronze Age, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman Republic and Roman Empire. A typology of ingots has been developed to allow for comparison of ingots between wrecks. The uses of lead are reviewed, organized by type of use: domestic, professional, military and infrastructural. This allows insight into both the consumers in need of lead and the volume and regularity of consumption required for each use. An overview of lead production and its economic limitations further informs the discussion of the lead trade. The final analysis considers all of these factors in creating a picture of lead trade for each of the six periods, focusing on the regions of supply, the types of demand, and the dominant forces that drove the mining and production of lead...|$|R

Sources are reviewed and discussed at some length, not just because they form the foundation of what one knows about Viking raids in the Dordogne, but also because sources or lack of them reveal the degree of franco-centricity during the Carolingian era relative to an area largely autonomous from Frankish dominance. What has been written and said about Viking activity in Périgord is in contrast with actual, extant source records. But the paucity of source material may have other causes than lack of event. When contextualizing Viking raids in the Dordogne, there are causes that not only help explain the reasons for them, but also why the source record is so meagre. Some causes have to do with natural, cultural and especially political conditions in the region at the time that made raiding attractive to the Vikings pull causes; other causes deal with conditions that made it natural for Vikings to engage in this kind of activity in the 9 th century with consequences for the Dordogne push causes. Viking raids can be seen in a wide context of long-distance trading patterns, and of attempts to control the <b>seaborne</b> networks of <b>trade</b> and raid, and perhaps even in the context of dynastic claims and kingdom formations in Viking homelands. It is only when one sees the wider context of the raids and their causes that one can reconstruct and understand the extent, and the contents, of Viking raiding on the Dordogne river system. The thesis concludes that it is more than likely that Vikings were a regular presence on the Dordogne river system, at least from the 840 s until the 860 s, and that material gains were used to further certain chiefs interests in controlling a north Atlantic seaborne network, which was linked to Ireland but which also may have had dynastic implications in Scandinavia...|$|R
