50|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances, the genetically determined circuitry in {{the brain}} remains largely stable throughout life. It was thought, until about 30 years ago, that no new neural circuits could be formed in the adult mammalian brain. Recently, functional MRI studies in amputees have shown that almost all patients have experienced motor cortical remapping. The majority of motor reorganization has occurred as a downward shift of the hand area of the cortex onto the area of face representation, especially the lips. Sometimes there is a <b>side</b> <b>shift</b> of the hand motor cortex to the ipsilateral cortex. In patients with phantom limb pain, the reorganization was great enough to cause a change in cortical lip representation into the hand areas only during lip movements. It has also been found {{that there is a}} high correlation between the magnitude of phantom limb pain {{and the extent to which}} the shift of the cortical representation of the mouth into the hand area in motor and somatosensory cortical reorganization has occurred. Additionally, as phantom pains in upper extremity amputees increased, there was a higher degree of medial shift of the facial motor representation. There are multiple theories that try to explain how cortical remapping occurs in amputees, but none have been supported to a great extent.|$|E
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of digital {{photography}} and considering that it would substitute le film in a short time, Silvestri began to study a camera able to face the double need of working with film {{but at the same}} time can be converted back to digital applications. There were two possible solutions, the scan backs or the matrix ones. The choice selected the matrix backs, creating a compact, easy to carry, proportioned to the small size of the high resolution sensors. Two series of Rodenstock and Schneider lenses, from the 23 mm to the long focal ones, specifically designed for high resolution digital photography are its range of lenses. The Bicam introduced in the late nineties was added with new accessories and components so to follow the continuous evolution of the sensors’ technology. Its main characteristics are the possibility to work with lenses mounted in helical focusing mount and bayonet, or with a bellows system which add to the camera all the necessary correction movements typical of view cameras; <b>side</b> <b>shift,</b> rise and fall, tilt and swing; all movements are extremely precise and micrometric.The reversible and interchangeable backs have a large range of accessories, from the sliding adapters with viewing screen and drop-in plates to interface the most popular digital backs: Hasselblad V, Hasselblad H, Mamiya 645, Contax 645, Rollei AFI.|$|E

The accuracy of a computerized pantograph {{has not been}} confirmed in laboratory or clinical studies. Specific aims. The purpose of this in vitro study is to test the accuracy of a computerized pantograph to record predetermined condylar settings on a fully adjustable articulator for condylar inclination with flat versus 3 / 8 " inserts, top wall, rear wall, progressive <b>side</b> <b>shift,</b> and immediate <b>side</b> <b>shift.</b> Materials and methods. Computerized pantographic sensors were mounted on a fully adjustable articulator with an arbitrary determination of the hinge axis. Tracings were made on the articulator with known condylar settings for condylar inclination with flat and 3 / 8 " curved inserts, immediate <b>side</b> <b>shift,</b> progressive <b>side</b> <b>shift,</b> top wall and rear wall. Means, standard deviations, P-values, equivalence testing and Bonferonni adjustments were determined for each condylar setting. Results. The computerized pantograph accurately recorded the immediate <b>side</b> <b>shift</b> at 0, 1. 2 mm and 2. 0 mm (P<. 0001). Condylar inclination with the 3 / 8 " curved insert at 10 and 25 degrees was accurately determined at the 10 mm condylotrack distance (P<. 0001).

40|$|The <b>Side</b> <b>Shift</b> {{approach}} to correction of scoliosis curves {{has been used}} by therapist at the RNOHT for over 30 years. The <b>Side</b> <b>Shift</b> approach was developed by Mrs Min Mehta, and has been Modified using consensus based evi-dence of SOSORT. Clinical observations had indicated that not all patients could actively (Auto) correct to beyond the trunk midline, a key principle of <b>Side</b> <b>Shift.</b> At the RNOHT a classification system based upon the ability of an individual to auto-correct the spine during a <b>Side</b> <b>Shift</b> movement has been developed to aid the appropriate application of the shift exercises and allow future comparative analysis. Aim To develop a Clinical Classification System for the Phy-sical Therapy treatment of scoliosis, which is reliable, valid and universally accepted. Methods 58 Consecutive patients who have AIS were tested, by two clinicians (a Physiotherapist and a Orthotist), in 2013. The clinicians were blinded to the classification of each other. The results were tested for reliability. Three types of Side-Shift were developed. Type 1 : flexible, Type 2 :stiff, and type 3 :rigid.

Purpose: This {{study was designed}} to determine the repeatability of a digital condylogram to generate condylar recordings on patients at two separate time periods. Materials and Methods: A digital condylogram was used on 16 patients to record condylar movements at two separate time periods approximately 1 month apart. Data manager software was used to calculate recommended settings of a Denar D 5 A fully adjustable articulator for each trial. The differences between the calculated angles of trials 1 and 2 for each patient were determined and analyzed. Results: Immediate <b>side</b> <b>shift</b> (ISS) and progressive <b>side</b> <b>shift</b> (PSS) demonstrated significant differences on average between trial 1 and 2. Variation between the trials was large, particularly for rear wall and top wall angles.

Conclusion: The digital condylogram records sagittal condylar inclination, rear wall and top wall angles predictably over time; however, ISS and PSS were not recorded predictably. Results demonstrated significant variation that may be due to the patients' abilities to reproduce jaw movements precisely or that may be due to the operator's ability to connect the condylogram predictably...|$|E

40|$|Multifractal {{time series}} {{analysis}} is a approach that shows the possible complexity of the system. Nowadays, {{one of the most}} popular and the best methods for determining multifractal characteristics is Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA). However, it has some drawback. One of its core elements is detrending of the series. In the classical MFDFA a trend is estimated by fitting a polynomial of degree m where m=const. We propose that the degree m of a polynomial was not constant (m≠ const) and its selection was ruled by an established criterion. Taking into account the above amendment, we examine the multifractal spectra both for artificial and real-world mono- and the multifractal time series. Unlike classical MFDFA method, obtained singularity spectra almost perfectly reflects the theoretical results and for real time series we observe a significant right <b>side</b> <b>shift</b> of the spectrum.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} semigroups of transformations of cellular automata which act on a fixed shift space. In particular, {{we are interested in}} two properties of these semigroups which relate to "largeness". The first property is ID and the other property is maximal commutativity (MC). A semigroup has the ID property if the only infinite invariant closed set (with respect to the semigroup action) is the entire space. We shall consider two examples of semigroups: one is spanned by cellular automata transformations that represent multiplications by integers on the one-dimensional torus and the other one consists of all the cellular automata transformations which are linear (when the symbols set is the ring of integers mod n). It will be shown that the two properties of these semigroups depend on the number of symbols s. The multiplication semigroup is ID and MC if and only if s is not a power of prime. The linear semigroup over the mentioned ring is always MC but is ID if and only if s is prime. When the symbol set is endowed with a finite field structure (when possible) the linear semigroup is both ID and MC. In addition, we associate with each semigroup which acts on a one <b>sided</b> <b>shift</b> space a semigroup acting on a two <b>sided</b> <b>shift</b> space, and vice versa, {{in such a way that}} preserves the ID and the MC properties.
