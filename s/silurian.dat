5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} <b>Silurian</b> underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the <b>Silurian</b> doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is not human, the leader of the <b>Silurian</b> warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a <b>Silurian</b> court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities.|$|E

Lapworth's work in this area, especially his examination of the complex stratigraphy of the <b>Silurian</b> rocks by comparing fossil graptolites, was crucial in to the early understanding of these epochs.|$|E

5|$|Sir Roderick Murchison (1792–1871) {{was born}} in Ross and Cromarty and served under Wellesley in the Peninsular War.

50|$|Doctor Who and the <b>Silurians</b> is {{the second}} serial of the seventh season in the British science fiction {{television}} series Doctor Who. It was first broadcast in seven weekly parts from 31 January to 14 March 1970. The story is the first appearance of the <b>Silurians.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Silurians</b> {{revive the}} Sea Devil warriors of Elite Group One and their {{brilliant}} commander, Sauvix. The <b>Silurians</b> and Sea Devils launch {{an attack on}} the base and the Doctor, recognising their ship on the monitor screen, tries to warn Vorshak not to fire on them. Vorshak ignores him, and, as a result, the Base’s defences are neutralised by the Silurians' deflection beam. The <b>Silurians</b> then dispatch the Myrka, a large marine monster, who attacks Airlock 1, and the Sea Devils, who assault Airlock 5 of the sea base.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling {{deep into the}} earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes {{to open in the}} earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one <b>Silurian,</b> Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the <b>Silurian</b> civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Silurians</b> {{also make}} a number of {{appearance}} in comic books. Comic book story [...] "Twilight of the Silurians" [...] (1980) is set during the species' last days pre-hibernation, where <b>Silurians</b> observe captive [...] "ape-men" [...] in their zoological research station, millions of years ago. The comic book [...] "City of Devils" [...] (1983) features two Doctor Who companions, journalist Sarah Jane Smith and robot dog K-9 uncover a hidden city of <b>Silurians</b> (here, 'Eocenes') in an Egyptian archaeological dig, who seek peaceful coexistence with humans; this comic strip {{is based on the}} premise of the television spin-off special K9 and Company. In the story arc [...] "Final Genesis" [...] (1993), an alternate universe is depicted wherein <b>Silurians</b> made peace with humanity and the two races live in harmony; UNIT is renamed URIC, the 'United Races Intelligence Command'. In the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip cycle [...] "The Cybermen" [...] (1994-1996), the cyborg race of Cybermen discover <b>Silurians</b> and Sea Devils living on their own planet Mondas during an unspecified time in the past; in Doctor Who, Mondas is Earth's former [...] "twin planet". The strip also portrays Golgoth, a primordial humanoid reptile god-figure, who resembles a Sea Devil and may have some link to the <b>Silurians.</b> Madame Vastra co-stars in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip [...] "The Crystal Throne" [...] (2014).|$|R
5|$|The slate {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: Cambrian, Ordovician and <b>Silurian.</b> The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on Anglesey. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The <b>Silurian</b> deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) have taken the TARDIS deep below the ground to the <b>Silurian</b> city where the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), a local man named Mo (Alun Raglan), and Mo's son, Elliot (Samuel Davies), are being held hostage. Meanwhile, above ground, Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill); Mo's wife, Ambrose (Nia Roberts); and Ambrose's father, Tony (Robert Pugh), keep watch over Alaya (Neve McIntosh), a captured <b>Silurian</b> who {{is the key to}} freeing the hostages. While the Doctor leaves Amy and Nasreen to negotiate sharing the planet with the Silurians, to help Mo find his son Eliot, it is revealed that Restac's sister Alaya has been killed by Ambrose on the surface.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick (who first proposed {{the name of}} the Cambrian period), independently used their studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and <b>Silurian,</b> were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area based on Murchison's and Sedgwick's work.|$|E

50|$|Preston urges the Doctor {{to use the}} gas {{on all of the}} <b>Silurians</b> and Sea Devils. The Doctor adamantly refuses and accuses Preston of advocating genocide. The Doctor {{changes his}} mind when Turlough reminds him of what the <b>Silurians</b> intend to do if they launch the missiles. When he is unable to find {{anything}} else less lethal, he begins to connect the gas containers to a central air pump. The Doctor is discovered by Sauvix before he can turn the pump on. Preston grabs a gun, but is killed by Sauvix before he is sprayed with gas and killed by Bulic. As the <b>Silurians</b> prepare to fire the missiles, the Doctor feeds the gas into the ventilation system. Bulic stays in the chemical store to ensure that the gas keeps flowing, while the Doctor and his companions leave for the bridge to try to stop the <b>Silurians.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mountains in Juniata County include Tuscarora Mountain and Shade Mountain. Agricultural {{land and}} forested land make {{up most of}} the county's area. Major rivers and creeks in the county include the Susquehanna River, the Juniata River, Tuscarora Creek, and West Branch Mahantango Creek. It borders seven other counties. The county lies over 16 {{different}} rock formations (which are from the Ordovician, <b>Silurian,</b> and Devonian) and 51 different soils.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous {{limestone}} uplands in Britain. They are composed of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and <b>Silurian</b> volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for building stone and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. Sand, gravel and peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} of <b>Silurian</b> age (443–419 million years ago), the most southerly known outcrop of rocks {{of this age}} in Britain. They make up a {{sequence}} of lavas, tuffs (volcanic ash), shales and mudstones in a narrow outcrop to the northeast of Shepton Mallet, in the eastern Mendip Hills.|$|E

5|$|Written by David A. McIntee, {{this was}} a four-part Lovecraftian horror story set in Arkham, New England in 1927, {{although}} McIntee later began a rewrite to shift the action to Cornwall.
