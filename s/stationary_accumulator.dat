Both the principle and technology of the primary components used in an electromechanical accumulator will be presented herein. A number of well-known examples of systems will be shown in order to derive a summary state-of-the-art. We will then proceed by providing the example of a prototype developed at the SATIE Laboratory in the aim of designing a <b>stationary</b> <b>accumulator</b> for a domestic application requiring power on the order of one kilowatt...|$|E
