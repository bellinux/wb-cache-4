5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E

He came across a village where he found a flowing stream of water. To inform Azam Shah, he sent his messenger, Iradat Khan, to him with the message. When he returned, he {{informed}} Bidar Bakht {{that he had seen}} Bahadur Shah's advance tents. Khan Alam Dakhvini and Munavvar Khan, who were in charge of the central wing of the troops, were dispatched to attack the tents. Azim-ush-Shan's 500 elephants failed to mount a resistance against the invading forces. The attackers looted the tents and then <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth {{approaching}} from the southeast, {{it was too}} late for Leissègues to escape. Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, {{who was in}} Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E

Peter of Castile complained afterwards to King Peter IV of Aragon, but as he did not obtain the desired results, he declared war on the Crown of Aragon. While both crowns promptly engaged in a bloody frontier war by land, in mid-1358 the naval campaign began with the landing of a Castilian army at the Valencian town of Guardamar. Led by Peter I, they quickly occupied the town. Its castle, however, held out for longer, and when a storm drove most of the Castilian fleet ashore, including six hired Genoese galleys, Peter I had to <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire and return to Castile through Murcia, defeated.|$|E
25|$|Kenya {{recorded}} an easy nine-wicket {{win over}} Gibraltar. The Europeans were dismissed for just 80 (RCR Patel 3-13) and their opponents rushed {{to victory in}} 14.2 overs, with Rehmann making 53 not out. In a low-scoring match, Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by four wickets. The young Dermot Reeve made 38 for Hong Kong and took 2-26, but the Papuans overhauled their target of 100 with 34.4 overs in hand. Elsewhere, Zimbabwe crushed the USA by 191 runs, thanks to a second-wicket partnership of 214 between David Houghton (135) and Kevin Curran (126 not out) that <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> their way to 332/4. The Americans were never remotely in the hunt, and 4-34 from Peter Rawson restricted their total to just 141.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in {{classical}} Antiquity, the warships of the 6th century did not feature rams; naval combat was therefore dominated by missile exchanges and boarding actions. In {{this form of}} combat, experience {{and the ability to}} maintain a formation of ships was essential, and the Byzantine crews held the advantage over the inexperienced Goths. Soon, in the heat of battle, some Gothic ships drifted off the main body and were easily destroyed, while others sailed too close together and were unable to maneuver. In the end, the weary Gothic fleet disintegrated and their ships fled as best as they could. They lost 36 ships, and Gibal was captured, while Indulf with the remainder fled towards Ancona. As soon as he came close to the Gothic army's camp, he beached his ships and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire.|$|E

25|$|In February 1950, Sukumar Sen, the Chief Secretary of West Bengal had {{travelled}} to Dhaka to {{hold the}} Chief Secretary level dialogue with his East Bengal counterpart Aziz Ahmed. On 10 February, at around 10 A.M. in the morning, when the talks were in progress, a Muslim woman in blood-stained clothes was paraded in the Secretariat building. It was rumoured {{that she had been}} raped in Kolkata. The Secretariat employees immediately struck work and started a procession shouting anti-Hindu slogans. As they progressed towards Nawabpur, many others joined the procession, which ended at the Victoria Park. At 12 noon, a rally was held at the park where the speakers, some of them employees of the Secretariat, made fierce anti-Hindu speeches. At around 1 P.M., as soon as the rally broke, the crowd began to loot Hindu shops and houses and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> fire. The Hindus were killed wherever they were found. By the evening, 90% Hindu shops of Dhaka were looted and many of them burnt. The Hindu jewellery shops were looted in the presence of police officers. An estimated 50,000 Hindus were displaced in seven hours of murder loot and arson. According to the PTI reports, the worst affected areas were Banagram and Makims Lane. Most of the houses in the two predominantly Hindu localities were completely looted, many completely burnt down and places of worship desecrated. Tajuddin Ahmed, who travelled in the different parts of Dhaka between 1 pm to 6 pm acknowledged the destruction and loss inflicted upon the Hindus by the Muslims in the localities of Nawabpur, Sadarghat, Patuatuli, Islampur, Digbazar, English Road, Bangshal and Chowk Bazaar. On the afternoon of 12 February, 60 India-bound Hindu passengers were attacked at the Kurmitola airport. All the non-Muslim passengers arriving at the Tejgaon airport were stabbed. Three days after the massacre started in Dhaka, the villages of Vikrampur and Lohajang were attacked. On 15 February, Simulia market was set on fire and the Hindu shops were looted. Between 15 February and 1 March, there were 15 instances of stabbing on Hindus reported from Dighali and Lohajang. On 28 February, the Dighali market was burnt down, the Hindu shops were gutted. In Parulla village under Kaliganj police station, all the Hindu houses were looted. All the Hindu houses in the villages of Khsawala, Gazaria, Karar Char, Char Sindur, Palas and Sadhar Char were looted. According to Indian government sources, the bodies of 200 Hindu victims were cremated in the first two days of violence. They also claimed that 50,000 out of Dhaka's 80,000 Hindus had to flee their homes during the attacks. On 24 February 1950, the U.S. ambassador to India wrote to the U.S. Secretary of State that between 600 and 1,000 Hindus were killed and thousands injured in Dhaka area.|$|E
