25|$|Initially, {{the main}} {{function}} of FPS was protection, {{as an integral}} part of building operations. For the most part, the force held fixed posts and performed duties that would be considered <b>safety</b> <b>functions</b> today, such as: eliminating fire and safety hazards, patrolling buildings, detecting fires, and providing the first line of defense in fighting fires; and answering visitor questions, assisting citizens, rendering first aid, and directing traffic when necessary. By 1960, the mission of FPS became the first line of defense against bomb threats, bombings, vandalism, mass demonstrations, and violence against Federal buildings.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the next}} {{regularly}} scheduled Metrolink board meeting after the accident, the board {{decided not to}} wait for PTC {{to be ready for}} deployment before making system safety improvements; instead Metrolink will expand the existing automated train stop system used on [...] of Metrolink track in Orange County across its [...] system. Metrolink's automated train stop system will automatically apply the brakes to stop a train if the engineer fails to respond to a warning within eight seconds. It was originally installed in the 1950s by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to allow trains to operate at speeds of over 79mph under regulations imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a former federal regulatory body whose <b>safety</b> <b>functions</b> have since been assumed by the Federal Railroad Administration. Metrolink also added a second engineer to some trains to improve safety in 2008.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} the STL and SIL concepts complement each other. Both factors are {{attributes of the}} same <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> The STL level {{is determined by the}} average PFS value of the <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> The SIL level is determined by the average probability of failure on demand. PFD value of the <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> The STL level expresses the probability of spurious trips by the <b>safety</b> <b>function,</b> i.e., the <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> is executed without a demand from the process. The SIL level expresses the probability that the <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> does not work upon demand from the process. Both parameters are important to end-users in order to achieve safety and asset protection.|$|R
50|$|The STL level {{achieved}} by a <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> {{is determined by}} the probability of fail safe (PFS) of this <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> The PFS value is determined by internal failures of the safety system that cause the <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> to be executed without a demand from the process.

The network has been emulated by at least six other cities in Tennessee and studied by other cities in the US and even internationally. Jay Weatherill, South Australia's Premier, visited Chattanooga in January 2012 and [...] "looked at the current gigabit network that was supporting critical city <b>safety</b> <b>functions</b> such as police and fire communications infrastructure, equipment and applications.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> for {{prevention}} of vehicle control loss.

Based on sensor information about the host vehicle's state and the road ahead, a threat assessment algorithm predicts the future evolution of the vehicle's state. If the vehicle motion, predicted over a finite time horizon violates safety constraints, autonomous deceleration is activated in order to prevent vehicle loss of control. The <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> has been implemented in real-time.

40|$|This paper clarifies the {{possible}} {{existence of a}} <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> in control laws under the authorization by the international standard IEC 61508 for the first time. The <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> consists of a dependability function to maintain stability and admissible control performance even if {{the system is not}} operating normally and a safety capability to suppress fluctuations of transient responses after a device failure in order to prevent the deviations to the fullest extent possible. The <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> can prevent events where physical parameter values in a control system deviate from the normal operating range to the fullest extent possible. Then, it can decrease the frequency of demand occurrences on ordinary externally-implemented safety-related systems and supplement them in risk reduction required by IEC 61508. In addition, this paper presents a quantitative assessment framework for the contribution of the <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> to risk reduction using Markov analysis and switching L 2 gain...|$|R
50|$|The {{spurious}} trip level represents asset loss due to {{an internal}} failure of the <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> The more financial damage the <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> can cause due to a spurious trip the higher the STL level of the <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> should be. Each company needs to decide for themselves which level of financial loss they can or are willing to take. This actually depends on many different factors including the financial strength of the company, the insurance policy they have, the cost of process shutdown and startup, and so on. All these factors are unique to each company. The table below shows {{an example of how}} a company can calibrate its spurious trip levels.|$|R
